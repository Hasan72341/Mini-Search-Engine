His stated reason for the override was an excess of funds devoted to mass transit projects and funds for over 100 local transportation infrastructure projects included in the bill. His veto was overriden by a vote of 67-33, the smallest possible margin of victory for a veto override, which requires a 2/3rds vote.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are three DivX codecs: the original MPEG-4 Part 2 DivX codec, the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DivX Plus HD codec and the High Efficiency Video Coding DivX HEVC Ultra HD codec. The most recent version of the codec itself is version 6.9.2, which is several years old. New version numbers on the packages now reflect updates to the media player, converter, etc.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe \"DivX\" brand is distinct from \"DIVX\", which is an obsolete video rental system. The winking emoticon in the early \"DivX\u00a0;-)\" codec name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the DIVX system. Although not created by them, the DivX company adopted the name of the popular DivX\u00a0;-) codec. The company dropped the smiley and released DivX 4.0, which was actually the first DivX version to trademark the term \"DivX\".\nDivX\u00a0;-) (not DivX) 3.11 Alpha and later 3.xx versions refers to a hacked version of the Microsoft \"MPEG-4 Version 3\" video codec (not to be confused with MPEG-4 Part 3) from Windows Media Tools 4 codecs. The video codec, which was actually not MPEG-4 compliant, was extracted around 1998 by French hacker Jerome Rota (also known as Gej) at Montpellier. The Microsoft codec originally required that the compressed output be put in an ASF file. It was altered to allow other containers such as Audio Video Interleave (AVI). Rota hacked the Microsoft codec because newer versions of the Windows Media Player would not play his video portfolio and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that were encoded with it. Instead of re-encoding his portfolio, Rota and German hacker Max Morice decided to reverse engineer the codec, which \"took about a week\".\nIn early 2000, Jordan Greenhall recruited Rota to form a company (originally called DivXNetworks, Inc., renamed to DivX, Inc. in 2005) to develop an MPEG-4 codec, from scratch, that would still be backward-compatible with the Microsoft MPEG-4 Version 3 format. This effort resulted first in the release of the \"OpenDivX\" codec and source code on 15 January 2001. OpenDivX was hosted as an open-source project on the Project Mayo web site hosted at projectmayo.com (the name comes from \"mayonnaise\", because, according to Rota, DivX and mayonnaise are both \"French and very hard to make.\"). The company's internal developers and some external developers worked jointly on OpenDivX for the next several months, but the project eventually stagnated.\nIn early 2001, DivX employee \"Sparky\" wrote a new and improved version of the codec's encoding algorithm known as \"encore2\". This code was included in the OpenDivX public source repository for a brief time, but then was abruptly removed. The explanation from DivX at the time was that \"the community really wants a Winamp, not a Linux.\" It was at this point that the project forked. That summer, Rota left the French Riviera and moved to San Diego \"with nothing but a pack of cigarettes\" where he and Greenhall founded what would eventually become DivX, Inc.\nDivX took the encore2 code and developed it into DivX 4.0, initially released in July 2001. Other developers who had participated in OpenDivX took encore2 and started a new project\u2014Xvid\u2014that started with the same encoding core. DivX, Inc. has since continued to develop the DivX codec, releasing DivX 5.0 in March 2002. By the release of version 5.2.1 on 8 September 2004, the DivX codec was substantially feature-complete. Changes since then have tended to focus on speed, and encouraging wider hardware player support, while the company has also focused its time on the formats and next generation codecs.\nIn February 2011, DivX was acquired by Rovi Corporation, upon completion of its acquisition of Sonic Solutions. In 2014, Blackstone Group and Parallax Capital acquired DivX from Rovi for $75 million. On January 5, 2015, it was announced that IPTV company NeuLion would acquire DivX for $62.5 million. In February 2018, a deal was finalized to sell certain DivX assets, intellectual property and subsidiaries from NeuLion, Inc. to Fortress Investment Group.\nDivX, LLC continues to operate from their headquarters in San Diego and release new versions of DivX Software for Windows and macOS.\nDivX formats.\nDivX Media Format (DMF).\nDivX 6 expanded the scope of DivX from including just a codec and a player by adding an optional media container format called \"DivX Media Format\" (\"DMF\") (with a .divx extension) that includes support for the following DVD-Video and VOB container like features. This media container format is used for the MPEG-4 Part 2 codec.\nThis new DivX Media Format also came with a \"DivX Ultra Certified\" profile, and all \"Ultra\" certified players must support all DivX Media Format features. While video encoded with the DivX codec is an MPEG-4 video stream, the DivX Media Format is analogous to media container formats such as Apple's QuickTime. In much the same way that media formats such as DVD specify MPEG-2 video as a part of their specification, the DivX Media Format specifies MPEG-4-compatible video as a part of its specification. However, despite the use of the \".divx\" extension, this format is an extension to the AVI file format. The methods of including multiple audio and even subtitle tracks involve storing the data in RIFF headers and other such AVI hacks which have been known for quite a while, such that even VirtualDubMod supports them. DivX, Inc. did this on purpose to keep at least partial backward compatibility with AVI, so that players that do not support the new features available to the .divx container format (like interactive menus, chapter points and XSUB subtitles) can at least play that primary video stream (usually the main movie if the DMF file contains multiple video streams like special features like bonus materials). Of course, the DivX codec and tools like Dr. DivX still support the traditional method of creating standard AVI files.\nSince version 5.0 of DivX, the FourCC (identifying code) for the DivX MPEG-4 Part 2 codec is DX50. Previously it used DIVX.\nDivX Plus HD.\nDivX Plus HD is a marketing name for a file type using the standard Matroska media container format (.mkv), rather than the proprietary DivX Media Format. DivX Plus HD files contain an H.264 video bitstream, AAC surround sound audio, and a number of XML-based attachments defining chapters, subtitles and meta data. This media container format is used for the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec.\nDivX profiles.\nDivX has defined profiles which are subsets of MPEG-4/AVI and H.264/Matroska standards. Because the grouping is a specific subset of what is in the standards, there are certification processes for each of the profiles that device manufacturers must follow. All DivX certified devices bearing a DivX logo will adhere to one of the profiles outlined in the table below as would any tools that support the DivX profiles.\nDivX Video on Demand.\nDivX Video on Demand (DivX VOD) is DivX's version of digital rights management (DRM), which allows content copyright holders to control distribution. In 2009, DivX, Inc. received format approval from major Hollywood studios including Sony, Paramount, and Lionsgate, which has allowed content retailers to sell protected videos that will play on current and previous generations of DivX certified devices. The terms of the contract are not known, so it is unknown if that approval is still in effect.\nCommunity software.\n\"Dr. DivX OSS\" is capable of transcoding many video formats to DivX-encoded video. The original closed-source Dr. DivX terminated at version 1.06 for DivX 5.21. That was the last version of DivX capable of running on Windows 9x. An open-source version has since been made, which supports DivX 6. \"Dr. DivX\" offers greatly expanded features over the free DivX Converter application, that was bundled with the codec from version 6 onwards. Dr. DivX is not compatible with DivX Plus HD.\nDivX has released a command line interface (CLI) for the codice_1 encoder used in the DivX Converter as beta, free for non-commercial use. To complement the CLI codice_1 encoder released on DivX Labs, DivX has also released a DivX AAC encoder CLI as a Windows beta binary. Finally, codice_3 has been released as a free Windows CLI through DivX Labs with documentation on the DivX Developer Portal; DivX describes the release as a reference mux to demonstrate DivX Plus MKV extensions like World Fonts and Smooth FF/RW.\nHardware support.\nDivX, Inc. markets a certification program to consumer electronics and IC manufacturers for the purpose of guaranteed compatibility and playback of video files that fall within DivX profiles. Devices that have been DivX certified usually brandish one of the following marks:\nDivX certified devices have included DVD players, car stereos, mobile phones, televisions, Blu-ray players, and even alarm clocks.\nAside from verifying proper decoding of files conforming to the DivX profiles the certification also confirms the device can play back DivX Video on Demand content, which includes Hollywood content that can be purchased from Internet retailers.\nGaming system compatibility.\nOn 4 December 2007, native MPEG-4 ASP playback support was added to the Xbox 360, allowing it to play video encoded with DivX and other MPEG-4 ASP codecs.\nOn 17 December 2007, firmware upgrade 2.10 was released for the Sony PlayStation 3, which included official DivX Certification. Firmware version 2.50 (released on 15 October 2008) included support for the DivX Video on Demand (DivX VOD) service, and firmware version 2.60 (released on 20 January 2009) included official DivX Certification and updated Profile support to version 3.11.\nWith introduction of DivX to Go in the DivX Player for Windows, a PlayStation 3 icon is readily available on the interface, which will invoke a transfer wizard for freely converting and copying video files via USB or optical disc. The output from DivX to Go's PlayStation 3 preset is also playable on the Xbox 360.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the age of 15, Williams suffered from rheumatic fever and was advised to avoid strenuous physical activities. However, as his high school required participation in athletic competitions, he started training in sprint in 1924 and by 1927 became a local champion.\nOlympic competition.\nAt the 1928 Olympic trials, Williams won the 100 and 200 metres races, equaling the Olympic 100 metres record of 10.6 seconds.\nTo earn his travel ticket for the trials, Williams and his volunteer coach, Bob Granger, worked as waiters and dishwashers in a railroad dining car, and Vancouver track fans raised the money to pay Granger's transatlantic ship passage to the 1928 Olympics.\nIn the second round of the 100 metres at Amsterdam, Williams again equaled the Olympic record with a time of 10.6 seconds and did the same in his semi-final, but placed second to Bob McAllister. The final opened with two false starts, first by Wilfred Legg and then one by Frank Wykoff. Williams took the lead off the start and never relinquished it, winning the gold over Jack London with Georg Lammers third. Williams then won the 200 metres two days later, coming from behind to overtake Helmut K\u00f6rnig, who had led out of the bend. It was Williams' eighth race in four days and he was the first non-American to complete the sprint double. Williams was also part of the Canadian team which was disqualified in the final of the 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay contest.\nWilliams's victories were front-page news in Canada and he returned a national hero, feted by enormous crowds across the country. An estimated 25,000 people turned out to welcome him at the Canadian Pacific Railway station at the foot of Granville Street in Vancouver. Williams was met off the train by Mayor L.\u00a0D. Taylor and Premier Simon Fraser Tolmie. They bundled him and Granger into cars and paraded them through the confetti-filled city. The event was broadcast live by reporters with microphones stationed along the route.\nWilliams showed that his success was not an accident, setting a World Record at the Canadian Track and Field Championships at Varsity Stadium in Toronto in 1930. He then won the 100 yard dash at the inaugural British Empire Games (now known as the Commonwealth Games) in Hamilton, Ontario, but tore the tendons in his upper left leg around the 70 yard mark and never made a full comeback. At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 metre event. With the Canadian team he finished fourth in the 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay competition. Subsequently, Williams stopped running and became an insurance agent.\nLater life and death.\nIn August 1940, Williams joined the Non-Permanent Active Militia, his occupation listed as \"Salesman\" and religion as \"C of E\" (Church of England). He also served as a civilian pilot during World War\u00a0II, ferrying aircraft around the country for Canadian Airways, then became a civilian flight instructor with the Royal Canadian Air Force.\nIn 1971, after his former mentor's death, Williams was asked how much credit was due to Granger for his Olympic success. \"Offhand, I'd say 100 percent,\" Williams answered.\nIn the mid-1960s, he donated his two gold medals from the 1928 Olympics to the BC Sports Hall of Fame, saying he wanted them to be seen and remembered. In 1980, they were stolen never to be found again; gold prices at the time were at historic highs and it was suspected the medals had been melted down. It was said at that time Williams simply shrugged off the loss and no replacements were ever issued. In 2023 the stolen medals were replaced by newly minted replicas, recreated by the International Olympic Committee at the request of Williams family, who then rededicated them to B.C. Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn later years, Williams grew bitter about his sporting experiences, culminating in being the only living Canadian Olympic gold medalist who refused the federal government's invitation to attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.\nIn 1979, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\nWilliams, who never married, lived with his mother, Dot, until her death in 1980, at the age of 92. After that, he lived on alone and suffered from terrible arthritic pain.\nA keen collector of guns, Williams shot himself in the head with a shotgun he had been awarded in 1928 as a prize for his Olympic feat. His suicide was a major surprise to everyone and no note was left. He was interred at Masonic Cemetery of British Columbia, Burnaby, Canada.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 1950, Williams was proclaimed by a Canadian press poll as Canada's greatest track athlete of the first half of the century, which was later updated in 1972 to declare him Canada's all-time greatest Olympic athlete.\nPercy Williams Junior Public School located in Toronto, Ontario, is named after Williams.\nIn 1996, Canada Post released a postage stamp of Percy Williams as part of its \"Sporting Heroes\" series.\nOutside the BC Sports Hall of Fame at BC Place is a life-sized statue of Williams, crouched in a sprinter's stance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A bullet jacket usually allows higher muzzle velocities than a lead alloy cast bullet without depositing significant amounts of metal in the bore. It also prevents damage to bores from hard steel or armor-piercing core materials.\nHistory.\nDespite a widespread belief that the full metal jacket bullet was invented ca. 1882 by Swiss Colonel Eduard Rubin while he was working for the Swiss Federal Ammunition Factory and Research Center, in fact it was known already in the 1880s that the actual inventor was Prussian Major (later Lt.-Col.) Julius Emil Bode (1835\u20131885), who came up with the idea in either 1875 or 1876.\nThe use of full metal jacketing in military ammunition came about in part because of the need for improved feeding characteristics in small arms that used internal mechanical manipulation of the cartridge in order to chamber rounds, as opposed to externally hand-reloading single-shot firearms. The harder metal used in bullet jackets was less prone to deformation than softer, exposed lead, which improved feeding. Full metal jacketing also allowed bullets to withstand much higher velocities caused by the decrease of the caliber.\nIn addition to the various advantages afforded by FMJ rounds, the Hague Convention of 1899 Declaration III prohibits in international warfare the use of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.\nImpact characteristics.\nBy design, a fully jacketed projectile has less capacity to expand after contact with the target than a hollow-point projectile or a soft-point projectile. Although that can be an advantage when engaging targets behind cover, it can also be a disadvantage because an FMJ bullet may pierce completely through a target, leading to less-severe wounding and, possibly, failure to disable the target. Furthermore, a projectile that goes completely through a target can cause unintentional damage behind the target.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The sheet is widely used for craft metalworking by hammer working. It is also used particularly as a lower-cost training material for silversmiths. Starting in 1944, shell casings made of gilding metal were melted down by the United States Mint to be made into pennies. These pennies replaced the less popular steel cent of 1943, and the pennies of this composition were produced until 1946.\nGilding metal was also used for the \"bronze\" Olympic medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in 2021.\nGilding metal may be annealed by heating to between .

In 1968, he became the first man to officially break the 10-second barrier in the 100 meters, and won individual and relay gold at the Mexico City Olympics.\nTrack career.\nBorn in Dumas, Arkansas, Hines was raised in Oakland, California, and graduated from McClymonds High School in 1964. He was a baseball player in his younger years until he was spotted by track coach Jim Coleman as a running talent, and Hines became a sprinter. At the 1968 U.S. national championships in Sacramento, California, Hines became the first man to break the ten second barrier in the 100-metre race, setting 9.9 (manual timing), with an electronic time of 10.03 \u2013 two other athletes, Ronnie Ray Smith behind him (electronic time 10.13) and Charles Greene on the other semi-final (electronic time 10.09) having the same official clocking. That evening of June 20, 1968, at Hughes Stadium has been dubbed by track and field historians as the \"Night of Speed\". Hines attended Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas. He was a member of the Texas Southern University Tigers track team.\nA few months later, at the 1968 Summer Olympics, Hines \u2013 a black athlete \u2013 found himself in a tense situation, with racial riots going on in his home country and a threat of a boycott by the black athletes of the U.S. team, who were disturbed by the controversial idea of admitting apartheid South Africa to the Games and revelations linking the head of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, to a racist and antisemitic country club. Hines reached the 100 m final, and won it with the time 9.89 appearing on the screen, later corrected to 9.95. The 9.89 was taken from a light beam across the finish line, while the official photographic process used Polaroid film and took a couple of minutes to process and read. There was some controversy over how his (slower appearing) automatic time of 9.95 should compare to the hand timed 9.9 world record (Hines was again recorded at 9.9 in his 9.95 race). Automatic times start instantly with the sound of the gun, while hand times include human reaction time to start the watch. It took until 1977 before fully automatic timing was required of world records. As the fastest electronic time to that point, Hines' mark was recognized exclusively as a new world record. The race was also significant for being the third all-black podium in Olympic history. Hines helped break another world record, when he and his teammates sprinted to the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay gold at the same Games.\nProfessional football career.\nHines was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the NFL in the sixth round of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft. Hines spent the 1968 season on the Dolphins' practice squad. He was given the nickname \"Oops\". He appeared in ten games with Miami in 1969, accumulating a total of 52 all-purpose yards. Hines' final professional game was his first and only game with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1970. Hines was ranked as the 10th-worst NFL player of all time by Deadspin writer Jeff Pearlman.\nLater years.\nFor years Hines worked with inner-city youth in Houston, as well as on oil rigs outside the city.\nHines's world record remained unsurpassed until Calvin Smith ran a time of 9.93 in 1983.\nHines competed in the 100 at a 1984 Masters Track and Field Competition at UCLA.\nHines was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1994. Hines was also inducted into the Texas Track and Field coaches Hall of Fame, class of 2016.\nHines died in Hayward, California, on June 3, 2023, at the age of 76.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In return, Harriet regularly spies on the Spy Catcher Club through a back fence and concocts vengeful ways to punish them. After getting into trouble for carrying out some of her plans, Harriet unsuccessfully tries to resume her friendships with Sport and Janie as if nothing had ever happened. When Harriet's grades go down, her parents confiscate her notebook, which only depresses her further.\nHarriet's mother takes her daughter to see a child psychiatrist, who advises Harriet's parents to get in touch with Ole Golly and ask her to write to Harriet. In her letter, Ole Golly tells Harriet that \"if\" anyone ever reads her notebook, \"you have to do two things, and you are not going like either one of them. 1: You have to apologize. 2: You have to lie. Otherwise you are going to lose a friend.\"\nMeanwhile, dissension is rippling through the Spy Catcher Club. Marion and Rachel are calling all the shots, and Sport and Janie are tired of being bossed around. When they quit the club, most of their classmates do the same.\nHarriet's parents speak with her teacher and the headmistress, and Harriet is appointed editor of the class newspaper, replacing Marion. The newspaper\u2014featuring stories about the people on Harriet's spy route and the students' parents\u2014becomes an instant success. Harriet also uses the paper to print a retraction of the things she had written in her journal. Harriet is forgiven by Sport and Janie.\nReception.\nThe book appeared on a 1964 list of \"The Year's Best Juveniles\" in \"The New York Times Book Review\". One 1965 reviewer called the book \"a brilliantly written, unsparing realistic story, a superb portrait of an extraordinary child\". Another reviewer found that it \"captures the feelings, thoughts and situations of a modern city child with remarkable clarity and dimension\". Nevertheless, at least one reviewer in 1965 felt that the book dealt with \"disagreeable people and situations\". Although it was not chosen as one of the American Library Association (ALA) Notable Books for Children for 1964, years later it was included in a retrospective 1960\u20131964 ALA Notable Books List.\nIt won a Sequoyah Book Award in 1967. The paperback version was selected as one of the \"Best in the Field\" published during the previous 16 months in a 1968 \"New York Times\" article. In 1995, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies claimed that 2.5 million copies of the book had been sold; however, the book did not appear on a 2001 \"Publishers Weekly\" list of \"hardcovers that have sold 750,000 copies and paperbacks that have topped the one million copy mark.\"\nWhitney Matheson wrote on the \"USA Today\" site in 2002 that Harriet \"attracts dedicated, lifelong supporters\". Anita Silvey in 2004 selected it as one of the 100 best books for children. In 2005, the ex-CIA officer Lindsay Moran cited the \"Harriet the Spy\" series of books as an inspiration for her career. It was included in a 2009 list of \"Children\u2019s Classics\" by \"The Horn Book Magazine\".\nIn 2012, \"Harriet the Spy\" was ranked number 17 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\". Earlier that year, \"Time Out New York Kids\" ranked it number 12 among the \"50 Best Books for Kids\". Late in 2015, the same source ranked it number 34 in the \"73 best kids' books of all time for families\".\nDespite its popularity, the book has been banned from some schools and libraries \"because it was said to set a bad example for children\". Along with \"Are You There God?\", \"Blubber\", and \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\", the book was challenged at a 1983 school-board meeting in Xenia, Ohio. Proponents of the Xenia ban stated that the book \"teaches children to lie, spy, back-talk, and curse\", but the board voted to keep the books in the school libraries.\nSeries.\nFitzhugh wrote two sequels to the book: \"The Long Secret\" (1965) and \"Sport\" (1979, published posthumously). Both books received mixed reviews.\n\"Sport\" is a spin-off that focuses on Simon \"Sport\" Rocque, expanding upon his brief family background covered in \"Harriet the Spy\". As his parents are divorced, Sport lives with his father, who is a struggling writer who has been focusing on a book (a big gamble) rather than the steady income of journal/newspaper articles, with Sport managing their finances. Their financial problems are exacerbated once Sport's grandfather Simon Vane (from his mother's side) becomes terminally ill and stops sending regular payments to Sport. Things change for the better once Sport's father meets the kind Kate, who becomes a good stepmother. However, Simon's will has named Sport as the main beneficiary to the $30 million family fortune, much to the chagrin of Sport's mother Charlotte Vane and her sister. Charlotte, an absentee mother who has been living well abroad in Europe most of the time, returns to New York City upon hearing of her father's illness, scheming to increase her share of Simon's inheritance by kidnapping Sport and imprisoning him in the Plaza Hotel for a week.\nIn 2002, a sequel \"Harriet Spies Again\" appeared; written by Helen Ericson, it also received mixed reviews. Another sequel, \"Harriet the Spy, Double Agent\" by Maya Gold, was published in 2005; one review of that book stated \"there's not much to interest readers here.\"\nAdaptations.\nFilm rights to the novel were bought by Herbert Swope in 1964. \"Harriet the Spy\" was made into a 1996 film of the same name. It starred Michelle Trachtenberg and was the first film to be produced by Nickelodeon's feature film division.\nIn September 2004, Mainframe Entertainment announced that Protocol Entertainment will produce a new \"Harriet the Spy\" live-action television series, consisting of at least 22 half-hour episodes, with 2 Friends Entertainment acting as executive producers and US sales agent and Mainframe retaining international distribution rights.\nIn March 2010, Disney Channel aired a version of the story, '. This starred \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" cast member Jennifer Stone as Harriet, Alexander Conti from \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" as Harriet's friend Sport, and ''s Melinda Shankar as Janie. In this film, Harriet competes against Marion Hawthorne to see who has a better blog.\nIn August 2020, Apple TV+ announced it had given the production a series order for an animated television adaptation of the novel. The series was to be produced by The Jim Henson Company and Rehab Entertainment with Will McRobb as writer, Sidney Clifton as producer, and Terissa Kelton and John W. Hyde as executive producers, and starring Beanie Feldstein as Harriet, Jane Lynch as Ole Golly, and Lacey Chabert as Marion Hawthorne. The series was released on November 19, 2021.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was marketed as a rival to Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\". Originally released for the Amiga home computer in October 1992, the game was subsequently ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Game Boy and Game Gear, as well as other home computers. A sequel, \"Zool 2\", was released in 1993. A remastered version of the original game, titled \"Zool Redimensioned\", was developed by Sumo Digital Academy and published by \nSecret Mode for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2021.\nGameplay.\nThe game is a platform game, relying on smooth, fast-moving gameplay. Its protagonist is Zool, a gremlin \"Ninja of the Nth Dimension\" who is forced to land on Earth; in order to gain ninja ranking, he has to pass seven lands, beating a boss at the end of each of them. The game contains a number of embedded minigames, including several arcade games, a scrolling space shooter and a game accessible only by making Zool play a certain tune on an in-game piano or finding certain invisible warp points.\nDevelopment and release.\nGeorge Allan came up with the idea of \"Zool\" as he was criticized on his previous game \"Switchblade II\" for having a lack of enemies. In development, Zool could cast spells to get him out of trouble by collecting potions. For example, Zool could escape from pits with high jump spells and cast a shadow spell to make a clone of him that follows his actions (thus doubling the fire power). In the final version, the spells were replaced with collectible power-ups. The very early name for the project was \"Pootz\". The soundtrack by Patrick Phelan overlaps with the \"Lotus 3\" soundtrack and inspired several modern electro/techno remixes. Candy company Chupa Chups sponsored the game's production, with the company logo featured prominently within the game. The game was heavily hyped upon its initial release, including being bundled with the then-newly launched Amiga 1200, although not the AGA version with enhanced graphics which followed later. In 2000, the Amiga version of \"Zool\" was re-released as part of \"The Best of Gremlin\" compilation.\n\"Zool\" was also ported to the Atari ST, Game Boy, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Master System, Game Gear, Amiga CD32, IBM PC Compatibles, and RISC OS, as well as an arcade machine. The Amiga CD32 version has original red book audio tracks by Neil Biggin and has the option to have both sound effects and music. This and the Acorn Archimedes port are the only two incarnations of the original Amiga version to have this. For the Atari ST, the programmers and graphics artists choose to incorporate the redesigned sprites from their upcoming sequel \"Zool 2\" (in development at the time) to use for their star character on the Atari version to address the criticism that the original \"Zool\" character sprites were not cute enough. Most computer ports are close to the Amiga original but the Genesis and SNES ports both feature different levels which are structured differently, different background graphics, and unique bosses. The Sega Master System version features smaller, more scaled down stages and a more strict quota on collectible items, but also features unique gameplay moves like a wall climb. With the exception of the CD32 version, all console versions feature the soundtrack of the Amiga original, remixed appropriately for each console's unique sound systems.\nReception.\nThe original Amiga game was released to critical acclaim,\nreceiving scores of 97%, 96%, 95% from \"Amiga Computing\", \"Amiga Action\" and \"Amiga Format\" respectively. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" claimed that \"Zool\" sports great graphics, but the character moves too fast with little control. \"GamePro\" gave a positive review of the Game Gear version, praising its \"great graphics and sound abound\", as well as its \"crisp\" gameplay. \"Power Unlimited\" gave the Game Boy version a score of 80% and the Sega Genesis version a score of 81%. The magazine was generally positive to the game, despite noting that the game did not add anything new in the platforming genre.\nRetrospectively, \"Virgin Media\" included \"Zool\" on their list of top ten video game ninja heroes. In 2011, \"Wirtualna Polska\" ranked it as the 22nd best game for the Amiga, noting its \"absurdly\" high difficulty.\nLegacy.\nTwo children's novels based on the games, entitled \"Cool Zool\" and \"Zool Rules\", were released in February 1995. They were written by Stan Nicholls and Ian Edginton and published by Boxtree. \"The Game Maker's Companion\" (APress, 2010), a book on hobbyist game development, contains step-by-step instructions on how to remake the original \"Zool\" game using GameMaker Studio.\nA remastered version of the console version of \"Zool\", titled \"Zool Redimensioned\", was developed by Sumo Digital Academy and published by publisher Secret Mode for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 18, 2021. The remake features modes for both modern and classic-style difficulty, challenges for each level, and a multiplayer party mode, as well as an emulated version of the Genesis version of the game. For legal reasons, references to the original game's Chupa Chups sponsorship have been removed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67842", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67842", "title": "Electronic color code", "text": "Color code to indicate values of electronic components\nAn electronic color code or electronic colour code (see spelling differences) is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for resistors, but also for capacitors, inductors, diodes and others. A separate code, the 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in some telecommunications cables. Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.\nHistory.\nBefore industry standards were established, each manufacturer used its own unique system for color coding or marking their components.\nIn the 1920s, the RMA resistor color code was developed by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) as a fixed resistor coloring code marking. In 1930, the first radios with RMA color-coded resistors were built. Over many decades, as the organization name changed (RMA, RTMA, RETMA, EIA) so was the name of the code. Though known most recently as EIA color code, the four name variations are found in books, magazines, catalogs, and other documents over more than 95 years.\nIn 1952, it was standardized in by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and since 1963 also published as EIA RS-279. Originally only meant to be used for fixed resistors, the color code was extended to also cover capacitors with . The code was adopted by many national standards like DIN 40825 (1973), BS 1852 (1974) and IS 8186 (1976). The current international standard defining marking codes for resistors and capacitors is . In addition to the color code, these standards define a letter and digit code named RKM code for resistors and capacitors.\nColor bands were used because they were easily and cheaply printed on tiny components. However, there were drawbacks, especially for color blind people. Overheating of a component or dirt accumulation may make it impossible to distinguish brown from red or orange. Advances in printing technology have now made printed numbers more practical on small components. The values of components in surface mount packages are marked with printed alphanumeric codes instead of a color code.\nResistors.\nColor band system.\nTo distinguish left from right there is a gap between the C and D bands:\nIn the above example, a resistor with bands of red, violet, green, and gold has first digit 2 (red; see table below), second digit 7 (violet), followed by 5 (green) zeroes: . Gold signifies that the tolerance is \u00b15%.\nPrecision resistors may be marked with a five band system, to include three significant digits, a power of 10 multiplier (number of trailing zeroes, and a tolerance band. An extra-wide first band indicates a wire-wound resistor.\nResistors manufactured for military use may also include a fifth band which indicates component failure rate (reliability); refer to MIL-HDBK-199 for further details.\nTight tolerance resistors may have three bands for significant figures rather than two, or an additional band indicating temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), in units of ppm/K.\nAll coded components have at least two value bands and a multiplier; other bands are optional.\nThe standard color code per is as follows:\nResistors use various E series of preferred numbers for their specific values, which are determined by their tolerance. These values repeat for every decade of magnitude: ... 0.68, 6.8, 68, 680, ... For resistors of 20% tolerance the E6 series, with six values: 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, 68, then 100, 150, ... is used; each value is approximately the previous value multiplied by 6\u221a10. For 10% tolerance resistors the E12 series, with 12\u221a10 as multiplier, is used; similar schemes up to E192, for 0.5% or tighter tolerance are used. The separation between the values is related to the tolerance so that adjacent values at the extremes of tolerance approximately just overlap; for example, in the E6 series 10 + 20% is 12, while 15 \u2212 20% is also 12.\nZero ohm resistors, marked with a single black band, are lengths of wire wrapped in a resistor-like body which can be mounted on a printed-circuit board (PCB) by automatic component-insertion equipment. They are typically used on PCBs as insulating \"bridges\" where two tracks would otherwise cross, or as soldered-in jumper wires for setting configurations.\nBody-end-dot system.\nThe \"body-end-dot\" or \"body-tip-spot\" system was used for cylindrical composition resistors sometimes still found in very old equipment (built before the Second World War); the first band was given by the body color, the second band by the color of one end of the resistor, and the multiplier by a dot or band around the middle of the resistor. The other end of the resistor was in the body color, silver, or gold for 20%, 10%, 5% tolerance (tighter tolerances were not routinely used).\nExamples.\nFrom top to bottom:\nThe physical size of a resistor is indicative of the power it can dissipate.\nThere is an important difference between the use of three and of four bands to indicate resistance. The same resistance is encoded by:\nMnemonics.\nUseful mnemonics have been created to make it easier to remember the numeric order of resistor color bands:\nThe following example includes the tolerance codes \u2014 gold, silver and none:\nThe colors are sorted in ascending order of visible light photon frequency/energy like in a rainbow to make them easy to remember and to reduce the significance of possible read errors due to color shifts and fading over time: red (2), orange (3), yellow (4), green (5), blue (6), violet (7). Black (0) has no energy, brown (1) has a little more, white (9) has everything and grey (8) is like white, but less intense.\nCapacitors.\nCapacitors may be marked with 4 or more colored bands or dots. The colors encode the first and second most significant digits of the value in picofarads, and the third color the decimal multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.\nExtra bands on ceramic capacitors identify the voltage rating class and temperature coefficient characteristics. A broad black band was applied to some tubular paper capacitors to indicate the end that had the outer electrode; this allowed this end to be connected to chassis ground to provide some shielding against hum and noise pickup.\nPolyester film and \"gum drop\" tantalum electrolytic capacitors may also be color-coded to give the value, working voltage and tolerance.\nPostage stamp capacitors and war standard coding.\nCapacitors of the rectangular \"postage stamp\" form made for military use during World War II used \"American War Standard\" (AWS) or \"Joint Army-Navy\" (JAN) coding in six dots stamped on the capacitor. An arrow on the top row of dots pointed to the right, indicating the reading order. From left to right the top dots were: either black, indicating JAN mica, or silver, indicating AWS paper; first significant digit; and second significant digit. The bottom three dots indicated temperature characteristic, tolerance, and decimal multiplier. The characteristic was black for , brown for \u00b1500, red for \u00b1200, orange for \u00b1100, yellow for \u221220 to +100\u00a0ppm/\u00b0C, and green for 0 to +70\u00a0ppm/\u00b0C.\nA similar six-dot code by EIA had the top row as first, second and third significant digits and the bottom row as voltage rating (in hundreds of volts; no color indicated 500 volts), tolerance, and multiplier. A three-dot EIA code was used for 500 volt 20% tolerance capacitors, and the dots signified first and second significant digits and the multiplier. Such capacitors were common in vacuum tube equipment and in surplus for a generation after the war but are unavailable now.\nInductors.\nStandards IEC\u00a060062\u00a0/ EN\u00a060062 do not define a color code for inductors, but manufacturers of small inductors use the resistor color code, typically encoding inductance in microhenries. A white tolerance ring is used by TDK to indicate custom specifications.\nDiodes.\nThe part number for small JEDEC \"1N\"-coded diodes\u00a0\u2013 in the form \"1N4148\"\u00a0\u2013 is sometimes encoded as three or four rings in the standard color code, omitting the \"1N\" prefix. The 1N4148 would then be coded as yellow (4), brown (1), yellow (4), grey (8).\nWire.\nTransformer.\nPower transformers used in North American vacuum-tube equipment were often color-coded to identify the leads. Black was the primary connection, red secondary for the B+ (plate voltage), red with a yellow tracer was the center tap for the B+ full-wave rectifier winding, green or brown was the heater voltage for all tubes, yellow was the filament voltage for the rectifier tube (often a different voltage than other tube heaters). Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.\nAudio transformers for vacuum tube equipment were coded blue for the finishing lead of the primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.\nOther.\nWires may be color-coded to identify their function, voltage class, polarity, phase or to identify the circuit in which they are used. The insulation of the wire may be solidly colored, or where more combinations are needed, one or two tracer stripes may be added. Some wiring color codes are set by national regulations, but often a color code is specific to a manufacturer or industry.\nBuilding wiring under the US National Electrical Code and the Canadian Electrical Code is identified by colors to show energized, neutral, and grounding conductors, and to identify phases. Other color codes are used in the UK and other areas to identify building wiring or flexible cable wiring.\nMains electrical wiring, both in a building and on equipment, was once usually red for live, black for neutral, and green for earth, but this was changed as it was a hazard for color-blind people, who might confuse red and green; different countries use different conventions. Red and black are frequently used for positive and negative of battery or other single-voltage DC wiring.\nThermocouple wires and extension cables are identified by color code for the type of thermocouple; interchanging thermocouples with unsuitable extension wires destroys the accuracy of the measurement.\nAutomotive wiring is color-coded but standards vary by manufacturer; differing SAE and DIN standards exist.\nModern personal computer peripheral cables and connectors are color-coded to simplify connection of speakers, microphones, mice, keyboards and other peripherals, usually according to coloring schemes following recommendations such as PC System Design Guide, PoweredUSB, ATX, etc.\nA common convention for wiring systems in industrial buildings is: black jacket \u2013 AC less than , blue jacket \u2013 DC or communications, orange jacket \u2013 medium voltage or , red jacket or higher. Red-jacketed cable is also used for relatively low-voltage fire alarm wiring, but has a much different appearance.\nLocal area network cables may also have non-standardised jacket colors identifying, for example, process control network vs. office automation networks, or to identify redundant network connections, but these codes vary by organization and facility.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* http:// (4 and 5 band, mobile-friendly, shows nearest standard value)\n* https:// (easy lookup, 4 and 5 band calculators also available)\n* https://\n* https://"}

She is traditionally regarded as the foundress of the Benedictine nuns.\nScholastica is honored as a saint of the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Anglican Communion. She was born in Italy, and a ninth-century tradition makes her the twin sister of Benedict. Her feast day is 10 February.\nLife.\nAccording to the 6th-century \"Dialogues\" of Gregory the Great, Scholastica was born c. 480 in Nursia, Umbria, of wealthy parents (Anicius Eupropius and his wife Claudia Abondantia Reguardati). While Gregory only states that Scholastica was Benedict's sister, a later tradition says she was his twin (whether this is meant biologically or spiritually, or both, is unclear). Gregory also says she was dedicated to God from a young age. She and her brother Benedict were brought up together until the time he left to pursue studies in Rome.\nA young Roman woman of Scholastica's class and time would likely have remained in her father's house until marriage or entry into consecrated life. On occasion several consecrated virgins would live together in a household and form a community.\nBenedictine history shows that Scholastica established a hermitage about five miles from Monte Cassino and that this was the first convent of Benedictine nuns. However, it is possible that Scholastica lived in a hermitage with one or two other consecrated virgins in a cluster of houses at the base of Mount Cassino where there is an ancient church under her patronage Monastero di Santa Scolastica. Ruth Clifford Engs notes that since \"Dialogues\" indicates that Scholastica was dedicated to God at an early age, perhaps she lived in her father's house with other religious women until his death and then moved nearer to Benedict.\nNarrative from the \"Dialogues\".\nThe most commonly told story about her is that Scholastica would, once a year, go and visit her brother at a place near his abbey, and they would spend the day worshiping together and discussing sacred texts and issues.\nOne day they had supper and continued their conversation. When Benedict indicated it was time for him to leave, Scholastica, perhaps sensing that the time of her death was drawing near, asked him to stay with her for the evening so they could continue their discussions. Not wishing to break his own Rule, Benedict refused, insisting that he needed to return to his cell. At that point, Scholastica closed her hands in prayer, and after a moment, a wild storm started outside of the guest house in which they were staying. Benedict asked, \"What have you done?\", to which she replied, \"I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God and he did listen. So now go off, if you can; leave me and return to your monastery.\" Benedict was unable to return to his monastery, and they spent the night in discussion.\nThree days later, from his cell, he saw his sister's soul leaving the earth and ascending to heaven in the form of a shining white dove. Benedict had her body brought to his monastery, where he had it laid in the tomb which he had prepared for himself.\nThe Anglo-Saxon bishop and scholar Aldhelm recounts the story in both the \"De Laude Virginitatis\", written for the nuns at Barking, and in the shorter \"Carmen de virginitate\".\nStudies.\nWhat is known of Scholastica derives from the \"Dialogues\" of Gregory the Great. Early calendars and place names in the area around Monte Cassino support the historical accuracy of St. Gregory the Great's account of her life. Gregory names as his sources four of Benedict's contemporaries. A contemporary, Caesarius of Arles, wrote the \"Regula virginum\" (Rule for Virgins), a rule drawn up for virgins living in community, for a community which was headed by his sister, Caesaria.\nVeneration.\nScholastica is the patron saint of Benedictine nuns, education, and convulsive children, and is invoked against storms and rain. Her feast is celebrated on 10 February, and Saint Scholastica's Day bears special importance in the Benedictine monastic calendar. The Diocese of Aachen locally keeps a secondary feast of the translation of Scholastica's relics on 6 February, while Premonstratensians commemorate her on 9 February. Scholastica is also remembered in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 10 February. \nIn iconography, Scholastica is represented in a Benedictine habit, often as an abbess, and holding the Rule of Saint Benedict, with a crucifix or an ascending dove.\nScholastica was selected as the main motif for a high-value commemorative coin: the Austria \u20ac50 'The Christian Religious Orders', issued 13 March 2002. On the obverse (head) side, Scholastica is shown alongside her brother, Benedict."}

The bishop Josep Torras i Bages, one of the main figures of Catalan nationalism, called him the \"Prince of Catalan poets\". He was also known as \"moss\u00e8n\" (Father) Cinto Verdaguer, because of his career as a priest, and informally also simply \"moss\u00e8n Cinto\" (with Cinto being a short form of Jacint).\nLife.\nHe was born in Folgueroles, a town on the Plain of Vic, in the \"comarca\" of Osona (Province of Barcelona) to a modest family who valued learning. His father, Josep Verdaguer i Ordeix (Tav\u00e8rnoles, 1817 \u2013 Folgueroles, 1876), was a brickmason and farmer. His mother, Josepa Santal\u00f3 i Planes (Folgueroles, 1819\u20131871), a housewife and farmer, was to exercise great influence over young Jacint, as she conveyed to him a love of literature, especially poetry, and was a deeply religious woman. He was the third of eight children, only three of whom survived. In 1855, at the age of 10, he entered the Seminary of Vic, as was expected for a child who was not the first-born under the system of primogeniture and had to make his livelihood without relying on an inheritance. Until then, he had lived like the other children in his town. The anecdotes told about him show that he stood out from his peers for his intelligence, astuteness and courage, as well as his athletic constitution. He displayed a balanced attitude without any apparent religious inclinations.\nIn 1863, when he was 18, he started to work as a tutor for a family at the Can Tona masia (where he also helped out on the farm), while he continued to study. Can Tona is in the municipal district of Sant Mart\u00ed de Riudeperes, today Calldetenes (Osona). \nIn 1864, while a seminary student at the Seminari de Vic, Verdaguer wrote his first published poem \"Als estudiants. Recepta\", written in the style of a satirical d\u00e9cima. He was influenced in this endeavour by the popularity of a similar satirical d\u00e9cima, \"Entusiasme d'un estudiant per la cresta\" written by fellow seminary student Andreu Garriga in 1863. That same year, he participated in Barcelona's Floral Games (Jocs Florals) poetry contest, though without distinction. However, he was more successful in the next two Jocs Florals, winning four prizes in 1865 and two in 1866. In the late 1860s, Verdaguer would become the central figure of the Esbart de Vic, a group of young poets in Vic inspired by the ideals of the Catalan Renaixen\u00e7a.\nOn 24 September 1870 he was ordained a priest by the bishop Llu\u00eds Jord\u00e0 in Vic, and in October that same year, he said his first Mass, in the Sant Jordi hermitage. The next day he said his second Mass in the Sant Francesc hermitage near Vic. In 1871, his mother died (January 17) at the age of 52. On September 1 he was appointed bishop coadjutor of the small town of Vinyoles d'Or\u00eds and three days later he took up his charge.\nIn 1873, he published the \"cant\" (ode or song) \"Passi\u00f3 de Nostre Senyor Jesucrist\" (Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ). He left Vinyoles d'Or\u00eds for health reasons and moved to Vic. He went on a trip to Roussillon and saw the mountain, El Canig\u00f3, possibly for the first time. In December, he joined the Companyia Transatl\u00e0ntica trans-Atlantic steamship company as a chaplain because he was prescribed sea air for his health; he embarked in C\u00e1diz bound for Havana, Cuba.\nOn 8 September 1876 his father died at the age of 65. On board the \"Ciudad Condal\", on the return voyage from Cuba, Jacint Verdaguer finished his epic poem \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\". In November he entered the palace of Antonio L\u00f3pez, 1st Marquess of Comillas as an alms chaplain.\nIn 1877, when he was 32, and having returned from his journey, the jury of the Jocs Florals awarded him the special prize of the Diputation of Barcelona for \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\". Now he had earned his reputation as a poet.\nIn 1878, he traveled to Rome, where he was granted an audience with Pope Leo XIII. They discussed Verdaguer's poem \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\". In 1880, as the winner of three prizes in the Jocs Florals, he was proclaimed \"Master of the Gay Sciences\" (\"Mestre en Gai Saber\"). That same year he published his book of poetry, \"Montserrat\", which included \"Llegenda de Montserrat\", a legend (or two) in the form of a poem with 13 cantos.\nIn 1883, the Barcelona City Council published a print-run of 100,000 copies of his \"Oda a Barcelona\" (Ode to Barcelona), a 46-stanza poem. Such a print-run was quite remarkable given that the population of Barcelona at the time was 350,000, which would have amounted to about a copy per household. At the age of 39, Verdaguer traveled to Paris, Switzerland, Germany and Russia.\nHis collection of poems \"Caritat\" (\"Charity\", 1885) was published to raise funds for reconstruction after the 1884 Andalusian earthquake.\nOn 21 March 1886, when he was 41 years old, Bishop Morgades crowned him 'Poet of Catalonia' in the monastery of Ripoll. He published the epic poem \"Canig\u00f3\" and made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\nIn 1893, following controversy about aspects of his work as a priest, he left the post of alms chaplain at Claudio L\u00f3pez, 2nd Marquess of Comillas' palace. The publication of the trilogy \"Jes\u00fas Infant\" was completed, and he was assigned to the sanctuary of La Gleva. For a period, he was stripped of his office as priest, although this was eventually restored. In 1894, the books \"Roser de tot l'any\" and \"Veus del bon pastor\" were published. On 31 March he left the sanctuary of La Gleva.\nOn 17 May 1902, his 57th birthday, he moved from his home at Carrer Arag\u00f3 235 in Barcelona to the country house known as Vil\u00b7la Joana, in Vallvidrera (Barcelona), where he hoped to convalesce. On 10 June he died in Vil\u00b7la Joana, which is now one of the Museum of the History of Barcelona (MUHBA) heritage sites.\nVerdaguer was buried in Montju\u00efc Cemetery in Barcelona.\nHe was depicted on the Spanish 1971 500 Pesetas banknote.\nSelected works.\nAmong his works are: \nThe scenic cantata \"Atl\u00e0ntida\", composed by Manuel de Falla and completed after de Falla's death by Ernesto Halffter, is based on Verdaguer's \"L'Atl\u00e0ntida\". Manuel de Falla considered this large-scale orchestral piece to be the most important of all his works.\nSome of his shorter poems are well known as songs in Catalonia, especially \"L'Emigrant\" (\"Sweet Catalonia, country of my heart...\").\nBibliography.\nVerdaguer's works are collected in English in: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It causes a mild upper respiratory infection that resembles acute influenza. Pontiac fever resolves spontaneously and often goes undiagnosed. Both Pontiac fever and the more severe Legionnaires' disease may be caused by the same bacterium, but Pontiac fever does not include pneumonia.\nCause.\nSpecies of \"Legionella\" known to cause Pontiac fever include \"Legionella pneumophila\", \"Legionella longbeachae\", \"Legionella feeleii\", \"Legionella micdadei\", and \"Legionella anisa\". Sources of the causative agents are aquatic systems and potting soil. The first outbreak caused by inhalation of aerosolized potting soil was discovered in New Zealand in January 2007. A total of 10 workers at a nursery came down with Pontiac fever. It was the first identification of \"L. longbeachae\". Pontiac fever does not spread from person to person. It is acquired through aerosolization of water droplets and/or potting soil containing \"Legionella\" bacteria.\nEpidemiology.\nPontiac fever is known to have a short incubation period of 1 to 3 days. No fatalities have been reported and cases resolve spontaneously without treatment. It is often not reported. Age, gender, and smoking do not seem to be risk factors. Pontiac fever seems to affect young people in the age medians of 29 to 32. Pathogenesis of the Pontiac fever is poorly known.\nHistory.\nPontiac fever was named after the city of Pontiac, Michigan, where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county's department of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the 1976 Legionnaires' outbreak in Philadelphia, the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified \"Legionella pneumophila\". An outbreak caused by\" Legionella micdadei\" in early 1988 in the UK became known as Lochgoilhead fever. Since that time, other species of \"Legionella\" that cause Pontiac fever have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where \"Legionella longbeachae\" was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also marked the first time Pontiac fever had been traced to potting soil.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shortly after the death of his father, when he was 16, he entered the Military Academy of Guadalajara to join the Corps of Engineers of the Spanish Army, specializing in bridges, railways and telegraphs. He requested to be transferred to Cuba but was sent several times to Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, rising from telegrapher to captain. As an officer in the Spanish army, he favored its modernization. He achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1887 he was transferred to Lleida, where he met his wife, Eug\u00e8nia Lamarca, daughter of Agapito Lamarca, with whom he had three children, Joan, Eug\u00e8nia and Maria. \nOn 25 November 1905, some Spanish army officers, in retaliation to a joke in the satirical Catalan journal \u00a1Cu-Cut!, assaulted and destroyed the offices of the magazine, as well as the offices of the Catalanist journal La Veu de Catalunya. The Spanish Government responded by creating a Law of jurisdictions for the repression of crimes against the homeland and against the army, which caused various political groups to unite to form Solidaritat Catalana ('Catalan Solidarity'). Maci\u00e0 publicly condemned the military's action. As a result, his officials transferred him to Santo\u00f1a, Cantabria.\nHe ran as a member of Catalan Solidarity in the election of 21 April 1907 for Barcelona and Les Borges Blanques districts, where his family came from. The resounding victory of this formation (41 of the 44 deputies of Catalonia) took him in Santo\u00f1a. He was re-elected deputy in 1914, 1916, 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1923. From the Spanish Congress, he began to advocate for the regeneration of Spain, however, during his last years as a politician in Madrid, he moved from Catalan regionalist to left-wing independentist positions.\nIndependentist leader.\nIn 1919 he founded the Nationalist Democratic Federation (\"Federaci\u00f3 Democr\u00e0tica Nacionalista\"), which proposed a federal or confederal solution for Spain, in which Catalonia would enjoy a high degree of self-government. In 1922, Maci\u00e0 founded the independentist party Estat Catal\u00e0.\nIn September 1923, right after the coup d'etat of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Maci\u00e0 took refuge in Perpignan. In 1926 he attempted an insurrection against the Spanish dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. This uprising, known as the plot of Prats de Moll\u00f3, had the aim to achieve the independence of Catalonia, was based in Prats de Moll\u00f3 (Roussillon, southern France). Between 50 and 100 Italian mercenaries, mostly from the Garibaldi Legion that fought in the French Foreign Legion during World War I and exiled to France, were hired by Maci\u00e0 to help on the action. This attempt was aborted by the French Gendarmerie, which was able to abort the complot with the help of Ricciotti Garibaldi jr., a spy of Fascist Italy and grandson of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Maci\u00e0 was arrested and convicted to two months in jail and a fine of 100 francs. Despite the failure, Maci\u00e0 and his cause became very popular in Catalonia. He left France for Brussels in March 1927, where his notoriety increased while he remained in Belgium. He founded there, with other exiles, the Casal Catal\u00e0 de Brussel\u00b7les. In April 1930 he returned to Spain after being pardoned; he was briefly exiled again but returned once more in February 1931.\nRepublic and Generalitat.\nIn March 1931 Estat Catal\u00e0 joined the Catalan Republican Party of Llu\u00eds Companys and the L'Opini\u00f3 Group of Joan Lluh\u00ed to found a new party, Republican Left of Catalonia (\"Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya\", ERC), maintaining Estat Catal\u00e0 a degree of internal autonomy. Francesc Maci\u00e0 became the leader figure of the new party.\nOn 14 April 1931, two days after the Spanish local elections that caused the exile of king Alfonso XIII of Spain and gave the local majority to the Republican Left of Catalonia, and a few hours before the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in Madrid, from the balcony of the Palau de la Generalitat (then the seat of the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona), Maci\u00e0 proclaimed the \"Catalan Republic, expecting that the other peoples of Spain constitute themselves as republics, in order to establish the Iberian Confederation\". Maci\u00e0 was appointed as acting president of Catalonia. Three days later, the government of the new Spanish Republic sent three ministers (Fernando de los R\u00edos, Llu\u00eds Nicolau d'Olwer and Marcel\u00b7l\u00ed Domingo) to Barcelona to negotiate with Maci\u00e0 and the Catalan provisional government. Maci\u00e0 reached an agreement with the ministers, in which the Catalan Republic was renamed Generalitat of Catalonia, becoming an autonomous government within the Spanish Republic. Maci\u00e0 remained as acting President of the Generalitat. The main task of the provisional Generalitat was to draft an statute of autonomy for Catalonia, approved by the Spanish Congress after many modifications and discussions on 9 September 1932.\nAfter the first Catalan parliamentary election on 20 November 1932 when, after a landslide victory of ERC, he was officially appointed President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, maintaining the position until his death in December 1933.\nDeath.\nMaci\u00e0 died due to appendicitis on 25 December 1933 in Barcelona. His funeral caused a massive demonstration of grief. His remains rest in the \"Pla\u00e7a de la Fe\", the Montju\u00efc Cemetery, in Barcelona's Montju\u00efc hill.\nDocumentation.\nPart of his personal collection, which consists of documentation image about the president travels throughout Catalonia and family snapshots, is preserved in the National Archive of Catalonia. They are a repository of Mrs. Teresa Peyr\u00ed i Maci\u00e0. The fund contains documents generated and received by Francesc Maci\u00e0, personal and family documents, correspondence from the period before the Second Spanish Republic (until April 1931) and documentation produced primarily in terms of its political activity. The fund brings together documents relating to his conduct before being named president of the Government of Catalonia (1907-1931): as a Member of Parliament (speeches, proclamations, and conference reports) on Estat Catal\u00e0 (organization, reports, proclamations, calls, publications, etc.), on Catalan Army (constitution, rules and organization, information mapping and geographic pathways) and on the corresponding period in the Directory of General Primo de Rivera. Finally, there is the collection of photographs, most made during his presidency.\nAnother part of Maci\u00e0's personal archive consists of correspondence written to/by Joan Agell, documents of Centre Catal\u00e0 in New York, diverse documentation and press clippings. It is in the Pavell\u00f3 de la Rep\u00fablica CRAI Library at the University of Barcelona."}

It was named after its designer, Shinobu Ishihara, a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917.\nThe test consists of a number of Ishihara plates, which are a type of pseudoisochromatic plate. Each plate depicts a solid circle of colored dots appearing randomized in color and size. Within the pattern are dots which form a number or shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, and invisible, or difficult to see, to those with a red\u2013green color vision deficiency. Other plates are intentionally designed to reveal numbers only to those with a red\u2013green color vision deficiency, and be invisible to those with normal red\u2013green color vision. The full test consists of 38 plates, but the existence of a severe deficiency is usually apparent after only a few plates. There are also Ishihara tests consisting of 10, 14 or 24 test plates, and plates in some versions ask the viewer to trace a line rather than read a number.\nPlates.\nThe plates make up several different test designs:\nThe numbering and rotation of plates differs between the shortened diagnostic versions of the test and the full 38-plate test.\nHistory.\nBorn in 1879 to a family in Tokyo, Shinobu Ishihara began his education at the Imperial University where he attended on a military scholarship. Ishihara had just completed his graduate studies in ophthalmology in Germany when war broke out in Europe and World War I had begun. While holding a military position related to his field, he was given the task of creating a color blindness test. Ishihara studied existing tests and combined elements of the Stilling test, named after the German ophthalmologist Jakob Stilling, with the concept of pseudo-isochromaticism to produce an improved, more accurate and easier to use test. \nTest procedures.\nBeing a printed plate, the accuracy of the test depends on using the proper lighting to illuminate the page. A \"daylight\" bulb illuminator is required to give the most accurate results, of around 6000\u20137000\u00a0K temperature (ideal: 6500\u00a0K, Color Rendering Index (CRI) &gt;90), and is required for military color vision screening policy. Fluorescent bulbs are often used in school testing, but the color of fluorescent bulbs and their CRI can vary widely. Fluorescent lighting showed better results and faster recognition speed compared to CFL and LED luminance in trichromats. Incandescent bulbs should not be used, as their low temperature (yellow-color) gives highly inaccurate results, allowing some color vision deficient persons to pass.\nProper testing technique is to give only three seconds per plate for an answer, and not allow coaching, touching or tracing of the numbers by the subject. The test is best given in random sequence, if possible, to reduce the effectiveness of prior memorization of the answers by subjects. Some pseudo-isochromatic plate books have the pages in binders, so the plates may be rearranged periodically to give a random order to the test.\nSince its creation, the Ishihara Color Blindness Test has become commonly used worldwide because of its easy use and high accuracy. In recent years, the Ishihara test has become available online in addition to its original paper version. Though both media use the same plates, they require different methods for an accurate diagnosis.\nOccupational screening.\nThe United States Navy uses the Ishihara plates (and alternatives) for color vision screening. The current passing score is 10 correct of 14 red/green test plates (not including the demonstration plate).\nResearch has shown that scores below twelve indicate color vision deficiency, and twelve or more correct indicate normal color vision, with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The sensitivity of the Ishihara test varies by the number of plates allowed to pass, which can vary by institutional policy. Sensitivity also may be influenced by test administration (strength of lighting, time allowed to answer) and testing errors (coaching by administrators, smudges or marks made upon the plates).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Globally, around 40% of individuals engage in some form of regular exercise or organized sports, with upwards of 60% of US high school students participating in one or more sports. Sports injuries account for 15 - 20% of annual acute care visits with an incidence of 1.79 - 6.36 injuries per 1,000 hours of participation. Sports injuries can be broken down into the types of injuries, risk factors and prevention and the overall impact that injuries have on athletes.\nTypes of sport injury.\nThe type of sports injury suffered varies greatly based on gender, age and sport. Nonetheless, those with the highest prevalence remain contusions, fractures and sprains, followed closely by wounds and overuse injuries. Also common, the possible severity of head and neck injuries are important to consider. It is also paramount to place emphasis on the specific injuries that are most commonly encountered by sports medicine specialists.\nSoft tissue injuries.\nSoft tissue injuries can be divided into those that affect the connective tissue (such as the skin), ligaments, tendons, or muscles. Injuries affecting the integument or the skin, can be classified as contusions, abrasions, and lacerations. Contusions or bruises are the simplest and most common injuries and are usually a result of blunt force trauma. Severe contusions may involve deeper structures and can include nerve or vascular injury. Abrasions are superficial injuries to the skin that result from a shearing force and are no deeper than the most superficial tissue layer, the epidermis. Bleeding, when present, is minimal. Minor abrasions generally do not scar, but deeper abrasions generally bleed and may scar. Lacerations occur from blunt trauma and result in a puncture through the skin, leaving an open wound. Facial lacerations are the most variable of the soft tissue injuries that athletes can sustain. They can occur intraoral or extraoral, and vary from a superficial skin nick to a lip laceration, or involve significant vascular disruption or injury to collateral vital structures.\nAnother major set of soft tissue injuries are those that affect the tendons and ligaments involved in the function of weight bearing joints. Of the various ligament and tendon injuries sustained during sports, those that hold particular importance for sports medicine providers due to their high prevalence are described in the following table:\nBony Injuries.\nTypes of hard tissue injuries can include dental and bone injuries and are less frequent than soft tissue injuries in sport, but are often more serious. Hard tissue injuries to teeth and bones can occur with contusions, such as Battle sign, which indicates basilar skull fracture, and so-called raccoon eyes, which indicate midface fractures. However, tooth fractures are the most common type of tooth injury, and can be categorized as crown infractions, enamel-only fracture, enamel-dentin fractures, and fractures that extend through the enamel and dentin into the pulp which is defined below.\nIn addition to tooth fractures, there are several types of bone fractures as well. These types being closed or simple, open or compound, greenstick, hairline, complicated, comminuted, avulsion, and compression. A complicated fracture is when the structures surrounding the fracture are injured, such as blood vessels, organs, nerves, etc.\nOveruse injuries.\nOveruse injuries can be defined as injuries that result from a mechanism of repetitive and cumulative micro-trauma, that exceeds tissue repair capacity. Overuse injuries can be divided into three primary categories, tendinopathy, stress reaction and stress fractures, and Juvenile Osteochondritis Dissecans. Tendinopathy is the result of accumulative micro-trauma and degenerative changes to the tissue that can predispose to pain and even rupture with activity. Tendinopathy progresses in stages from tendinitis which is inflammatory driven, to later tendinosis which is primarily degenerative. The lack of inflammation in this later stage is in fact what hinders the bodies ability to heal the injury. Stress reaction and stress fractures occur due to accumulative trauma to bone that leads to a imbalance between bone cleavage and replacement leaving the bone prone to micro-damage (stress reactions) and stress fractures. \nA common cause for both these types of injuries are increase in training frequency and can be associated with poor technique, or other external factors like training on hard surfaces or long distance sports. Finally, the rapid changes in physical growth in children leave them prone to overuse injuries, especially Juvenile Osteochonditis Dissecans, in which the bone-cartilage interface is affected. This disease is driven primarily by repetitive micro-trauma sustained while training and can lead to pain in the affected joints. The disease predominately affects athletes undergoing rapid periods of growth, therefore as the athlete's bodies continues to mature, the disease tends to self-resolve. \nHead and neck injuries.\nSports-related head and neck injuries account for a large portion of athletic trauma, and the severity of these injuries account for an estimated 70% of sports-related mortality and 20% permanent disability. In the United States, approximately 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions occur annually, with contact sports such as football, hockey, and soccer carrying the highest incidence.\nConcussion, the most common sports-related head injury, results from disrupted neurologic function due to significant mechanical forces imparted on the brain, plus resulting inflammation. Continuing research into sports related concussions has shown that repeat concussions can lead to a disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), characterized by memory loss, lack of impulse control, amongst a myriad of mental health and movement disorders.\nSideline evaluation of concussed athletes includes symptom assessment, cognitive testing, and balance examination. Imaging, like CT-scan, is reserved for cases when intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding into the brain, is suspected. Return-to-play protocols are designed to ensure a stepwise and timely recovery to prevent second-impact syndrome, a severe condition caused by swelling of the brain tissue.\nHead and neck injuries commonly co-occur. When examining a patient with a neck injury, a physician will use specialized maneuvers in conjunction with a neurologic examination, to evaluate if the neck injury is causing compression or disruption of the nerve roots. Should a spinal cord injury be suspected, the athlete will be placed into spinal immobilization and sent for further testing. If an athlete with a head injury is unconscious, they are assumed to have a spinal cord injury and full spinal immobilization is required.\nSeveral strategies, such as rule modifications and protective equipment have helped decrease the risk of head and neck injuries, especially in high contact sports like football and hockey. However, the effectiveness of such strategies has shown more efficacy for preventing concussions as compared to neck injuries. Given the severity of such injuries, the Concussion in Sport Group holds regular conferences to evaluate the literature on the topic and propose updated guidelines for prevention and management of these injuries.\nRisk factors.\nRecent changes to load management for athletes and fear of overtraining led to a groundbreaking study by the International Olympic Committee in 2016, in which the committee hoped to identify risk factors predisposing athletes to overuse and risk of injury. The study performed a systematic review with an inclusion of 106 prior studies on load and injury risk. A major takeaway from the study was the analysis of how external versus internal factors predispose to injury and how these factors can be managed to avoid injury. Intrinsic or personal factors that could put an athlete at higher risk for injury could be gender. For example, female athletes are typically more prone to injuries such as ACL tears. There is approximately a 1.6-fold greater rate of ACL tears per athletic exposure in high school female athletes than in males of the same age range. Other intrinsic factors are age, weight, body composition, height, lack of flexibility or range of motion, coordination, balance, and endurance. In addition, biological factors such as pes planus, pes cavus, and valgus or varus knees can cause an athlete to have improper biomechanics and become predisposed to injury. There are also psychological factors that are included in intrinsic risk factors. Some psychological factors that could make certain individuals more subject to injury include personal stressors in their homes, school, or social life. There are also extrinsic risk factors that can affect an athlete's risk of injury. Some examples of extrinsic factors would be sport-specific protective equipment such as helmets, shoulder pads, mouth guards, and shin guards, and whether or not these pieces of equipment are fitted correctly to the individual athlete to ensure that they are each preventing injury as well as possible. Other extrinsic factors are the conditions of the sports setting such as rain, snow, and maintenance of the floor/field of playing surface.\nPrevention.\nPrevention helps reduce potential sports injuries. Benefits include a healthier athlete, longer duration of participation in the sport, potential for better performance, and reduced medical costs. Explaining the benefits of sports injury prevention programs to coaches, team trainers, sports teams, and individual athletes will give them a glimpse at the likelihood for success by having the athletes feel they are healthy, strong, comfortable, and capable to compete. Better training and better exercises can help prevent injuries from even happening. \nPrimary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.\nPrevention can be broken up into three broad categories primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention involves the avoidance of injury. An example is ankle brace being worn as a team. Even those with no history of previous ankle injuries participate in wearing braces. If primary prevention activities were effective, there would be a lesser chance of injuries occurring in the first place. Secondary prevention involves an early diagnosis and treatment once an injury has occurred. The goal of early diagnosis is to ensure that the injury is receiving proper care and recovering correctly, thereby limiting the concern for other medical problems stemming from the initial traumatic event. \nSome sports leagues have gone further in terms of secondary prevention by incorporating live sensing data to allow early diagnosis and treatment: Some teams in the Swiss National Ice Hockey League are testing out systems that combine helmet-integrated sensors and analysis software to reveal a player's ongoing brain injury risk during a game. These sensors provide players and coaches with real-time data on head impact strength, frequency, and severity. The sensors are planned to be integrated into the foam padding used inside hockey helmets to serve as pressure detectors.\nLastly, tertiary prevention is solely focused on rehabilitation to reduce and correct an existing disability resulting from the traumatic event. Thus, for an athlete with an ankle injury, rehabilitation would consist of balance exercises to recover strength and mobility, as well as wearing an ankle brace while gradually returning to the sport.\nSeason analysis.\nIt is most essential to establish participation in warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that focus on main muscle groups commonly used in the sport of interest. This decreases the chances of getting muscle cramps, torn muscles, and stress fractures. A season analysis is an attempt to identify risks before they occur by reviewing training methods, the competition schedule, traveling, and past injuries. If injuries have occurred in the past, the season analysis reviews the injury and looks for patterns that may be related to a specific training event or competition program. For example, a stress fracture injury on a soccer team or cross country team may be correlated to a simultaneous increase in running and a change in running environment, like a transition from a soft to hard running surface. A season analysis can be documented as team-based results or individual athlete results. Other key program events that have been correlated to injury incidence are changes in training volume, changes in climate locations, selection for playing time in important matches, and poor sleep due to tight chaotic scheduling. It is important for team program directors and staff to implicate testing to ensure healthy, competitive, and confident athletes for their upcoming season.\nPreseason screening.\nAnother beneficial review for preventing player sports injuries is preseason screenings. A study found that the highest injury rate during practices across fifteen Division I, II, and III NCAA sports was in the preseason compared to in-season or postseason. To prepare an athlete for the wide range of activities needed to partake in their sport pre-participation examinations are regularly completed on hundreds of thousands of athletes each year. The physical exam must be done properly to limit the risks of injury and also to diagnose early onsets of a possible injury. Preseason screenings consist of testing the mobility of joints (ankles, wrists, hips, etc.), testing the stability of joints (knees, neck, etc.), testing the strength and power of muscles, and also testing breathing patterns. The objective of a preseason screening is to clear the athlete for participation and verify that there is no sign of injury or illness, which would represent a potential medical risk to the athlete (and a risk of liability to the sports organization). Besides the physical examination and the fluidity of the movements of joints the preseason screenings often take into account a nutrition aspect as well. It is important to maintain normal iron levels, blood pressure levels, fluid balance, adequate total energy intake, and normal glycogen levels. Nutrition can aid in injury prevention and rehabilitation if one obtains the body's daily intake needs. Obtaining sufficient amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fluids, protein, and vitamins and minerals is important for the overall health of the athlete and limits the risk of possible injuries. Iron deficiency, for example, is found in both male and female athletes; however 60 percent of female college athletes are affected by iron deficiency. There are many factors that can contribute to the loss of iron, like menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding, inadequate iron intake from the diet, general fatigue, and weakness, among others. The consequences of iron deficiency, if not solved, can be impaired athletic performance and a decline in immune and cognitive function.\nFunctional movement screen.\nOne technique used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen (FMS). Functional movement screening is an assessment used to evaluate movement patterns and asymmetries, which can provide insight into mechanical restrictions and potential risk for injury. Functional movement screening contains seven fundamental movement patterns that require a balance of both mobility and stability. These fundamental movement patterns provide an observable performance of basic locomotor, manipulative, and stabilizing movements. The tests place the individual athlete in extreme positions where weaknesses and imbalances become clear if proper stability and mobility are not functioning correctly. The seven fundamental movement patterns are a deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight-leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability. For example, the deep squat is a test that challenges total body mechanics. It is used to gauge bilateral, symmetrical, and functional mobility of the hips, knees, and ankles. The dowel held overhead gauges bilateral and symmetrical mobility of the shoulders and the thoracic spine. The ability to perform the deep squat technique requires appropriate pelvic rhythm, closed-kinetic chain dorsiflexion of the ankles, flexion of the knees and hips, extension of the thoracic spine, as well as flexion and abduction of the shoulders. There is a scoring system applied to each movement as follows a score of 3 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement without any compensations, a score of 2 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement, but operate on poor mechanics and compensatory patterns to achieve the movement, a score of 1 is given to the athlete if they cannot perform the movement pattern even with compensations, and finally, a 0 is given to the athlete if one has pain during any part of the movement or test. Three of the seven fundamental tests including shoulder mobility, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability have a clearance score associated with them meaning a pass or fail score. If the athlete fails this part of the test a score of 0 is given as the overall score. Once the scoring is complete the athlete and medical professional can review the documentation together and organize a set prevention program to help target and strengthen the areas of weakness to limit the risks of possible injuries.\nSport injury prevention for children.\nThere are approximately 8,000 children treated in emergency rooms each day for sports-related injuries. It is estimated that around 1.35 million children will suffer a sports-related injury per year, worldwide. This is why children and adolescents need special attention and care when participating in sports.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many sports-related injuries are predictable and preventable. Some prevention techniques are listed below.\nSports injury prevalence.\nThe prevalence of sports injuries is difficult to define, due to the variety of sports that individuals participate in and based on severity, those not treated versus those requiring urgent treatment. As such, incidence as a function of injury per 1,000 hours of activity participation has been adopted to aid in comparison of injury types, and across different sports and groups of people.\nSports that have a higher incidence of contact and collision have the highest rates of injury. Collisions with the ground, objects, and other players are common, and unexpected dynamic forces on limbs and joints can cause sports injuries. Soccer is the sport leading to the most competitive injuries in NCAA female college athletes. Gymnastics, on the other hand, has the highest injury rate overall. Swimming and diving is the NCAA sport that has the lowest injury rates. Injury rates were much higher for NCAA women's sports during competitions rather than practices except for volleyball, indoor track, and swimming and diving. For eight of the NCAA sports, many injuries acquired during competition require at least seven days recovery before returning to the sport. In general, more females are injured during practice than in competition. NCAA athlete injury rates are higher in men's ice hockey, basketball, and lacrosse. NCAA athlete injury rates were significantly higher in women's cross country than men's cross country. The NCAA injury rates are roughly the same for soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and both indoor and outdoor track and field, regardless of gender.\nCosts.\nInterventions targeted at decreasing the incidence of sports injuries can impact healthcare costs, as well as family and societal resources. Sports injuries have direct and indirect costs. The direct costs are usually calculated by taking into account the cost of using healthcare resources to prevent, detect, and treat injury. There is a need for research about how healthcare is used and the expenses that coincide with it. Included in these expenses are how different injuries may have different prognoses. Indirect costs may be taken into account as well, when an injury prevents an individual from returning to work it may hinder the economic benefit to themselves and others.\nFor collegiate athletics, the estimated cost of sports injuries ranges from $446 million to $1.5 billion per year. For high school athletics, the yearly estimated cost of sport injuries ranges from $5.4 billion to $19.2 billion. Medical costs in the United States for sports injury-related emergency department visits exceeded $935 million every year.\nSports-related emotional stress.\nSports involvement can initiate both physical and mental demands on athletes. Athletes must learn ways to cope with stressors and frustrations that can arise from competition against others. Conducted research shows that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated following sports injuries. After an occurrence of an injury many athletes display self-esteem issues, athletic identity crises, and high levels of post-traumatic distress, which are linked to avoidant coping skills.\nEach year in the United States, 3.5 million athletes are injured; therefore, it is important to understand how injury can impact anxiety. Athletes are exposed to a culture that focuses heavily on success, and injuries can hinder the athlete from reaching their full potential. Because of this reliance on achievement, many players are unlikely to stop performing because of pain they face. An injury could not only impact an athlete's ability to train and compete but also influence their psyche and mental health. The external pressure by coaches, teammates, fans, and the media on athletes to endure pain and injury instead of refusing to play when hurt has prompted athletes to believe that accepting physical risks is their only choice. This will in turn lead to both physical and mental struggles for the athlete to endure simultaneously and could lead to a worse outcome if not treated appropriately.\nIn addition, the influences of personal and situational factors can directly impact an athlete's perceptions about their injury. Personal factors include the characteristics of the injury, the athlete's approach to their injury, and their identity. Situational factors include the nature of the athlete's sport, social influences, and the rehabilitation environment. For example, stressful events such as divorce or employment instability can increase the likelihood of experiencing an injury. An athlete's response to an injury is influenced by a variety of stressors they encountered before the injury and the coping skills they used to overcome previous struggles. Therefore, it is important to utilize an integrated model in the rehabilitation process to account for the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral needs of the athletes.\nIn the rehabilitation process, athletes may experience anxiety as a result of the injury as well as their underlying personal and situational issues. As mental trainer Jeff Troesch mentions, \"Recovering from injury can be one of the toughest psychological challenges any athlete faces.\" All of the uncertainty surrounding the injury and lacking full control over one's body can lead to more anxiety and stress on the athlete. Studies have shown that higher anxiety scores are commonly associated with other comorbidities including depression. In addition, athletes with higher ratings for career dissatisfaction also exhibited higher anxiety scores compared to those who were career satisfied with their career. From these studies it can be inferred that injured athletes experience an increase in anxiety levels as a result of psychosocial factors. Hence, taking these influences into account may assist sports medicine practitioners when planning for the psychological management needs of injured elite athletes.\nWhen addressing psychological readiness during the recovery process, rehabilitation facilities should encourage confidence-building and provide social support to the athletes. Developing confidence in returning to sport includes \"having trust in the rehabilitation provider, satisfaction of social support needs, and achievement of physical standards/clinical outcomes.\" Social support can operate as a buffer for the amount of anxiety and stress associated with an injury by positively affecting the athlete's psychological and emotional wellbeing. In turn, this support can improve the athlete's motivation and coping skills during the rehabilitation process. In addition, research suggests that emotional social support, which prioritizes \"empathy, love, trust, and caring\" can benefit injured athletes psychologically as they recover. With greater emphasis on the psyche, athletes will be more motivated to envision their injury recovery as a new competition or task, rather than a roadblock that hinders them from achieving their dreams.\nTo accommodate psychosocial factors in recovery, services must be accessible to the athletes. Although many universities provide psychological services to their students, these employees may not be trained in handling athlete-specific factors, and thus may not be able to address the particular needs of injured athletes. Therefore, certified athletic trainers who work with athletes consistently can be an important resource for providing emotional and social support to injured athletes. In previous studies, athletes who were content with the social support they received from their athletic trainers were 87% less likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety. Thus, such athletic trainers involved in the athlete's regular activities can be effective in facilitating psychological interventions during the rehabilitation process.\nCurrently, mental health struggles are often surrounded by stigma and can be seen as a weakness for high-level athletes. When discussing Kara Goucher's openness to sharing her difficulty with negative self-talk and confidence, the author acknowledged that this example is rare in the world of athletics because such struggles are usually considered a weakness. If more athletes like Kara Goucher communicate about their mental health, others will feel more inclined to discuss their issues instead of keeping it to themselves. Therefore, de-stigmatizing and engaging in conversations about mental health can encourage athletes to enlist help for their internal struggles throughout their sports career and during an injury. Mindfulness-based interventions that integrate the mind and body have begun to address mental health needs among high-level athletes. Not only has mindfulness been shown to positively impact general well-being and improve performance, but it could also be utilized as a \"protective factor to stress and stress-related psychological issues.\" The stigma associated with mental health as a weakness is a common barrier impeding help-seeking behaviors for athletes whose primary goal is to achieve perfection and success in their sport.\nElite athletes dedicate an immense amount of time and effort and can suffer from both physical and mental roadblocks. Therefore, rehabilitation programs must account for mental health as a strong component of the recovery process for athletes, so that they are better prepared to manage not only the physical burden but also the psychological effects of their injury. Understanding the injured athlete's experience from a physical, psychological, and social perspective is essential for athletes to return to their sport when they are both physically and mentally prepared and perform at their optimal level.\nMany student-athletes do not seek mental health support. Research suggests that only 10% of college athletes with mental health conditions seek support. This means that out of approximately 500,000 college athletes, only 50,000 seek help. Awareness is another challenge of support. In a survey evaluating mental health support for college athletes, 60% of male athletes and 55% of female athletes were not aware of how to find or access mental health support. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67886", "revid": "3810835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67886", "title": "Iliotibial band syndrome", "text": "Medical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nIliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is the second most common knee injury, and is caused by inflammation located on the lateral aspect of the knee due to friction between the iliotibial band and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Pain is felt most commonly on the lateral aspect of the knee and is most intensive at 30 degrees of knee flexion. Risk factors in women include increased hip adduction and knee internal rotation. Risk factors seen in men are increased hip internal rotation and knee adduction. ITB syndrome is most associated with long-distance running, cycling, weight-lifting, and with military training.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms range from a stinging sensation just above the knee and outside of the knee (lateral side of the knee) joint, to swelling or thickening of the tissue in the area where the band moves over the femur. The stinging sensation just above the knee joint is felt on the outside of the knee or along the entire length of the iliotibial band. At initial symptom onset pain typically occurs following activity, but as the condition progresses pain is frequently felt during activities and may be present at rest. Pain may also be present above and below the knee, where the ITB attaches to the tibia. Pain is frequently worsened by running up or downhill or by stride lengthening.\nRisk factors.\nITBS is associated with various risk factors including training habits, anatomical abnormalities, or muscular imbalances:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMechanism.\nIliotibial band syndrome is one of the leading causes of lateral knee pain in runners. The iliotibial band is a thick band of fascia composing the tendon of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. It is located on the lateral aspect of the knee, extending from the outside of the pelvis, over the hip and knee, and inserting just below the knee. The band serves to stabilize the knee. It has been proposed that during activity such as running and cycling the iliotibial band slides back and forth over the lateral femoral epicondyle, which causes friction and inflammation of the band. It has also been suggested that symptoms are caused by impingement of the iliotibial band in the knee during 30 degree flexion, which is a position common in running and cycling. Additional proposed mechanisms causing the symptoms of ITBS include compression of the fat and soft tissues beneath the iliotibial band, and chronic iliotibial band bursitis.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis of iliotibial band syndrome is primarily based on history and physical exam findings, including tenderness at the lateral femoral epicondyle, where the iliotibial band passes over the bone.\nExam maneuvers.\nThere are several physical exam maneuvers used to test iliotibial band function and provoke symptoms diagnostic of ITBS. The Noble test is used to assess for iliotibial band disfuction, in which the examiner extends the patient's knee from the 90 degree position with pain over the lateral femoral epicondyle occurring at 30 degrees of flexion. Additional tests include the Ober test to detect iliotibial band contracture, where the patient lies on their side and the examiner attempts to abduct, extend, and then adduct the leg. A positive test occurs with inability to adduct the leg due to iliotibial band shortening. The Thomas test is used to detect excessive tightness of the iliotibial band. In this test the patient holds the unaffected leg to their chest while the examiner straightens and lowers the other leg to a horizontal position, inability to fully straighten and lower the leg indicates excessive band tightness.\nImaging.\nImaging studies are generally not needed for diagnosis of ITBS, as characteristic symptoms and physical exam findings are sufficient for diagnosis. However, in severe or persistent cases MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as rule out other causes of lateral knee pain. Ultrasonography may also be used to evaluate disease progression by measuring iliotibial band thickness.\nDifferential.\nOther conditions that may present with knee pain similar to ITBS that must be differentiated include a lateral meniscus tear, degenerative joint disease, tendinopathy of the biceps femoris, stress fracture, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and injury to the lateral collateral ligament.\nTreatment.\nWhile ITBS pain can be acute, the iliotibial band can be treated conservatively with rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) to reduce pain and inflammation, followed by stretching. Utilization of corticosteroid injections and the use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or topical NSAIDs on the painful area are possible treatments for ITB syndrome. Corticosteroid injections have been shown to decrease running pains significantly 7 days after the initial treatment. Similar results can be found with the use of anti-inflammatory medication, analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication, specifically. Physical therapy is an effective treatment modality, with the goal of stretching the iliotibial band, tensor fasciae latae, and gluteus medius. Other non-invasive treatments include modalities such as flexibility and strength training, neuromuscular/gait training, manual therapy, training volume reduction, myofascial release, or changes in running shoe.\u00a0 Muscular training of the gluteus maximus and hip external rotators is stressed highly as those muscles are associated with many of the risk factors of ITBS. For runners specifically, neuromuscular/gait training may be needed for success in muscular training interventions to ensure that those trained muscles are used properly in the mechanics of running. Strength training alone will not result in decrease in pain due to ITBS, however, gait training, on its own can result in running form modification that reduces the prevalence of risk factors.\nSurgery.\nSurgery treatments are utilized if several conservative approaches fail to produce results. 6 months of conservative treatments are generally used before surgical intervention. Surgery typically involves removal of a small piece of the iliotibial band to release excessive tension. Other procedures that have been utilized include resection of the iliotibial band bursa and z-lengthening. In the z-lengthening procedure, two horizontal incisions are made in the band and connected by a vertical incision, forming a z. The resulting sections are reattached together in a lengthened position, increasing the length of the band.\nPrognosis.\nITBS symptoms typically improve with treatment. An estimated 50-90% of patients have symptom resolution with 4-8 weeks of conservative treatment, while surgical patients also generally have good outcomes. Complications of ITBS include recurrence and exacerbation by return to activity following treatment, as well as possible progression to patellofemoral pain syndrome.\nEpidemiology.\nOccupation.\nITBS commonly affects athletes and has been reported in runners, cyclists, rowers, skiers, and triathletes, as well as basketball, soccer, and field hockey players.\nSignificant association between the diagnosis of ITBS and occupational background of the patients has been thoroughly determined. Occupations that require extensive use of the iliotibial band are more susceptible to developing ITBS due to a continuum of their iliotibial band repeatedly abrading against the lateral epicondyle prominence, thereby inducing an inflammatory response. Professional or amateur runners are at high clinical risk of ITBS, and there is a greater risk in those running long-distance. Study suggests ITBS alone makes up 12% of all running-related injuries and 1.6% to 12% of runners are affected by ITBS.\nThe relationship between ITBS and mortality/morbidity is claimed to be absent. A study showed that coordination variability did not vary significantly between runners with no injury and runners with ITBS. This result elucidates that the runner's ability to coordinate themselves toward direction of their intention (motor coordination) is not, or very minorly affected by the pain of ITBS.\nAdditionally, military trainee in marine boot camps displayed high incidence rate of ITBS. Varying incidence rate of 5.3\u201322% in basic training was reported in a case study. A report from the U.S. Marine Corps announces that running/overuse-related injuries accounted for &gt;12% of all injuries.\nStudies suggest that there is not a difference in ITBS incidence rate between patients of different race, gender, or age. However, there has been a claim that females are more prone to ITBS due to their anatomical differences in the pelvis and lower extremities. Males with a larger lateral epicondyle prominence may also be more susceptible to ITBS.\u00a0 Higher incidence rate of ITBS has been reported between the ages of 15 and 50, which generally includes most active athletes.\nOther professions that had noticeable association with ITBS include cyclists, heavy weightlifters, et cetera. One observational study discovered 24% of 254 cyclists were diagnosed with ITBS within 6 years. A study provided data that shows more than half (50%) of professional cyclists complain of knee pain. Additional studies have shown that ITBS makes up 15\u201324% of all overuse injuries in cyclists.\nHistory.\nITBS was originally described by Lieutenant Commander James W. Renne in 1975 after observing frequent lateral knee pain in recruits participating in intensive military training. He initially named the syndrome \"iliotibial band friction syndrome\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Generally recognized as the first international recording star, Caruso made around 250 commercially released recordings from 1902 to 1920.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEnrico Caruso was born in Naples in the via Santi Giovanni e Paolo n\u00b0 7 on 25 February 1873. He was baptised the next day in the adjacent Church of San Giovanni e Paolo. His parents originally came from Piedimonte d'Alife (now called Piedimonte Matese), in the Province of Caserta in Campania, Southern Italy.\nCaruso was the third of seven children and one of only three to survive infancy. For decades, it was widely reported that Caruso's parents had 21 children, 18 of whom died in infancy. However, based on genealogical research (amongst others conducted by Caruso family friend Guido D'Onofrio), biographers Pierre Key, Francis Robinson, and Enrico Caruso Jr. and Andrew Farkas, have proven this to be untrue. Caruso himself and his brother Giovanni may have been the source of the exaggerated number. Caruso's widow Dorothy also included the story in her best-selling memoir about her husband, published in 1945. She allegedly quoted the tenor, speaking of his mother, Anna Caruso (\"n\u00e9e\" Baldini): \"She had twenty-one children. Twenty boys and one girl \u2013 too many. I am number nineteen boy.\"\nThe Caruso family was poor, but not destitute. Marcellino Caruso, the tenor's father, was a mechanic and foundry worker. Initially, Marcellino thought his son should adopt the same trade, and at the age of 11, the boy was apprenticed to a mechanical engineer who constructed and maintained public water fountains. Whenever visiting Naples in future years, Caruso liked to point out a certain fountain that he had helped to install. Caruso later worked alongside his father at the Meuricoffre factory in Naples. At his mother's insistence, he also attended school for a time, receiving a basic education under the tutelage of a local priest. He learned to write in a handsome script and studied technical draftsmanship. At this time, he sang in a church choir, and his voice showed enough promise for him to contemplate a possible career in music.\nCaruso was encouraged in his early musical ambitions by his mother, who died in 1888. To help support his family, he worked as a street singer in Naples and performed at cafes and soir\u00e9es. In 1894, his progress as a paid entertainer was interrupted, however, by 45 days of compulsory military service, which was completed for him by his brother, Giovanni. Caruso resumed his vocal studies upon being discharged from the army.\nEarly career.\nOn 15 March 1895, Caruso made his professional stage debut at age 22, appearing at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples in the now-forgotten opera, \"L'Amico Francesco\", by the amateur composer Mario Morelli. A string of further engagements in provincial opera houses followed, and he received instruction from the conductor and voice teacher Vincenzo Lombardi that improved his high notes and polished his style. Three other prominent Neapolitan singers taught by Lombardi were the baritones Antonio Scotti and Pasquale Amato, both of whom would go on to partner Caruso at the Metropolitan Opera and the tenor Fernando De Lucia, who would also appear at the Met and later sing at Caruso's funeral.\nMoney continued to be in short supply for the young Caruso. One of his first publicity photographs, taken on a visit to Sicily in 1896, depicts him wearing a bedspread draped like a toga since his sole dress shirt was away being laundered.\nDuring the final few years of the 19th century, Caruso performed at a succession of theatres throughout Italy until 1900, when he was rewarded with a contract to sing at La Scala. His La Scala debut occurred on 26 December of that year in the part of Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\" with Arturo Toscanini conducting. Audiences in Monte Carlo, Warsaw and Buenos Aires also heard Caruso sing during this pivotal phase of his career and, in 1899\u20131900, he appeared before the Tsar and the Russian aristocracy at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow as part of a touring company of first-class Italian singers.\nThe first major operatic role that Caruso created was Federico in Francesco Cilea's \"L'arlesiana\" (1897); then he was Loris in Umberto Giordano's \"Fedora\" (1898) at the Teatro Lirico, Milan. At that same theatre, he created the role of Maurizio in Francesco Cilea's \"Adriana Lecouvreur\" (1902). Puccini considered casting the young Caruso in the role of Cavaradossi in \"Tosca\" at its premiere in January 1900, but ultimately chose the older, more established Emilio De Marchi instead. Caruso appeared in the role later that year and Puccini stated that Caruso sang the part better.\nIn February 1901, Caruso participated in a grand concert at La Scala organised by Toscanini to mark the recent death of Giuseppe Verdi. Among those who appeared with him at the concert were two other leading Italian tenors of the day, Francesco Tamagno (the creator of the protagonist's role in Verdi's \"Otello\") and Giuseppe Borgatti (the creator of the protagonist's role in Giordano's \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\"). In December 1901, Caruso made his debut at the San Carlo Opera House in Naples in \"L'Elisir d'Amore\" to a lukewarm reception; two weeks later, he appeared as Des Grieux in Massenet's \"Manon\" which was even more coolly received. The indifference of the audiences and harsh critical reviews in Caruso's native city hurt him deeply, and he vowed never again to sing there. He later said: \"I will never again come to Naples to sing; it will only be to eat a plate of spaghetti\". Caruso embarked on his last series of La Scala performances in March 1902, creating the principal tenor part of Federico Loewe in \"Germania\" by Alberto Franchetti.\nA month later, on 11 April, he was engaged by the British Gramophone Company to make his first series of recordings in Milan, for a fee of 100 pounds sterling. These ten records swiftly became best-sellers. Among other things, they helped spread 29-year-old Caruso's fame throughout the English-speaking world. The management of London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, signed him for a season of appearances in eight different operas ranging from Verdi's \"Aida\" to Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\". His successful debut at Covent Garden occurred on 14 May 1902, as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's \"Rigoletto\". Covent Garden's highest-paid diva, the Australian soprano Nellie Melba, partnered him as Gilda. They would sing together often during the early 1900s. In her memoirs, Melba praised Caruso's voice but considered him to be a less sophisticated musician and interpretive artist than Jean de Reszke, the Met's star tenor before Caruso.\nMetropolitan Opera.\nOn 23 November 1903, Caruso made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The gap between his London and New York engagements had been filled by a series of performances in Italy, Portugal and South America. Caruso's contract had been negotiated by his agent, the banker and impresario Pasquale Simonelli. Caruso's Met debut was in a new production of \"Rigoletto\" with Marcella Sembrich singing opposite him as Gilda. A few months later, Caruso began his lifelong association with the Victor Talking Machine Company. He made his first American records on 1 February 1904, having signed a lucrative financial deal with Victor. Thereafter, his recording career ran in concert with his Met career, each bolstering the other, until his death in 1921.\nIn 1904, Caruso purchased the Villa Bellosguardo, a palatial estate near Florence. The villa became his retreat from the pressures of the operatic stage and the grind of travel. Caruso's preferred address in New York City was a suite at Manhattan's Knickerbocker Hotel. Caruso commissioned the New York jewellers Tiffany &amp; Co. to strike a 24-carat gold medal adorned with the tenor's profile. He presented the medal in gratitude to Simonelli as a souvenir of his many well-remunerated performances at the Met.\nIn addition to his regular New York engagements, Caruso appeared in opera and gave occasional recitals in a large number of cities across the United States and Canada. He also continued to sing widely in South America and Europe, again appearing at Covent Garden in 1904\u201307 and 1913\u201314, and undertaking a tour of the UK, including Scotland, in 1909. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Caruso sang regularly in Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Belgium and Monaco. In 1909, Melba asked him to participate in her forthcoming tour of Australia, but he declined because of the distance and significant amount of travel time that such a trip would entail.\nCaruso and other members of the Metropolitan Opera visited San Francisco on tour in April 1906. The morning after an appearance as Don Jos\u00e9 in \"Carmen\" at the city's Grand Opera House, a strong jolt awakened Caruso at 5:13 AM on April 18th in his suite at the Palace Hotel. He found himself in the middle of the San Francisco earthquake, which led to a series of fires that destroyed most of the city. The Met lost all of the sets, costumes and musical instruments that had been brought on tour, but none of the company members were harmed. There are innumerable stories about Caruso's experience in the earthquake, many of them contradictory, some of them implausible, and it has become difficult to separate fact from fiction. Caruso grabbed his autographed photo of President Theodore Roosevelt and ran from the hotel into the street. Supposedly, he composed himself enough to walk to the St. Francis Hotel, where he ordered breakfast. Charlie Olson, the broiler cook, served the tenor bacon and eggs. The disaster apparently did not adversely effect Caruso's appetite, as he cleaned his plate and tipped Olson $2.50. Eventually, Caruso was successful in fleeing the burning city, first by boat and then by train, using his autographed photo of the President as a form of identification. \"Give me Vesuvius\" he said, when asked later about the experience. Caruso vowed never to return to San Francisco and he kept his word.\nIn November 1906, Caruso was arrested and charged with allegedly pinching the buttocks of a woman in the monkey house of New York's Central Park Zoo. Caruso claimed a monkey did the bottom-pinching. Although evidence was soon uncovered which proved Caruso had almost certainly been framed (the victim gave a false address, never appeared in court and knew the arresting officer who previously made similar charges against men in the monkey house), he was found guilty and fined ten dollars. The incident received extensive newspaper coverage, and some members of New York's opera-going high society were initially outraged. However, the affair was soon forgotten, and Caruso's popularity was unaffected. Caruso's fan base at the Met was not restricted, however, to the wealthy; he enjoyed an immense following among New York's half million Italian immigrants and middle classes, who eagerly paid to hear him sing and purchased his records.\nOn 10 December 1910, Caruso created the role of Dick Johnson in the world premiere of Puccini's \"La fanciulla del West\". The composer wrote the music for Johnson with Caruso's voice specifically in mind. Appearing with Caruso were two more of the Met's star singers, the Czech soprano Emmy Destinn and baritone Pasquale Amato. Arturo Toscanini, then the Met's principal conductor, presided in the orchestra pit. David Belasco, author of the original play and Puccini himself were both on hand to personally supervise the production.\nExtortion by Black Hand.\nCaruso's immense popularity drew the attention of New York's Black Hand extortionists. They threatened to harm him and his family, or injure his throat with lye if he did not pay them $2000 (US $65,000 in 2025). The tenor promptly paid their extortion fee and expected the matter to be closed, but his willingness to pay made them regard him as an easy mark. They subsequently demanded an even larger sum of $15,000 (US $489,000 in 2025) Caruso had no intention of paying a second time and he contacted the police. He was aided by New York City police detective Joseph Petrosino who, impersonating Caruso, captured the extortionists. Two Italian men, Antonio Misiano and Antonio Cincotto, would be later specifically accused of the crime.\nLater career and personal life.\nAs he aged, the timbre of Caruso's voice gradually darkened and by 1916, he began adding dramatic tenor parts such as Samson, John of Leyden, and El\u00e9azar to his repertoire, while still singing lyric tenor roles such as Nemorino and Lionello. During 1915 and again in 1917, Caruso toured South America, with performances in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. He performed in Mexico City in 1919, where he sang operatic performances in a bullring. In the spring of 1920, Caruso traveled to Havana, Cuba where he was paid the enormous sum of US $10,000 a night (US$ in 2024). \nIn 1917, the United States entered the First World War. Caruso did extensive patriotic charity work during the conflict, raising money for many war-related causes by giving concerts and participating enthusiastically in Liberty Bond drives. Caruso had shown himself to be a shrewd businessman since arriving in America. He put a sizable proportion of his earnings from record royalties and singing fees into a range of investments. Biographer Michael Scott writes that by the end of the war in 1918, Caruso's annual income tax bill amounted to $154,000 (US$ in 2024).\nFrom 1897 to 1908, Caruso had been romantically linked to an Italian soprano, Ada Giachetti. Although she was already married (there was no divorce in Italy at that time), Giachetti bore Caruso four sons during their liaison, two of which survived infancy: Rodolfo Caruso (1898\u20131951) and singer/actor Enrico Caruso Jr. (1904\u20131987). Giachetti had left her husband, manufacturer Gino Botti, and an existing son to cohabit with the tenor. Information provided in Scott's biography of Caruso suggests that she was Caruso's vocal coach as well as his lover. Statements by Enrico Caruso Jr. in his book tend to substantiate this. Caruso and Giachetti separated in 1908, after she began a love affair with Cesare Romati, the tenor's chauffeur. Giachetti's subsequent attempts to sue Caruso for damages were dismissed by the courts.\nIn 1917, Caruso met and courted a 25-year-old socialite, Dorothy Park Benjamin (1893\u20131955). She was the daughter of Park Benjamin, a wealthy New York patent lawyer and author. In spite of the disapproval of Dorothy's father, the couple wed on 20 August 1918. They had a daughter, Gloria Caruso (1919\u20131999). Dorothy wrote two biographies of Caruso, published in 1928 and 1945; the latter book, which includes many of Caruso's letters to his wife, was a best-seller and served as the basis for the screenplay of the biographical motion picture \"The Great Caruso\" (1951), starring tenor Mario Lanza as Caruso.\nA fastidious dresser, Caruso took at least two baths a day and enjoyed good food and convivial company. He forged a particularly close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti\u00a0\u2013 an amiable and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was very superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms with him when he sang. He often played cards for relaxation, especially the games, \"Scopa\" and \"Bazzica\". An expert caricaturist, he made countless sketches of himself, friends, singers, musicians and even strangers. His wife, Dorothy, said that by the time she knew him, her husband's favourite hobby was compiling scrapbooks of his caricatures and reviews of his singing. He also amassed valuable collections of rare coins, postage stamps, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong Egyptian cigarettes. This deleterious habit, combined with a lack of exercise and the punishing schedule of performances that Caruso willingly undertook at the Met each season (Incredibly, he sang as often as 7 times a week) may have contributed to the persistent ill-health which plagued him the last year of his life.\nIllness and death.\nOn 16 September 1920, Caruso concluded three days of recording sessions at the Trinity Church studio of the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. Among the several discs recorded were the \"Domine Deus\" and \"Crucifixus\" from the \"Petite messe solennelle\" by Rossini. These were the final recordings he made.\nDorothy Caruso noted that her husband's health began to decline during the autumn of 1920, just before he undertook an extensive North American concert tour. In his Father's biography, Enrico Caruso Jr. points to an on-stage injury suffered by Caruso as the possible trigger of his fatal illness. A scenery malfunction during a performance of Saint-Sa\u00ebns' \"Samson and Delilah\" at the Met on 3 December caused a decorative pillar to fall and hit him on the back, over the left kidney (and not on the chest as often reported). A few days before a performance of \"Pagliacci\" at the Met (Pierre Key says it was 4 December, the day after the \"Samson and Delilah\" injury) he suffered a chill and developed a cough and a \"dull pain in his side\" near the area he had been struck by the pillar. It was initially believed to be a severe episode of bronchitis. Caruso's controversial physician, Dr. Philip Horowitz, who gave the tenor questionable treatments for migraine headaches and other ailments, diagnosed \"intercostal neuralgia\" and pronounced Caruso fit to appear on stage, although the pain steadily worsened and began to hinder his movements and voice production. Dr. Horowitz was later discharged by Dorothy.\nOn 11 December 1920, during a performance of \"L'elisir d'amore\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Caruso began spitting blood as a result of a mouth or throat haemorrhage and the performance was cancelled after the first act. Following this incident, an ailing Caruso sang two more performances (in \"La Forza del Destino\" and \"Samson and Dalilah\") and cancelled another (\"L'elisir d'amore\") at the Met before his appearance on Christmas Eve. On 24 December 1920, Caruso sang the final performance of his career in Hal\u00e9vy's \"La Juive\" while suffering acute pain. Upon returning home after the performance, Dorothy was shocked by the colour of his complexion which was described as \"a curious greyish-green\". By Christmas Day, the pain in Caruso's side had become so excruciating that he began to scream. Dorothy summoned the hotel physician, who gave Caruso some morphine and codeine and called in another doctor, Evan M. Evans. Evans brought in three other doctors, and Caruso finally received a correct diagnosis: pleurisy and pneumonia.\nCaruso lingered between life and death during the early weeks of 1921. He lapsed into a coma and at one point, nearly succumbed to heart failure. He continued to experience episodes of severe pain due to the infection and underwent a total of seven surgical procedures to drain fluid and pus from his chest cavity. The most serious of these operations occurred on 12 February, which required the removal of part of a rib. After a blood transfusion and two final surgeries in March, Caruso's condition slowly began to improve, and by late May he had recovered sufficiently to sail to Italy to further recuperate. According to Dorothy, while in Naples and Sorrento, he appeared to be proceeding with his convalescence and had regained about 25 pounds, but in late July, the tenor's fever returned and his condition began to deteriorate dramatically after that (it is believed that an unhygienic elderly doctor examined Caruso using an unsterilized instrument which may have caused the final infection). The Bastianelli brothers, eminent Italian medical practitioners, examined Caruso and recommended that his left kidney be removed. On the morning of 1 August, Caruso and his entourage left Sorrento for the Bastianelli's clinic in Rome, but by the time they reached Naples, Caruso was running a high fever and was gravely ill. The party checked into the Hotel Vesuvio, where Caruso was immediately put to bed; suddenly, he began screaming in pain. Dorothy began a frantic search for a doctor, but most had left the city for the summer. After several hours, a doctor was finally located; he injected Caruso with morphine to help him sleep.\nCaruso died the following morning at the Hotel Vesuvio shortly after 9:00\u00a0a.m. local time, on 2 August 1921. He was 48 years old. Although no post-mortem examination was performed, the Bastianellis attributed the cause of Caruso's death to peritonitis, arising from a burst subphrenic abscess. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, opened the Royal Basilica of the Church of San Francesco di Paola for Caruso's funeral, which was attended by thousands of people. Caruso was entombed at the Del Pianto cemetery in Naples; for several years, the singer's embalmed body was displayed in an open sarcophagus, covered by a sheet of glass, for visitors to view. Dorothy Caruso had never approved of this Italian custom but his family had insisted on it. In 1929, after appealing directly to the Italian government, she was finally successful in having the sarcophagus covered and the doors to the tomb locked.\nVoice and technique.\nCaruso's voice and his vocal technique are described in depth by his personal physician and voice specialist, Mario Marafioti. His book, \"Caruso's Method of Voice Production\" was published shortly after the singer's death.\nIn the book, Marafioti argues that there is a correct singing method grounded in science. While Marafioti calls Caruso's singing method \"natural\", he believes that the method is teachable. Marafioti characterises singing as basically \"speaking in musical rhythm \"and suggests that singers focus on developing their speaking voice, clear enunciation, and strong resonance.\nHistorical and musical significance.\nCaruso's career, which lasted from 1895 to 1920, included 863 appearances with the New York Metropolitan Opera (both at the Met and on tour) before his death in 1921 at the age of 48. Thanks largely to his tremendously popular phonograph records, Caruso was one of the most famous entertainment personalities of his day, and his fame has continued to endure to the present. He was one of the first examples of a global media celebrity. Beyond records, Caruso's name became familiar to millions throughout the world via newspapers, books, magazines, and the new media technology of the 20th century: cinema, the telephone, and telegraph.\nCaruso toured frequently with the Metropolitan Opera company and occasionally as a recitalist. He also appeared in opera performances throughout Europe and North and South America. He was a client of the noted promoter Edward Bernays during the latter's tenure as a press agent in the United States. Beverly Sills noted in an interview: \"I was able to do it with television and radio and media and all kinds of assists. The popularity that Caruso enjoyed without any of this technological assistance is astonishing.\"\nCaruso biographers, including Pierre Key, Bruno Zirato and Stanley Jackson attribute Caruso's fame not only to his voice and musicianship but also to a keen business sense and an enthusiastic reception of commercial sound recording, then in its infancy. Many opera singers of Caruso's time rejected the phonograph (or gramophone), regarding it as a toy or novelty. Others, including Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno and Nellie Melba, embraced the new technology once they became aware of the lucrative financial returns that Caruso was reaping from his initial recording sessions.\nFrom 1904 to 1920, Caruso made more than 260 extant recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). Caruso and his heirs earned millions of dollars in royalty payments from the retail sales of these records. He was also heard live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House in 1910 when he participated in the first public radio broadcast to be transmitted in the United States.\nCaruso also appeared in two motion pictures. In 1918, he played a dual role in the American silent film \"My Cousin\" (entirely restored in July 2021) for Paramount Pictures. This film included a sequence depicting him on stage performing the aria \"Vesti la giubba\" from Leoncavallo's opera \"Pagliacci\". The following year, Caruso played a character called Cosimo in another film, \"The Splendid Romance\". Producer Jesse Lasky paid Caruso $100,000 (US$ in 2024) each to appear in these two efforts but \"My Cousin\" flopped at the box office, and \"The Splendid Romance\" was apparently never released in the United States. Brief candid glimpses of Caruso offstage have been preserved in contemporary newsreel footage.\nWhile Caruso sang at such venues as La Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House, in London, the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, and the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, he appeared most often at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where he was the leading tenor for 18 consecutive seasons. It was at the Met, in 1910, that he created the role of Dick Johnson in Giacomo Puccini's \"La fanciulla del West\".\nCaruso's voice extended up to high D-flat in its prime and grew in power and weight as he grew older. At times, his voice took on a dark, almost baritonal colouration. He sang a broad spectrum of roles, ranging from lyric, to spinto, to dramatic parts, in the Italian and French repertoires. In the German repertoire, Caruso sang only two roles, Assad in Karl Goldmark's \"The Queen of Sheba\" and Richard Wagner's \"Lohengrin\", both of which he performed in Italian in Buenos Aires in 1899 and 1901, respectively.\nHonors and recognitions.\nDuring his lifetime, Caruso was the recipient of numerous orders, decorations, testimonials and other kinds of honors from monarchs, governments and miscellaneous cultural bodies of the various nations and cities in which he sang. He was also the recipient of Italian knighthoods. In 1917, he was elected an honorary member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men involved in music, by the fraternity's Alpha chapter of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. According to Dorothy Caruso, an unusual award bestowed on him in 1918 of \"Honorary Captain of the New York Police Force\", pleased him more than any of the other decorations he received. In 1960, for his contribution to the recording industry, Caruso received a star located at 6625 Hollywood Boulevard on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1987, Caruso was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. On 27 February of that same year, the United States Postal Service issued a 22-cent postage stamp with his likeness in his honour. He was voted into \"Gramophone\"'s Hall of Fame in 2012.\nRepertoire.\nCaruso's repertoire consisted primarily of Italian opera, along with a handful of roles in French. He also performed two German operas, Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" and Goldmark's \"Die K\u00f6nigin von Saba\", singing in Italian, early in his career. Below are the first performances by Caruso, in chronological order, of each of the operas that he undertook on the stage. World premieres are indicated with **.\nCaruso also had a repertoire of more than 500 songs. They ranged from classical compositions to traditional Italian melodies and popular tunes of the day, including a few English-language titles such as George M. Cohan's \"Over There\", Henry Geehl's \"For You Alone\" and Arthur Sullivan's \"The Lost Chord\".\nRecorded Legacy.\nEnrico Caruso died in 1921, before the advent of electrical recording technology in 1925. His entire recorded output was made using the acoustic process, which required the performer to sing into a metal horn or funnel; the sound was relayed directly onto a wax master disc, using a stylus. This antiquated process captured a limited range of the overtones and nuances present in a singing voice. Caruso's 12-inch disc records were limited to a maximum playing time of approximately four and one-half minutes; consequently, most of the operatic selections that he recorded were limited to that duration or those which could be edited to fit this time constraint. Occasionally, longer excerpts were issued on two or more record sides.\nCaruso is generally acknowledged as the record industry's first major recording star. He possessed a phonogenic voice which was \"manly and powerful, yet sweet and lyrical\", to quote the singer/author John Potter (see bibliography below). Caruso and the disc phonograph (known in the United Kingdom as the gramophone) did much to promote each other during the first two decades of the 20th century. During his lifetime, Caruso earned more in royalties from the sales of his recordings than he did from his operatic appearances. From 1902 to 1921, Caruso's record royalties amounted to more than two million dollars (nearly $36 million in 2025). Many of Caruso's recordings have remained continuously available since their original release over a century ago. All of his surviving recordings (including several which were long unissued) have been remastered and reissued several times over the years. Although some recordings of complete operas had been undertaken during the early 1900s, Caruso never participated in a complete opera recording. He did, however, take part in a series of recordings for Victor of excerpts from Gounod's \"Faust\" with a unified cast featuring Geraldine Farrar, Marcel Journet, Antonio Scotti and Louise Homer.\nCaruso's first recordings were arranged by recording pioneer Fred Gaisberg and cut on disc in three separate sessions in Milan during April, November and December 1902. They were made with piano accompaniments for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company Limited, forerunner of EMI Records. In April 1903, Caruso made seven further recordings, also in Milan, for the Anglo-Italian Commerce Company (AICC). These were originally released on discs bearing the Zonophone label. Three more Milan recordings for AICC followed in October 1903, released by Path\u00e9 Records on cylinders as well as on discs. On 1 February 1904, Caruso made his first recordings in the United States for the Victor Talking Machine Company. With the exception of one final recording for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company in April, 1904, Caruso thereafter recorded exclusively for Victor. The tenor's American recordings were all made in Victor's studios in New York and its headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Some of Caruso's later recordings were made in Victor's Trinity Church studio in Camden, which Victor acquired in 1917 for its acoustical properties and could accommodate larger bands of musicians. Caruso's first Victor recordings in 1904 were made in Room 826, a small vocal studio located in Carnegie Hall in New York. \"Questa o quella\" and \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" from Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" were the first selections to be recorded. Caruso's final recording session took place on 16 September 1920 in Camden at Victor's Trinity Church studio, with the tenor singing the \"Domine Deus\" and \"Crucifixus\" from Rossini's \"Petite messe solennelle\".\nCaruso's earliest Victor records of operatic arias from 1904 and 1905, like their thirty or so Milan-made predecessors, were all piano-accompanied. Beginning on 11 February 1906, orchestral accompaniments became the norm, utilising an ensemble of between eleven and twenty musicians. The regular conductors of these recording sessions with the Victor Orchestra were Walter B. Rogers and, from 1916, Josef Pasternack. Beginning in 1932, RCA Victor in the USA and EMI (His Master's Voice) in the UK, reissued several of the Caruso discs with the original accompaniment over-dubbed by a larger electrically recorded orchestra. Earlier experiments using this re-dubbing technique by Victor in 1927 had been considered unsatisfactory. Although these overdubbed Caruso recordings were initially praised by some critics upon their original release in the 1930s, they are largely forgotten and vilified by collectors today. In 1947, RCA Victor began to reissue a number of the tenor's recordings on 78-rpm discs pressed on red vinylite instead of the usual shellac. In 1950, RCA Victor began issuing long-playing records (LPs) and many of Caruso's recordings were enhanced with the addition of electronic reverb, bass and treble to give them a \"fuller\" sound for release on the extended format. RCA Victor issued its first Caruso LP collections in 1951; most of these early LP compilations were simultaneously released on the new 45-rpm format, introduced by RCA Victor in 1949. In 1956, RCA Victor issued a limited edition 3 LP Caruso anthology in a deluxe album with an illustrated booklet. By 1959, RCA Victor had reissued more than half of their Caruso catalogue on LP records. Several more collections of Caruso recordings previously unavailable on LP were released by RCA Victor throughout the 1960s. In 1973, to mark the centennial year of Caruso's birth, the label issued a 4-record boxed set containing the tenor's remaining recordings not previously transferred to LP, including some unpublished items. In Italy that year, RCA Italiana released a comprehensive 12 LP boxed set containing the majority of Caruso's Victor recordings.\nDuring the 1970s, Thomas G. Stockham of the University of Utah developed an early computer reprocessing technique called \"Soundstream\" to remaster Caruso's recordings for RCA. This digital recording process claimed to remove or reduce some of the undesirable resonances, distortion and surface noise typical of the early acoustically recorded shellac discs (critics of Stockham's process later claimed that the only \"reprocessing\" the recordings received was merely \"re-equalisation\" by increasing bass and reducing treble). In 1976, RCA released an LP collection of sixteen of Caruso's most popular opera arias utilising Soundstream's computer process. From 1978 to 1985, RCA issued \"The Complete Caruso\" LP series, containing the Soundstream digitised recordings (after the introduction of the compact disc in the early 1980s, RCA never finished \"The Complete Caruso\" series on LP and the tenor's European and 1904-05 Victor recordings were never remastered using the Soundstream process). RCA released its first Caruso compact disc, a collection of 21 operatic arias, in 1987. Finally, in 1990, RCA Victor issued \"The Complete Caruso\" boxed set on 12 CDs (the recordings were repackaged and reissued by RCA again in 2004 and (minus the pre-Victor recordings) for a third time, in 2017). Other complete sets of Caruso's recordings in new remasterings were issued on CD on the Pearl label and in 2000\u20132004 by Naxos. The Pearl and Naxos sets were remastered by the noted American audio-restoration engineer Ward Marston. In 1993, Pearl also released a two-CD collection devoted to RCA and EMI's electrically overdubbed versions of some of Caruso's original acoustic discs, originally issued in the 1930s. Since 1999, RCA Victor has issued three CDs of Caruso recordings with digitally recorded overdubbed orchestral accompaniments. Since the expiration of their original copyrights, Caruso's records are now in the public domain in the United States and have been reissued by several different record labels with varying degrees of sound quality. They are also available over the internet as digital downloads. Caruso's best-selling downloads at iTunes have been the popular Italian folk songs \"Santa Lucia\" and \"\".\nIn addition to operatic arias, Caruso recorded many duets and ensembles with several noted opera stars of the period, including Frances Alda, Mario Ancona, Pasquale Amato, Angelo Bad\u00e0, Giuseppe De Luca, Maria Duch\u00eane, Emmy Destinn, Geraldine Farrar, Johanna Gadski, Frieda Hempel, Amelita Galli-Curci, Alma Gluck, Frieda Hempel, Louise Homer, Marcel Journet, Flora Perini, L\u00e9on Rothier, Titta Ruffo, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Antonio Scotti, Marcella Sembrich and Luisa Tetrazzini.\nMedia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps://"}
{"id": "67893", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67893", "title": "Arc lamp", "text": "Lamp that produces light by an electric arc\nAn arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc (also called a voltaic arc).\nThe carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for most of these purposes, but it is still used as a source of high intensity ultraviolet light.\nThe term is now used for gas discharge lamps, which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through a gas in a glass bulb. The common fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure mercury arc lamp. The xenon arc lamp, which produces a high intensity white light, is now used in many of the applications which formerly used the carbon arc, such as movie projectors and searchlights.\nOperation.\nAn \"arc\" is the discharge that occurs when a gas is ionized. A high voltage is pulsed across the lamp to \"ignite\" or \"strike\" the arc, after which the discharge can be maintained at a lower voltage. The \"strike\" requires an electrical circuit with an \"igniter\" and a ballast. The ballast is wired in series with the lamp and performs two functions.\nWhen the power is first switched on, the igniter/starter (which is wired in parallel across the lamp) sets up a small current through the ballast and starter. This creates a small magnetic field within the ballast windings. A moment later the starter interrupts the current flow from the ballast, which has a high inductance and therefore tries to maintain the current flow (the ballast opposes any change in current through it); it cannot, as there is no longer a 'circuit'. As a result, a high voltage appears across the ballast momentarily, to which the lamp is connected; therefore the lamp receives this high voltage across it which 'strikes' the arc within the tube/lamp. The circuit will repeat this action until the lamp is ionized enough to sustain the arc.\nWhen the lamp sustains the arc, the ballast performs its second function, to limit the current to that needed to operate the lamp. The lamp, ballast, and igniter are rating-matched to each other; these parts must be replaced with the same rating as the failed component or the lamp will not work.\nThe colour of the light emitted by the lamp changes as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Lightning is a similar principle where the atmosphere is ionized by the high potential difference (voltage) between earth and storm clouds.\nThe temperature of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose their power supply, one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes (called cold restrike lamps). However, some lamps (mainly fluorescent tubes/energy saving lamps) can be restruck as soon as they are turned off (called hot restrike lamps).\nThe Vortek water-wall plasma arc lamp, invented in 1975 by David Camm and Roy Nodwell at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1986 and 1993 as the most powerful continuously burning light source at over 300\u00a0kW or 1.2 million candle power.\nCarbon arc lamp.\nIn a carbon arc lamp, the electrodes are carbon rods in free air. To ignite the lamp, the rods are touched together, thus allowing a relatively low voltage to strike the arc. The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the carbon rods are heated and the carbon vaporizes. The rods are slowly burnt away in use, and the distance between them needs to be regularly adjusted in order to maintain the arc.\nMany ingenious mechanisms were invented to control the distance automatically, mostly based on solenoids. In one of the simplest mechanically-regulated forms (which was soon superseded by more smoothly acting devices) the electrodes are mounted vertically. The current supplying the arc is passed in series through a solenoid attached to the top electrode. If the points of the electrodes are touching (as in start up) the resistance falls, the current increases and the increased pull from the solenoid draws the points apart. If the arc starts to fail the current drops and the points close again.\nThe Yablochkov candle is a simple arc lamp without a regulator, but it has the drawback that the arc cannot be restarted (single use) and a limited lifetime of only a few hours.\nSpectrum.\nThe spectrum emitted by a carbon-arc lamp is the closest to that of sunlight of any lamp. One of the first electric lights, their harsh, intense output usually limited their use to lighting large areas. Although invisible wavelengths were unknown at the time of their invention, unenclosed lamps were soon discovered to produce large amounts of infrared and harmful ultraviolet radiation not found in sunlight. If the arc was encased in a glass globe, it was found that many of these invisible rays could be blocked. However, carbon-arcs were soon displaced by safer, more efficient, versatile, and easier to maintain incandescent and gas-discharge lamps. Carbon-arc lamps are still used where a close approximation of sunlight is needed, for testing materials, paints, and coatings for wear, fading, or deterioration, or, for example, spacecraft materials that are to be exposed to sunlight at orbits closer than Earth's.\nThe arc consists of pure carbon-vapor heated to a plasma state. However, the arc contributes very little of the light output, and is considered non-luminous, as most of its emission occurs in spectral lines in the violet and UV portions of the spectrum. Most of the carbon spectra occurs in a very broad line centered at 389 nm (UV-A, just outside the visual spectrum), and a very narrow line at 250 nm (UV-B), plus some other less-powerful lines in the UV-C. \nMost of the visible and IR radiation is produced from incandescence created at the positive electrode, or anode. Unlike the tungsten anodes found in other arc lamps, which remain relatively cool, carbon produces much higher resistance and the electrons are forced to enter the anode at the hottest point, generating tremendous amounts of heat that vaporizes the carbon and creates a pit in the anode's surface. This pit is heated from 6000 to 6500 degrees Fahrenheit (3300 to 3600 degrees Celsius, just below its melting point), causing it to glow very brightly with incandescence. Due to this, the electrodes were often placed at right angles from each other with the anode facing outward to keep from blocking its light output. Since carbon has the highest melting point of any element, it is the only lamp whose blackbody radiation is capable of nearly matching the Sun's temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5500 degrees Celsius), especially when filters are used to remove most of the IR and UV light.\nHistory.\nThe concept of carbon-arc lighting was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in the early 19th century, but sources disagree about the year he first demonstrated it; 1802, 1805, 1807 and 1809 are all mentioned. Davy used charcoal sticks and a two-thousand-cell battery to create an arc across a gap. He mounted his electrodes horizontally and noted that, because of the strong convection flow of air, the arc formed the shape of an arch. He coined the term \"arch lamp\", which was contracted to \"arc lamp\" when the devices came into common usage.\nIn the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for \"The Electrician\", explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\".\nThe arc lamp provided one of the first commercial uses for electricity, a phenomenon previously confined to experiment, the telegraph, and entertainment.\nCarbon-arc lighting in the U.S..\nIn the United States, there were attempts to produce arc lamps commercially after 1850, but the lack of a constant electricity supply thwarted efforts. Thus electrical engineers began focusing on the problem of improving Faraday's dynamo. The concept was improved upon by a number of people including William Edwards Staite and Charles F. Brush. It was not until the 1870s that lamps such as the Yablochkov candle were more commonly seen. In 1877, the Franklin Institute conducted a comparative test of dynamo systems. The one developed by Brush performed best, and Brush immediately applied his improved dynamo to arc-lighting, an early application being Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Despite this, Wabash, Indiana claims to be the first city ever to be lit with \"Brush Lights\". Four of these lights became active there on March 31, 1880. Wabash was a small enough city to be lit entirely by 4 lights, whereas the installation at Cleveland's Public Square only lit a portion of that larger city. In 1880, Brush established the Brush Electric Company.\nThe harsh and brilliant light was found most suitable for public areas, such as Cleveland's Public Square, being around 200 times more powerful than contemporary filament lamps.\nThe usage of Brush electric arc lights spread quickly. \"Scientific American\" reported in 1881 that the system was being used in:\n800 lights in rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 lights in woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 lights in large stores, hotels, churches, 250 lights in parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 lights in railroad depots and shops, 130 lights in mines, smelting works, 380 lights in factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 lights in lighting stations, for city lighting, 1,200 lights in England and other foreign countries.\nA total of over 6,000 lights were actually sold.\nThere were three major advances in the 1880s: Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u017e\u00edk invented in 1880 a mechanism to allow the automatic adjustment of the electrodes. The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption (increasing the life span to around 100 hours). \"Flame arc lamps\" were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts (usually magnesium, strontium, barium, or calcium fluorides) added to increase light output and produce different colours.\nIn the U.S., patent protection of arc-lighting systems and improved dynamos proved difficult and as a result the arc-lighting industry became highly competitive. Brush's principal competition was from the team of Elihu Thomson and Edwin J. Houston. These two had formed the American Electric Corporation in 1880, but it was soon bought up by Charles A. Coffin, moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, and renamed the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. Thomson remained, though, the principal inventive genius behind the company patenting improvements to the lighting system. Under the leadership of Thomson-Houston's patent attorney, Frederick P. Fish, the company protected its new patent rights. Coffin's management also led the company towards an aggressive policy of buy-outs and mergers with competitors. Both strategies reduced competition in the electrical lighting manufacturing industry. By 1890, the Thomson-Houston company was the dominant electrical manufacturing company in the U.S. \nAround the turn of the century arc-lighting systems were in decline, but Thomson-Houston controlled key patents to urban lighting systems. This control slowed the expansion of incandescent lighting systems being developed by Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company. Conversely, Edison's control of direct current distribution and generating machinery patents blocked further expansion of Thomson-Houston. The roadblock to expansion was removed when the two companies merged in 1892 to form the General Electric Company.\nArc lamps were used in some early motion-picture studios to illuminate interior shots. One problem was that they produce such a high level of ultra-violet light that many actors needed to wear sunglasses when off camera to relieve sore eyes resulting from the ultra-violet light. The problem was solved by adding a sheet of ordinary window glass in front of the lamp, blocking the ultra-violet. By the dawn of the \"talkies\", arc lamps had been replaced in film studios with other types of lights. In 1915, Elmer Ambrose Sperry began manufacturing his invention of a high-intensity carbon arc searchlight. These were used aboard warships of all navies during the 20th century for signaling and illuminating enemies. In the 1920s, carbon arc lamps were sold as family health products, a substitute for natural sunlight.\nArc lamps were superseded by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche applications such as cinema projection, spotlights, and searchlights. In the 1950s and 1960s the high-power D.C. for the carbon-arc lamp of an outdoor drive-in projector would typically be supplied by a motor\u2013generator combo (AC motor powering a DC generator). Even in these applications conventional carbon-arc lamps were mostly pushed into obsolescence by xenon arc lamps, but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured for at least one purpose \u2013 simulating sunlight in \"accelerated aging\" machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.\nCarbon arc lighting left its imprint on other film projection practices. The practice of shipping and projecting motion pictures on 2,000-foot reels, and employing \"changeovers\" between two projectors, was due to the carbon rods used in projector lamphouses having a lifespan of roughly 22 minutes (which corresponds to the amount of film in said reels when projected at 24 frames/second). The projectionist would watch the rod burn down by eye (though a peephole like a welder's glass) and replace the carbon rod when changing film reels. The two-projector changeover setup largely disappeared in the 1970s with the advent of xenon projector lamps, being replaced with single-projector platter systems, though films would continue to be shipped to cinemas on 2,000-foot reels.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67896", "revid": "50404588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67896", "title": "Space tourism", "text": "Human space travel for recreation\nSpace tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. Tourists are motivated by the possibility of viewing Earth from space, feeling weightlessness, experiencing extremely high speed and something unusual, and contributing to science.\nSpace tourism started in April 2001, when American businessman and engineer Dennis Tito became the first ever space tourist to travel to space aboard a Soyuz-TM32 spacecraft. During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, brokered by American company Space Adventures in conjunction with Roscosmos and RSC Energia. Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006. The publicized price was in the range of US$20\u201325 million per trip. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.\nSpace tourists need to be in good physical form before going to space. In particular, they have to train for fast acceleration or g-forces in a centrifuge and weightlessness by flying in a high-altitude jet plane doing parabolic arcs. They may have to learn how to operate and even fix parts of the spaceship using simulators.\nRussia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants. Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the planned flight was postponed indefinitely. Russian orbital tourism eventually resumed with the launch of Soyuz MS-20 in 2021.\nOn June 7, 2019, NASA announced that starting in 2020, the organization aims to start allowing private astronauts to go on the International Space Station, with the use of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Boeing Starliner spacecraft for public astronauts, which is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one astronaut, and an estimated 50 million USD for the ride there and back.\nWork also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. SpaceX announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship, however the project was cancelled on June 1, 2024.\nPrecursors.\nThe Soviet space program was successful in broadening the pool of cosmonauts. The Soviet Intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) also took advantage of the program.\nThe US Space Shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional NASA astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, Ulf Merbold from the ESA and Byron Lichtenberg from MIT (engineer and Air Force fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the Space Shuttle, on mission STS-9.\nIn 1984, Charles D. Walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer McDonnell Douglas paying US$40,000 () for his flight. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International studied a $200\u2013300\u00a0million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the National Space Society stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 million to $1.5\u00a0million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years, 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 () each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.\nAs the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe was chosen as the first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the \"Challenger\" disaster in January 1986, the programs were cancelled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the Space Shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was cancelled in the wake of the \"Columbia\" disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the Space Shuttle.\nInitially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principle; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it was not interested in accommodating paying guests. The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science of the House of Representatives held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing's purpose: \"Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism.\" The subcommittee report was interested in evaluating Dennis Tito's extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.\nWith the realities of the post-Perestroika economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to \"Mir\" with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10\u00a0million up to $37\u00a0million. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies.\nIn 1991, British chemist Helen Sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space. The program was known as Project Juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the Soviet Union and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost cancelled. Reportedly Mikhail Gorbachev ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 to \"Mir\" and returned aboard Soyuz TM-11.\nIn April 1999, the Russian space agency announced that 51-year-old British billionaire Peter Llewellyn would be sent to the aging Mir space station in return for a payment of $100 million by Llewellyn. Llewellyn, however, denied agreeing to pay that sum, his refusal to pay which prompted his flight's cancellation a month later.\nOrbital space tourism.\nAs of 2021, Space Adventures and SpaceX are the only companies to have coordinated tourism flights to Earth's orbit. Virginia-based Space Adventures has worked with Russia to use its Soyuz spacecraft to fly ultra-wealthy individuals to the International Space Station. The tourists included entrepreneur and space investor Anousheh Ansari and Cirque du Soleil co-founder Guy Lalibert\u00e9. Those missions were priced at around $20 million each. The space industry could soon be headed for a tourism revolution if SpaceX and Boeing make good on their plans to take tourists to orbit.\nSuccessful projects.\nAt the end of the 1990s, MirCorp, a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit \"Mir\" in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. Dennis Tito, an American businessman and former JPL scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit \"Mir\", Tito managed to switch his trip to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft through a deal between MirCorp and US-based Space Adventures, Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in April\u2013May 2001, becoming the world's first \"fee-paying\" space tourist. Tito paid a reported $20 million for his trip.\nTito was followed in April 2002 by South African Mark Shuttleworth (Soyuz TM-34). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian Soyuz program was temporarily put on hold, because Soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle's return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. The third was Gregory Olsen in October 2005 (Soyuz TMA-7). In September 2006, an Iranian American businesswoman named Anousheh Ansari became the fourth space tourist (Soyuz TMA-9).) In April 2007, Charles Simonyi, an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks (Soyuz TMA-10). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on Soyuz TMA-14 in March 2009. British-American Richard Garriott became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard Soyuz TMA-13. Canadian Guy Lalibert\u00e9 visited the ISS in September 2009 aboard Soyuz TMA-16, becoming the last visiting tourist until Japanese nationals Yusaku Maezawa and Yozo Hirano aboard Soyuz MS-20 in December 2021. Originally the third member aboard Soyuz TMA-18M would have been the British singer Sarah Brightman as a space tourist, but on May 13, 2015, she announced she had withdrawn from training.\nSince the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold. On June 7, 2019, NASA announced a plan to open the ISS to space tourism again.\nOn September 16, 2021, the Inspiration4 mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and spent almost three days in orbit aboard the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\", becoming the first all-civilian crew to fly an orbital space mission.\nOn September 12, 2024, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis performed the first commercial spacewalk during the \"Polaris Dawn\" spaceflight operated by SpaceX.\nOn April 1, 2025, Fram2 became the first crewed spaceflight to enter a polar retrograde orbit, launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\nLegality.\nUnder the Outer Space Treaty signed in 1967, the launch operator's nationality and the launch site's location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.\nAfter valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the Outer Space Treaty dictates that \"outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means\". However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected for scientific purposes are property of that country when they return.\nUnited States.\nIn December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism. These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.\nIn 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act, which, among other things, encourages space commercialization (https://).\nUnder current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III. This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004, which required that NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to allow paying passengers fly on suborbital launch vehicles at their own risk.\nIn March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the \"death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities\". Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\nIn December 2021, the FAA announced that starting in 2022, it would recognize on its official website those who travel to space. \"Any individual who is on an FAA-licensed or permitted launch and reaches 50 statute miles above the surface of the Earth will be listed on the site.\" The announcement ended the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program, under which the FAA had offered commercial astronaut wings to individuals on private spacecraft who made it above 50 miles (80 kilometers) in altitude above Earth since 2004.\nLegal issues and challenges.\nWith the increasing advent of sub-orbital flights, there are growing concerns that the present international framework is insufficient to address the significant issues raised by space tourism. The concerns relate to commercial Liability, insurance, consumer protection, passenger safety, environmental impact, and emergency response.\nList of space tourism trips.\nThe following list notes each trip taken by an individual for whom a fee was paid (by themselves or another party) to go above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, the internationally recognized boundary of space at 100\u00a0km, or above the US definition of the boundary of space at 50 miles (80\u00a0km). It also includes future trips which are paid for and scheduled.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCriticism of the term \"space tourist\".\nMany private space travelers have objected to the term \"space tourist\", often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called \"private astronaut\" than \"tourist\". Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a \"pioneer of commercial space travel\". Gregory Olsen prefers \"private researcher\", and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term \"private space explorer\". Other advocates of private spaceflight object to the term on similar grounds. Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, for example, has said: \"I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck.\" Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe Guy Lalibert\u00e9 as a tourist: \"It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission.\"\n\"Spaceflight participant\" is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists Christa McAuliffe as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the STS-51-L flight.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of \"commercial astronaut\" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft.\nAttitudes towards space tourism.\nA 2018 survey from the PEW Research Center identifies the top three motivations for a customer to purchase a flight into space as:\nThe PEW study also found that only 43% of Americans would be definitely or probably interested in going into space. NASA astronaut Megan McArthur has a message to space tourists: spaceflight is uncomfortable and risky, and takes grit.\nA web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to two weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk, of whom 14% would pay a 50% premium for the experience, and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.\nThe concept has met with some criticism; G\u00fcnter Verheugen, vice-president of the European Commission, said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: \"It's only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions\".\nOn October 14, 2021, Prince William suggested that entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism and also warned about a rise in \"climate anxiety\" among younger generations.\nEnvironmental effects.\nA 2010 study published in \"Geophysical Research Letters\" raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry. This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between . The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5\u20136%. The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as \"a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type\", but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.\nA 2022 study estimated the air pollution impacts on climate change and the ozone layer from rocket launches and re-entry of reusable components and debris in 2019 and from a theoretical future space industry extrapolated from the \"billionaire space race\". It concludes that substantial effects from routine space tourism should \"motivate regulation\".&lt;ref name=\"10.1029/2021EF002612\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nEducation and advocacy.\nSeveral organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. \"UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine\" is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.\nClasses in space tourism are currently taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, and Keio University in Japan. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida launched a worldwide space tourism course in 2017.\nEconomic potential.\nA 2010 report from the Federal Aviation Administration, titled \"The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U.S. Economy in 2009\", cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years. Eight tourists reached orbit between 2001 and 2009. In 2011 Space Adventures suggested that this number could reach 140 by 2020, but with commercial crewed rockets only just beginning to enter service, such numbers have yet to be achieved.\nAccording to a 2022 report by Research and Markets, titled \"Global Space Tourism Market,\" the global space tourism industry is projected to reach US$8.67 billion by 2030, with an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.1% between 2022 and 2030.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The work reflects the creators' observations of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the late 1960s, and several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War movement. The musical's profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence for the American flag, and its nude scene caused controversy. The work broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of \"rock musical\", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a \"Be-In\" finale.\n\"Hair\" tells the story of the \"tribe\", a group of politically active, long-haired hippies of the \"Age of Aquarius\" living a bohemian life in New York City and fighting against conscription into the Vietnam War. Claude, his friend Berger, their roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives, loves and the sexual revolution with their rebellion against the war and their conservative parents and society. Ultimately, Claude must decide whether to resist the draft, as his friends have done, or serve in Vietnam, compromising his pacifist principles and risking his life.\nAfter an off-Broadway debut on October 17, 1967, at Joseph Papp's Public Theater, and a run at the Cheetah nightclub from December 1967 through January 1968, the show opened on Broadway in April 1968 and ran for 1,750 performances. Simultaneous productions in cities across the United States and Europe followed shortly thereafter, including a London production that ran for 1,997 performances. Since then, productions have been staged around the world, spawning dozens of recordings, including the 3 million-selling original Broadway cast recording. Some of the songs became Top 10 hits, and a feature film adaptation was released in 1979. A Broadway revival opened in 2009, earning strong reviews and winning the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Revival of a Musical. In 2008, Richard Zoglin wrote in \"Time\" that \"Today \"Hair\" seems, if anything, more daring than ever.\"\nHistory.\nActors James Rado and Gerome Ragni began writing \"Hair\" together in late 1964. The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert. Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical. Rado said, \"We were great friends. It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece. We put the drama between us on stage.\"\nRado described the inspiration for \"Hair\" as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\". He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\" Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited off the street. Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never \"experience\" it. We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" According to Rado's obituary in \"The New York Times\", the title was inspired by \"a painting of a tuft of hair by the Pop artist Jim Dine. Its title was \"Hair\".\"\nRado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition. He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg. Ragni was a member of The Open Theater, one of several groups that were developing experimental theatre techniques, including non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director and actor. By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and The Open Theatre were devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space rather than following a traditional script. Ragni introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater. In 1966, while the two were developing \"Hair\", Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play \"Viet Rock\", about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. \"Viet Rock\" employed the improvisational exercises being used in experimental theatre. Scenes were connected in \"prelogical ways\": a scene could be built from a tangent from the previous scene, in counterpoint to it, or connected psychologically. Actors switched roles in the middle of a show, in mid-scene, or played actors. Terry wrote, \"The ... transformations should be abrupt and total.\" \"Hair\" was designed in much the same way; the actors play different characters throughout the piece, and, as in Claude's psychedelic trip in Act 2, sometimes during the same scene. As in \"Viet Rock\", the actors frequently break the \"fourth wall\" to interact with the audience.\nRado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had already won two Grammy Awards for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Original Jazz Composition in 1961 for his \"African Waltz\" (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\" \"I never even heard of a hippie.\" But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. \"We work independently\", MacDermot said in May 1968. \"I prefer it that way. They hand me the material. I set it to music.\" MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song. He first wrote \"Aquarius\" as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it as an uplifting anthem.\nOff-Broadway productions.\nThe creators pitched the show to Broadway producers and received many rejections. Eventually Joe Papp, who ran the New York Shakespeare Festival, decided he wanted \"Hair\" to open the new Public Theater (still under construction) in New York City's East Village. \"Hair\" was the first work by living authors that Papp produced. The director, Gerald Freedman, the theater's associate artistic director, decided that Rado, at 35, was too old to play Claude, although he agreed to cast the 32-year-old Ragni as Berger. The production did not go smoothly: The rehearsal and casting process was confused, the material itself incomprehensible to many of the theater's staff. [Freedman] withdrew in frustration during the final week of rehearsals and offered his resignation. Papp accepted it, and the choreographer Anna Sokolow took over the show.\u00a0... After a disastrous final dress rehearsal, Papp wired Mr. Freedman in Washington, where he'd fled: \"Please come back.\" Mr. Freedman did.\n\"Hair\" premiered off-Broadway at the Public on October 17, 1967, and ran for six weeks. The lead roles were played by Walker Daniels as Claude, Ragni as Berger, Jill O'Hara as Sheila, Steve Dean as Woof, Arnold Wilkerson as Hud, Sally Eaton as Jeanie and Shelley Plimpton as Crissy. Set design was by Ming Cho Lee, costume design by Theoni Aldredge, and, although Anna Sokolow began rehearsals as choreographer, Freedman received choreographer credit. The production had a \"tepid critical reception\" but was popular with audiences. A cast album was released in 1967.\nChicago businessman Michael Butler was planning to run for the U.S. Senate on an antiwar platform. After seeing an ad for \"Hair\" in \"The New York Times\" that led him to believe the show was about Native Americans, he watched the Public's production several times and joined forces with Papp to reproduce the show at another New York venue after it closed at the Public. Papp and Butler first moved the show to The Cheetah discoth\u00e8que in midtown, where it opened on December 22, 1967, and ran for 45 performances. There was no nudity in either the Public Theater or Cheetah production.\nRevision for Broadway.\n\"Hair\" underwent a thorough overhaul between its closing at the Cheetah in January 1968 and its Broadway opening three months later. The off-Broadway book, already light on plot, was loosened even further and made more realistic. Thirteen new songs were added, including \"Let the Sun Shine In\", to make the ending more uplifting.\nBefore the move to Broadway, the creative team hired director Tom O'Horgan, who had built a reputation directing experimental theater at La MaMa E.T.C. He had been the authors' first choice to direct the Public Theater production, but he was in Europe at the time. \"Newsweek\" called O'Horgan's directing style \"sensual, savage, and thoroughly musical\u00a0... [he] disintegrates verbal structure and often breaks up and distributes narrative and even character among different actors.\u00a0... He enjoys sensory bombardment.\" O'Horgan and the writers rearranged scenes to increase the experimental aspects. In rehearsals, O'Horgan used techniques passed down by Viola Spolin and Paul Sills involving role playing and improvisational \"games\", many of which were incorporated into the Broadway script. O'Horgan and new choreographer Julie Arenal encouraged freedom and spontaneity in their actors, introducing \"an organic, expansive style of staging\" that had never been seen before on Broadway. The inspiration to include nudity came when the authors saw an antiwar demonstration in Central Park in which two men stripped naked as an expression of defiance and freedom. O'Horgan had used nudity in many of the plays he directed, and he helped integrate the idea into the fabric of the show.\nPapp declined to pursue a Broadway production, so Butler produced the show himself. For a time it seemed that he would be unable to secure a Broadway theater, as the Shuberts, Nederlanders and other theater owners deemed the material too controversial. But Butler had family connections and knew important people; he persuaded Biltmore Theatre owner David Cogan to make his venue available. The stage design was completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. The spare set was painted in shades of grey, with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast gathered from New York's streets, including a life-size papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 bus driver, a head of Jesus and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village. The costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture. Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell-bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red, white and blue fringed coat.\nSynopsis.\nAct I.\nClaude sits center stage as the \"tribe\" mingles with the audience. Tribe members Sheila, a New York University student and political activist, and Berger, an irreverent free spirit, cut a lock of Claude's hair and burn it. After the tribe converges in slow motion toward the stage, they begin their celebration as children of the Age of Aquarius (\"Aquarius\"). Berger removes his trousers to reveal a loincloth. Interacting with the audience, he introduces himself as a \"psychedelic teddy bear ... looking for my Donna\" (\"Donna\").\nThe tribe recites a list of pharmaceuticals, legal and illegal (\"Hashish\"). Woof, a gentle soul, extols sexual practices (\"Sodomy\"). He loves plants, his family and the audience, telling the audience, \"We are all one.\" Hud, a militant African-American, is carried in upside-down on a pole. He declares himself \"president of the United States of Love\" (\"Colored Spade\"). In a fake English accent, Claude says that he is \"the most beautiful beast in the forest\" from \"Manchester, England\". A tribe member reminds him that he's from Flushing, New York (\"Manchester England\"). Hud, Woof and Berger declare their color (\"I'm Black\"), while Claude counters that he is \"invisible\". The tribe rattles off a list of things they lack (\"Ain't Got No\"). African-American tribe members list street signs in symbolic sequence (\"Dead End\"). Sheila is carried onstage (\"I Believe in Love\") and leads the tribe in a protest chant. Jeanie, an eccentric young woman, appears wearing a gas mask because of pollution (\"Air\"). She is pregnant and in love with Claude, wishing it was Claude's baby, as she was \"knocked up by some crazy speed freak\". The tribe link LBJ, FBI, CIA and LSD (\"Initials\"). Members of the tribe appear dressed as Claude's parents, berating him for transgressions: he has no job and collects \"mountains of paper\" clippings and notes. They say they will not give him any more money, and \"the army'll make a man out of you\", presenting him with his draft notice. In defiance, Claude leads the tribe in celebrating their vitality (\"I Got Life\").\nBerger hands out imaginary pills to the tribe members, saying they are for high-profile people such as Richard Nixon, the Pope and \"Alabama Wallace\". He relates how he was expelled from high school. Three tribe members dress up as school principals in Hitler mustaches and swastika armbands, mocking the American education system. Berger and the tribe defy them, singing \"Going Down\". Claude returns from passing his draft board physical. He pretends to burn his Vietnam War draft card, which Berger reveals is a library card. Claude agonizes about what to do about being drafted. Two tribe members dressed as tourists arrive to ask the tribe why they have long hair. Claude and Berger lead the tribe in explaining the significance (\"Hair\"). The woman says kids should \"be free, no guilt\" and \"do whatever you want, just so long as you don't hurt anyone.\" She observes that long hair is natural (\"My Conviction\"). She opens her coat to reveal that she's a man in drag. As the couple leaves, the tribe calls her Margaret Mead.\nSheila gives Berger a yellow shirt. He goofs around and tears it in two. Sheila laments that Berger cares more about the \"bleeding crowd\" than about her (\"Easy to Be Hard\"). Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: \"I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung up everywhere. Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger.\" Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it (\"Don't Put it Down\"). The tribe joins the audience, inviting them to a Be-In. After young and innocent Crissy describes \"Frank Mills\", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the \"Be-In\". The men burn their draft cards. Claude puts his card in the fire, changes his mind and pulls it out. He asks, \"where is the something, where is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?\" (\"Where Do I Go\"). The tribe appears naked, intoning \"beads, flowers, freedom, happiness.\"\nAct II.\nSome tribe members have the \"Electric Blues\". The tribe enters worshiping in an attempt to summon Claude (\"Oh Great God of Power\"). Claude returns from the induction center, and tribe members act out an imagined conversation from his draft interview, with Hud saying \"the draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend the land they stole from the red people\". Claude gives Woof a Mick Jagger poster; Woof is excited about the gift, as he is infatuated with Jagger. Three white women of the tribe tell why they like \"Black Boys\" (\"black boys are delicious\"), and three black women of the tribe, dressed like The Supremes, explain why they like \"White Boys\" (\"white boys are so pretty\").\nBerger gives Claude a joint laced with a hallucinogen. Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions (\"Walking in Space\"). He hallucinates that he is skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam. Berger appears as General George Washington and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack. The Indians shoot all of Washington's men. General Ulysses S. Grant appears and begins a roll call: Abraham Lincoln (played by a black female tribe member), John Wilkes Booth, Calvin Coolidge, Clark Gable, Scarlett O'Hara, Aretha Franklin, Colonel George Custer. They all dance a minuet until African witch doctors kill them, except for Lincoln, who says, \"I'm one of you\". After the Africans sing his praises, Lincoln recites an alternate version of the Gettysburg Address (\"Abie Baby\"). Booth shoots Lincoln, but Lincoln tells him, \"Shit! I'm not dyin' for no white man\". As the visions continue, Buddhist monks enter. One pours a can of gasoline over another monk, who is set afire (reminiscent of the self-immolation of Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c) and runs off screaming. Three Catholic nuns strangle the three remaining Buddhist monks. Three astronauts shoot the nuns with ray guns. Three Chinese people stab the astronauts. Three Native Americans kill the Chinese with bows and tomahawks. Three Green Berets kill the Native Americans with machine guns and then kill each other. A sergeant appears with two parents holding a suit on a hanger, talking to the suit as if it were their son of whom they are very proud. The bodies rise and play like children. The playing escalates to violence until they are all dead again. They rise again and comment about the casualties in Vietnam: \"It's a dirty little war\" (\"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\"). At the end of the sequence, two tribe members sing, over the dead bodies, Shakespeare's paean to the nobility of Man (\"What A Piece of Work Is Man\").\nAfter the trip, Claude says \"I can't take this moment to moment living on the streets. ... I want to be ... invisible\". As they \"look at the Moon\", Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment (\"Good Morning Starshine\"). The tribe pays tribute to an old mattress (\"The Bed\"). Claude leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets during a snowstorm. They begin a protest chant and then call for Claude. Claude enters dressed in a military uniform, his hair short, but the tribe does not see him because he is an invisible spirit. Claude says, \"like it or not, they got me.\" The tribe sings \"Flesh Failures\". They move in front of Claude and launch into \"Let the Sun Shine In\"; as they exit, Claude is left lying in the center. During the curtain call, the tribe reprises \"Let the Sun Shine In\" and brings audience members on stage to dance.\nEarly productions.\nBroadway.\n\"Hair\" opened on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre on April 29, 1968. The production was directed by O'Horgan and choreographed by Arenal, with designs by Robin Wagner (set), Nancy Potts (costumes), and Jules Fisher (lighting). The original Broadway cast included Rado and Ragni as Claude and Berger, Lynn Kellogg as Sheila, Lamont Washington as Hud, Eaton, Plimpton and Dyson reprising their off-Broadway roles as Jeanie, Crissy and the \"Aquarius\" soloist, Melba Moore as Dionne, Steve Curry as Woof, and Paul Jabara and Diane Keaton in the ensemble (both Moore and Keaton later played Sheila). Other replacements during the original Broadway run were Ben Vereen, Keith Carradine, Barry McGuire, Ted Lange, Meat Loaf, La La Brooks, Mary Seymour (of Musique), Joe Butler, Peppy Castro (of the Blues Magoos), Robin McNamara, Eddie Rambeau, Vicki Sue Robinson, Beverly Bremers, Bert Sommer, Dale Soules and Kim Milford. It was the first Broadway show to have a regular ticket price of $50, with 12 of the seats at this price for sale to large corporations from July 1968. The top price when it opened was $11.\nThe \"Hair\" team soon became embroiled in a lawsuit with the organizers of the Tony Awards. After assuring producer Michael Butler that commencing previews by April 3, 1968, would assure eligibility for the 1968 Tonys, the New York Theatre League ruled \"Hair\" ineligible, moving the cutoff date to March 19. The producers sued but were unable to force the League to reconsider. At the 1969 Tonys, \"Hair\" was nominated for Best Musical and Best Director but lost to \"1776\" in both categories. The production ran for four years and 1,750 performances, closing on July 1, 1972.\nEarly regional productions.\nThe West Coast version played at the Aquarius Theater in Los Angeles beginning about six months after the Broadway opening and running for an unprecedented two years. The Los Angeles tribe included Rado, Ragni, Vereen (who played Hud and then replaced Ragni), Ted Neeley (who replaced Rado), Willie Weatherly (who played Berger and Claude), Meat Loaf, Gloria Jones, T\u00e1ta Vega, Jobriath, Jennifer Warnes and Dobie Gray.\nThere were soon nine simultaneous productions in U.S. cities, followed by national tours. Performers in these included Joe Mantegna, Andr\u00e9 DeShields, Charlotte Crossley and Alaina Reed (Chicago), David Lasley, David Patrick Kelly, Meat Loaf, and Shaun Murphy (Detroit), Kenny Ortega and Arnold McCuller (tour), Bob Bingham (Seattle) and Philip Michael Thomas (San Francisco). The creative team from Broadway worked on \"Hair\" in Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, as the Broadway staging served as a rough template for these and other early regional productions. In Los Angeles, Tom Smothers was co-producer. Regional casts consisted mostly of local actors, although a few Broadway cast members reprised their roles. O'Horgan or the authors sometimes took new ideas and improvisations from a regional show and brought them back to New York, such as when live chickens were tossed onto the stage in Los Angeles.\nIt was rare for so many productions to run simultaneously during an initial Broadway run. Butler, who had called \"Hair\" \"the strongest anti-war statement ever written\", said the reason he opened so many productions was to influence public opinion against the war and end it as soon as possible.\nWest End.\n\"Hair\" opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London on September 27, 1968, led by the same creative team as the Broadway production. The opening night was delayed until the abolition of theatre censorship in England under the Theatres Act 1968 so that the show could include nudity and profanity. As with other early productions, the London show added local allusions and other minor departures from the Broadway version.\nThe original London tribe included Sonja Kristina, Peter Straker, Paul Nicholas, Melba Moore, Annabel Leventon, Elaine Paige, Paul Korda, Marsha Hunt, Floella Benjamin, Alex Harvey, Oliver Tobias, Richard O'Brien and Tim Curry. This was Curry's first full-time theatrical acting role, where he met future \"Rocky Horror Show\" collaborator O'Brien. \"Hair\"'s engagement in London surpassed the Broadway production, running for 1,997 performances until the roof of the theatre collapsed in July 1973.\nEarly international productions.\nBertrand Castelli, Butler's partner and executive producer of the Broadway show, led the foreign-language productions. Castelli was a writer/producer known in Paris art circles. Butler called him a \"crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads\". Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used. Each script contained local references. Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production, after London, opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968, with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg and Bill \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m, produced and directed by Pierre Fr\u00e4nckel and choreographed by Arenal. It ran for 134 performances until March 1969.\nA German production, directed by Castelli, opened a month later in Munich; the tribe included Donna Summer, Liz Mitchell and Donna Wyant. A Paris production opened on June 1, 1969. The original Australian production debuted in Sydney on June 6, 1969, produced by Harry M. Miller and directed by Jim Sharman, who also designed the production. The tribe included Keith Glass and then Reg Livermore as Berger, John Waters as Claude and Sharon Redd as The Magician. Redd was one of six African-Americans brought to Australia to provide a racially integrated tribe. The production broke local box-office records and ran for two years, but because of some of the language in the show, the cast album was banned in Queensland and New Zealand. The production transferred to Melbourne in 1971 and then had a national tour. It marked the theatrical debut of Marcia Hines. In Mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in Acapulco. 18-year-old S\u00f4nia Braga appeared in the 1969 Brazilian production.\nA production in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1969, was the first \"Hair\" produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by Mira Trailovi\u0107 at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikoli\u0107, Branko Mili\u0107evi\u0107, Seka Sabli\u0107 and Du\u0161an Prelevi\u0107. Over four years, the production played 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival.\nBy 1970, \"Hair\" was a huge financial success, and 19 productions had been staged outside of North America, including in Scandinavia, South America, Italy, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. According to \"Billboard\", the productions took in almost $1 million every ten days, and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show's songs, making it \"the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the Broadway stage\".\nThemes.\n\"Hair\" explores many themes of the hippie movement of the 1960s. Theatre critic Scott Miller wrote:\n[Youth protests in the 1960s concerned] racism, environmental destruction, poverty, sexism and sexual repression, violence at home and the war in Vietnam, depersonalization from new technologies, and corruption in politics. ... [T]he hippies had great respect for America and believed that they were the true patriots. ... [Long] hair was the hippies' flag\u2014their ... symbol not only of rebellion but also of ... the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles. ... Drab work clothes (jeans, work shirts, pea coats) were a rejection of materialism. Clothing from ... the Third World and native Americans represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness. ... [N]atural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics, a return to natural things. ... [O]ld World War II or Civil War jackets [co-opted] the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence.\nRace and the tribe.\nExtending the precedents set by \"Show Boat\" (1927) and \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935), \"Hair\" opened the Broadway musical to racial integration; fully one-third of the cast was African American. Except for satirically in skits, the roles for the black tribe members portrayed them as equals, breaking from traditional roles for black people in entertainment as slaves or servants. An \"Ebony\" article called the show the biggest outlet for black actors in the history of the U.S. stage. Several songs and scenes from the show address racial issues. \"Colored Spade\", introducing the character Hud, a militant black man, is a long list of racial slurs (\"jungle bunny ... little black Sambo\"). \"Dead End\", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. \"Black Boys/White Boys\" is an exuberant acknowledgment of interracial sexual attraction; the U.S. Supreme Court had not struck down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967. \"Abie Baby\" is part of the Act 2 \"trip\" sequence: four African witch doctors, who have just killed various American historical, cultural and fictional characters, sing the praises of Abraham Lincoln, portrayed by a black female tribe member, whom they decide not to kill. The first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in old movies, like \"I's finished ... pluckin' y'all's chickens\" and \"I's free now thanks to y'all, Master Lincoln\". The Lincoln character recites a modernized version of the Gettysburg Address while a white female tribe member polishes his shoes with her blond hair.\nThe script's many references to Native Americans are part of the anti-consumerist, naturalist focus of the hippie movement and of \"Hair\". The characters are referred to as the \"tribe\", borrowing the term for Native American communities. The cast of each production chooses a tribal name. Miller wrote: \"The practice is not just cosmetic ... the entire cast must work together, must like each other. ... All the sense of family, of belonging, of responsibility and loyalty inherent in the word 'tribe' has to be felt by the cast.\" To enhance this feeling, O'Horgan put the cast through sensitivity exercises based on trust, touching, listening and intensive examination that broke down barriers between the cast and crew and encouraged bonding.\nNudity, sexual freedom and drug use.\nThe brief nude scene at the end of Act I was a subject of controversy and notoriety. \"Much has been written about that scene ... most of it silly,\" wrote Gene Lees in \"High Fidelity\". During \"Where Do I Go?\", those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes behind a scrim. At the musical cue, \"they [stood] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed\" in dim projections of floral patterns, chanting. It lasted 20 seconds. The scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-culture jokes. Jack Benny quipped at a London preview, \"Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?\" Groucho Marx joked, \"I was gonna go see it ... [To save the $11 ticket price,] I went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror.\"\nThe nudity was optional for the performers. The French cast was \"the nudest\" of the foreign groups, while the London cast \"found nudity the hardest to achieve\". In Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked in the aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled \"CENSORED\". Miller writes, \"nudity was a big part of the hippie culture, both as a rejection of the sexual repression of their parents and also as a statement about naturalism, spirituality, honesty, openness, and freedom. The naked body was beautiful, something to be celebrated and appreciated. ... They saw their bodies and their sexuality as gifts\". According to Melba Moore, \"It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. ... It's like so much else people get uptight about.\" Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that \"it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing.\"\n\"Hair\" glorifies sexual freedom in various ways. In addition to acceptance of interracial attraction, the characters' free love lifestyle acts as a sexually and politically charged updating of \"La boh\u00e8me\"; as Rado explained, \"The love element of the peace movement was palpable.\" In the song \"Sodomy\", Woof exhorts everyone to \"join the holy orgy Kama Sutra\". Toward the end of Act 2, the tribe members reveal their free love tendencies when they banter about who will sleep with whom that night.\nIllegal drugs taken by the characters include a hallucinogen during the trip sequence. The song \"Walking in Space\" begins the sequence, declaring \"how dare they try to end this beauty ... in this dive we rediscover sensation ... our eyes are open, wide, wide, wide\". Similarly, in \"Donna\", Berger sings, \"I'm evolving through the drugs that you put down.\" Generally, the tribe favors hallucinogenic or \"mind expanding\" drugs, such as LSD and marijuana.\nPacifism and environmentalism.\nThe opposition to the war that pervades the show is unified by the plot thread that progresses through the book\u2014Claude's moral dilemma over whether to burn his draft card. Pacifism is explored throughout the extended trip sequence in Act 2. The lyrics to \"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\", sung during that sequence, evoke the horrors of war (\"ripped open by metal explosion\"). The song is based on Allen Ginsberg's 1966 poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra\", in which General Maxwell D. Taylor proudly reports to the press the number of enemy soldiers killed in one month, repeating it digit by digit for effect: \"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\". The song begins with images of death and dying and turns into a manic dance number, echoing Maxwell's glee at reporting the enemy casualties. The song also raises the issue of the disproportionate loss and disparate treatment of black servicemen in \"decorations, promotion and duty assignments\" in the Vietnam War, with the repeated phrase \"Prisoners in niggertown/ It's a dirty little war\".\n\"Don't Put It Down\" satirizes the unexamined patriotism of people who are \"crazy for the American flag\". \"Be In (Hare Krishna)\" praises the peace movement and events like the San Francisco and Central Park Be-Ins. Throughout the show, the tribe chants popular protest slogans like \"What do we want? Peace! When do we want it? Now!\" and \"Do not enter the induction center\". The upbeat \"Let the Sun Shine In\" is a call to action, to reject the darkness of war and change the world for the better.\n\"Hair\" also satirizes pollution. Jeanie appears wearing a gas mask and sings the song \"Air\": \"Welcome, sulfur dioxide. Hello carbon monoxide. The air ... is everywhere\", suggesting that pollution will eventually kill her: \"vapor and fume at the stone of my tomb, breathing like a sullen perfume\". In a comic, pro-green vein, Woof introduces himself by explaining that he \"grows things\", and Berger weaves nature imagery into the title song.\nReligion and astrology.\nReligion, particularly Catholicism, appears both overtly and symbolically throughout the piece and is often the butt of jokes. Berger sings of looking for \"my Donna\", giving it the double meaning of a woman he is searching for and the Madonna. During \"Sodomy\", a hymn-like paean to all that is \"dirty\" about sex, the cast strikes evocative religious positions: the Piet\u00e0 and Christ on the cross. Before the song, Woof recites a modified rosary. In Act II, when Berger gives famous figures imaginary pills, he offers \"a pill for the Pope\". In \"Going Down\", after being kicked out of school, Berger compares himself to Lucifer: \"Just like the angel that fell / Banished forever to hell / Today have I been expelled / From high school heaven.\" Claude becomes a classic Christ figure at various points. In Act I, he says, \"I am the Son of God. I shall vanish and be forgotten\", then gives benediction to the tribe and the audience. He suffers from indecision, and, in his Gethsemane at the end of Act I, he asks \"Where Do I Go?\". The textual alludes to Claude being on a cross, and, in the end, he is chosen to give his life for the others. Berger is a John the Baptist figure, preparing the way for Claude.\nSongs like \"Good Morning, Starshine\" and \"Aquarius\" reflect the 1960s cultural interest in astrological and cosmic concepts. \"Aquarius\" was written after Rado researched his own astrological sign. The company's astrologer, Maria Crummere, was consulted about casting: Sheila was usually played by a Libra or Capricorn and Berger by a Leo. Crummere was also consulted on when the show would open on Broadway and in other cities. \"Playbill\" reported that she chose April 29, 1968, for the Broadway premiere. The 29th was auspicious ... because the moon was high, indicating that people would attend in masses. The position of the 'history makers' (Pluto, Uranus, Jupiter) in the 10th house made the show unique, powerful and a money-maker. And that Neptune was on the ascendancy foretold that \"Hair\" would develop a reputation involving sex. In Mexico, where Crummere did not pick the opening date, the show was closed by the government after one night. She disliked the date of the Boston opening (where the producers were sued over the show's content), saying, \"Jupiter will be in opposition to naughty Saturn, and the show opens the very day of the sun's eclipse. Terrible\".\nLiterary themes and symbolism.\n\"Hair\" makes many references to Shakespeare's plays and, at times, takes lyrical material directly from Shakespeare. For example, the lyrics to the song \"What a Piece of Work Is Man\" are from \"Hamlet\" (II:\u00a0scene\u00a02), and portions of \"Flesh Failures\" (\"the rest is silence\") are from Hamlet's final lines. In \"Flesh Failures/Let the Sun Shine In\", the lyrics \"Eyes, look your last!/ Arms, take your last embrace! And lips, O you/ The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\" are from \"Romeo and Juliet\" (V: iii). According to Miller, the \"Romeo\" suicide imagery makes the point that, with our complicity in war, we are killing ourselves. Claude's indecision, especially his resistance to burning his draft card, which ultimately causes his demise, parallels \"Hamlet\", \"the melancholy hippie\". This symbolism is carried into the last scene, where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene, where he says, \"I know what I want to be ... invisible\". Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis said: Both [\"Hair\" and \"Hamlet\"] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war, violence, and venal politics. They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human. In the end, unable to effectively combat the evil around them, they tragically succumb.\nOther literary references include the song \"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\", based on Ginsberg's \"Wichita Vortex Sutra\", and, in the psychedelic drug trip sequence, the portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara from \"Gone with the Wind\" and activist African-American poet LeRoi Jones.\nMusic.\nAfter studying the music of the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of \"Hair\". He listened to \"what [the Bantu] called quaylas ... [which have a] very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. Much deeper though. ... \"Hair\" is very African\u2014a lot of [the] rhythms, not the tunes so much.\" Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like \"What a Piece of Work Is Man\" and \"Ain't Got No Grass\". MacDermot said, \"My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock &amp; roll\u2014but to me that translated to 'funk'.\" Funk influence is evident throughout the score, notably in songs like \"Colored Spade\" and \"Walking in Space\". But MacDermot said the songs \"can't all be the same. You've got to get different styles.\u00a0... I like to think they're all a little different\". The music in \"Hair\" varies from the rockabilly sensibilities of \"Don't Put it Down\" to the folk rock rhythms of \"Frank Mills\" and \"What a Piece of Work is Man\" to rhythm and blues in \"Easy to Be Hard\" and protest rock anthems, such as \"Ain't Got No\" and \"The Flesh Failures\". The acid rock of \"Walking in Space\" and \"Aquarius\" are balanced by the mainstream pop of \"Good Morning Starshine\". Miller ties the music of \"Hair\" to the hippies' political themes: The hippies\u00a0... were determined to create art of the people and their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist.\u00a0... [T]he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government.\nThe music did not resonate with everyone. Leonard Bernstein said, \"the songs are just laundry lists\", and walked out of the production. Richard Rodgers could hear only the beat and called it \"one-third music\". John Fogerty said, \"\"Hair\" is such a watered-down version of what is really going on that I can't get behind it at all.\" For \"High Fidelity\", Gene Lees wrote that John Lennon found the show \"dull\" and \"I do not know any musician who thinks it's good.\" Theatre historian John Kenrick countered:\n[\"Hair's\"] explosion of revolutionary proclamations, profanity and hard rock shook the musical theatre to its roots.\u00a0... Most people in the theatre business [and] Tony voters tried to ignore \"Hair's\" importance, shutting it out from any honors. However, some now insisted it was time for a change. \"New York Times\" critic Clive Barnes gushed that \"Hair\" was \"the first Broadway musical in some time to have the authentic voice of today rather than the day before yesterday.\"\nSongs.\nThe score had many more songs than typical Broadway shows of the day. Most had about six to ten songs per act; \"Hair\"'s total is in the thirties. This list reflects the songs most often included during the original Broadway run.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe show was under almost perpetual rewrite. Thirteen songs were added between the production at the Public Theater and Broadway. Others were cut; \"What a piece of work is a man\" and \"Hashish\" were originally spoken but musicalized for Broadway. Subsequent productions have included or cut others.\nRecordings.\nThe first recording in 1967 featured the off-Broadway cast. The original Broadway cast recording received a Grammy Award in 1969 for Best Score from an Original Cast Show Album and sold nearly 3\u00a0million copies in the U.S. by December 1969. It charted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the last Broadway cast album to do so (as of 2024), and stayed at No. 1 for 13 weeks in 1969. The album peaked at number 2 in Australia in 1970. According to \"The New York Times\", \"The cast album of \"Hair\" was\u00a0... a must-have for the middle classes. Its exotic orange-and-green cover art imprinted itself instantly and indelibly on the psyche.\u00a0... [It] became a pop-rock classic [with] an appeal that transcends particular tastes for genre or period.\" In 2019, the Library of Congress added the original Broadway cast album to the National Recording Registry.\nA 1969 studio album, \"DisinHAIRited\", contains 19 songs written for the show but not included in previous recordings, a few of which were never included in stage productions. Some were cut between the Public and Broadway productions or were left off the original cast albums due to space. Productions in England, Germany, France, Sweden, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, Australia and elsewhere released cast albums, Such broad attention was paid to the recordings of \"Hair\" that, after an unprecedented bidding war, ABC Records paid a record amount for MacDermot's next Broadway adaptation, \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\". The 2009 revival recording debuted at No.\u202f1 on \"Billboard\"'s \"Top Cast Album\" chart and at No.\u202f63 in the Top 200, making it the highest debuting album in Ghostlight Records history. The 1993 London revival cast album contains new music incorporated into the standard rental version.\nMore than 1,000 performances of individual songs from \"Hair\" have been recorded. The 5th Dimension's release of \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" in 1969 won Record of the Year in 1970 and topped the charts for six weeks. The Cowsills' recording of the title song \"Hair\" climbed to No.\u202f2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while Oliver's \"Good Morning Starshine\" reached No.\u202f3. Three Dog Night's \"Easy to Be Hard\" went to No.\u202f4. Nina Simone's 1968 medley of \"Ain't Got No, I Got Life\" reached the top 5 on the UK singles chart. ASCAP confirmed that \"Aquarius\" was the most frequently played song on U.S. radio and television in 1970. Among other artists recording \"Hair\" songs are Shirley Bassey, Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross. \"Good Morning Starshine\" was sung on a 1969 episode of \"Sesame Street\" by Bob McGrath, and versions have been recorded by artists such as Sarah Brightman, Petula Clark and Strawberry Alarm Clock. Liza Minnelli and The Lemonheads recorded \"Frank Mills\", and Andrea McArdle, Jennifer Warnes and S\u00e9rgio Mendes each made versions of \"Easy to Be Hard\". Run DMC sampled \"Where Do I Go\" on its 1993 single \"Down with the King\", which went to No.\u202f1 on the \"Billboard\" rap chart and reached the top 25 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \"Hair\" helped launch the recording careers of Meat Loaf, Dobie Gray, Jennifer Warnes, Jobriath, Bert Sommer, Ronnie Dyson, Donna Summer and Melba Moore. In 2004 \"Aquarius\", from the 1979 film version, was number\u00a033 on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs.\nEarly critical reception.\nReception of \"Hair\"'s Broadway premiere was overwhelmingly positive. Clive Barnes wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"I think it is simply that it is so likable. So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions.\" John J. O'Connor of \"The Wall Street Journal\" said the show was \"exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater\". Richard Watts Jr. of the \"New York Post\" wrote that \"it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist.\" Allan Jeffreys of ABC TV said the actors were \"the most talented hippies you'll ever see\u00a0... directed in a wonderfully wild fashion by Tom O'Horgan.\" Leonard Probst of NBC said \"\"Hair\" is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it's more fun than any other this season\". John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot's \"dynamic score\" that \"blasts and soars\", and Len Harris of CBS said \"I've finally found the best musical of the Broadway season\u00a0... it's that sloppy, vulgar, terrific tribal love rock musical \"Hair\".\"\nA dissenting review in \"Variety\" called the show \"loony\" and \"without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.\u00a0... It's impossible to tell whether [the cast has] talent. Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business.\" In \"Newsweek\", Jack Kroll wrote, \"There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new \"Hair\"\u00a0... there is something hard, grabby, slightly corrupt about O'Horgan's virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy.\" A \"Time\" critic wrote that although the show \"thrums with vitality, [it is] crippled by being a bookless musical and, like a boneless fish, it drifts when it should swim.\"\nWhen \"Hair\" opened in London, critic Irving Wardle of \"The Times\" wrote, \"Its honesty and passion give it the quality of a true theatrical celebration\u2014the joyous sound of a group of people telling the world exactly what they feel.\" In the \"Financial Times\", B. A. Young wrote that \"Hair\" was \"not only a wildly enjoyable evening, but a thoroughly moral one.\" In his final review before retiring, 78-year-old W. A. Darlington of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that he had \"tried hard\" but found the evening \"a complete bore\u2014noisy, ugly and quite desperately funny\". Of such critiques, Miller wrote in 2001, \"some people can't see past the appearance of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath\", adding, \"Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, but many of the songs didn't really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn't know when to applaud.\u00a0... The show rejected every convention of Broadway [and] of traditional theatre.\"\nSocial change.\n\"Hair\" challenged many of the norms of Western society in 1968. The name itself was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism. Rado recalled that long hair \"was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was. Long hair was shocking, and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair. It was kind of a flag, really.\"\nThe musical caused controversy. It was the first time a Broadway show had seen totally naked performers, and the show was charged with the desecration of the American flag and the use of obscene language. These controversies, and the anti-Vietnam War theme, attracted occasional threats and violence during the show's early years and became the basis for legal actions. Two cases eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In Indiana cities, the producers were either refused booking, had difficulty securing a theater, or the production was picketed by church groups. Productions in the U.S. were frequently confronted with the closure of theaters by the fire marshal. Chattanooga's 1972 refusal to allow \"Hair\" to play at the city-owned Memorial Auditorium was later found by the Supreme Court to be an unlawful prior restraint.\nLegal challenges against the Boston production were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Chief of the Licensing Bureau said, \"anyone who desecrates the flag should be whipped on Boston Common.\" Although the scene was removed before opening, the District Attorney alleged that \"lewd and lascivious\" actions were taking place onstage. \"Hair\" obtained an injunction from the Superior Court against criminal prosecution, and the D.A. appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. At the request of both parties, several of the justices viewed the production; the court ruled that \"the cast [must] be clothed to a reasonable extent.\" The cast defiantly played the scene nude later that night, saying the ruling was vague about when it took effect. The next day, the production closed. After a Federal appellate bench reversed the Massachusetts court's ruling, the D.A. appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 4\u20134 decision, the Court upheld the reversal, allowing \"Hair\" to reopen.\nA 1969 Acapulco, Mexico, production played for one night. The theater, across the street from a popular bordello, was padlocked by the government, which called the production \"detrimental to the morals of youth\". The cast was arrested and agreed to leave the country, but because of legal complications they went into hiding. They were expelled from Mexico days later. In Bergen, Norway, citizens formed a human barricade to try to prevent the performance. In St. Paul, Minnesota, a protesting clergyman released mice in the lobby, hoping to frighten the audience. Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, after naming Apollo 13's lunar module \"Aquarius\" after the song, walked out of the production at the Biltmore in protest of perceived anti-Americanism and disrespect of the flag. In April 1971, a bomb was thrown at \"Hair\"'s theater in Cleveland, Ohio, bouncing off the marquee; the blast shattered windows in the building and nearby storefronts. The same month, the families of a cast member and the stage manager died in a fire in the Cleveland hotel where members of the show's troupe were staying. The Sydney, Australia, production's opening night was interrupted by a bomb scare in 1969.\n\"Hair\" effectively marked the end of stage censorship in the United Kingdom. London's stage censor, the Lord Chamberlain, refused to license the musical, and the opening was delayed until Parliament passed a bill stripping his licensing power. San Francisco's large hippie population considered the show an extension of their street activities, blurring the barrier between art and life by frequently meditating with the cast and joining them onstage during the show. 18-year-old Princess Anne danced onstage in London. In Munich, authorities threatened to close the production if the nude scene remained, but after a \"Hair\" spokesman said his relatives had been marched nude into Auschwitz, the authorities relented. The Paris production encountered little controversy, nudity being common onstage in Paris. But even in Paris there was occasional opposition, as when a member of the Salvation Army used a portable loudspeaker to exhort the audience to halt the presentation.\nSubsequent productions.\n1970s to 1990s.\nThe first college production took place in 1970 at Memphis State University, Tennessee, directed by Keith Kennedy. The cast participated in the Atlanta International Pop Festival in 1970. WMC-TV produced a 1971 documentary chronicling the production.\nIn 1977, a Broadway revival of \"Hair\" produced by Michael Butler and directed by O'Horgan ran for 43 performances at the Biltmore Theater. The cast included Ellen Foley, Annie Golden, Loretta Devine, Cleavant Derricks and Kristen Vigard. Reviews were generally negative, and critics accused the musical of \"showing its gray\". A 1985 production in Montreal was reportedly the 70th professional production. A 20th-anniversary benefit concert was held in May 1988 at the United Nations General Assembly. The event was sponsored by First Lady Nancy Reagan and introduced by Barbara Walters. Rado, Ragni and MacDermot reunited to write nine new songs for the concert. The cast of 163 included former stars from productions around the globe, Moore, Vereen, Williams and Summer, as well as guest performers Bea Arthur, Frank Stallone and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Ticket prices ranged from $250 to $5,000, and the proceeds went to the United States Committee for UNICEF and the Creo Society's Fund for Children with AIDS. In November 1988, Butler produced \"Hair\" at Chicago's Vic Theater. The production was well received and ran until February 1989.\nFrom 1990 to 1991, Pink Lace Productions ran a U.S. national tour of \"Hair\". A 1990 \"bus and truck\" production toured Europe for over 3\u00a0years. Even after Ragni died in 1991, MacDermot and Rado continued to write new songs for revivals through the 1990s. \"Hair Sarajevo, AD 1992\" was staged during the siege of Sarajevo as an appeal for peace. Rado directed a US national 25th-anniversary tour in 1994 featuring actor Luther Creek; MacDermot returned to oversee the music. Rado also directed various European productions from 1995 to 1999. A production ran in Australia in 1992, and a London revival starring John Barrowman and Paul Hipp opened at the Old Vic in 1993, directed by Michael Bogdanov. A \"Guardian\" review suggested that its failure stemmed from a cast of \"Thatcher's children who didn't really get it\". South African productions began only after the eradication of apartheid. In 1996, Butler staged a revival in Chicago, concurrent with the 1996 Democratic National Convention, echoing the last time the DNC was in Chicago: 1968. A 30th-anniversary Off-off Broadway production was staged at Third Eye Repertory, directed by Shawn Rozsa.\n2000s and 2010s.\nIn 2001, Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles performed \"Hair\" at the Wadsworth Theatre, starring Steven Weber as Berger, Sam Harris as Claude and Jennifer Leigh Warren as Sheila. \"Encores!\" presented a 2001 production at City Center, starring Luther Creek, Idina Menzel and Tom Plotkin, with MacDermot playing the keyboards. An Actors' Fund benefit of the show was performed for one night at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City in 2004.\nIn 2005, a London production opened at the Gate Theatre, directed by Daniel Kramer. Rado approved an updating of the musical's script to place it in the context of the Iraq War. In Kramer's modernized interpretation, the nudity called to mind images from Abu Ghraib. In 2006, Rado collaborated with director Robert Prior on a CanStage production in Toronto. A revival produced by Pieter Toerien toured South Africa in 2007, directed by Paul Warwick Griffin. From September to December 2007, \"Hair\" ran at the MET Theatre in Los Angeles, produced by Butler and directed and choreographed by Bo Crowell, with musical direction by Christian Nesmith. It won the LA Weekly Theater Award for Musical of the Year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was a show about now when we did it. Now it's a show about then \u2013 but it's still about now.\nJames Rado, 2008\nFor three nights in September 2007, Joe's Pub and the Public Theater presented a 40th-anniversary production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. This concert version, directed by Diane Paulus, featured MacDermot on keyboards and starred Jonathan Groff as Claude, Karen Olivo as Sheila and Will Swenson as Berger. Actors from the original Broadway production joined the cast onstage during the encore of \"Let the Sun Shine In\". Demand for the show was extraordinary. The Public presented a fully staged production of \"Hair\" at the Delacorte from July to September 2008. Paulus again directed, with choreography by Karole Armitage. Groff and Swenson returned as Claude and Berger, with others from the concert cast. Caren Lyn Manuel played Sheila, and Christopher J. Hanke replaced Groff as Claude on August 17. Reviews were generally positive, with Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" writing, \"this production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece\". \"Time\" magazine wrote: \"\"Hair\" ... has been reinvigorated and reclaimed as one of the great milestones in musical-theatre history. ... Today \"Hair\" seems, if anything, more daring than ever.\"\n2009 Broadway revival and 2010 U.S. national tour.\nThe Public Theater production transferred to Broadway at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, beginning previews on March 6, 2009, with an official opening on March 31, 2009. Paulus and Armitage again directed and choreographed, and most of the cast returned from the production in the park. A pre-performance ticket lottery was held nightly for $25 box-seat tickets. The opening cast included Gavin Creel as Claude, Swenson as Berger, Caissie Levy as Sheila, Megan Lawrence as Mother and Sasha Allen as Dionne. Designers included Scott Pask (sets), Michael McDonald (costumes), Kevin Adams (lighting), and Acme Sound Partners (sound). Critical response was almost uniformly positive. The \"New York Daily News\" praised the direction, \"colorfully kinetic\" choreography and technical features, writing, \"as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom, [\"Hair\" is] highly communicable\" and warning: \"If you're seated on the aisle, count on [the cast] to be in your face or your lap\". The \"New York Post\" wrote of the \"triumphant\" production: These days, the nation is fixated less on war and more on the economy. As a result, the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race.\" \"Variety\" enthused, \"Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast ... cut right to the 1967 rock musical's heart, generating tremendous energy. ... If this explosive production doesn't stir something in you ... check your pulse.\" \"The Boston Globe\" dissented, saying the revival \"felt canned\" and \"overblown\" and \"feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib\". Ben Brantley, writing for \"The New York Times\", reflected the majority:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This emotionally rich revival ... delivers ... the intense, unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth. ... Armitage's happy hippie choreography, with its group gropes and mass writhing, looks as if it's being invented on the spot. But there's intelligent form within the seeming formlessness. ... [Paulus finds] depths of character and feeling in [the 1968 show about kids] frightened of how the future is going to change them. ... After the show I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen to [the characters]. Mr. MacDermot's music ... holds up beautifully, given infectious life by the ... flavorfully blended voices of the cast.\nThe Public Theater struggled to raise the budget for the Broadway transfer. Paulus helped keep costs low by using an inexpensive set, and the show sold well. On April 30, 2009, on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical. By August, the revival had recouped its $5,760,000 investment, becoming one of the fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history. Its cast album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. When the Broadway cast transferred to London for the 2010 West End revival, a mostly new tribe took over on Broadway on March 9, 2010, including Ace Young as Berger, Diana DeGarmo as Sheila, Kyle Riabko as Claude, Annaleigh Ashford as Jeanie and Vanessa Ray as Chrissie. Rachel Bay Jones later played Mother and other roles. Sales decreased, and the revival closed on June 27, 2010, after 29 previews and 519 regular performances.\nA U.S. national tour of the production began on October 21, 2010, starring Steel Burkhardt as Berger, Paris Remillard as Claude and Caren Lyn Tackett as Sheila. The tour received mostly positive reviews. The show returned to Broadway at the St. James Theatre from July 5 to September 10, 2011. After that, the tour resumed, ending on January 29, 2012.\n2010 West End revival.\nThe 2009 Broadway production was duplicated at the Gielgud Theatre in London's West End. Previews began on April 1, 2010, with an official opening on April 14. The producers were the Public Theater, together with Cameron Mackintosh and Broadway Across America. Nearly all of the New York cast relocated, but Luther Creek played Woof. The revival closed on September 4, 2010.\nA review by Michael Billington of \"The Guardian\" described it as \"a vibrant, joyous piece of living theatre\", writing, \"it celebrates a period when the joy of life was pitted against the forces of intolerance and the death-dealing might of the military\u2013industrial complex.\" Charles Spencer in \"The Daily Telegraph\" agreed: \"This is a timely and irresistibly vital revival of the greatest of all rock musicals.\" Michael Coveney of \"The Independent\" wrote that \"Hair\" is \"one of the great musicals of all time, and a phenomenon that, I'm relieved to discover, stands up as a period piece\". In \"The Times\", Benedict Nightingale commented that \"it's exhilarating, as well as oddly poignant, when a multihued cast ... race downstage while delivering that tuneful salute to an age of Aquarius that still refuses to dawn.\"\n2014\u2013present.\nIn August 2014, \"Hair\" returned for a three-night engagement at the Hollywood Bowl. Directed by Adam Shankman, the cast included Kristen Bell as Sheila, Hunter Parrish as Claude, Benjamin Walker as Berger, Amber Riley as Dionne, Jenna Ushkowitz as Jeanie, Sarah Hyland as Crissy, Mario as Hud, and Beverly D'Angelo and Kevin Chamberlin as Claude's parents.\nA 2016 production in Manchester, England, at the Hope Mill Theatre, directed by Jonathan O'Boyle, starring Robert Metson as Claude, Laura Johnson as Sheila and Ryan Anderson as Berger, earned positive reviews. In 2017, the musical's 50th anniversary, the staging was repeated Off West End at The Vaults theatre in London, with Metson and Johnson repeating their roles and Andy Coxon as Berger. The production won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Off-West End Production. A UK national tour of the production began in March 2019, starring Jake Quickenden as Berger, Daisy Wood-Davis as Sheila, Paul Wilkins as Claude and Marcus Collins as Hud.\nInternational success.\n\"Hair\" has been performed in most countries. After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled for the first time to Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC's \"Nightline\", when Phil Alden Robinson visited in 1996 and discovered a production of \"Hair\" there in the midst of the war). In 1999, Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce \"Hair\" in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre in Moscow's Gorky Park. The production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30\u00a0years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.\nRado wrote in 2003 that the only places where the show had not been performed were \"China, India, Vietnam, the Arctic and Antarctic continents as well as most African countries.\" Since then, an Indian production has been mounted.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nA musical film adaptation was released in 1979. Directed by Milo\u0161 Forman with choreography by Twyla Tharp and a screenplay by Michael Weller, the film stars John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo, with Golden, Moore, Dyson, Foley, Dorsey Wright, Don Dacus, Nell Carter and Cheryl Barnes. It was nominated for two Golden Globes: Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture (for Williams), and Forman was nominated for a C\u00e9sar Award.\nSeveral songs were deleted, and the film's more conventionally romantic storyline departs greatly from the musical. Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. The friendly tribe adopts the farm boy in Central Park and, led by Berger, tries to facilitate the romance. During Claude's basic training, they bring Sheila for a tryst with Claude, substituting Berger in his barracks wearing Claude's dogtags. A mistake leads Berger to be taken to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed. While the film received generally positive reviews, Ragni and Rado said its comic portrayal of the tribe failed to capture the essence of \"Hair\" by portraying hippies as \"oddballs\" without any connection to the peace movement.\nPopular culture.\n\"The New York Times\" noted in 2007 that \"\"Hair\" was one of the last Broadway musicals to saturate the culture as shows from the golden age once regularly did.\" Songs from the musical have been featured in films and television episodes. For example, in the 2005 film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", the character Willy Wonka welcomed the children with lyrics from \"Good Morning Starshine\". \"Aquarius\" was performed in the final episode of \"Laverne and Shirley\" in 1983, where the character Carmine moves to New York City and auditions for \"Hair\". \"Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In\" was also performed in the final scene in the film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\", and Three Dog Night's recording of \"Easy to Be Hard\" was featured in David Fincher's film \"Zodiac\". On \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The Springfield Files\", townspeople sing \"Good Morning Starshine\". The episode \"Hairography\" of \"Glee\" includes a mash-up of the songs \"Hair\" and \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyonc\u00e9. \"Head of the Class\" featured a two-part episode in 1990, titled \"Hair to Eternity\", in which the head of the English department is determined to disrupt the school's performance of \"Hair\".\n\"Hair\" continues to be a popular choice for high-school, university, and amateur productions. In 2002, Peter Jennings featured a Boulder, Colorado, high-school production in his ABC documentary series \"In Search of America\". A 2006 community theater production in Red Bank, New Jersey, was singled out by Butler as \"one of the best \"Hair\"s I have seen in a long time.\" A production by Mountain Play ran at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley, California, in 2007.\nLegacy.\n\"Hair\" was Broadway's \"first fully realized\" concept musical, a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies. While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of \"Hair\"'s tenure on Broadway, the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete.\nMacDermot followed \"Hair\" with three successive rock scores: \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" (1971); \"Dude\" (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and \"Via Galactica\" (1972). While \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, \"Dude\" failed after just sixteen\u00a0performances, and \"Via Galactica\" flopped after a month. According to Horn, these and other such \"failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented\". By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. Audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores. Some later rock musicals, such as \"Rent\" (1996) and \"Spring Awakening\" (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like \"We Will Rock You\" (2002) and \"Rock of Ages\" (2009), have found success. But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after \"Hair\". Critic Clive Barnes commented: \"No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... \"Tommy\" ... was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. There's so much more money in records and rock concerts.\" The continued popularity of \"Hair\" in the 21st century is seen in its number ten ranking in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \"[United Kingdom]'s Number One Essential Musicals\".\nOn the other hand, \"Hair\" had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway, but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated. For example, in 1970, Butler, Castelli and the various \"Hair\" casts contributed to fundraising for the World Assembly of Youth. The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues. For about a week, cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund. \"Hair\" raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly. Cast and crew also contributed a day's pay, and Butler contributed a day's profits from these productions. Moreover, as Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa E. T. C., noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Hair\" came with blue jeans, comfortable clothing, colors, beautiful colors, sounds, movement. ... And [now everyone's] got on blue jeans. ... You can go anywhere you want, and [see] what \"Hair\" did. ... A kind of emancipation, a spiritual emancipation that came from [O'Horgan's] staging. ... \"Hair\" until this date has influenced every single thing that you see ... anywhere in the world, you will see elements of the experimental techniques that \"Hair\" brought not just to Broadway, but to the entire world.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

(An integral square is a square whose sides have integer length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with squaring the circle. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set. The most studied restriction is that the squaring be perfect, meaning the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is squaring the plane, which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.\nPerfect squared squares.\nA \"perfect\" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.\nPerfect squared squares were studied by R. L. Brooks, C. A. B. Smith, A. H. Stone and W. T. Tutte (writing under the collective pseudonym \"Blanche Descartes\") at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938. They transformed the square tiling into an equivalent electrical circuit \u2013 they called it a \"Smith diagram\" \u2013 by considering the squares as resistors that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied Kirchhoff's circuit laws and circuit decomposition techniques to that circuit. The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.\nThe first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by Roland Sprague in 1939.\nMartin Gardner published an extensive article written by W. T. Tutte about the early history of squaring the square in his \"Mathematical Games\" column of November 1958.\nSimple squared squares.\nA \"simple\" squared square is one where no subset of more than one of the squares forms a rectangle or square. When a squared square has a square or rectangular subset, it is \"compound\".\nIn 1978, A. J. W. Duijvestijn discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal. This squared square forms the logo of the Trinity Mathematical Society. It also appears on the cover of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory.\nDuijvestijn also found two simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. Theophilus Harding Willcocks, an amateur mathematician and fairy chess composer, found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these three are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.\nThe perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, Pasquale Joseph Federico and P. Leeuw mathematically proved it to be the lowest-order example.\nMrs. Perkins's quilt.\nWhen the constraint of all the squares being different sizes is relaxed, a squared square such that the side lengths of the smaller squares do not have a common divisor larger than 1 is called a \"Mrs. Perkins's quilt\". In other words, the greatest common divisor of all the smaller side lengths should be 1. The Mrs. Perkins's quilt problem asks for a Mrs. Perkins's quilt with the fewest pieces for a given formula_1 square. The number of pieces required is at least formula_2, and at most formula_3. Computer searches have found exact solutions for small values of formula_4 (small enough to need up to 18 pieces). For formula_5 the number of pieces required is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNo more than two different sizes.\nFor any integer formula_4 other than 2, 3, and 5, it is possible to dissect a square into formula_4 squares of one or two different sizes.\nSquaring the plane.\nIn 1975, Solomon Golomb raised the question whether the whole plane can be tiled by squares, one of each integer edge-length, which he called the heterogeneous tiling conjecture. This problem was later publicized by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column and appeared in several books, but it defied solution for over 30 years.\nIn \"Tilings and patterns\", published in 1987, Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum and G. C. Shephard describe a way of tiling of the plane by integral squares by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square. The recursive scaling process increases the sizes of the squares exponentially \u2013 skipping most integers \u2013 a feature which they note was true of all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time.\nIn 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved Golomb's heterogeneous tiling conjecture: there exists a tiling of the plane by squares, one of each integer size. Their proof is constructive and proceeds by \"puffing up\" an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.\nCubing the cube.\nCubing the cube is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a cube \"C\", the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.\nUnlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a rectangular cuboid \"C\" into a finite number of unequal cubes.\nTo prove this, we start with the following claim: for any perfect dissection of a \"rectangle\" in squares, the smallest square in this dissection does not lie on an edge of the rectangle. Indeed, each corner square has a smaller adjacent edge square, and the smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge.\nNow suppose that there is a perfect dissection of a rectangular cuboid in cubes. Make a face of \"C\" its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle \"R\" by the cubes which rest on it. The smallest square \"s\"1 in \"R\" is surrounded by \"larger\", and therefore \"higher\", cubes. Hence the upper face of the cube on \"s\"1 is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let \"s\"2 be the smallest square in this dissection. By the claim above, this is surrounded on all 4 sides by squares which are larger than \"s\"2 and therefore higher.\nThe sequence of squares \"s\"1, \"s\"2, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number. This contradicts our original supposition.\nIf a 4-dimensional hypercube could be perfectly hypercubed then its 'faces' would be perfect cubed cubes; this is impossible. Similarly, there is no solution for all cubes of higher dimensions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

ICC had over 30,000 subscribing members in 2005. It was the first Internet chess server and was the largest pay to play chess server in 2005.\nHistory.\nThe first Internet chess server (ICS), programmed by Michael Moore and Richard Nash, was launched on 15 January 1992. Players logged in by telnet, and the board was displayed as ASCII text. Bugs in the server software allowed illegal moves, false checkmates etc. Over time more and more features were added to ICS, such as Elo ratings and a choice of graphical interfaces. The playing pool grew steadily, many of the server bugs were fixed, and players began to have higher expectations for stability.\nLater on in 1992, Daniel Sleator (darooha) volunteered to take over as head programmer, and began a large overhaul of the server code. He addressed, among other issues, the frequent complaint that players would lose blitz games on time due to Internet lag. In 1994, he copyrighted the code, and began receiving purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialize the server. On 1 March 1995, Sleator announced his intentions to commercialize ICS, renaming it the Internet Chess Club, or ICC, and charging a yearly membership fee. The membership is free for players with a Grandmaster or International Master title.\nSome programmers who had worked on the original ICS became unhappy with what they saw as the commoditization of their project. Led by Chris Petroff, they formed the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), which to this day continues to allow everyone to access all features for free.\nOn 29 May 2007, the World Chess Network was bought by the Internet Chess Club. It was then merged with Chess Live, another Internet chess server acquired by Internet Chess Club from GamesParlor. The result of the acquisition and merger was the formation of World Chess Live, a new Internet chess server that merged features of both services. World Chess Live merged into, and become part of, the Internet Chess Club on 19 March 2012. For some years, the Spanish on-line chess portal JaqueMate.org had technological support provided by ICC. The portal closed on 30 April 2013 with members transferred to ICC.\nServices available.\nICC's core service is the facility to play chess games (and a number of chess variants) against other members and computers coupled with a rating system. ICC also offers many different types of tournaments. ICC recently partnered with the United States Chess Federation (USCF) to provide USCF rated online quick and blitz tournaments (these online ratings are separate from the USCF over-the-board quick and blitz rating systems apart from the initial seeding of the online quick and blitz ratings for unrated players). Members can also watch live broadcasts of tournaments with grandmaster commentary on Chess.FM, watch games involving titled players being played on ICC and challenge grandmasters in simultaneous exhibitions. The site also offers access to libraries of games, recorded lectures and private lessons (at additional cost).\nCriticism.\nThe commercialisation of ICC was extensively criticised by users, particularly that Daniel Sleator was charging a subscription to use a system that had been developed by others. Following complaints by students, they were offered a 50% discount.\nThe security of the system was criticised in December 2005 with claims that communications between ICC and users could easily be read and that the timestamping could be defeated.\nInternet Computer Chess Tournament.\nThe Internet Computer Chess Tournament (CCT) was a chess tournament for computer chess programs held from 2000 to 2011. It was organised annually by the Internet Chess Club. The format was a Swiss system varying between 7 and 9 game rounds, with time controls (from CCT7 onwards) of 50 minutes and 3 second increments. The tournament was set to be completed in one weekend. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed precocious talent in the fields of music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met the Futurists.\nHis attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism. It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti's book \"Imbottigliature\" which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. His contribution to the movement was not only his literary works but also the paintings and drawings he produced between 1917 and 1919\u2014the years in which his work was taking on the metaphysical style.\nThe 1920s were a complex period for Conti. He explored Mannerism, Exoticism, Pittura Metafisica, and great historical and religious painting, covering a vast area that can be compared with his keen interest in the theatrical and literary world of Luigi Pirandello, Massimo Bontempelli and Enrico Pea, which led him to found the Viareggio Prize in 1929.\nThe 1930s brought a series of alternating events that created problems in his private life and led to his celebrative paintings. The decade also saw his enforced adhesion to Fascism (joining the Partito Nazionale Fascista), and his inner rebellion against it which transpired from his refusal to join Margherita Sarfatti's Novecento Italiano group and from other episodes when he stepped out of line. New prospects were only opened up to him when he became involved in designing stage sets for the opera house with the foundation of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.\nBy the 1940s, long before the official rediscovery (20 years later) of the Futurist movement, Conti was again working on Futurist subjects and experiments. From 1948 to 1963 he followed the rules of the Order of the Franciscans, though he still continued to paint.\nMany of his works are housed in the Museo Primo Conti (Primo Conti Foundation Museum http://) in the Villa le Coste at Fiesole (near Florence)."}

{"id": "67911", "revid": "16929265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67911", "title": "Busy beaver", "text": "Concept in theoretical computer science\nIn theoretical computer science, the busy beaver game aims to find a terminating program of a given size that (depending on definition) either produces the most output possible, or runs for the longest number of steps. Since an endlessly looping program producing infinite output or running for infinite time is easily conceived, such programs are excluded from the game. Rather than traditional programming languages, the programs used in the game are n-state Turing machines, one of the first mathematical models of computation.\nTuring machines consist of an infinite tape, and a finite set of states which serve as the program's \"source code\". Producing the most output is defined as writing the largest number of 1s on the tape, also referred to as achieving the highest score, and running for the longest time is defined as taking the longest number of steps to halt. The \"n-\"state busy beaver game consists of finding the longest-running or highest-scoring Turing machine which has \"n\" states and eventually halts. Such machines are assumed to start on a blank tape, and the tape is assumed to contain only zeros and ones (a binary Turing machine). The objective of the game is to program a set of transitions between states aiming for the highest score or longest running time while making sure the machine will halt eventually.\nAn n\"-th busy beaver, BB-\"n or simply \"busy beaver\" is a Turing machine that wins the \"n\"-state busy beaver game. Depending on definition, it either attains the highest score (denoted by \u03a3(n)), or runs for the longest time (S(n)), among all other possible \"n\"-state competing Turing machines.\nDeciding the running time or score of the \"n\"th busy beaver is noncomputable. In fact, both the functions \u03a3(n) and S(n) eventually become larger than any computable function. This has implications in computability theory, the halting problem, and complexity theory. The concept of a busy beaver was first introduced by Tibor Rad\u00f3 in his 1962 paper, \"On Non-Computable Functions\".\nOne of the most consequential aspects of the busy beaver game is that, if it were possible to compute the functions \u03a3(n) and S(n) for all \"n\", then this would resolve all mathematical conjectures which can be encoded in the form \"does \u27e8this Turing machine\u27e9 halt\". For example, there is a 25-state Turing machine that checks Goldbach's conjecture for each number and halts on a counterexample; if this machine did not halt after running for S(25) steps, then it must run forever, resolving the conjecture. Many other problems, including the Riemann hypothesis (744 states) and the consistency of ZF set theory (745 states), can be expressed in a similar form, where at most a countably infinite number of cases need to be checked.\nTechnical definition.\nThe \"n\"-state busy beaver game (or BB-\"n\" game), introduced in Tibor Rad\u00f3's 1962 paper, involves a class of Turing machines, each member of which is required to meet the following design specifications:\n\"Running\" the machine consists of starting in the starting state, with the current tape cell being any cell of a blank (all-0) tape, and then iterating the transition function until the Halt state is entered (if ever). If and only if the machine eventually halts, then the number of 1s finally remaining on the tape is called the machine's \"score\". The \"n\"-state busy beaver (BB-\"n\") game is therefore a contest, depending on definition to find such an \"n\"-state Turing machine having the largest possible score or running time.\nExample.\nThe rules for one 1-state Turing machine might be:\nThis Turing machine would move to the right, swapping the value of all the bits it passes. Since the starting tape is all 0s, it would make an unending string of ones. This machine would not be a busy beaver contender because it runs forever on a blank tape.\nFunctions.\nIn his original 1962 paper, Rad\u00f3 defined two functions related to the busy beaver game: the score function \u03a3(n) and the shifts function S(n). Both take a number of Turing machine states formula_1 and output the maximum score attainable by a Turing machine of that number of states by some measure. The score function \u03a3(n) gives the maximum number of 1s an formula_1-state Turing machine can output before halting, while the shifts function S(n) gives the maximum number of shifts (or equivalently steps, because each step includes a shift) that an formula_1-state Turing machine can undergo before halting. He proved that both of these functions were noncomputable, because they each grew faster than any computable function. The function BB(n) has been defined to be either of these functions, so that notation is not used in this article.\nA number of other uncomputable functions can also be defined based on measuring the performance of Turing machines in other ways than time or maximal number of ones. For example:\nThese four functions together stand in the relation formula_6. More functions can also be defined by operating the game on different computing machines, such as 3-symbol Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, the lambda calculus (sequence in the OEIS) or even arbitrary programming languages.\nScore function \u03a3.\nThe score function quantifies the maximum score attainable by a busy beaver on a given measure. This is a noncomputable function, because it grows asymptotically faster than any computable function.\nThe score function, formula_7, is defined so that formula_8 is the maximum attainable score (the maximum number of 1s finally on the tape) among all halting 2-symbol formula_1-state Turing machines of the above-described type, when started on a blank tape.\nIt is clear that formula_10 is a well-defined function: for every \"n\", there are at most finitely many \"n\"-state Turing machines as above, up to isomorphism, hence at most finitely many possible running times.p.\u00a0880\nAccording to the score-based definition, any \"n\"-state 2-symbol Turing machine \"M\" for which \"\u03c3\"(\"M\") = \u03a3(\"n\") (i.e., which attains the maximum score) is called a busy beaver. For each \"n\", there exist at least 4(\"n\" \u2212 1)! \"n\"-state busy beavers. (Given any \"n\"-state busy beaver, another is obtained by merely changing the shift direction in a halting transition, a third by reversing \"all\" shift directions uniformly, and a fourth by reversing the halt direction of the all-swapped busy beaver. Furthermore, a permutation of all states except Start and Halt produces a machine that attains the same score. Theoretically, there could be more than one kind of transition leading to the halting state, but in practice it would be wasteful, because there is only one sequence of state transitions producing the sought-after result.)\nNon-computability.\nRad\u00f3's 1962 paper proved that if formula_11 is any computable function, then \u03a3(\"n\") &gt; \"f\"(\"n\") for all sufficiently large \"n\", and hence that \u03a3 is not a computable function.\nMoreover, this implies that it is undecidable by a general algorithm whether an arbitrary Turing machine is a busy beaver. (Such an algorithm cannot exist, because its existence would allow \u03a3 to be computed, which is a proven impossibility. In particular, such an algorithm could be used to construct another algorithm that would compute \u03a3 as follows: for any given \"n\", each of the finitely many \"n\"-state 2-symbol Turing machines would be tested until an \"n\"-state busy beaver is found; this busy beaver machine would then be simulated to determine its score, which is by definition \u03a3(\"n\").)\nEven though \u03a3(\"n\") is an uncomputable function, there are some small \"n\" for which it is possible to obtain its values and prove that they are correct. It is not hard to show that \u03a3(0) = 0, \u03a3(1) = 1, \u03a3(2) = 4, and with progressively more difficulty it can be shown that \u03a3(3) = 6, \u03a3(4) = 13 and \u03a3(5) = 4098 (sequence in the OEIS). \u03a3(\"n\") has not yet been determined for any instance of \"n\" &gt; 5, although lower bounds have been established (see the Known values section below).\nComplexity and unprovability of \u03a3.\nA variant of Kolmogorov complexity is defined as follows: The \"complexity\" of a number \"n\" is the smallest number of states needed for a BB-class Turing machine that halts with a single block of \"n\" consecutive 1s on an initially blank tape. The corresponding variant of Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that, in the context of a given axiomatic system for the natural numbers, there exists a number \"k\" such that no specific number can be proven to have complexity greater than \"k\", and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for \u03a3(\"k\") (the latter is because \"the complexity of \"n\" is greater than \"k\"\" would be proven if \"n\" &gt; \u03a3(\"k\") were proven). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of \"ordinary mathematics\" the least value \"k\" for which this is true is far less than 10\u21c810; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any upper-bound of \u03a3(10\u21c810) can be proven. (G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form \u03a3(10\u21c810) = \"n\", and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form \u03a3(10\u21c810) &lt; \"n\".)\nMaximum shifts function \"S\".\nIn addition to the function \u03a3, Rad\u00f3 [1962] introduced another extreme function for Turing machines, the maximum shifts function, \"S\", defined as follows:\nBecause normal Turing machines are required to have a shift in each and every transition or \"step\" (including any transition to a Halt state), the max-shifts function is at the same time a max-steps function.\nRad\u00f3 showed that \"S\" is noncomputable for the same reason that \u03a3 is noncomputable \u2013 it grows faster than any computable function. He proved this simply by noting that for each \"n\", \"S\"(\"n\") \u2265 \u03a3(\"n\"). Each shift may write a 0 or a 1 on the tape, while \u03a3 counts a subset of the shifts that wrote a 1, namely the ones that had not been overwritten by the time the Turing machine halted; consequently, \"S\" grows at least as fast as \u03a3, which had already been proved to grow faster than any computable function.\nThe following connection between \u03a3 and \"S\" was used by Lin &amp; Rad\u00f3 (\"Computer Studies of Turing Machine Problems\", 1965) to prove that \u03a3(3) = 6 and that S(3)=21: For a given \"n\", if \"S\"(\"n\") is known then all \"n\"-state Turing machines can (in principle) be run for up to \"S\"(\"n\") steps, at which point any machine that has not yet halted will never halt. At that point, by observing which machines have halted with the most 1s on the tape (i.e., the busy beavers), one obtains from their tapes the value of \u03a3(\"n\"). The approach used by Lin &amp; Rad\u00f3 for the case of \"n\" = 3 was to conjecture that \"S\"(3) = 21 (after unsuccessfully conjecturing 18), then to simulate all the essentially different 3-state machines (82,944 machines, equal to 21034) for up to 21 steps. They found 26,073 machines that halted, including one that halted only after 21 steps. By analyzing the behavior of the machines that had not halted within 21 steps, they succeeded in showing that none of those machines would ever halt, most of them following a certain pattern. This proved the conjecture that \"S\"(3) = 21, and also determined that \u03a3(3) = 6, which was attained by several machines, all halting after 11 to 14 steps.\nIn 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson obtained the first (explicit) upper bound on the minimum \"n\" for which S(\"n\") is unprovable in ZFC. To do so they constructed a 7910-state Turing machine whose behavior cannot be proven based on the usual axioms of set theory (Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice), under reasonable consistency hypotheses (stationary Ramsey property). Stefan O'Rear then reduced it to 1919 states, with the dependency on the stationary Ramsey property eliminated, and later to 748 states. In July 2023, Riebel reduced it to 745 states. Further improvements are reported on the https://.\nProof for uncomputability of \"S\"(\"n\") and \u03a3(\"n\").\nSuppose that \"S\"(\"n\") is a computable function and let \"EvalS\" denote a TM, evaluating \"S\"(\"n\"). Given a tape with \"n\" 1s it will produce \"S\"(\"n\") 1s on the tape and then halt. Let \"Clean\" denote a Turing machine cleaning the sequence of 1s initially written on the tape. Let \"Double\" denote a Turing machine evaluating function \"n\" + \"n\". Given a tape with \"n\" 1s it will produce 2\"n\" 1s on the tape and then halt. \nLet us create the composition \"Double\" | \"EvalS\" | \"Clean\" and let \"n\"0 be the number of states of this machine. Let \"Create_n0\" denote a Turing machine creating \"n\"0 1s on an initially blank tape. This machine may be constructed in a trivial manner to have \"n\"0 states (the state \"i\" writes 1, moves the head right and switches to state \"i\" + 1, except the state \"n\"0, which halts). Let \"N\" denote the sum \"n\"0 + \"n\"0.\nLet \"BadS\" denote the composition \"Create_n0\" | \"Double\" | \"EvalS\" | \"Clean\". Notice that this machine has \"N\" states. Starting with an initially blank tape it first creates a sequence of \"n\"0 1s and then doubles it, producing a sequence of \"N\" 1s. Then \"BadS\" will produce \"S\"(\"N\") 1s on tape, and at last it will clear all 1s and then halt. But the phase of cleaning will continue at least \"S\"(\"N\") steps, so the time of working of \"BadS\" is strictly greater than \"S\"(\"N\"), which contradicts to the definition of the function \"S\"(\"n\").\nThe uncomputability of \u03a3(\"n\") may be proved in a similar way. In the above proof, one must exchange the machine \"EvalS\" with \"Eval\u03a3\" and \"Clean\" with \"Increment\" \u2014 a simple TM, searching for a first 0 on the tape and replacing it with 1.\nThe uncomputability of \"S\"(\"n\") can also be established by reference to the blank tape halting problem. The blank tape halting problem is the problem of deciding for any Turing machine whether or not it will halt when started on an empty tape. The blank tape halting problem is equivalent to the standard halting problem and so it is also uncomputable. If \"S\"(\"n\") was computable, then we could solve the blank tape halting problem simply by running any given Turing machine with \"n\" states for \"S\"(\"n\") steps; if it has still not halted, it never will. So, since the blank tape halting problem is not computable, it follows that \"S\"(\"n\") must likewise be uncomputable.\nUncomputability of space(n) and num(n).\nBoth formula_5 and formula_4 functions are uncomputable. This can be shown for formula_5 by noting that every tape square a Turing machine writes a one to, it must also visit: in other words, formula_15. The formula_4 function can be shown to be incomputable by proving, for example, that formula_17: this can be done by designing an \"(3n+3)\"-state Turing machine which simulates the \"n\"-state space champion, and then uses it to write at least formula_5 contiguous ones to the tape.\nGeneralizations.\nAnalogs of the shift function can be simply defined in any programming language, given that the programs can be described by bit-strings, and a program's number of steps can be counted. For example, the busy beaver game can also be generalized to two dimensions using Turing machines on two-dimensional tapes, or to Turing machines that are allowed to stay in the same place as well as move to the left and right. Alternatively a \"busy beaver function\" for diverse models of computation can be defined with Kolmogorov complexity. This is done by taking formula_19 to be the largest integer formula_20 such that formula_21, where formula_22 is the length of the shortest program in formula_23 that outputs formula_20: formula_19 is thereby the largest integer a program with length formula_1 or less can output in formula_23.\nThe longest running 6-state, 2-symbol machine which has the additional property of reversing the tape value at each step produces 1s after steps. So for the Reversal Turing Machine (RTM) class, \"S\"RTM(6) \u2265 and \u03a3RTM(6) \u2265 . Likewise we could define an analog to the \u03a3 function for register machines as the largest number which can be present in any register on halting, for a given number of instructions.\nDifferent numbers of symbols.\nA simple generalization is the extension to Turing machines with \"m\" symbols instead of just two (0 and 1). For example, a trinary Turing machine with \"m\" = 3 symbols would have the symbols 0, 1, and 2. The generalization to Turing machines with \"n\" states and \"m\" symbols defines the following generalized busy beaver functions:\nFor example, the longest-running 3-state 3-symbol machine found so far runs steps before halting.\nNondeterministic Turing machines.\nThe problem can be extended to nondeterministic Turing machines by looking for the system with the most states across all branches or the branch with the longest number of steps. The question of whether a given NDTM will halt is still computationally irreducible, and the computation required to find an NDTM busy beaver is significantly greater than the deterministic case, since there are multiple branches that need to be considered. For a 2-state, 2-color system with \"p\" cases or rules, the table to the right gives the maximum number of steps before halting and maximum number of unique states created by the NDTM.\nApplications.\nOpen mathematical problems.\nIn addition to posing a rather challenging mathematical game, the busy beaver functions \u03a3(n) and \"S\"(\"n\") offer an entirely new approach to solving pure mathematics problems. Many open problems in mathematics could in theory, but not in practice, be solved in a systematic way given the value of \"S\"(\"n\") for a sufficiently large \"n\". Theoretically speaking, the value of S(n) encodes the answer to all mathematical conjectures that can be checked in infinite time by a Turing machine with less than or equal to \"n\" states.\nConsider any formula_28 conjecture: any conjecture that could be disproven via a counterexample among a countable number of cases (e.g. Goldbach's conjecture). Write a computer program that sequentially tests this conjecture for increasing values. In the case of Goldbach's conjecture, we would consider every even number \u2265 4 sequentially and test whether or not it is the sum of two prime numbers. Suppose this program is simulated on an \"n\"-state Turing machine. If it finds a counterexample (an even number \u2265 4 that is not the sum of two primes in our example), it halts and indicates that. However, if the conjecture is true, then our program will never halt. (This program halts \"only\" if it finds a counterexample.)\nNow, this program is simulated by an \"n\"-state Turing machine, so if we know \"S\"(\"n\") we can decide (in a finite amount of time) whether or not it will ever halt by simply running the machine that many steps. And if, after \"S\"(\"n\") steps, the machine does not halt, we know that it never will and thus that there are no counterexamples to the given conjecture (i.e., no even numbers that are not the sum of two primes). This would prove the conjecture to be true. Thus specific values (or upper bounds) for \"S\"(\"n\") could be, in theory, used to systematically solve many open problems in mathematics.\nHowever, current results on the busy beaver problem suggest that this will not be practical for two reasons:\nConsistency of theories.\nAnother property of S(n) is that no arithmetically sound, computably axiomatized theory can prove all of the function's values. Specifically, given a computable and arithmetically sound theory formula_32, there is a number formula_33 such that for all formula_34, no statement of the form formula_35 can be proved in formula_32. This implies that for each theory there is a specific largest value of S(n) that it can prove. This is true because for every such formula_32, a Turing machine with formula_33 states can be designed to enumerate every possible proof in formula_32. If the theory is inconsistent, then all false statements are provable, and the Turing machine can be given the condition to halt if, and only if, it finds a proof of, for example, formula_40. Any theory that proves the value of formula_41 proves its own consistency, violating G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem. This can be used to place various theories on a scale, for example the various large cardinal axioms in ZFC: if each theory formula_32 is assigned as its number formula_33, theories with larger values of formula_33 prove the consistency of those below them, placing all such theories on a countably infinite scale.\nPhysical Church\u2013Turing thesis.\nThe growth properties of the Busy Beaver function have implications for the behaviour of physical systems, assuming the truth of the physical Church\u2013Turing thesis. If the physical Church\u2013Turing thesis holds, and all physically computable functions are Turing-computable, then no directly measurable physical quantity can grow faster than the Busy Beaver function, as no Turing-computable function can grow faster than it. Simple functions of formula_46 would also impose a lower limit on growth rates, as well as upper and lower bounds on rates of convergence.\nKnown results.\nLower bounds.\nGreen machines.\nIn 1964 Milton Green developed a lower bound for the 1s-counting variant of the busy beaver function that was published in the proceedings of the 1964 IEEE symposium on switching circuit theory and logical design. Heiner Marxen and J\u00fcrgen Buntrock described it as \"a non-trivial (not primitive recursive) lower bound\". This lower bound can be calculated but is too complex to state as a single expression in terms of \"n\". This was done with a set of Turing machines, each of which demonstrated the lower bound for a certain n. When \"n\" \n 8 the method gives\nformula_47\nIn contrast, the best current (as of 2024) lower bound on formula_48 is formula_49, where each formula_50 is Knuth's up-arrow notation. This represents formula_30, an exponentiated chain of 15 tens. The value of formula_52 is probably much larger than that.\nGreen's lower bound was shown by a recursive construction of a series of Turing machines, each of which was made of a smaller one with two additional states that repeatedly applied the smaller machine to the input tape. Defining the value of the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-state busy-beaver competitor on a tape containing formula_20 ones to be formula_54 (the ultimate output of each machine being its value on formula_55, because a blank tape has 0 ones), the recursion relations are as follows:\nformula_56\nThis leads to two formulas for calculating the lower bound formula_57 given by the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;th machine:\nformula_58\nGreen's lower bound &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can also be related to the Ackermann function. In particular,\nformula_59\nfor all positive integers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nRelationships between busy beaver functions.\nTrivially, \"S\"(\"n\") \u2265 \u03a3(\"n\") because a machine that writes \u03a3(\"n\") ones must take at least \u03a3(\"n\") steps to do so. It is possible to give a number of upper bounds on the time \"S\"(\"n\") with the number of ones \u03a3(\"n\"):\nBy defining num(\"n\") to be the maximum number of ones an n-state Turing machine is allowed to output contiguously, rather than in any position (the largest unary number it can output), it is possible to show that\nformula_63\nBen-Amram and Petersen, 2002, also give an asymptotically improved bound on \"S\"(\"n\"). There exists a constant c such that for all \"n\" \u2265 2,\nformula_64\nExact values and lower and upper bounds.\nThe following table lists the exact values and some known lower bounds for \"S\"(\"n\"), \u03a3(\"n\"), and several other busy beaver functions. In this table, 2-symbol Turing machines are used. Entries listed as \"?\" are at least as large as other entries to the left (because all n-state machines are also (n+1) state machines), and no larger than entries above them (because S(n) \u2265 space(n) \u2265 \u03a3(n) \u2265 num(n)). So, space(6) is known to be greater than 2formula_655, as space(n) \u2265 \u03a3(n) and \u03a3(6) &gt; 2formula_655. is an upper bound for space(5), because S(5) = () and S(n) \u2265 space(n). 4098 is an upper bound for num(5), because \u03a3(5) = 4098 and \u03a3(n) \u2265 num(n). The last entry listed as \"?\" is num(6), because \u03a3(6) &gt; 2formula_655, but \u03a3(n) \u2265 num(n), same for num(7).\nThe 5-state busy beaver was discovered by Heiner Marxen and J\u00fcrgen Buntrock in 1989, but only proved to be the winning fifth busy beaver in 2024 using a proof in Rocq.\nList of busy beavers.\nThese are tables of rules for Turing machines that generate \u03a3(1) and \"S\"(1), \u03a3(2) and \"S\"(2), \u03a3(3) (but not \"S\"(3)), \u03a3(4) and \"S\"(4), \u03a3(5) and \"S\"(5), and the best known lower bound for \u03a3(6) and \"S\"(6).\nIn the tables, columns represent the current state and rows represent the current symbol read from the tape. Each table entry is a string of three characters, indicating the symbol to write onto the tape, the direction to move, and the new state (in that order). The halt state is shown as H.\nEach machine begins in state A with an infinite tape that contains all 0s. Thus, the initial symbol read from the tape is a 0.\nResult key: (starts at the position overlined, halts at the position underlined)\nResult: 0 0 1 0 0 (1 step, one \"1\" total)\nResult: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (6 steps, four \"1\"s total)\nResult: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 (14 steps, six \"1\"s total).\nThis is one of several nonequivalent machines giving six 1s. Unlike the previous machines, this one is a busy beaver for \u03a3, but not for \"S\". (\"S\"(3) = 21, and the machine obtains only five 1s.)\nResult: 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 (107 steps, thirteen \"1\"s total)\nResult: 4098 \"1\"s with 8191 \"0\"s interspersed in 47,176,870 steps.\nNote in the image to the right how this solution is similar qualitatively to the evolution of some cellular automata.\nResult: 1 0 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 (\"10\" followed by more than 10\u2191\u219115 contiguous \"1\"s in more than 10\u2191\u219115 steps, where 10\u2191\u219115=1010..10, an exponential tower of 15 tens).\nVisualizations.\nIn the following table, the rules for each busy beaver (maximizing \u03a3) are represented visually, with orange squares corresponding to a \"1\" on the tape, and white corresponding to \"0\". The position of the head is indicated by the black ovoid, with the orientation of the head representing the state. Individual tapes are laid out horizontally, with time progressing from top to bottom. The halt state is represented by a rule which maps one state to itself (head doesn't move).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were married circa 9 AD, when he was 18 years old. Suetonius writes that they were divorced in 24 AD on the grounds of her scandalous love affairs and the suspicion of murder. \nFamily.\nUrgulanilla was a member of the Plautia gens. She was of Etruscan descent.\nHer father was Marcus Plautius Silvanus, the consul for the year 2 BC, and a decorated general, honoured with triumphal ornaments for his successes in the Bellum Batonianum or Great Illyrian Revolt in 12 AD. He had served beside Tiberius. Her paternal grandmother was Urgulania, after whom Urgulanilla was named; her maternal grandmother was also a close friend of the Empress Livia Drusilla.\nHer mother was named Lartia and was the daughter of Gnaeus Lartius.\nUrgulanilla had three attested siblings:\nThrough her family Urgulanilla was well-connected, but her marriage to Claudius was not a splendid match for a member of the imperial family; rather, it came about as consequence of the unfortunate fates of the other candidates. Claudius broke off his first engagement after Julia the Younger, the mother of his fianc\u00e9e Aemilia Lepida, fell into disgrace, and his second fianc\u00e9e Livia Medullina died on their wedding day.\nClaudius and Urgulanilla were married circa 9 AD.\nUrgulanilla had two attested children: \nMurder of Apronia.\nThe murder in which Urgulanilla is supposed to have participated was that of her sister-in-law, Apronia, who was the second wife of Urgulanilla's brother, Marcus Plautius Silvanus. However, none of the existing ancient writings makes clear how she was involved, and the details provided by Tacitus seem to imply she could not have been personally involved at all. Plautius Silvanus was first married to Fabia Numantina; however, at some time before 24 AD, they had divorced, and he had married Apronia, a daughter of Lucius Apronius. In 24 AD, Plautius Silvanus was accused of murdering Apronia \"for reasons not ascertained\" by throwing her out of a window in that year. Silvanus responded by claiming that he was asleep when the event had occurred, and was totally unaware of the circumstances leading to her death, saying that she had perhaps committed suicide. The murder was investigated by the Emperor Tiberius who, having investigated the couple's bedroom, discovered proof of a scuffle, and therefore referred the case to the Senate for trial, thus implying that he believed Silvanus to be guilty. However, Silvanus' grandmother, Urgulania, sent him a dagger, encouraging him to commit suicide, which he duly did. Shortly after the murder of Apronia, Fabia Numantina was \"charged with having caused her husband's insanity by magical incantations and potions\" but was acquitted.\nIn fiction.\nUrgulanilla appears as a significant character in \"I, Claudius\" by Robert Graves. She was played by Jennifer Croxton in the BBC TV adaptation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the first of four Hollywood films that depicted the role of the Strategic Air Command in the Cold War era.\n\"Strategic Air Command\" was the second film released in Paramount's new widescreen format, VistaVision, in color by Technicolor and Perspecta pseudo-stereo sound. It would also be Stewart and Mann's eighth and final collaboration and the last of three films that paired Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, the others being \"The Stratton Story\" and \"The Glenn Miller Story\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nIn 1952, Robert \"Dutch\" Holland is a professional baseball player with the St. Louis Cardinals. A B-29 bomber pilot in the Pacific theater during World War II, Holland retains a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force Reserve, but is on inactive, non-drilling status.\nDuring spring training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, he is visited by a former World War II squadron mate, now-Major General \"Rusty\" Castle, who is visiting nearby MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida for meetings. Inviting Rusty to a party that Dutch and his wife, Sally, are hosting at their St. Petersburg home that evening, Rusty informs Dutch that he is being recalled to active duty for 21 months, a decision that was made well above Rusty's level. Dutch subsequently reports to his posting at Carswell Air Force Base, a bomber base in Fort Worth, Texas, to qualify in the Convair B-36. He arrives in a civilian business suit, for which he is later rebuked by General Hawkes, the commander of SAC who is making a no-notice inspection of Carswell, and replies that his uniforms are \"the wrong color\" (i.e., implying that Dutch has been inactive at least since the Air Force replaced the brown United States Army Air Forces uniform with a distinctive blue service dress uniform, which had occurred years earlier in 1949).\nHolland is given a staff job with the 11th Bombardment Wing at Carswell that involves a lot of flying. He soon has a B-36 crew of his own, selecting a former World War II colleague as his flight engineer, and becomes enamored with both flying and the role of SAC in deterring war. He is joined by Sally, who had not bargained on being an Air Force wife, and who struggles with his repeated absences and the dangers of military flying. On any given night, Holland might find his aircraft on airborne alert far from the continental United States, in secret, only telling his wife when he returns days later. Even so, Sally tells Dutch that she is happy as long as they can be together, no matter what he decides to do with his life.\nThe B-36 is a complex aircraft when introduced, but improvements are under constant development. One challenge was leakage from the fuel tanks, but a new fix is introduced to permanently resolve the issue. On their next flight, Holland's crew has to fly their B-36 from Carswell AFB to Thule Air Base, Greenland. The fix does not work and one of the engines bursts into flame, causing the entire left wing to catch fire. The crew is forced to abandon the aircraft and bail out over the ice and snow of Greenland before arriving at Thule while Holland and his radar navigator stay on board for a forced landing on the Greenland ice cap, which causes Holland to injure his right shoulder.\nHolland becomes a favorite of General Hawkes, and he is rewarded with a revised assignment flying the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet at MacDill Air Force Base, across the bay from St. Petersburg where his old baseball team continues to conduct its spring training. Promoted to \"full bird\" colonel and made deputy wing commander of his B-47 wing at MacDill AFB, Dutch decides, to Sally's displeasure, to remain in the Air Force, rather than return to baseball at the end of his active duty obligation.\nOn a full B-47 wing deployment exercise that involves flying nonstop from MacDill to Yokota Air Base in Japan, Dutch's crew encounters severe wind and storms. Low on fuel, they divert to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. As they prepare to land, Holland realizes that his shoulder injury from the B-36 crash was worse than he thought, and his arm is almost immobile. He is unable to operate the engine power levers (throttles) during final landing phase, and he has to rely on his co-pilot to do so, while Holland works the flight controls with his left arm and both feet.\nThis injury bars Holland from further military flying and also appears to threaten his professional baseball career. Following the near-mishap, Dutch is ordered to report to General Hawkes at SAC Headquarters at Offutt AFB, Nebraska. General Hawkes chastises Dutch for flying the MacDill to Yokota mission with a debilitating physical condition but also commends him for his service and devotion to SAC's mission. General Hawkes advises Dutch that he can remain in the Air Force, but it would be limited to a non-flying staff officer capacity, which Dutch declines, accepting a medical release from active duty instead. General Hawkes tells Dutch that he doesn't blame him for declining but reminds Dutch that he plus the thousands of other Air Force Reservists who have been recalled to active duty with SAC for roughly two-year periods has been essential for SAC executing its deterrence mission and that Dutch's time with SAC was a major part of the command's success. Given Dutch's shoulder injury likely negating his return to a career as a Major League Baseball player, General Hawkes suggests that he would make an excellent team manager and the St. Louis Cardinals ball club should consider him for such. The film closes with General Hawkes pointing out his office window at a fly-by of the newest combat-qualified wing of B-47s as Dutch and Sally look on.\nProduction.\nIn real life, during World War II, Stewart had been an Army Air Forces B-17 instructor pilot, a B-24 squadron commander, and a bomb group operations officer, completing 20 combat missions over Europe and having been twice awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. At the time of filming, Stewart, much like the character he portrays, was also a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, serving with the Strategic Air Command when on duty and at the time was qualified as a pilot on the B-47, although much of the B-47 flying was performed by his friend and fellow Air Force pilot, Major (later Colonel) A.W. Blizzard Jr.\nStewart's military service and lifelong interest in aviation greatly influenced the making of the film. He pushed for an authentic but sympathetic portrayal of the Strategic Air Command, which led Paramount to put together a strong cast of Hollywood veterans and production people including June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy, director Anthony Mann, and the top stunt pilot of the day, Paul Mantz. The film accurately portrays (from the perspective of the 1952 starting point of the script) the duties and responsibilities of an Air Force strategic bomber pilot, and the demands such service places on family life.\nMann later said the film, \"...was to promote the Air Force and the idea of SAC which in itself had its own restrictions, just being a military subject. Therefore, the cooperation of the Air Force was vital, and we were held within the bounds of what they wanted. The story itself was restricted and the whole concept of its shooting was confined to what they would let me show, which is perfectly all right. I went into it purely as a service to the Air Force, and as Jimmy Stewart was of the Force, we accepted this handicap and just tried to make an exciting film, not out of the characters which were paper-mache, but out of the B-36 and B-47 - we tried to dramatic them as our two great characters.\"\nThe film includes dramatic aerial photography, credited to Thomas Tutwiler, for which it was awarded a special citation by the American National Board of Review. It is also the only motion picture to highlight the Convair B-36 (depicted in the theatrical release poster), the largest mass-produced piston-powered aircraft ever built, and the first bomber for the hydrogen bomb. The propeller-driven B-36 was then near the end of its service life and was about to be replaced by the jet-powered B-47 Stratojet, followed by the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The aerial footage was accompanied by a dramatic and soaring musical score composed by Victor Young.\nThe film was made with the full cooperation of the U.S. Air Force, and it was filmed partly on location at MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida; Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, and Carswell Air Force Base, Texas.\nThe baseball scenes were filmed with the cooperation of the St. Louis Cardinals at their spring training home of Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, just across Tampa Bay from MacDill AFB.\nStewart's character is based on the real-life military career and an actual mission flown by Brigadier General Clifford Schoeffler, who crashed during an Arctic B-36 mission and survived. Brigadier General Schoeffler was on site at Carswell Air Force Base during the filming of \"Strategic Air Command\" as a consultant.\nSome commentators have speculated that the plot was inspired by Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams, a World War II combat veteran and Marine Corps Reserve officer, who was recalled to active duty for Korean War service as a Naval Aviator with the U.S. Marine Corps at the height of his baseball career.\nReception.\nThe Storz Mansion in Omaha, Nebraska, was the scene of opulent parties celebrating the film. Its premiere was held in Omaha, the home of Offutt AFB and of SAC Headquarters. The premiere party was held at the Mansion, with guests that included Stewart and Allyson, as well as the Strategic Air Command commander, General Curtis LeMay.\nShot in the new VistaVision process, the film was the sixth highest-grossing film of 1955. Critics were lukewarm about the performances of all except for Stewart, who was called \"capable\", \"charming\", and \"competent\". \nPublic reaction centered on the spectacular aerial footage, so much so that the B-36 and B-47 aircraft were arguably the real stars of the film. Its release led to a 25 percent increase in Air Force enlistments.\n\"Strategic Air Command\" was later followed by two additional military aviation films that were also supportive of SAC's mission, \"Bombers B-52\" (1957), and \"A Gathering of Eagles\" (1963).\nThe B-47 cockpit used in the film is now on display at the March Field Air Museum at March Air Reserve Base (former March AFB) in Riverside, California.\nHome media.\nIn October 2016, \"Strategic Air Command\" was released by Olive Films on DVD and Blu-ray.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term genital enhancement seem to be generally used for genital modifications that modify the external aspect, the way the patient wants it. The term genital mutilation is used for genital modifications that drastically diminish the recipient's quality of life and result in adverse health outcomes, whether physical or mental. Mutilations are sometimes performed without consent or on people who cannot consent such as children and the mentally disabled.\nReasons.\nBody modification.\nVoluntary.\nMany types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons.\nSocial acceptance for male intimate cosmetic surgery seem to have happened around the 2010s, decades after other types of cosmetic surgeries.\nPenile subincision, or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of Indigenous Australians. This procedure has taken root in Western body modification culture, the modern primitives. Meatotomy is a form that involves splitting of the glans penis alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.\nGenital piercings and genital tattooing may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings can have the benefit of increasing sexual pleasure for the pierced individual or their sex partners.\nSimilarly, pearling involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, genital scarification is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding decorative scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.\nClitoris enlargement may be achieved temporarily through the use of a clitoral pump, or it may be achieved permanently through the application or injection of testosterone. Penis enlargement is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.\nGender-affirming surgery.\nPeople who are transgender may undergo gender-affirming surgery to alter their genitals to match their gender identity. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries.\nSome of the surgical procedures are vaginoplasty (creation of a vagina) and vulvoplasty (creation of a vulva) for trans women and metoidioplasty (elongation of the clitoris), phalloplasty (creation of a penis), and scrotoplasty (creation of a scrotum) for trans men. Trans women may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery, while some trans men may have liposuction to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs. Hijra, a third gender found in the Indian subcontinent, may opt to undergo castration. In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned without their consent due to genital injury, including David Reimer, who was the subject of John Money's John/Joan case. Similarly, intersex people often benefit from gender-affirming surgeries but are also sometimes subjected to them without consent in a violation of intersex human rights. The specialized term is intersex medical interventions.\nNontherapeutic.\nThe following types of unvoluntary genital cutting or surgery are sometimes performed on children for nontherapeutic (medically unnecessary) reasons: clitoral reduction surgeries on children with CAH,24 hypospadias surgeries,24 removal of internal gonads24 and penile circumcision.24 In some societies, other types of endosex girl genital cutting happen.22\nThey can be done for psychosocial, cultural, subjective-aesthetic, or prophylactic perceived benefits, as judged by doctors or parents.11722\nPenile subincision, or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of Indigenous Australian children. This procedure has been adapted for adults in Western body modification culture, the modern primitives. Meatotomy is a form that involves splitting of the glans penis alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.\nIntersex.\nIntersex children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to \"normalize\" the appearance of their genitalia.\nThese surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them infertile. For example, in cases involving male children with micropenis, doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female. The Intersex Society of North America objects to elective surgeries performed on people without their informed consent on grounds that such surgeries subject patients to unnecessary harm and risk.\nAs sexual violence.\nGenital mutilation is common in some situations of war or armed conflict, with perpetrators using violence against the genitals of men, women, and non-binary people. These different forms of sexual violence can terrorize targeted individuals and communities, prevent individuals from reproducing, and cause tremendous pain and psychological anguish for victims. Many wars, religious conquests, and genocides have involved forced circumcision. A related practice is killing people based on their circumcision status, notably in the Bangladesh genocide and recently in the 2025 India-Pakistan Crisis.\nAs treatment.\nIf the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo vaginectomy or vulvectomy (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo penectomy or orchiectomy (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). Reconstructive surgery may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in gender-affirming surgery.\nDuring childbirth, an episiotomy (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.\nHymenotomy is the surgical perforation of an imperforate hymen. It may be performed to allow menstruation to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of their hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate sexual penetration of their vagina.\nSelf-inflicted.\nA person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as castration, penectomy, or clitoridectomy. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due personal crisis related to mental illness, self-mutilation, body dysmorphia, or social reasons. Not all regions have proper transgender health care or gender-affirming surgeries available, which can lead to people attempting self-surgery.\nFemale.\nFemale genital mutilation.\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to \"all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other surgery of the female genital organs whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons.\" It is not the same as the procedures used in gender-affirming surgery or the genital modification of intersex persons.\nIt is practiced in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, most of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated. Over eight million have been infibulated, a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. Infibulation, the most extreme form of FGM (known as Type III), consists of the removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva, while a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood; afterwards the vagina will be opened after the wedding for sexual intercourse and childbirth (see episiotomy). In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights organizations. The Istanbul Convention prohibits FGM (Article 38).\nFGM is considered a form of violence against women by the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1993; it states: \"Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including ... female genital mutilation ...\". However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.\nHymenorrhaphy.\nHymenorrhaphy refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female virginity at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not a virgin when her marriage was consummated. Individuals who are victims of rape, who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.\nLabia stretching.\nLabia stretching is the act of elongating the \"labia minora\" through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights). It is a familial cultural practice in Rwanda, common in Sub-Saharan Africa, and a body modification practice elsewhere. It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.\nVulvoplasty and vaginoplasty.\nCosmetic surgery of female genitalia, known as \"elective genitoplasty\", has become pejoratively known as \"designer vagina\". In May 2007, an article published in the \"British Medical Journal\" strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences. Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.\nSome women undergo vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty procedures to alter the shape of their vulvas to meet personal or societal aesthetic standards. The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as \"designer vagina\".\nIn the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their labia minora. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a \"good looking vagina\" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well. Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vulva more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in vulvo- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed \"acceptable\".\nClitoral hood reduction.\nClitoral hood reduction is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an elective plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size and the area of the clitoral hood (prepuce) in order to further expose the glans of the clitoris; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her vulva. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a labiaplasty procedure for reducing the labia minora; and occasionally within a vaginoplasty procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of female genital mutilation.\nMale.\nCastration.\nCastration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the testicles. Occasionally the term is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. It should not be confused with chemical castration.\nThe removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as \"unilateral castration\") is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.\nCircumcision.\nCircumcision is the removal of the foreskin, the double-layered fold of skin, mucosal and muscular tissue at the distal end of the human penis. Around half of all circumcisions worldwide are performed for reasons of preventive healthcare; half for religious or cultural reasons. Circumcision involves either a conventional \"cut and stitch\" surgical procedure or use of a circumcision instrument or device. Complications are rare. Modern proponents say that circumcision reduces the risks of a range of infections and diseases and confers sexual benefits. Opponents, particularly of routine neonatal circumcision, question its preventive efficacy and object to subjecting non-consenting newborn males to a procedure that is potentially harmful, in their view, with little to no benefit, as well as violating their human rights and possibly negatively impacting their sex life. There is a consensus among the world's major medical organizations and in the academic literature that circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in high-risk populations if carried out by medical professionals under safe conditions. They hold variant perspectives on the prophylactic efficacy of the elective circumcision of minors in developed nations.\nForeskin restoration.\nForeskin restoration and reconstruction are techniques for the recreation of the foreskin after its removal by circumcision or injury.\nSurgical reconstruction often involves grafting skin taken from the scrotum onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical restoration involves tissue expansion by stretching the penile skin forward over the glans penis with the aid of tension, either by hand or with a restoration device.\nInfibulation.\n\"Infibulation\" literally means \"to close with a clasp or a pin.\u201d The word is used to include suturing of the foreskin over the head of the penis.\nEarly Greek infibulation consisted of tying the most distal portion of the foreskin with to conceal the glans. The kynodesm\u0113 was also used by the Etruscans and Romans (ligatura praeputii), but the Romans preferred to apply a gold, silver, or bronze ring (\"annulus\"), a metal clasp (\"fibula\") or pin. Use of a kynodesm\u0113 may also permanently lengthen the foreskin over time which was seen as proper and desirable.\nIn modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of BDSM.\nEmasculation.\nEmasculation is the removal of both the penis and the testicles, the external male sex organs. It differs from castration, which is the removal of the testicles only, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\nGenital nullification is a procedure practiced in a body modification subculture made up mostly of men who have had their genitals surgically removed. Those undergoing the procedure often go by the name of nullos, and are not necessarily transgender or nonbinary; some identify as eunuchs. The term \"nullo\" is short for \"genital nullification\". Though the procedure is mostly sought by men, female genital mutilation may be referred to as clitoral nullification.\nIn modern-day South Asia, some members of hijra communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called \"nirwaan\" and seen as a rite of passage.\nIt was part of the eunuch-making of the Chinese court, and it was widespread in the Arab slave trade. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.\nPearling.\nPearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals\u2014of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of the receptive partner(s) during vaginal or anal intercourse.\nPenectomy.\nPenectomy involves the partial or total amputation of the penis. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with castration, or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on eunuchs and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a harem. The hijra of India may remove their penis as an expression of their gender identity. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of gangrene or cancer.\nIn the ulwaluko circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.\nIn the United States In 1907 Bertha Boronda sliced off her husband's penis with a straight razor. Lorena Bobbit infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In the latter case, the use of microsurgery was able to reattach Bobbitt's penis.\nPenile subincision/meatotomy.\nPenile subincision is a form of genital modification involving a urethrotomy and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the meatus towards to the base. It was performed on children by people of some cultures, such as the Indigenous Australians, the Arrente, the Luritja, the Samburu, the Samoans, and the Native Hawaiians. Indigenous Australians also perform circumcision as a prerequisite for subincision. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after ejaculation), and may require a man to sit down while urinating. When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, exsanguination, or permanent damage are major concerns.\nPenile superincision.\nA rectal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the glans penis without removing skin or tissue.\nThe practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to circumcision when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The spices and flavors vary but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, mustard and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger. Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment for dishes that are usually served hot, and are fried or greasy: e.g., french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat.\nKetchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.\nNomenclature.\nTerminology.\nThe term used for the sauce varies. \"Ketchup\" is the dominant term in American English and Canadian English, although \"catsup\" is commonly used in some southern US states and Mexico.\nIn Canada and the US, \"tomato sauce\" is not a synonym for ketchup but is a sauce made from tomatoes and commonly used in making sauce for pasta.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the word \"ketchup\" is unclear; there are multiple competing theories:\nAmoy theory.\nA popular folk etymology is that the word came from the Amoy (Xiamen) region of China into English, as a borrowed word \u8304\u6c41 (, Cantonese, meaning \"tomato sauce\"; the character means 'eggplant'; \"tomato\" in Chinese is , so the phrase literally translates to \"foreign eggplant sauce\"). \nAnother theory among academics is that the word derives from one of two words from Hokkien of the Fujian region of coastal southern China: \"k\u00f4e-chiap\" (in the Amoy / Xiamen dialect and Quanzhou dialect) or \"k\u00ea-chiap\" (in the Zhangzhou dialect). Both of these pronunciations of the same word (, / ) come from the Quanzhou dialect, Amoy dialect, and Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien, respectively, where it meant the brine of pickled fish or shellfish (, 'pickled food' (usually seafood) + , 'juice'). There are citations of in the \"Chinese-English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy\" (1873) by Carstairs Douglas, defined as \"brine of pickled fish or shell-fish.\"\nMalay theory.\n\"Ketchup\" may have entered the English language from the Malay word (, sometimes spelled or ). Originally meaning \"soy sauce\", the word itself derives from Chinese.\nIn Indonesian cuisine, which is similar to Malay, the term refers to fermented savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: , which translates to \"salty \" in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and or \"sweet \" in Indonesian. is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy. A third type, , meaning \"fish \" is fish sauce similar to the Thai \"nam pla\" or the Philippine \"patis\". It is not, however, soy-based.\nEuropean-Arabic theory.\nAmerican anthropologist E.\u00a0N. Anderson relies on Elizabeth David to claim that \"ketchup\" is a cognate of the French escav\u00e8che, meaning \"food in sauce\". The word also exists in Spanish and Portuguese forms as \"escabeche\", \"a sauce for pickling\", which culinary historian Karen Hess traced back to Arabic , or \"pickling with vinegar\". The term was anglicized to \"caveach\", a word first attested in the late 17th century, at the same time as \"ketchup\".\nEarly uses in English.\nThe word entered the English language in Britain during the late 17th century, appearing in print as \"ketchup\" (1682), \"catchup\" (1690), and later as \"catsup\" (1730). The following is a list of early quotations collected by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and others.\nHistory.\nThe term \"ketchup\" first appeared in 1682. Recipes for many types of ketchup began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. \nMushroom ketchup.\nIn the United Kingdom, from the 1600s ketchup was prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than tomatoes. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies.\nTomato ketchup.\nJames Mease published the first known tomato ketchup recipe in 1812. An early recipe for \"tomato catsup\" from 1817 includes anchovies and insects:\nIn 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in \"The Virginia Housewife\" (an influential 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin). Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. Jonas Yerkes is credited as the first American to sell it in a bottle. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. By the mid-1850s, anchovies no longer featured as an ingredient.\nShortly thereafter, other companies followed suit. F. &amp; J. Heinz launched their tomato ketchup in 1876. By 1897 the Sears catalog reported \"there are hundreds of brands of Catsup on the market, a few of them good.\"\nAmerican cooks also began to sweeten ketchup in the 19th century. The \"Webster's Dictionary\" of 1913 defined \"catsup\" as: \"table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Also written as ketchup].\" As the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the United States. Tomato ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were. People were less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices. \nHeinz Tomato Ketchup was advertised: \"Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!\", a slogan which alluded to the lengthy process required to produce tomato ketchup in the home. With industrial ketchup production and a need for better preservation there was a great increase of sugar in ketchup, leading to the typically sweet and sour formula of today. In Australia, it was not until the late 19th century that sugar was added to \"tomato sauce\", initially in small quantities, but today it contains just as much as American ketchup and only differed in the proportions of tomatoes, salt and vinegar in early recipes. While ketchup and tomato sauce are both sold in Australia, American ketchup is sweeter and thicker whereas Australian tomato sauce is more sour and runny.\nModern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, the \"father\" of the US Food and Drug Administration, challenged the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. In response, entrepreneurs including Henry J. Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe that eliminated the need for that preservative. Katherine Bitting, a bacteriologist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, carried out research in 1909 that proved increasing the sugar and vinegar content of the product would prevent spoilage without use of artificial preservatives. She was assisted by her husband, Arvil Bitting, an official at that agency.\nPrior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin, in part because they used unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.\nLater innovations.\nIn fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small sachets or tubs. Diners tear the side or top of ketchup packets and squeeze ketchup out of them or peel the foil lid off tubs for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the \"Dip and Squeeze\" packet, which can be opened in either way.\nSome fast food outlets previously dispensed ketchup from hand-operated pumps into paper cups. This method has made a comeback in the first decades of the 21st century, as cost and environmental concerns over the increasing use of individual plastic ketchup tubs were taken into account.\nIn October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green (2000), purple (2001), mystery (pink, orange, or teal, 2002), and blue (2003). These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. By January 2006, these products were discontinued.\nProperties.\nComposition.\nU.S. Heinz tomato ketchup's ingredients (listed from highest to lowest percentage weight) are: tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high-fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring.\n\"Fancy\" ketchup.\nSome ketchup in the U.S. is labeled \"Fancy\", a USDA grade related to specific gravity. Fancy ketchup has a higher tomato solid concentration than other USDA grades.\nNutrition.\nThe following table compares the nutritional value of ketchup with raw ripe tomatoes and salsa, based on information from the USDA Food Nutrient Database.\nViscosity.\nCommercial tomato ketchup has an additive, usually xanthan gum, which gives the condiment a non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic or \"shear thinning\" property\u2014more commonly known as thixotropy. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added\u2014usually 0.5%\u2014which can make it difficult to pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup, it will lower the viscosity, enabling the sauce to flow. A common method of getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. Ketchup in plastic bottles can be additionally manipulated by squeezing the bottle, which also decreases the viscosity of the ketchup inside. Another technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed, the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.\nKetchup is a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning that its viscosity changes under stress and is not constant. It is a shear thinning fluid, which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a non-Newtonian fluid is as follows: formula_1. This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when one shakes a bottle of ketchup so it becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreases with stress.\nThe molecular composition of ketchup is what creates its pseudoplastic characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water make up the majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. While exposed to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to respond quickly and create an alignment within the product. The bonds between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress. Hydrogen bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized state once the shear stress dissipates.\nIn 2017, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported the development of a bottle coating that allowed all the product to slip out without leaving a residue.\nIn 2022, researchers at the University of Oxford found that splatter from a near-empty bottle can be prevented by squeezing more slowly and doubling the diameter of the nozzle.\nSeparation.\nKetchup is one of the many products that are leachable, meaning that the water within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product. This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the ketchup suspension.\nPectin is a polysaccharide within tomatoes that has the ability to bind to itself and to other molecules, especially water, around it. This enables it to create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the solution. Water is a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled vinegar. In order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that are able to be made within the matrix must be made. The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more slowly within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy. The increased order within the polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-energy state, in which the water will want to be relieved. This concept implies that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased disorder between water molecules. This is partially the cause for water leaching out of solution when left undisturbed for a short period of time.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67923", "revid": "29566584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67923", "title": "East Sussex", "text": "County of England\nEast Sussex is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Kent to the north-east, West Sussex to the west, Surrey to the north-west, and the English Channel to the south. The largest settlement is the city of Brighton and Hove.\nThe county has an area of and had an estimated population of 844,752 in 2024. The largest settlements are located on the coast, and include Brighton and Hove in the south west, Eastbourne in the south, and Hastings in the south east. Away from the coast the county is largely rural, and its major settlements include Crowborough in the north, Halisham in the south-centre, and Lewes in the west. For local government purposes East Sussex comprises a non-metropolitan county, with five districts, and the unitary authority area of Brighton and Hove. East Sussex and West Sussex historically formed a single county, Sussex.\nThe north east of East Sussex is part of the Weald, a sandstone anticline that was once an extensive woodland. The highest point in this area is Crowborough Hill (), part of the High Weald uplands. The south west of the county is part of the South Downs, a rolling chalk escarpment that stretches west into West Sussex and Hampshire. Ditchling Beacon () is the highest point. Where the downs reach the sea, they form high cliffs such as the Seven Sisters, where eroded dry valleys create an undulating skyline. The county does not contain large rivers, but its largest are the Rother, which forms part of the boundary with Kent, the Cuckmere, and the Ouse, which rises in West Sussex and flows through Lewes before reaching the English Channel at Newhaven.\nHistory.\nEast Sussex is part of the historic county of Sussex, which has its roots in the ancient kingdom of the South Saxons, who established themselves there in the 5th century AD, after the departure of the Romans. Archaeological remains are plentiful, especially in the upland areas. The area's position on the coast has also meant that there were many invaders, including the Romans and later the Normans, following the defeat of the English army by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Earlier industries included fishing, iron-making, and the wool trade, all of which have declined or been lost completely.\nGovernance.\nSussex was historically sub-divided into six rapes. From the 12th century the three eastern rapes together and the three western rapes together had separate quarter sessions, with the county town of the three eastern rapes being Lewes. This situation was formalised by Parliament in 1865, and the two parts were made into administrative counties, each with its own elected county council in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. In East Sussex there were also three self-administered county boroughs: Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings.\nUpon its foundation, East Sussex included the south of Tunbridge Wells and the south of Lamberhurst; by the Local Government Act 1894 these areas were transferred to Kent.\nIn 1974 East Sussex was made a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county, and the three county boroughs became districts within the county. At the same time the western boundary was altered, so that the Mid Sussex region (including Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath) was transferred to the non metropolitan county of West Sussex. In 1997, Brighton and Hove became a self-administered unitary authority; it was granted city status in 2000, whilst remaining part of the ceremonial county of East Sussex.\nThe area of East Sussex County Council's jurisdiction is divided into five local government districts. Three are large rural districts (from west to east): Lewes, Wealden, and Rother. Eastbourne and Hastings are mainly urban areas. The rural districts are further subdivided into civil parishes.\nGeography.\nGeology.\nGeologically, East Sussex is part of southern anticline of the Weald: the South Downs, a range of moderate chalk hills which run across the southern part of the county from west to east and mirrored in Kent by the North Downs. To the north lie parallel valleys and ridges, the highest of which is the Weald itself (the Hastings beds and Wealden Clay). The sandstones and clays meet the sea at Hastings; the Downs, at Beachy Head. The area contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the Wealden basin according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said \"will bring jobs and business opportunities\" and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.\nClimate.\nEast Sussex, like most counties by the south coast, has an annual average total of around 1,750 hours of sunshine per year. This is much higher than the UK's average of about 1,340 hours of sunshine a year.\nRelief and drainage.\nThe relief of the county reflects the geology.\nThe chalk uplands of the South Downs occupies the coastal strip between Brighton and Eastbourne. There are two river gaps: the Rivers Ouse and Cuckmere. The Seven Sisters, where the Downs meet the sea, are the remnants of dry valleys cut into the chalk; they end at Beachy Head, 530\u00a0feet (162\u00a0m) above sea level. To the east of Beachy Head lie the marshlands of the Pevensey Levels, formerly flooded by the sea but now enclosed within a deposited beach. At Bexhill the land begins to rise again where the sands and clays of the Weald meet the sea; these culminate in the sandstone cliffs east of Hastings. Further east are the Pett Levels, more marshland, beyond which is the estuary of the River Rother. On the far side of the estuary are the dunes of Camber Sands. The highest point in the county is Ditchling Beacon on the South Downs, which has a maximum elevation of and is classed as a Marilyn.\nThe Weald occupies the northern borderlands of the county. Between the Downs and Weald is a narrow stretch of lower lying land; many of the rivers and streams occupying this area originate in the Weald. The High Weald is heavily wooded in contrast to the South Downs; the Low Weald less so. Part of the Weald is the Ashdown Forest.\nSettlements.\nThe location of settlements in East Sussex has been determined both by its history and its geography. The original towns and villages tended to be where its economy lay: fishing along the coast and agriculture and iron mining on the Weald. Industry today tends to be geared towards tourism, particularly along the coastal strip where towns such as Bexhill-on-Sea, Eastbourne, and Hastings are located. Newhaven and Rye are ports, although the latter is also of historical importance. Peacehaven and Seaford serve as dormitory towns. Away from the coast are former market towns such as Hailsham, Heathfield and Uckfield; Crowborough is a centre for the Ashdown Forest. Lewes, the County town of East Sussex; Battle, with its Norman Conquest beginnings, and Wadhurst are the other three towns of significance.\nEconomy and demography.\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex (Brighton &amp; Hove has a separate table) at current basic prices http:// (pp.\u00a0240\u2013253) by \"Office for National Statistics\" with figures in millions of pounds.\nEconomic activities.\nMeasured by the number of registered companies, East Sussex is not a major manufacturing or industrial area of the United Kingdom. Of the companies registered, the leading category in 2023 was \"construction\", followed by \"real estate activities\". An important contribution to the county's economy comes from the fact that many residents of Brighton and Hove, Eastbourne and Hastings commute to London or work remotely for companies outside the county.\nThere were 1,720 agricultural holdings in East Sussex (excluding Brighton and Hove) in 2022, with a total farmed area of 108,825 hectares. They employed just over 4000 people and, in 2020, produced a gross value added of \u00a366 million. Livestock grazing accounts for almost 40% of the farmed area, with there being approximately six times as many sheep as cattle. Fishing is limited but there are still fishing fleets, notably at Rye and Hastings, although the number of boats is much reduced. Historically, the fisheries were of great importance.\nLandmarks.\nThe Seven Sisters Park is part of the South Downs National Park. Beachy Head is one of the most famed local attractions, along with the flats along Normans Bay.\nApart from the physical landmarks such as the Downs and the Weald, East Sussex has a great many landmarks of historical interest. There are castles at Bodiam, Herstmonceux, Lewes and Pevensey; and defence works such as the Martello towers and Eastbourne Redoubt. Battle Abbey, built to commemorate the Battle of Hastings; Bateman's, home of Rudyard Kipling; Hammerwood Park, one of the first examples of Greek Revival architecture in the UK; and the University of Sussex buildings at Falmer are among interesting buildings. Bexhill-on-Sea is also home to the De La Warr Pavilion. East Sussex also includes two chalk hill figures, being the Litlington White Horse and the Long Man of Wilmington, which are both situated in the Sussex Downs.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nEast Sussex has no motorways, and even dual carriageways are sparse in the county. The main roads through the county are those part of the radial pattern from London: the A21 from Kent to Hastings; the A22 from Surrey to Eastbourne; and the A23 from Gatwick to Brighton. Cross-country routes include the A26 which carries traffic from Newhaven and Lewes north into Kent; and the south coast trunk route, which starts in Folkestone (Kent) as the A259 trunk road, and traverses the south coast to Eastbourne, where it becomes the A27 trunk road and heads westwards towards Chichester in West Sussex and ultimately to Honiton in Devon. All the main roads suffer from congestion and traffic problems: the A27 which connects Eastbourne to Portsmouth is one of the busiest trunk roads in the UK.\nBus routes serve all the main areas of settlement and many of the villages in the county.\nRailways.\nThe railways serve the main towns in a similar fashion to the roads. Until the closures of many branch railways in the 20th century, rural East Sussex was well-served by rail: few such branch lines escaped the Beeching cuts so that today only main-line services remain. They include the East Coastway Line (including the Marshlink Line); the Hastings line; and the Uckfield branch of the Oxted Line. There are three heritage railways: the Kent and East Sussex Railway operates from Tenterden in Kent to Bodiam; the Bluebell Railway from Sheffield Park to East Grinstead; and the Lavender Line Steam Railway is a one-mile line at Isfield, near Uckfield.\nTrains in the county are operated by Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and Great Western Railway. Southern is the key operator for the county, operating services along the West Coastway and East Coastway routes, as well as trains from Brighton, Eastbourne, Seaford and Hastings to London Victoria, and to a lesser extent London Bridge, which is also where trains to/from Uckfield go. Southeastern operate trains from London Charing Cross to Hastings. Thameslink operate trains from Brighton to Bedford.\nAirports.\nThere are no airports offering scheduled flights in East Sussex. London's second airport, Gatwick Airport, is a short distance from East Sussex and easily accessible by road and rail from most of the county. Despite its name, Brighton City Airport, the former Shoreham Airport, is in West Sussex. Three airfields service general aviation, helicopters and flying schools: Spilsted Farm near Hastings; Kittyhawk Aerodrome near Lewes;, and Deanland Airfield, also near Lewes. Sussex Gliding Club operate from Kitsons field at The Broyle on the outskirts of Ringmer.\nFerries.\nA ferry operates from Newhaven to Dieppe in France twice daily in the off-season and three times daily in the summer. Both vehicles and foot passengers are accepted.\nFootpaths.\nAmong the long-distance footpaths in East Sussex are the South Downs Way; 1066 Country Walk, High Weald Landscape Trail, Saxon Shore Way, Sussex Border Path, Sussex Ouse Valley Way, Vanguard Way, Wealdway and The Monarch's Way.\nEducation.\nThe Universities of Sussex and Brighton are based in East Sussex, with facilities in Brighton, Falmer and Hastings.\nOver 150 primary schools serve the area; many of them small and local in scope.\nState and independent secondary schools include Lewes Old Grammar School, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in 2012. Overall, more than 50 serve East Sussex, including further education colleges in larger towns.\nA number of independent boarding schools that also cater to day students are located in the county, including Brighton College and Roedean. The Pestalozzi Children's Village, an international foundation, is located at Sedlescombe.\nCulture.\nEast Sussex has many theatres and performance venues, including the Theatre Royal in Brighton and the Brighton Dome, the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts at the University of Sussex, the Royal Hippodrome Theatre and Devonshire Park Theatre in Eastbourne, and the White Rock Theatre in Hastings. The annual Glyndebourne Festival Opera takes place at Glyndebourne near Lewes. The Brighton Festival is a large multi-arts festival held every May.\nThere is a wide range of museums and art galleries in East Sussex. Notable amongst these are the Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery; the Hove Museum of Creativity; the Hastings Museum and Art Gallery; Hastings Contemporary; Charleston Farmhouse near Lewes, with an exhibition devoted to the artistic work of the Bloomsbury Group; the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, which houses a contemporary art gallery; and the Towner Eastbourne gallery, which celebrated its centenary in 2023 and hosted the award ceremony for the Turner Prize on 5 December of that year.\nTourism.\nThe coastal towns of Brighton and Hove, Bexhill-on-Sea, Hastings and Eastbourne attract many day trippers during the summer to visit the beaches. Brighton and Hove have a range of attractions including the Royal Pavilion. Beginning in 1787, it was built in three stages as a seaside retreat for George, Prince of Wales, who became King George IV in 1820. A more recent attraction is the Brighton i360, a 162 m observation tower on the seafront, which opened on 4 August 2016 to provide extensive views over Brighton and Hove, the South Downs and the English Channel. The tower has never achieved forecast visitor numbers and in June 2023 the company operating it owed Brighton and Hove Council \u00a348 million.\nBrighton Palace Pier, Eastbourne Pier and Hastings Pier serve as entertainment centres that attract many visitors. Several other piers built in the heyday of day tripper visits by train no longer exist, including St Leonards Pier, in St Leonards-on-Sea, and the West Pier in Brighton, parts of which can still be seen in the sea opposite the Brighton i360. Originally, the profits from the i360 were seen as a potential source of funds to rebuild the West Pier, but that now seems unlikely.\nOther important tourist attractions within East Sussex include Ashdown Forest, Drusillas Zoo Park near Alfriston and Michelham Priory. The county has two narrow-gauge railways, the Hastings Miniature Railway, which is powered by a steam locomotive, and Volk's Electric Railway, which runs from Brighton's Palace Pier to Brighton Marina along the seafront. Volk's is the oldest operational electric railway in the world. There are also several castles that attract many visitors, as indicated in the Landmarks section above.\nAnnual events also promote tourism to the county. Brighton Pride is one of the UK's largest and oldest pride parades and other pride events take place at Eastbourne and Hastings. The London to Brighton Veteran Car Run is the world's longest-running motoring event. To qualify, cars must have been built before 1905. It is also the world's largest gathering of veteran cars. The race finishes on Madeira Drive in Brighton.\nFor visitors who wish to explore East Sussex by car, there are many attractive towns and villages, such as Alfriston; Battle, site of the Battle of Hastings; Ditchling; Herstmonceux, with the castle of the same name; Lewes; Rottingdean; and Rye.\nTraditions.\nThe Lewes Bonfire is a set of bonfire celebrations held on Guy Fawkes Night, which both celebrates the uncovering of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and commemorates the memory of the seventeen Protestant martyrs from Mayfield burned at the stake between 1555 and 1557. It has a history of religious antagonism and anti-popery, including the burning of an effigy of the Pope. The event attracts tens of thousands of spectators every year. There are also many other bonfire societies in East Sussex.\nSport.\nFootball.\nBrighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. is the most successful club in East Sussex, playing in the Premier League in 2024\u201325 and also competing in the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League. It has appeared once in the FA Cup final, in 1983, losing to Manchester United after a replay. It is the only fully professional men's team in the county. The oldest club in East Sussex is Eastbourne Town F.C., which was founded in 1881. Lewes F.C. is a semi-professional football club. The men's first team is in the Isthmian League Premier Division. It also has a successful women's team, which in 2023\u201324 was competing in the second-tier Women's Championship against teams supported by much larger clubs, including some with their men's team in the Premier League.\nCricket.\nCricket had its origins in the counties of Kent, Surrey and Sussex. There is no team representing East Sussex. It combines with West Sussex as the Sussex County Cricket Club, playing first-team matches at the County Ground in Hove and reserve-team matches in both East and West Sussex. There are around 25 local clubs playing the game in East Sussex.\nRugby.\nThere are around 15 rugby clubs in East Sussex, with many of them fielding several teams including women's and girls' teams. Seaford Rugby Club claims the distinction of playing its home games below sea level.\nCycling.\nThe fourth stage of the 1994 Tour de France ended in Brighton after departing from Dover. The route included a climb over Ditchling Beacon. The hilly nature of the Downs presents a good challenge for cyclists and there are at least eight cycling clubs in East Sussex.\nGolf.\nThere are 42 golf courses in East Sussex, many on downland. Four of these (2 in Brighton and Hove, one in Eastbourne and one in Crowborough) are public courses; the remainder private, semi-private or resorts.\nOther sports.\nOther popular sports include sailing, bowls, stoolball, and tennis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town is the administrative centre of the wider district of the same name. It lies on the River Ouse at the point where the river cuts through the South Downs.\nA traditional market town and centre of communications, in 1264 it was the site of the Battle of Lewes. The town's landmarks include Lewes Castle, Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House. Other notable features of the area include the Glyndebourne festival, the Lewes Bonfire celebrations and the Lewes Pound.\nEtymology.\nThe place-name \"Lewes\" is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter circa 961 AD, where it appears as \"L\u00e6we\". It appears as \"Lewes\" in the Domesday Book of 1086. The addition of the &lt;-s&gt; suffix seems to have been part of a broader trend of Anglo-Norman scribes pluralising Anglo-Saxon place-names (a famous example being their rendering of \"Lunden\" as \"Londres\", hence the modern French name for London).\nThe traditional derivation of \"L\u00e6we\", first posited by the Tudor antiquarian Laurence Nowell, derives it from the Old English word \"hl\u00e6w\", meaning \"hill\" or \"barrow\", presumably referring to School Hill (on which the historic centre of Lewes stands) or to one of the five ancient burial mounds, all now levelled, in the vicinity of St John sub Castro.\nHowever, this etymology has been challenged by the Swedish philologist Rune Forsberg on the grounds that the loss of the initial \u27e8h\u27e9 in \"hl\u00e6w\" would be unlikely phonologically in this context. He suggested that the name \"L\u00e6we\" instead derives from the rare Old English word \"l\u01e3w\" (\"wound, incision\"), and reflects the fact that from the top of School Hill Lewes overlooks the narrow, steep-sided \"gash\" where the River Ouse cuts through the line of the South Downs. This theory was endorsed in 2011 by \"A Dictionary of British Place Names\".\nA third possibility has been advanced by Richard Coates, who has argued that \"L\u00e6we\" derives from \"lexowia\", an Old English word meaning \"hillside, slope\" (of which there is no shortage in the Lewes area). This unusual word was borrowed into Old English from Old Welsh, the Modern Welsh spelling being \"llechwedd\".\nHistory.\nPre-Saxon.\nThe immense strategic value of the site, which is able to command traffic between the Channel coast and the Sussex interior, was recognised as early as the Iron Age, when a hill-fort was built on Mount Caburn, the steep-sided hill that overlooks the Ouse (and the modern town of Lewes) from the east.\nDuring the Roman period, there was an aristocratic villa at Beddingham, at the foot of Mount Caburn, and there have been several finds of Roman coins and pottery sherds in Lewes itself. The Victorian historian Thomas Walker Horsfield therefore reckoned that there must have been a Roman settlement on the site, and he identified it with the otherwise unlocatable town of \"Mutuantonis\". Another antiquarian, John Elliot, even suggested that central Lewes's distinctive network of twittens was based on the layout of a Roman legionary fortress; however modern historians are rather more cautious about the possibility of a Roman Lewes, as there is as yet no archaeological evidence for a built-up area dating back to the Roman period.\nAnglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman.\nThe earliest phase of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Sussex was concentrated between the Rivers Ouse and Cuckmere, and Anglo-Saxon finds begin to appear in Lewes from the sixth century. The town of Lewes was probably founded around this time, and it may have been one of the most important settlements in the Kingdom of Sussex, along with Chichester and Hastings, though the evidence for this early period is very sketchy.\nBy the ninth century, the Kingdom of Sussex had been annexed to the Kingdom of Wessex, and in 838 Ecgberht, King of Wessex donated the estate of Malling, on the opposite side of the Ouse from Lewes, to the Archbishop of Canterbury. As a result, the Parish of Malling became a 'peculiar', which means that the parish was directly subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury rather than the Bishop of Chichester like every other parish in Sussex. Malling would retain this anomalous status until as late as 1845.\nInformation about Lewes becomes much more plentiful from the reign of Alfred the Great onward, as it was one of the towns which he fortified as part of the network of \"burhs\" he established in response to the Viking raids. The peace and stability brought by Alfred and his successors evidently stimulated economic activity in the area, for in the late Anglo-Saxon period Lewes seems to have been a thriving boom town \u2013 during the reign of Alfred's grandson \u00c6thelstan it was assigned two royal moneyers, more than any other mint in Sussex, and according to Domesday Book it generated \u00a326 of revenue for the Crown in 1065, almost twice the amount of any other town in the county, and comprised 127 households.\nAfter the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror rewarded his retainer William de Warenne by making him Earl of Surrey and granting him the Rape of Lewes, a strip of land stretching along the Ouse valley from the coast to the Surrey boundary. De Warenne constructed Lewes Castle within the walls of the Saxon \"burh\", while his wife Gundreda founded the Priory of St Pancras, a Cluniac monastic house, in about 1081.\nBattle of Lewes.\nDuring the Second Barons' War, King Henry III was ambushed at Lewes by a force of rebel barons led by Simon de Montfort. Henry marched out to fight de Montfort, leading to a pitched battle on the hills above the town (roughly in the area of modern Landport Bottom). The king's son Prince Edward, commanding the right wing of the royal army, succeeded in driving off some of the baronial forces, but he got carried away with the pursuit, which took him as far as Offham. In Edward's absence the remainder of the royal army was attacked by de Montfort and Gilbert de Clare and decisively defeated. The king's brother Richard of Cornwall was captured, and the king himself was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, a document which does not survive but was probably aimed at forcing Henry to uphold the Provisions of Oxford. Despite this uncertainty about its consequences, the battle is often seen as an important milestone in the development of English democracy.\nLate Mediaeval and Early Modern.\nThe de Warenne family died out with Earl John in 1347, whereupon lordship of the Rape of Lewes passed to his sororal nephew Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel. Fitzalan preferred to reside at Arundel Castle rather than at Lewes, and the town therefore lost the prestige and economic advantages associated with being the seat of an important magnate. This was only the beginning of a series of misfortunes that struck Lewes, for in 1348 the Black Death arrived in England and later on in the century the Hundred Years War led to a series of French and Castilian raids on Sussex, which badly disrupted trade. On one occasion in 1377 the Prior of St Pancras, John de Charlieu, was abducted by the raiders and held to ransom. Furthermore, after the main branch of the Fitzalan family died out in 1439, the Rape of Lewes was subsequently partitioned between the three sororal nephews of the last earl, namely John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny, and Edmund Lenthall. As a result of this dismemberment the district became even more neglected by its lords, although feudal politics was starting to become less important anyway due to the centralising reforms of the Yorkist and Tudor kings.\nThe English Reformation was begun by one of these Tudor monarchs, Henry VIII, and as part of this process the monasteries of England were dissolved; Lewes Priory was consequently demolished in 1538 and its property seized by the Crown. Henry's daughter Mary I reversed the religious policy of England, and during the resulting Marian Persecutions of 1555\u20131557, Lewes was the site of the execution of seventeen Protestant martyrs, most of them actually from the Weald rather than Lewes itself, who were burned at the stake in front of the Star Inn (now the site of Lewes Town Hall). Commemoration of the martyrs is one of the main purposes of Lewes Bonfire, and a stone memorial to the martyrs was unveiled on Cliffe Hill in 1901.\nLewesian politics was dominated by a strongly Puritan faction in the reign of Charles I, and during the English Civil War it was one of the most important Parliamentarian strongholds in Sussex. As such it became the target of a royalist attack in December 1642, but the royalist army was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Muster Green by Parliamentarian forces commanded by Herbert Morley, one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Lewes.\nLewes recovered relatively quickly after the Civil War, and prospered during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It had always been one of the principal market towns of Sussex, as well as an important port, and by the end of the Georgian era it also had well-developed textiles, iron, brewing, and shipbuilding industries.\nModern.\nThe severe winter of 1836\u20137 led to a large build-up of snow on Cliffe Hill, whose sheer western face directly overlooks the town. On Tuesday 27 December 1836 this snow cornice collapsed, and the resulting Lewes avalanche was the deadliest ever recorded in Britain. The avalanche struck the cottages on Boulters Row (now part of South Street), burying fifteen people, of whom eight died. A pub in South Street is named \"The Snowdrop\" in memory of the event.\nIn 1846, the town became a railway junction, with lines constructed from the north, south and east to two railway stations. The development of Newhaven ended Lewes's period as a major port. During the Crimean War, some 300 Finns who had served in the Russian army during the \u00c5land War and been captured at Bomarsund were imprisoned in the naval prison at Lewes. Lewes became a borough in 1881. Lewes Town Hall opened in 1893 in premises converted from the former Star Inn and in 1913 Council Offices were added in Arts-and-Crafts style.\nLewes Victoria Hospital opened in 1909 in its current premises, as Victoria Hospital and Infirmary, having previously been on School Hill where it opened as the Lewes Dispensary and Infirmary in 1855.\nIn October 2000, the town suffered major flooding during an intense period of severe weather throughout the United Kingdom. The commercial centre of the town and many residential areas were devastated. In a government report into the nationwide flooding, Lewes was officially noted the most severely affected location. As a result of the devastation, the Lewes Flood Action group formed, to press for better flood protection measures.\nGovernance and politics.\nLocal government.\nThere are three tiers of local government covering Lewes, at parish (town), district and county level: Lewes Town Council, Lewes District Council and East Sussex County Council. The town council is based at Lewes Town Hall on the High Street. The county council has its headquarters at County Hall on St Anne's Crescent in the town, which is also used by Lewes District Council as its meeting place.\nLewes was an ancient borough, although the structure of its early government is obscure. For much of the Middle Ages the town was run by a closed aristocratic organisation known as the \"Fellowship of the Twelve\", which was gradually eclipsed by a body known as the jury in the seventeenth century, presided over by a constable. The limitations of the town's administration were recognised in 1806 when separate improvement commissioners were established to pave, light and repair the streets and provide a watch. When local government in towns was reformed across the country in the 1830s, Lewes was one of the boroughs left unreformed, and so it continued to be run by its jury and improvement commissioners. The situation was finally regularised in 1881 when the town was made a municipal borough. The town was then run by a corporate body formally called the \"mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Lewes\", informally known as the corporation or town council. The last constable became the first mayor.\nIn 1890, the town council acquired the former Star Inn at 189 High Street, parts of which date back to the fourteenth century, and the adjoining corn exchange. The buildings were converted and extended to become the town hall, including a new frontage to High Street, which was completed in 1893. The municipal borough of Lewes was abolished in 1974 when the larger Lewes District was established. A successor parish was created covering the area of the former borough, with the parish council taking the name Lewes Town Council.\nFollowing the 2023 election the composition of the town council was:\nThe next election is due in 2027.\nSince 2010, the town has been included within the South Downs National Park. The National Park Authority has therefore taken over some functions from the local councils, notably relating to town planning.\nThere are also a number of local political groups without council representation. The far-left group Lewes Maoist Action has operated in the town since 2013, frequently handing out leaflets at the train station and running a cake stall at weekends outside Lewes Castle. In 2020, the group claims to have infiltrated the council and Harvey's brewery, although they have never contested a local or parliamentary election.\nConstituency.\nLewes gives its name to the Lewes parliamentary constituency. The constituency was held by the Conservatives from the 1870s until 1997, when it was won by Liberal Democrat Norman Baker. He held the seat for 18 years until defeated in 2015 by Conservative Maria Caulfield, who retained her seat in the 2017 and 2019 general elections. As of July 2024, Liberal Democrat James MacCleary is the MP.\nGeography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You can see Lewes lying like a box of toys under a great amphitheatre of chalk hills ... on the whole it is set down better than any town I have seen in England.\"\u2014\u200a\nLewes is situated on the Greenwich or Prime Meridian, in a gap in the South Downs, cut through by the River Ouse, and near its confluence with the Winterbourne Stream. It is approximately seven miles north of Newhaven, and an equal distance north-east of Brighton.\nThe South Downs rise above the river on both banks. The High Street, and earliest settlement, occupies the west bank, climbing steeply up from the bridge taking its ancient route along the ridge; the summit on that side, distant is known as Mount Harry. On the east bank there is a large chalk cliff, Cliffe Hill that can be seen for many miles, part of the group of hills including Mount Caburn, Malling Down (where there are a few houses in a wooded area on the hillside, in a development known as Cuilfail) and Golf Hill (home to the Lewes Golf Club). The two banks of the river are joined by Willey's Bridge (a footbridge), the Phoenix Causeway (a recent concrete road bridge, named after the old Phoenix Ironworks) and Cliffe Bridge (an 18th-century replacement of the mediaeval crossing, widened in the 1930s and now semi-pedestrianised).\nThe High Street runs from Eastgate to West-Out, forming the spine of the ancient town. Cliffe Hill gives its name to the one-time village of Cliffe, now part of the town. The southern part of the town, Southover, came into being as a village adjacent to the Priory, south of the Winterbourne Stream. At the north of the town's original wall boundary is the St John's or Pells area, home to several 19th-century streets and the Pells Pond. The Pells Pool, built in 1860, is the oldest freshwater \"lido\" in England. The Phoenix Industrial Estate lies along the west bank of the river and contains a number of light industrial and creative industry uses, as well as car parks and a fire station. A potential regeneration project (formerly \"The North Street Quarter\", renamed \"The Phoenix Project\" by the Lewes-based eco-development company Human Nature which took on ownership of the land in December 2020) for the area would be the largest in Lewes since the South Malling residential area was developed in the 1950s and 1960s and in the South Downs since it became a National Park.\nMalling lies to the east of the river and had 18th- and 19th-century houses and two notable breweries. Road engineering and local planning policy in the 1970s cleared many older buildings here to allow the flow of traffic; the main road route east from the town now goes along Little East Street, across the Phoenix Bridge and through the Cuilfail Tunnel to join the A27.\nThe town boundaries were enlarged twice (from the original town walls), in 1881 and 1934. They now include the more modern housing estates of Wallands, South Malling (the west part of which is a previously separate village with a church dedicated to St Michael), Nevill, Lansdown and Cranedown on the Kingston Road.\nCountryside walks can be taken starting from several points in Lewes. One can walk on Mount Caburn to the village of Glynde starting in Cliffe, traverse the Lewes Brooks (an RSPB reserve) from Southover, walk to Kingston near Lewes also from Southover, head up Landport Bottom to Mount Harry and Black Cap along the edge of the old Lewes Racecourse, or wander up along the Ouse to Hamsey Place from the Pells. The South Downs Way crosses the Ouse just south of Lewes at Southease and hikers often stop off at the town. A new route reaching the town at the Railway Land \u2013 the Egrets Way \u2013 initially conceived in 2011 by the Ouse Valley Cycle Network, has been designed as a network of walking and cycling paths linking Lewes and Newhaven with the villages in between.\nNatural sites.\nThree Sites of Special Scientific Interest lie within the parish: Lewes Downs, Lewes Brooks and Southerham Works Pit. Lewes Downs is a site of biological interest, an isolated area of the South Downs. Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, is part of the floodplain of the River Ouse, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails. Southerham Works Pit is of geological interest, a disused chalk pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The Railway Land nature reserve is on the east side of the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist Chris Drury. The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in East Sussex and Kent home to the marsh frog, an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.\nOn 21 August 1864, Lewes experienced an earthquake measuring 3.1 on the Richter magnitude scale.\nClimate.\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\nReligious buildings.\nRoman Catholic.\nThe Roman Catholic church is dedicated to St. Pancras in memory of the Priory and is a red-brick building over the street from St Anne's.\nDemography.\nIn 2001 the service industries were by far the biggest employers in Lewes: over 60% of the population working in that sector. A little over 10% are employed in manufacturing, mostly in the smaller industrial units.\nThe town is a net daytime exporter of employees with a significant community working in London and Brighton whilst it draws in employees of the numerous local government and public service functions on which its local economy is strongly dependent.\nAn important part of the town's economy is based on tourism, because of the town's many historic attractions and its location.\nAs referenced in the governance section, the town is also where three tiers of local government have their headquarters, and the head office of Sussex Police is also in Lewes.\nLewes Bonfire.\nThe town's most important annual event is the Lewes Bonfire celebrations on 5 November, Guy Fawkes Night. In Lewes this event not only marks the date of the uncovering of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, but also commemorates the memory of the seventeen Lewes Martyrs, Protestants burnt at the stake for their faith during the Marian Persecutions. The celebrations, which controversially involve burning an effigy of Pope Paul V, who was pope during the Gunpowder Plot, are the largest and most famous Bonfire Night celebrations in the country.\nEconomy.\nThe Lewes Chamber of Commerce represents the traders and businesses of the town. The town has been identified as unusually diversified with numerous specialist, independent retailers, counter to national trends toward 'chain' retailers and large corporate retail outlets.\nLewes Farmers' Market, one of the first in the UK, was started in the 1990s by Common Cause Co-operative Ltd and is a popular re-invention of Lewes as a market town. The Farmers' Market takes place in pedestrianised Cliffe High Street on the first and third Saturdays of every month, with local food producers coming to sell their wares under covered market stalls. A weekly food market in the Lewes Market Tower was established in July 2010 by Transition Town Lewes to allow traders to sell local produce. Occasionally French traders from the twin town of Blois attend, vending on Cliffe Bridge.\nFrom 1794 beers, wines and spirits were distributed from Lewes under the \"Harveys\" name, and the town is today the site of Harvey &amp; Son's brewery celebrated as one of the finest ale producers in England.\nIn September 2008, Lewes launched its own currency, the Lewes Pound, in an effort to increase trade within the town. One Lewes Pound is equal to \u00a31. Like the similar local currency in Totnes, the initiative is part of the Transition Towns movement. The Lewes Pound and the Transition Towns movement have received criticism for a failure to address the needs of the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticised in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as an unrealistic strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of pounds sterling in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on eBay at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.\nLandmarks.\nThe town is the location of several significant historic buildings, including Lewes Castle, the remains of Lewes Priory, Bull House (the former home of Thomas Paine), Southover Grange and public gardens, and a 16th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house known as Anne of Cleves House because it was given to her as part of her divorce settlement from Henry VIII, though she never lived there. Anne of Cleves House and the castle are owned and maintained by the Sussex Archaeological Society (whose headquarters are in Lewes). The Round House, a secluded former windmill in Pipe Passage, was owned by the writer Virginia Woolf.\nThe steep and cobbled Keere Street is home to many historic buildings, including a timber framed antiquarian bookshop. The gardens of the buildings on the east side of the street border the old Town Walls. The Prince Regent once drove his carriage down the street, and a sign at the bottom commemorates this event.\nThe ancient street pattern survives extensively as do a high proportion of the medieval building plots and oak framed houses, albeit often masked with later facades. The 18th-century frontages are notable and include several, like Bartholomew House at the Castle Gate, that are clad in mathematical tiles which mimic fine brick construction. Numerous streets of 18th- and 19th-century cottages have survived cycles of slum clearance as models of attractive town housing.\nAt the highest point of the old town the Portland stone and Coade stone facade of the Crown Court (1808\u201312, by John Johnson), the brick Market Tower and florid Lewes War Memorial mark the historic centre, although trade has tended to concentrate on the lower land in modern times. At the lowest part of the town, by the river, Harvey &amp; Son's Brewery, 'The Cathedral of Lewes' is an unspoilt 19th-century tower brewery and is the only one of the town's five original major breweries still in use. Nearby Fitzroy House is a George Gilbert Scott designed building, constructed as a library in memory of Lewes MP Henry FitzRoy in 1862 and now a private residence. The railway station is the other important monument of the industrial era.\nSouthover Grange is a grade II*listed Tudor manor house built in 1572 with Caen limestone taken from the ruins of Lewes Priory. The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and opened to the public in 1945. The house is now owned by East Sussex County Council, and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop and the Window caf\u00e9 (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large Magnolia grandiflora, a mulberry tree dating perhaps to the 17th century and a tulip tree planted by Queen Elizabeth II. The gardens are open to the public during daylight hours all year round.\nPelham House dates back to the 16th century and features architecture of all subsequent eras and a private landscaped garden facing the Downs. It now serves as an independent hotel. The Shelleys, also now a hotel, is likewise of some antiquity with a private garden and family associations with Percy Shelley.\nThe centre of Lewes is notable for a consistently high calibre of regional vernacular architecture and variety of historic construction materials and techniques. A comprehensive survey of all historical plaques was conducted in 2013 by a local civic society, the Friends of Lewes.\nA distinctive feature of the centre of Lewes is the network of alleyways or 'twittens' which run north\u2013south on either side of the High Street and date back to Anglo-Saxon times. According to the Dictionary of the Sussex dialect and collection of provincialisms in use in the county of Sussex published in Lewes in 1875. \"Twitten is a narrow path between two walls or hedges, especially on hills. For example, small passageways leading between two buildings to courtyards, streets, or open areas behind\". Some twittens (e.g. Broomans Lane, Church Twitten, Green Lane, Paine's Twitten) remain flint-wall-lined pedestrian thoroughfares, others (e.g. Watergate Lane, St Andrew's Lane and renamed Station Street (formerly St Mary's Lane)) are now narrow usually one-way roads. The most notable of all Lewes' twittens is Keere Street. A weekly Sunday morning run up and down all the twittens on the south side of the High Street \u2013 the so-called Twitten Run \u2013 has operated in the town since November 2015.\nPublic sculpture.\nHistoric.\nWith Eric Gill's move to Ditchling, the artistic community there gave rise to other sculptors in the Lewes district such as his nephew John Skelton and Joseph Cribb. Skelton's studio in Streat has continued as an educational and artist's workshop since his death in 1999. Eric Gill and Jacob Epstein conceived \"a great scheme for doing some colossal figures together\" around 1910 for a modern Stonehenge on 6 acres of land at Asheham House, Beddingham, south-east of Lewes. William Rothenstein agreed to buy the lease but the scheme failed.\nEdward Perry Warren first saw Lewes House in 1889 and with his partner John Marshall they were prodigious collectors of fine antique sculpture there. Eric Gill was introduced to Warren by Roger Fry and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which is now in the Tate Gallery collection. William Rothenstein suggested that Warren might like to acquire Rodin's new sculpture \"The Kiss\" and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes \"Kiss\" arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend \"The Kiss\" to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. \"The Kiss\" was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, \"The Kiss\" was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917, \"The Kiss\" was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, \"The Kiss\" was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and is now one of the Tate's most popular attractions.\nIt returned on loan to Lewes in 1999 for the exhibition \"Rodin in Lewes\".\nPresent day.\n\"The Helmet\" (1964), by Enzo Plazzotta, stands in the grounds of Lewes Priory. The \"Cuilfail Spiral\" (1983) by Peter Randall-Page sits on the roundabout at the north end of the Cuilfail Tunnel; made of 7 pieces of Portland limestone. The \"Magnus Inscription\" (c. 1200) sits in the East wall of St John Sub Castro on the Junction of Abinger Place and Lancaster Street. The \"Janus Head\" (1997) by John Skelton and \"Lewes Group\" (2010) by Jon Edgar sit in Southover Grange Gardens. \"Sculpture to Thomas Paine\" by Marcus Cornish commissioned as a private donation was unveiled in July 2010 outside the new Lewes Library in Styles Field.\nTransport.\nLewes, from its inception, has been an important transport hub. Its site as a bridging point was probably originally a ford: today the main routes avoid the town centre. The A27 trunk road taking traffic along the south coast between Eastbourne and Southampton passes to the south of the town. The A26 from Maidstone to Newhaven; and the A275 (the London road) both come in from the north. The Brighton &amp; Hove bus company and Compass Travel serve the town. The bus station was closed for a while but reopened in late 2008.\nLewes railway station was originally the junction for six routes. The town still enjoys half-hourly fast trains from London. The two erstwhile rural rail routes to the north, linking to East Grinstead and Uckfield respectively, are both now closed, but the East Coastway Line, connecting Brighton with Eastbourne and Hastings, and the branch to Seaford remain.\nThe Vanguard Way, a long-distance footpath from London to Newhaven, passes through countryside east of the town. The South Downs Way also passes close to Lewes, crossing the Ouse at Southease, some four miles south of the town. The Greenwich Meridian Trail, a long-distance path that follows the Greenwich Meridian from Peacehaven in East Sussex to Sand le Mere in East Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town.

The Eastbourne and Lewes Walking Festival was created in 2018 to promote walking in the local urban and rural South Downs area.\nEducation.\nPrimary schools.\nThere are many primary schools including:\nWestern Road and Southover School, despite being separate schools, are housed in linked buildings. The original Southover buildings are of red brick in the Queen Anne style, dating back to the early 20th century. The additions to it now forming the Western Road buildings date from after 1945.

The Flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA's \"Cassini\" space probe and ESA's \"Huygens\" lander, which landed on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. \"Cassini\" was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit, where it stayed from 2004 to 2017. The two craft took their names from the astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.\nLaunched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on October 15, 1997, \"Cassini\" was active in space for nearly 20 years, spending its final 13 years orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on July 1, 2004.\nThe voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and July 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, when \"Cassini\"'s trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft. The mission was successful beyond expectations \u2013 NASA's Planetary Science Division Director, Jim Green, described \"Cassini-Huygens\" as a \"mission of firsts\" that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System.\nOverview.\nPlanning and development.\nScientists and individuals from 27 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from the \"Cassini\" orbiter and the \"Huygens\" probe.\n\"Cassini\"'s planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded the \"Cassini Equinox Mission\". The mission was extended a second and final time with the \"Cassini Solstice Mission\", lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which date \"Cassini\" was de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere. The \"Huygens\" module traveled with \"Cassini\" until its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; Huygens landed by parachute on Titan on January 14, 2005. The separation was facilitated by the SED (Spin/Eject device), which provided a relative separation speed of and a spin rate of 7.5 rpm. It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth's Moon.\nAt the end of its mission, the \"Cassini\" spacecraft executed its \"Grand Finale\": a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings. This phase aimed to maximize \"Cassini\"'s scientific outcome before the spacecraft was intentionally destroyed to prevent potential contamination of Saturn's moons if \"Cassini\" were to unintentionally crash into them when maneuvering the probe was no longer possible due to power loss or other communication issues at the end of its operational lifespan. \"Cassini's\" atmospheric entry on Saturn ended the mission, but analysis of the returned data will continue for many years.\nNASA and JPL.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States, where the orbiter was assembled, managed the mission. The European Space Research and Technology Centre developed \"Huygens\". The centre's prime contractor, A\u00e9rospatiale of France (part of Thales Alenia Space from 2005), assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many European countries (including \"Huygens\"'s batteries and two scientific instruments from the United States). The Italian Space Agency (ASI) provided the \"Cassini\" orbiter's high-gain radio antenna, with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna (to ensure telecommunications with the Earth for the entire duration of the mission), a compact and lightweight radar, which also used the high-gain antenna and served as a synthetic-aperture radar, a radar altimeter, a radiometer, the radio science subsystem (RSS), and the visible-channel portion VIMS-V of VIMS spectrometer.\nNASA provided the VIMS infrared counterpart, as well as the Main Electronic Assembly, which included electronic sub-assemblies provided by CNES of France. On April 16, 2008, NASA announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed the \"Cassini\" Equinox Mission.\nIt was extended again in February 2010 as the \"Cassini\" Solstice Mission.\nNaming.\nThe mission consisted of two main elements: the ASI/NASA \"Cassini\" orbiter, named for the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer of Saturn's ring divisions and four of its satellites; and the ESA-developed \"Huygens\" probe, named for the Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens, discoverer of Titan.\nThe mission was commonly called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe (SOTP) during gestation, both as a Mariner Mark II mission and generically.\n\"Cassini-Huygens\" was a \"Flagship\"-class mission to the outer planets. The other planetary flagships include \"Galileo\", Voyager, and Viking.\nObjectives.\n\"Cassini\" had several objectives, including:\n\"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" was launched on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex\u00a040 using a U.S.\u00a0Air Force Titan IVB/Centaur rocket. The complete launcher was made up of a two-stage Titan IV booster rocket, two strap-on solid rocket engines, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing.\nThe total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about US$3.26\u00a0billion, including $1.4\u00a0billion for pre-launch development, $704 million for mission operations, $54\u00a0million for tracking and $422\u00a0million for the launch vehicle. The United States contributed $2.6\u00a0billion (80%), the ESA $500\u00a0million (15%), and the ASI $160\u00a0million (5%). However, these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in October 2000. They do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission, nor do they include the cost of the extended missions.\nThe primary mission for \"Cassini\" was completed on July 30, 2008. The mission was extended to June 2010 (\"Cassini\" Equinox Mission). This studied the Saturn system in detail during the planet's equinox, which happened in August 2009.\nOn February 3, 2010, NASA announced another extension for \"Cassini\", lasting 6&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u00a0years until 2017, ending at the time of summer solstice in Saturn's northern hemisphere (\"Cassini\" Solstice Mission). The extension enabled another 155\u00a0revolutions around the planet, 54\u00a0flybys of Titan and 11\u00a0flybys of Enceladus.\nIn 2017, an encounter with Titan changed its orbit in such a way that, at closest approach to Saturn, it was only above the planet's cloudtops, below the inner edge of the D ring. This sequence of \"proximal orbits\" ended when its final encounter with Titan sent the probe into Saturn's atmosphere to be destroyed.\nDestinations.\nSelected destinations (ordered largest to smallest but not to scale)\nHistory.\n\"Cassini\u2013Huygens\"'s origins date to 1982, when the European Science Foundation and the American National Academy of Sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA's \"Solar System Exploration Committee\" recommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while the American astronaut Sally Ride, in her influential 1987 report \"NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space\", also examined and approved of the \"Cassini\" mission.\nWhile Ride's report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA, Len Fisk, returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that ESA choose the \"Cassini\" mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did.\nAt the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the Soviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose Cassini\u2013Huygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US.\nThe collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" survive congressional budget cuts in the United States. \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded the United States Congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although citizens' groups concerned about the potential environmental impact a launch failure might have (because of its plutonium power source) attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch.\nSpacecraft design.\nThe spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, RTG-powered Mariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of Mars, after the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission, but budget cuts and project rescopings forced NASA to terminate CRAF development to save \"Cassini\". As a result, \"Cassini\" became more specialized. The Mariner Mark\u00a0II series was cancelled.\nThe combined orbiter and probe was at the time the third-largest uncrewed interplanetary spacecraft ever successfully launched, behind the Phobos 1 and 2 Mars probes, as well as being among the most complex; NASA's \"Europa Clipper\" became the new third-largest probe upon its launch in 2024. The orbiter had a mass of , the probe including of probe support equipment left on the orbiter. With the launch vehicle adapter and of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of .\nThe \"Cassini\" spacecraft was high and wide. Its bus was a dodecagonal prism atop a conical frustum connecting it to a cylinder containing the propellant tanks, to which the RTGs and \"Huygens\" were attached. Spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory (flight path) to Saturn, and by the ambitious science at its destination. \"Cassini\" had 1,630 interconnected electronic components, 22,000 wire connections, and of cabling. The core control computer CPU was a redundant system using the MIL-STD-1750A instruction set architecture. The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup R-4D bipropellant rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was and the total spacecraft delta-v was . Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control.\n\"Cassini\" was powered by of nuclear fuel, mainly plutonium dioxide (containing of pure plutonium). The heat from the material's radioactive decay was turned into electricity. \"Huygens\" was supported by \"Cassini\" during cruise, but used chemical batteries when independent.\nThe probe contained a DVD with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries, collected in a public campaign.\nUntil September 2017 the \"Cassini\" probe continued orbiting Saturn at a distance of between from the Earth. It took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. Thus ground controllers could not give \"real-time\" instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events. Even if response were immediate, more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers' response by the satellite.\nInstruments.\nSummary.\nInstruments:\nDescription.\n\"Cassini\"'s instrumentation consisted of: a synthetic aperture radar mapper, a charge-coupled device imaging system, a visible/infrared mapping spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a cosmic dust analyzer, a radio and plasma wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, a magnetospheric imaging instrument, a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlutonium power source.\nBecause of Saturn's distance from the Sun, solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe. To generate enough power, such arrays would have been too large and too heavy. Instead, the \"Cassini\" orbiter was powered by three GPHS-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which use heat from the decay of about of plutonium-238 (in the form of plutonium dioxide) to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics.\nThe RTGs on the \"Cassini\" mission have the same design as those used on the \"New Horizons\", \"Galileo\", and \"Ulysses\" space probes, and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes.\nAt the end of the nominal 11-year \"Cassini\" mission, they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power. (Leftover hardware from the \"Cassini\" RTG Program was modified and used to power the \"New Horizons\" mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, which was designed and launched later.)\nPower distribution was accomplished by 192 solid-state power switches, which also functioned as circuit breakers in the event of an overload condition. The switches used MOSFETs that featured better efficiency and a longer lifetime as compared to conventional switches, while at the same time eliminating transients. However, these solid-state circuit breakers were prone to erroneous tripping (presumably from cosmic rays), requiring them to reset and causing losses in experimental data.\nTo gain momentum while already in flight, the trajectory of the \"Cassini\" mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers: two fly-by passes of Venus, one more of the Earth, and then one of the planet Jupiter. The terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings. The maneuver was successful, with \"Cassini\" passing by above the Earth on August 18, 1999.\nHad there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the Earth, NASA's complete environmental impact study estimated that, in the worst case (with an acute angle of entry in which \"Cassini\" would gradually burn up), a significant fraction of the 33\u00a0kg of nuclear fuel inside the RTGs would have been dispersed into the Earth's atmosphere so that up to five billion people (i.e. almost the entire terrestrial population) could have been exposed, causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades (0.0005 per cent, i.e. a fraction 0.000005, of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes; the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere as 500,000 deaths). However, the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million, i.e. a chance of one person dying (assuming 5,000 deaths) as less than 1 in 200.\nNASA's risk analysis to use plutonium was publicly criticized by Michio Kaku on the grounds that casualties, property damage, and lawsuits resulting from a possible accident, as well as the potential use of other energy sources, such as solar and fuel cells, were underestimated.\nTelemetry.\nThe \"Cassini\" spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats. The telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem, because without it there could be no data return.\nThe telemetry was developed from the ground up, due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions. Therefore, \"Cassini\" was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process led to the creation of a Telemetry Manager for the mission.\nThere were around 1088 channels (in 67 mini-packets) assembled in the \"Cassini\" Telemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets, 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets.\nA total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 AACS telemetry modes were constructed. These modes are: (1) Record; (2) Nominal Cruise; (3) Medium Slow Cruise; (4) Slow Cruise; (5) Orbital Ops; (6) Av; (7) ATE (Attitude Estimator) Calibration. These 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes.\n\"Huygens\" probe.\nThe \"Huygens\" probe, supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and named after the 17th\u00a0century Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan, Christiaan Huygens, scrutinized the clouds, atmosphere, and surface of Saturn's moon Titan in its descent on January 15, 2005. It was designed to enter and brake in Titan's atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface.\nThe probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE) which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The PSE includes electronics that track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent, and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to Earth. The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A control system.\nThe data were transmitted by a radio link between \"Huygens\" and \"Cassini\" provided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe's mission could not be telecommanded from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).\nAfter \"Cassini\"'s launch, it was discovered that data sent from the \"Huygens\" probe to \"Cassini\" orbiter (and then re-transmitted to Earth) would be largely unreadable. The cause was that the bandwidth of signal processing electronics was too narrow and the anticipated Doppler shift between the lander and the mother craft would put the signals out of the system's range. Thus, \"Cassini\"'s receiver would be unable to receive the data from \"Huygens\" during its descent to Titan.\nA work-around was found to recover the mission. The trajectory of \"Cassini\" was altered to reduce the line of sight velocity and therefore the doppler shift. \"Cassini\"'s subsequent trajectory was identical to the previously planned one, although the change replaced two orbits prior to the \"Huygens\" mission with three, shorter orbits.\nSelected events and discoveries.\nVenus and Earth fly-bys and the cruise to Jupiter.\nThe \"Cassini\" space probe performed two gravitational-assist flybys of Venus on April 26, 1998, and June 24, 1999. These flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt, while the Sun's gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner Solar System.\nOn August 18, 1999, at 03:28\u00a0UTC, the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the Earth. One hour and 20\u00a0minutes before closest approach, \"Cassini\" made its closest approach to the Earth's Moon at 377,000 kilometers, and it took a series of calibration photos.\nOn January 23, 2000, \"Cassini\" performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 Masursky at around 10:00 UTC. It took photos in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of and a diameter of was estimated for the asteroid.\nJupiter flyby.\n\"Cassini\" made its closest approach to Jupiter on December 30, 2000, at 9.7 million kilometers, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter, its faint rings, and its moons were taken during the six-month flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately across.\nA major finding of the flyby, announced on March 6, 2003, was of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation. Dark \"belts\" alternate with light \"zones\" in the atmosphere, and scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. But analysis of \"Cassini\" imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According to Anthony Del Genio of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, \"the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking\".\nOther atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric haze, about the size of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions.\nThe same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably Metis and Adrastea.\nTests of general relativity.\nOn October 10, 2003, the mission's science team announced the results of tests of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, performed by using radio waves transmitted from the \"Cassini\" space probe. The radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as they passed close to the Sun. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive object like the Sun causes space-time to curve, causing a beam of radiowaves travelling out of its gravitational well to decrease in frequency and radiowaves travelling into the gravitational well to increase in frequency, referred to as gravitational redshift / blueshift.\nAlthough some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models, no such deviations were found by this experiment. Previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the \"Viking\" and \"Voyager\" space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The more refined measurements from the \"Cassini\" space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000. The data firmly support Einstein's general theory of relativity.\nNew moons of Saturn.\nIn total, the \"Cassini\" mission discovered seven new moons orbiting Saturn. Using images taken by \"Cassini\", researchers discovered Methone, Pallene and Polydeuces in 2004, although later analysis revealed that Voyager 2 had photographed Pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet.\nOn May 1, 2005, a new moon was discovered by \"Cassini\" in the Keeler gap. It was given the designation S/2005\u00a0S\u00a01 before being named Daphnis. A fifth new moon was discovered by \"Cassini\" on May 30, 2007, and was provisionally labeled S/2007 S 4. It is now known as Anthe. A press release on February 3, 2009, showed a sixth new moon found by \"Cassini\". The moon is approximately in diameter within the G-ring of the ring system of Saturn, and is now named Aegaeon (formerly S/2008 S 1). A press release on November 2, 2009, mentions the seventh new moon found by \"Cassini\" on July 26, 2009. It is presently labeled S/2009 S 1 and is approximately in diameter in the B-ring system.\nOn April 14, 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in Saturn's A Ring.\nPhoebe flyby.\nOn June 11, 2004, \"Cassini\" flew by the moon Phoebe. This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon (Voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images). It also was \"Cassini's\" only possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn.\nThe first close-up images were received on June 12, 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface.\nSaturn rotation.\nIn an announcement on June 28, 2004, \"Cassini\" program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn. Because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by \"Voyager 1\", and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet. It is thought to be due to variations in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at the latitudes which are magnetically connected to the radio source region.\nIn 2019 NASA announced Saturn's rotational period as 10 hours, 33 minutes, 38 seconds, calculated using Saturnian ring seismology. Vibrations from Saturn's interior cause oscillations in its gravitational field. This energy is absorbed by ring particles in specific locations, where it accumulates until it is released in a wave. Scientists used data from more than 20 of these waves to construct a family of models of Saturn's interior, providing basis for calculating its rotational period.\nOrbiting Saturn.\nOn July 1, 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between the F and G rings and achieved orbit, after a seven-year voyage. It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn.\nThe Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed by \"Cassini\" was complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn's rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622\u00a0m/s to allow Saturn to capture it. \"Cassini\" was captured by Saturn's gravity at around 8:54\u00a0pm Pacific Daylight Time on June 30, 2004. During the maneuver \"Cassini\" passed within of Saturn's cloud tops.\nWhen Cassini was in Saturnian orbit, departure from the Saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning.\nTitan flybys.\n\"Cassini\" had its first flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, on July 2, 2004, a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within of Titan. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon's global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness. On October 27, 2004, the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it passed a mere above the moon. Almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first radar images of the moon's haze-enshrouded surface. It revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys. Cassini collected pictures of Titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of water on Earth.\n\"Huygens\" lands on Titan.\n\"Cassini\" released the \"Huygens\" probe on December 25, 2004, by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground. Although \"Cassini\" successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from \"Huygens\" of its descent and landing site, a malfunction in one of the communications channels resulted in the loss of a further 350 pictures.\nEnceladus flybys.\nDuring the first two close flybys of the moon Enceladus in 2005, \"Cassini\" discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere. Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent. \"Cassini\" also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus, which gives more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn's E ring. Mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions.\nOn March 12, 2008, \"Cassini\" made a close fly-by of Enceladus, passing within 50\u00a0km of the moon's surface. The spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers, detecting water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer, while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer. \"Cassini\" was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction.\nOn November 21, 2009, \"Cassini\" made its eighth flyby of Enceladus, this time with a different geometry, approaching within of the surface. The Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS) instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the Baghdad Sulcus 'tiger stripe'. The data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere.\nOn April 3, 2014, nearly ten years after \"Cassini\" entered Saturn's orbit, NASA reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in Enceladus. The presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moon's rocky core, places Enceladus \"among the most likely places in the Solar System to host alien microbial life\". On June 30, 2014, NASA celebrated ten years of \"Cassini\" exploring Saturn and its moons, highlighting the discovery of water activity on Enceladus among other findings.\nIn September 2015, NASA announced that gravitational and imaging data from \"Cassini\" were used to analyze the librations of Enceladus's orbit and determined that the moon's surface is not rigidly joined to its core, concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent.\nOn October 28, 2015, \"Cassini\" performed a close flyby of Enceladus, coming within of the surface, and passing through the icy plume above the south pole.\nOn December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, \"these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life\".\nRadio occultations of Saturn's rings.\nIn May 2005, \"Cassini\" began a series of radio occultation experiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles in Saturn's rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.\nSpokes in rings verified.\nIn images captured September 5, 2005, \"Cassini\" detected spokes in Saturn's rings, previously seen only by the visual observer Stephen James O'Meara in 1977 and then confirmed by the Voyager space probes in the early 1980s.\nLakes of Titan.\nRadar images obtained on July 21, 2006, appear to show lakes of liquid hydrocarbon (such as methane and ethane) in Titan's northern latitudes. This is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on Earth. The lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across.\nOn March 13, 2007, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of Titan. At least one of these is larger than any of the Great Lakes in North America.\nSaturn hurricane.\nIn November 2006, scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of Saturn with a distinct eyewall. This is characteristic of a hurricane on Earth and had never been seen on another planet before. Unlike a terrestrial hurricane, the storm appears to be stationary at the pole. The storm is across, and high, with winds blowing at .\nIapetus flyby.\nOn September 10, 2007, \"Cassini\" completed its flyby of the strange, two-toned, walnut-shaped moon, Iapetus. Images were taken from above the surface. As it was sending the images back to Earth, it was hit by a cosmic ray that forced it to temporarily enter safe mode. All of the data from the flyby was recovered.\nMission extension.\nOn April 15, 2008, \"Cassini\" received funding for a 27-month extended mission. It consisted of 60 more orbits of Saturn, with 21 more close Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each of Dione, Rhea, and Helene. The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission as the mission coincided with Saturn's equinox.\nSecond mission extension.\nA proposal was submitted to NASA for a second mission extension (September 2010 \u2013 May 2017), provisionally named the extended-extended mission or XXM. This ($60M pa) was approved in February 2010 and renamed the Cassini Solstice Mission. It included \"Cassini\" orbiting Saturn 155 more times, conducting 54 additional flybys of Titan and 11 more of Enceladus.\nGreat Storm of 2010 and aftermath.\nOn October 25, 2012, \"Cassini\" witnessed the aftermath of the massive Great White Spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on Saturn. Data from the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn above normal. Simultaneously, a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December 5, 2010, in Saturn's northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest, hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System, initially being larger than Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\nVenus transit.\nOn December 21, 2012, \"Cassini\" observed a transit of Venus across the Sun. The VIMS instrument analyzed sunlight passing through the Venusian atmosphere. VIMS previously observed the transit of exoplanet HD 189733 b.\n\"The Day the Earth Smiled\".\nOn July 19, 2013, the probe was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon, as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as it was the first time NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance. The imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies, with \"Cassini\" scientist Carolyn Porco describing the moment as a chance to \"celebrate life on the Pale Blue Dot\".\nRhea flyby.\nOn February 10, 2015, the \"Cassini\" spacecraft visited Rhea more closely, coming within . The spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of Rhea.\nHyperion flyby.\n\"Cassini\" performed its latest flyby of Saturn's moon Hyperion on May 31, 2015, at a distance of about .\nDione flyby.\n\"Cassini\" performed its last flyby of Saturn's moon Dione on August 17, 2015, at a distance of about . A previous flyby was performed on June 16.\nHexagon changes color.\nBetween 2012 and 2016, the persistent hexagonal cloud pattern at Saturn's north pole changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color. One theory for this is a seasonal change: extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the Sun. It was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on Saturn between 2004 and 2008.\nGrand Finale and destruction.\n\"Cassini\"'s end involved a series of close Saturn passes, approaching within the rings, then an entry into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft. This method was chosen to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potential habitability.\nIn 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal, each with varying funding, scientific, and technical challenges. A short period Saturn impact for an end of mission was rated \"excellent\" with the reasons \"D-ring option satisfies unachieved AO goals; cheap and easily achievable\" while collision with an icy moon was rated \"good\" for being \"cheap and achievable anywhere/time\".\nThere were problems in 2013\u201314 about NASA receiving U.S. government funding for the Grand Finale. The two phases of the Grand Finale ended up being the equivalent of having two separate \"Discovery\"-class missions in that the Grand Finale was completely different from the main \"Cassini\" regular mission. The U.S. government in late 2014 approved the Grand Finale at the cost of $200 million. This was far cheaper than building two new probes in separate \"Discovery\"-class missions.\nOn November 29, 2016, the spacecraft performed a Titan flyby that took it to the gateway of F-ring orbits: This was the start of the Grand Finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet. A final Titan flyby on April 22, 2017, changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between Saturn and its inner ring days later on April 26. \"Cassini\" passed about above Saturn's cloud layer and from the visible edge of the inner ring; it successfully took images of Saturn's atmosphere and began returning data the next day. After a further 22 orbits through the gap, the mission was ended with a dive into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15; signal was lost at 11:55:46 UTC on September 15, 2017, just 30 seconds later than predicted. It is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission.\nIn September 2018, NASA won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program for its presentation of the \"Cassini\" mission's Grand Finale at Saturn.\nIn December 2018, Netflix aired \"NASA's Cassini Mission\" on their series \"7 Days Out\" documenting the final days of work on the \"Cassini\" mission before the spacecraft crashed into Saturn to complete its Grand Finale.\nIn January 2019, new research using data collected during \"Cassini\"'s Grand Finale phase was published:\nMissions.\nThe spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions. Each is structured according to a certain amount of funding, goals, etc. At least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on the \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" mission; in addition thousands of people overall worked to design, manufacture, and launch the mission.\nGlossary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial websites\nMedia and telecommunications"}

During a six-decade career, Scofield achieved the Triple Crown of Acting, winning an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Tony Award for his work. Scofield established a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean performers. He declined the honour of a knighthood, but was appointed CBE in 1956 and became a CH in 2001.\nScofield received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for portraying Sir Thomas More in the Broadway production of \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1962). Four years later, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor when he reprised the role in the 1966 film adaptation, making him one of eleven to receive a Tony and Academy Award for the same role. He received the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Male of the Species\" (1969).\nScofield garnered acclaim for his roles in films such as \"The Train\" (1964), \"King Lear\" (1971), \"A Delicate Balance\" (1973), \"Henry V\" (1989), and \"Hamlet\" (1990). He portrayed Mark Van Doren in the historical drama \"Quiz Show\" (1994), for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. For his role as Thomas Danforth in the film adaptation of \"The Crucible\" (1996) he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\nEarly life and education.\nPaul Scofield was born on 21 January 1922 in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, the son of Mary and Edward Harry Scofield. When Scofield was a few weeks old, his family moved to Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, where his father became headmaster at the Hurstpierpoint Church of England School. Scofield told his biographer, Garry O'Connor, that his upbringing was divided. His father was an Anglican and his mother a Roman Catholic. Baptised into his mother's faith, Scofield said, \"some days we were little Protestants and, on others, we were all devout little Catholics.\" He added, \"A lack of direction in spiritual matters is still with me.\"\nScofield recalled: \"I was a dunce at school. But at the age of twelve I went to Varndean School at Brighton where I discovered Shakespeare. They did one of his plays every year, and I lived just for that.\" In 1961, Scofield wrote, \"I don't have a psychological approach to acting; fundamentally, I have an intuitive approach. For me, the totally intellectual approach is never satisfactory. What matters to me is whether I like the play, for one thing, and, for another, whether I can recognize and identify myself with the character I'm to play.\" In 1939, Scofield left school at the age of seventeen and began training at the Croydon Repertory Theatre. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Scofield arrived for a physical examination and was ruled unfit for service in the British Army. He later recalled, \"They found I had crossed toes. I was unable to wear boots. I was deeply ashamed.\"\nCareer.\n1940\u20131959: Rise to prominence.\nScofield began his stage career in 1940 with a debut performance in American playwright Eugene O'Neill's \"Desire Under the Elms\" at the Westminster Theatre, and was soon being compared to Laurence Olivier. He played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. From there he went to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford, where he starred in Walter Nugent Monck's 1947 revival of \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\".\nIn 1948, Scofield appeared as Hamlet at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford alongside a then unknown Claire Bloom as Ophelia. Scofield's performance was so highly praised that it caused him to be dubbed, \"The Hamlet of his generation.\" He was also Bassanio in \"The Merchant of Venice\" with Bloom as an Attendee. J.C. Trewin commented, \"He is simply a timeless Hamlet... None could forget Scofield's pathos, the face folded in grief, at, 'When you are desirous to be blessed, I'll blessing beg of you.' We have known many correct, almost formal Hamlets, aloof from Elsinore. Scofield was ever a prisoner within its bounds: the world had many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.\"\nJohn Harrison, Director of the Leeds Playhouse, later recalled of Scofield's Hamlet, \"'Get thee to a nunnery,' so often delivered with rage or scorn, he says so gently. You have visions of quiet and prayer. A future for Ophelia.\" In her later book, \"\", Claire Bloom recalls that during the production she had a very serious crush on Scofield. As Scofield \"was happily married and the father of a son\", Bloom hoped only \"to be flirted with and taken some notice of.\" But Scofield never so much as glanced at Bloom or any of the other pretty actresses in the cast. Unusually, the production had two Hamlets: Scofield and Robert Helpmann took turns playing the title role and Bloom later recalled, \"I could never make up my mind which of my two Hamlets I found the more devastating: the openly homosexual, charismatic Helpmann, or the charming, shy young man from Sussex.\"\nScofield's versatility at the height of his career is exemplified by his starring roles in theatrical productions as diverse as the musical \"Expresso Bongo\" (1958) and Peter Brook's celebrated production of \"King Lear\" (1962). Brook wrote in his memoir, \"Threads of Time\", \"The door at the back of the set opened, and a small man entered. He was wearing a black suit, steel-rimmed glasses and holding a suitcase. For a moment we wondered who this stranger was and why he was wandering onto our stage. Then we realised that it was Paul, transformed. His tall body had shrunk; he had become insignificant. The new character now possessed him entirely.\"\nScofield also played in a big box office hit, \"Carve Her Name with Pride\".\n1960\u20131979: \"A Man for All Seasons\" and acclaim.\nOne of the highlights of Scofield's career in modern theatre is the role of Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's \"A Man for All Seasons\", which opened in July 1960. Scofield later referred to the part as the only time \"my intuition for the part has failed me.\" Theatre reviewers published very harsh criticism of Scofield's performance at first, which forced him to \"start from scratch and just work on facts, making myself totally faithful to what was on the page\". After realizing \"I had to find the way the man would feel; then I was able to find the way he should sound\", and the vital importance of conveying complete sincerity and humility when \"playing a man of spiritual depth\", Scofield successfully developed a means of performing as Thomas More through trial and error.\nAustrian-American filmmaker Fred Zinnemann later recalled of seeing the play onstage, \"It dealt with the sixteenth-century English statesman Thomas More, beheaded on the orders of his King, Henry VIII, for refusing to sanction his marriage to Anne Boleyn. With Paul Scofield in the lead, the play was a powerful emotional experience. It dramatized the nation's unquestioning submission to the absolute power of the king, in stark contrast to More, whose last words before the execution were, 'I die the Kings good servant, but God's first.'\"\nWhen Fred Zinnemann was first approached about directing the 1966 film adaptation of \"A Man For All Seasons\" by Columbia Pictures executive Mike Frankovich in 1965 and enthusiastically agreed, the studio did not wish to cast Scofield as the lead. Preferring a more internationally bankable cast, the studio desired either Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton as Thomas More, Alec Guinness as Cardinal Wolsey, and Peter O'Toole as King Henry VIII. Both Zinnemann and screenwriter Robert Bolt disagreed, however, but still went through the motions of meeting with Olivier and then informing him politely that he had not been chosen. Scofield, who was cast after Columbia grudgingly \"fell in with Zinnemann's wishes\", later recalled, \"I was surprised and honoured to be chosen for the film, being almost unknown in the movie world... My own task was unaltered except that I now focused on my thoughts on to a camera instead of an audience.\"\nEven though defying the studio's casting wishes forced him to film \"A Man For All Seasons\" on a shoestring budget, Fred Zinnemann felt very differently about Scofield and later recalled of the film shoot, \"For the first few days the crew did their usual work very well, the way they would have done any job, but on the third day, when Scofield made his speech about the majesty of the law, they were suddenly mesmerized by the magic of those words and they remained that way throughout the rest of the filming. So totally did Paul convey the scope of More's character that for months afterwards I couldn't help but look at him in awe, as a saint rather than an actor.\"\nIn 1964, Scofield acted in the John Frankenheimer war film \"The Train\" alongside Burt Lancaster. The film is set in August 1944 during World War II, it pits French Resistance-member Paul Labiche (Lancaster) against German Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Scofield), who is attempting to move stolen art masterpieces by train to Germany. The film received positive acclaim and was ranked as one of the best films by the National Board of Review. \nWriting in 1961, Scofield explained, \"Output in the theatre requires greater energy than anything else I know. Doubt of one's energy is the worst of all. One's output in the theatre requires energy of a sort that is never a factor in family life. Family energy generates itself. Social life outside the family can be exhausting. I don't care much for social life with people in the theatre. I'm rather good at being with people when I want to make the effort, but I'm bad at listening to people when I know what they're going to say. It isn't very interesting, and on the whole it's very draining. The interesting thing in the theatre is the work and working with people. I usually like the people in the work, but I can't go on with them outside the work as long as most actors can. And when I'm working on a part I'm thinking about it all the time, going over all the possibilities in my mind. I like to be alone when I'm working.\"\nIn a career devoted chiefly to the classical theatre, Scofield starred in many Shakespeare plays and played the title role in Ben Jonson's \"Volpone\" in Peter Hall's production for the Royal National Theatre (1977). In a 1994 interview, Scofield explained, \"One of the great strengths of the theatre is that it is ephemeral. It does exist only in what you remember and you can't check up on it afterwards and think, 'That's not as good as I remember.' If any performance I've ever given stays in someone's mind that's so much more exciting than being able to put it on the video and play it again. It's not that I don't want to take risks - the opposite is true, in fact. But the more you know about acting, the more you're aware of the pitfalls and the more nerve-racking it becomes. When I was young, I wasn't nervous at all. Even doing \"Hamlet\", I just had a go.\"\nScofield also appeared as Charles Dyer in Dyer's play \"Staircase\", staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966; Laurie in John Osborne's \"A Hotel in Amsterdam\" (1968); and Antonio Salieri in the original stage production of Peter Shaffer's \"Amadeus\" (1979). He was subsequently the voice of the Dragon in another play by Robert Bolt, a children's drama \"The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew\". \"Expresso Bongo\", \"Staircase\" and \"Amadeus\" were filmed with other actors, but Scofield starred in the screen version of \"King Lear\" (1971). His other major screen roles include the art-obsessed Wehrmacht Colonel von Waldheim in \"The Train\" (1964), Strether in a 1977 TV adaptation of Henry James's novel \"The Ambassadors\", and Tobias in Edward Albee's \"A Delicate Balance\" (1973).\n1980\u20131999.\nScofield was cast in the lead role of Sir Randolph Nettleby in the 1985 film \"The Shooting Party\", but was forced to withdraw due to an injury he suffered on set. According to the DVD extras documentary for the film, Scofield and the other male lead actors were to come into shot on a horse-drawn shooting brake driven by the renowned film horse-master George Mossman as the first shot of the first day of filming. As they turned the first corner, the plank that Mossman was standing on broke in two and he was hurled forward and down, falling between the sets of wheels and taking the reins with him. He was struck by a horse's hoof and concussed. The horses shied and broke into a gallop. Actor Rupert Frazer admitted that he was the first to jump off, landing safely, but bruised. Out of control, the horses turned to the right when confronted by a stone wall, causing the shooting brake to roll completely, catapulting the actors into a pile of scaffolding that had been stacked next to the wall. Robert Hardy stood up and realised to his amazement that he was unhurt. He looked across to see Edward Fox stand up, \"turn completely green and collapse in a heap\", having broken five ribs and his shoulder blade. He noticed that Scofield was lying very still on the ground \"and I saw that his shin-bone was sticking out through his trousers\". As the film takes place in October during the partridge-shooting season, the filmmakers had to make a choice whether to delay filming for a year or re-cast. The \"Shooting Party\" schedule was ultimately changed to allow James Mason to take over the part of Sir Randolph Nettleby six weeks later. Scofield's broken leg also deprived him of the part of O'Brien in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" in which he was replaced by Richard Burton.\nHelen Mirren, who appeared with Scofield in the 1989 film \"When the Whales Came\", said, \"He aspires to the soul rather than the character. He has no sense of personal ambition. He's one of our great, great actors. We're lucky to have him.\" Scofield also portrayed the Ghost in Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 film adaptation of \"Hamlet\" alongside Mel Gibson in the title role. Despite being an A-list actor at the time, Gibson, who had grown up idolising Scofield, compared the experience of performing Shakespeare alongside him to being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson\". Scofield, on the other hand, never felt similarly intimidated and later recalled about working with Gibson, \"Not the actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.\" Scofield portrayed Professor Moroi in the film of J\u00e1nos Ny\u00edri's \"If Winter Comes\" (1980), for BBC Television; poet Mark Van Doren in Robert Redford's film \"Quiz Show\" (1994), and Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth in Nicholas Hytner's film adaptation (1996) of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\".\nPersonal life and death.\nScofield married actress Joy Mary Parker on 15 May 1943. They had met while he played Hamlet to her Ophelia. Scofield later said \"Joy and I simply decided to be married. We were both of age and were determined. Any doubts from our families were overruled, and they were the usual ones \u2013 too young, etc. We had a week out at the end of \"The Moon Is Down\" tour, married during that week, and went straight into the Whitehall Theatre.\"\nPaul and Joy Scofield had two children: Martin (born 1945) who became a senior lecturer in English and American literature at the University of Kent and Sarah (born 1951). When asked by Garry O'Connor how he wished to be remembered, Scofield responded \"If you have a family, that is how to be remembered.\" When O'Connor asked about his seventieth birthday, Scofield replied, \"Birthdays are a bore, really. It's true, I do like my fallow times... I hate missing anything that might be happening outside on a summer evening, something in the garden.\" Filmmaker Michael Winner accordingly described Paul and Joy Scofield as \"one of the few very happily married couples I've ever met.\"\nScofield died from leukaemia on 19 March 2008 at the age of 86 at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, East Sussex, England. His memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on the first anniversary of his death. His wife Joy died four years later on 7 November 2012, aged 90.\nAwards and honours.\nScofield declined the honour of a knighthood on three occasions, but was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2001. When asked the reason for his decision to decline the knighthood, Scofield responded, \"I have every respect for people who are offered [a knighthood] and accept it gratefully. It is just not an aspect of life that I would want.\" His biographer Garry O'Connor described being knighted as \"the kind of honour from which [Scofield] instinctively recoiled. Never the actor before the part he plays.\" \nIn 1972, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Scofield its annual Shakespeare Prize. When Scofield was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for \"A Man for All Seasons\", he declined to travel to Los Angeles to attend the ceremony. When Scofield won the award, his leading lady Wendy Hiller, whom Fred Zinnemann had cast as Lady Alice More for being \"particularly marvelous at doing a 'slow burn'\", went up on stage to receive the Award Statue on Scofield's behalf. According to O'Connor, Scofield always kept his Oscar Statue \"put... away in the corner of his workroom\". Scofield explained, \"Although it was nice to get, it's not decorative, really. I suppose that's why I don't display it. But if anyone wants to see it I'll get it out.\" Scofield was subsequently nominated as Best Supporting Actor for \"Quiz Show\". \nScofield's many theatrical accolades include a 1962 Tony Award for \"A Man for All Seasons\". In 1969, Scofield became the sixth performer to win the Triple Crown of Acting, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for \"Male of the Species\". He accomplished this in only seven years (1962\u20131969), which is still a record. He was also one of only eleven actors to win both the Tony and the Oscar for the same role on stage and film, for \"A Man for All Seasons\". In 2002 he was awarded the honorary degree of D. Litt by the University of Oxford.\nIn 2004, a poll of actors of the Royal Shakespeare Company, including Ian McKellen, Donald Sinden, Janet Suzman, Ian Richardson, Antony Sher and Corin Redgrave, acclaimed Scofield's Lear as the greatest Shakespearean performance ever. Scofield appeared in many radio dramas for BBC Radio 4, including in later years plays by Peter Tinniswood: \"On the Train to Chemnitz\" (2001) and \"Anton in Eastbourne\" (2002). The latter was Tinniswood's last work and was written especially for Scofield, an admirer of Anton Chekhov. He was awarded the 2002 Sam Wanamaker Prize.\nDiscography.\nPaul Scofield led the cast in several dramas issued by Caedmon Records:\nAlso:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67955", "revid": "1398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67955", "title": "Georges Bizet", "text": "French composer (1838\u20131875)\nGeorges Bizet (n\u00e9\u00a0Alexandre C\u00e9sar L\u00e9opold Bizet; 25 October 1838\u00a0\u2013 3\u00a0June 1875) was a French composer of the Romantic era. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, \"Carmen\", which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.\nDuring a brilliant student career at the Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time\u2014\"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\" and \"La jolie fille de Perth\"\u2014were immediately successful.\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871, during which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera \"Djamileh\", though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to Alphonse Daudet's play \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\" was instantly popular. The production of his final opera, \"Carmen\", was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.\nBizet's marriage to Genevi\u00e8ve Hal\u00e9vy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from \"Carmen\", was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nFamily background and childhood.\nGeorges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838. He was registered as Alexandre C\u00e9sar L\u00e9opold, but baptised as \"Georges\" on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life. His father, Adolphe Bizet, had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training. He also composed a few works, including at least one published song. In 1837, Adolphe married Aim\u00e9e Delsarte, against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect; the Delsartes, though impoverished, were a cultured and highly musical family. Aim\u00e9e was an accomplished pianist, while her brother Fran\u00e7ois Delsarte was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both Louis Philippe and Napoleon III. Fran\u00e7ois Delsarte's wife Rosine, a musical prodigy, had been an assistant professor of solf\u00e8ge at the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of 13. At least one author has suggested that Aim\u00e9e was from a Jewish family, but this is not substantiated in any of Georges' official biographies.\nGeorges, an only child, showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.\nConservatoire.\nBizet was admitted to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848, two weeks before his 10th birthday. He made an early impression; within six months he had won first prize in solf\u00e8ge, a feat that impressed Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman, the Conservatoire's former professor of piano. Zimmerman gave Bizet private lessons in counterpoint and fugue, which continued until the old man's death in 1853. Through these classes, Bizet met Zimmerman's son-in-law, the composer Charles Gounod, who became a lasting influence on the young pupil's musical style\u2014although their relationship was often strained in later years. He also met another of Gounod's young students, the 13-year-old Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, who remained a firm friend of Bizet's. Under the tuition of Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel, the Conservatoire's professor of piano, Bizet's pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire's second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: \"In your class one learns something besides the piano; one becomes a musician\".\nBizet's first preserved compositions, two wordless songs for soprano, date from around 1850. In 1853, he joined Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's composition class and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality. Two of his songs, \"Petite Marguerite\" and \"La Rose et l'abeille\", were published in 1854. In 1855, he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra, and prepared four-hand piano versions of two of Gounod's works: the opera \"La nonne sanglante\" and the Symphony in D. Bizet's work on the Gounod symphony inspired him, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, to write his own symphony, which bore a close resemblance to Gounod's\u2014note for note in some passages. Bizet never published the symphony, which came to light again only in 1933, and was finally performed in 1935.\nIn 1856, Bizet competed for the prestigious Prix de Rome. His entry was not successful, but nor were any of the others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year. After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera competition which Jacques Offenbach had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 francs. The challenge was to set the one-act libretto of \"Le docteur Miracle\" by L\u00e9on Battu and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury's manipulation by Fromental Hal\u00e9vy in favour of Bizet. As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged Gioachino Rossini, who presented the young man with a signed photograph. Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that \"Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, he has all the virtues\".\nFor his 1857 Prix de Rome entry, Bizet, with Gounod's enthusiastic approval, chose to set the cantata \"Clovis et Clotilde\" by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Burion. Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts overturned the judges' initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only other requirement was the submission each year of an \"envoi\", a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Acad\u00e9mie. Before his departure for Rome in December 1857, Bizet's prize cantata was performed at the Acad\u00e9mie to an enthusiastic reception.\nRome, 1858\u20131860.\nOn 27 January 1858, Bizet arrived at the Villa Medici, a 16th-century palace that since 1803 had housed the French Acad\u00e9mie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as \"paradise\". Under its director, the painter Jean-Victor Schnetz, the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow-laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours. Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere, and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life; in his first six months in Rome, his only composition was a \"Te Deum\" written for the Rodrigues Prize, a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners. This piece failed to impress the judges, who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe, the only other entrant. Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music. His \"Te Deum\" remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971.\nThrough the winter of 1858\u201359, Bizet worked on his first envoi, an opera buffa setting of Carlo Cambiaggio's libretto \"Don Procopio\". Under the terms of his prize, Bizet's first envoi was supposed to be a mass, but after his \"Te Deum\" experience, he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Acad\u00e9mie, but their response to \"Don Procopio\" was initially positive, with praise for the composer's \"easy and brilliant touch\" and \"youthful and bold style\".\nFor his second envoi, not wishing to test the Acad\u00e9mie's tolerance too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by Horace. This work, entitled \"Carmen Saeculare\", was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to \"Carmen Saeculare\", he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe. After \"Don Procopio\", Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem \"Vasco da Gama\". This replaced \"Carmen Saeculare\" as his second envoi, and was well received by the Acad\u00e9mie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.\nIn the summer of 1859, Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around Anagni and Frosinone. They also visited a convict settlement at Anzio; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences. In August, he made an extended journey south to Naples and Pompeii, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: \"Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils...\" Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his \"Roma\" symphony, was not finished until 1868. On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete \"an important work\" (which has not been identified). In September 1860, while visiting Venice with his friend and fellow-laureate Ernest Guiraud, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.\nEmergent composer.\nParis, 1860\u20131863.\nBack in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Op\u00e9ra and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Op\u00e9ra. Although French composers were better represented at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager L\u00e9on Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's \"Faust\" and his \"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette\", and of a shortened version of Berlioz's \"Les Troyens\".\nOn 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner's opera \"Tannh\u00e4user\", a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner \"above and beyond all living composers\". Thereafter, accusations of \"Wagnerism\" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.\nAs a pianist, Bizet showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent \"as though it were a vice\". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: \"I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficulties\u00a0... there are three, and\u00a0... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant.\"\nBizet's third envoi was delayed for nearly a year by the prolonged illness and death, in September 1861, of his mother. He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works: an overture entitled \"La Chasse d'Ossian\", a scherzo and a funeral march. The overture has been lost; the scherzo was later absorbed into the \"Roma\" symphony, and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera. Bizet's fourth and final envoi, which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, \"La guzla de l'\u00e9mir\". As a state-subsidised theatre, the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and \"La guzla\" duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from Count Walewski, to compose the music for a three-act opera. This was \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\", based on a libretto by Michel Carr\u00e9 and Eug\u00e8ne Cormon. Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer's first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew \"La guzla\" from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera. The first performance of \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\", by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique company, was on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it \"does M. Bizet the greatest honour\". Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera's run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886.\nIn 1862, Bizet had fathered a child with the family's housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up to believe that he was Adolphe Bizet's child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son's true paternity.\nYears of struggle.\nWhen his Prix de Rome grant expired, Bizet found he could not make a living from writing music. He accepted piano pupils and some composition students, two of whom, Edmond Galabert and Paul Lacombe, became his close friends. He also worked as an accompanist at rehearsals and auditions for various staged works, including Berlioz's oratorio \"L'enfance du Christ\" and Gounod's opera \"Mireille\". However, his main work in this period was as an arranger of others' works. He made piano transcriptions for hundreds of operas and other pieces and prepared vocal scores and orchestral arrangements for all kinds of music. He was also, briefly, a music critic for \"La Revue Nationale et \u00c9trang\u00e8re\", under the assumed name of \"Gaston de Betzi\". Bizet's single contribution in this capacity appeared on 3 August 1867, after which he quarrelled with the magazine's new editor and resigned.\nSince 1862, Bizet had been working intermittently on \"Ivan IV\", an opera based on the life of Ivan the Terrible. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the Op\u00e9ra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946. In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for \"La jolie fille de Perth\", the libretto for which, by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges after Sir Walter Scott, is described by Bizet's biographer Winton Dean as \"the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set\". Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on 26 December 1867. Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet's other operas; \"Le M\u00e9nestral's\" critic hailed the second act as \"a masterpiece from beginning to end\". Despite the opera's success, Carvalho's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.\nWhile \"La jolie fille\" was in rehearsal, Bizet worked with three other composers, each of whom contributed a single act to a four-act operetta \"Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre\". When the work was performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e on 13 December 1867, it was a great success, and the \"Revue et Gazette Musicale's\" critic lavished particular praise on Bizet's act: \"Nothing could be more stylish, smarter and, at the same time, more distinguished\". Bizet also found time to finish his long-gestating \"Roma\" symphony and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs. Nevertheless, this period of Bizet's life was marked by significant disappointments. At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done. Several competition entries, including a cantata and a hymn composed for the Paris Exhibition of 1867, were unsuccessful. \"La Coupe du Roi de Thul\u00e9\", his entry for an opera competition, was not placed in the first five; from the fragments of this score that survive, analysts have discerned pre-echoes of \"Carmen\". On 28 February 1869, the \"Roma\" symphony was performed at the Cirque Napol\u00e9on, under Jules Pasdeloup. Afterwards, Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause, hisses, and catcalls, the work was a success.\nMarriage.\nNot long after Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's death in 1862, Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. Hal\u00e9vy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera \"No\u00e9\". Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Hal\u00e9vy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Hal\u00e9vy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter Genevi\u00e8ve, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Genevi\u00e8ve and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: \"I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!\" The pair became engaged, although the Hal\u00e9vy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: \"penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian\", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from \"a family bristling with artists and eccentrics\". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy wrote in his journal: \"Bizet has spirit and talent. He \"should\" succeed\".\nAs a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the \"No\u00e9\" manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund \"Vasco da Gama\" and \"Ivan IV\" were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and \"No\u00e9\" remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Genevi\u00e8ve's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Hal\u00e9vy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: \"Clarissa Harlowe\" based on Samuel Richardson's novel \"Clarissa\", and \"Gris\u00e9lidis\" with a libretto from Victorien Sardou. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.\nWar and upheaval.\nAfter a series of perceived provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French Emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which he was supposed to fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.\nBizet greeted with enthusiasm the proclamation in Paris of the Third Republic. The new government did not sue for peace, and by 17 September, the Prussian armies had surrounded Paris. Unlike Gounod, who fled to England, Bizet rejected opportunities to leave the besieged city: \"I can't leave Paris! It's impossible! It would be quite simply an act of cowardice\", he wrote to Mme Hal\u00e9vy. Life in the city became frugal and harsh, although, by October, there were efforts to re-establish normality. Pasdeloup resumed his regular Sunday concerts, and on 5 November, the Op\u00e9ra reopened with excerpts from works by Gluck, Rossini, and Meyerbeer.\nAn armistice was signed on 26 January 1871, but the departure of the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance. Following an uprising, the city's municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the Paris Commune. Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and Genevi\u00e8ve escaped to Compi\u00e8gne. Later, they moved to Le V\u00e9sinet where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: \"The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence\", Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.\nLate career.\n\"Djamileh\", \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\" and \"Don Rodrigue\".\nAs life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at the Op\u00e9ra was seemingly confirmed by its director, \u00c9mile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera \"Erostrate\" after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on \"Clarissa Harlowe\" and \"Gris\u00e9lidis\", but plans for the latter to be staged at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled \"Jeux d'enfants\", and a one-act opera, \"Djamileh\", which opened at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Genevi\u00e8ve gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques.\nBizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\". When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872\u201373, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's \"Rom\u00e9o et Juliette\" at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\".\nIn June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic] Hal\u00e9vy are doing my piece\". The subject chosen for this project was Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's short novel, \"Carmen\". Bizet began the music in the summer of 1873, but the Op\u00e9ra-Comique's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqu\u00e9 story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended. Bizet then began composing \"Don Rodrigue\", an adaptation of the El Cid story by Louis Gallet and \u00c9douard Blau. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Op\u00e9ra's principal baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure, hoping that the singer's approval might influence the directors of the Op\u00e9ra to stage the work. However, on the night of 28\u201329 October, the Op\u00e9ra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set \"Don Rodrigue\" aside. It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, \"Patrie\".\n\"Carmen\".\nAdolphe de Leuven, the co-director of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique most bitterly opposed to the \"Carmen\" project, resigned early in 1874, removing the main barrier to the work's production. Bizet finished the score during the summer and was pleased with the outcome: \"I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody\". The renowned mezzo-soprano C\u00e9lestine Galli-Mari\u00e9 (known professionally as \"Galli-Mari\u00e9\") was engaged to sing the title role. According to Dean, she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it. There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair; his relations with Genevi\u00e8ve were strained at this time, and they lived apart for several months.\nWhen rehearsals began in October 1874, the orchestra had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable. The chorus likewise declared some of their music impossible to sing and were dismayed that they had to act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line. Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper. Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way. Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning, by chance, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was announced.\nAmong leading musical figures at the premiere were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and Charles Gounod. Genevi\u00e8ve, suffering from an abscess in her right eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Sa\u00ebns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: \"Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish\". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Mari\u00e9's performance was described by one critic as \"the very incarnation of vice\". Others complained of a lack of melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Op\u00e9ra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. L\u00e9on Escudier in \"L'Art Musical\" called the music \"dull and obscure\u00a0... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes\". There was, however, praise from the poet Th\u00e9odore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Op\u00e9ra-Comique \"puppets\". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: \"I foresee a definite and hopeless flop\".\nIllness and death.\nFor most of his life, Bizet had suffered from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert that he had been very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: \"I suffered like a dog\". In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing \"Carmen\", he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as \"throat angina\", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875. At that time, depressed by the evident failure of \"Carmen\", Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at Bougival and, feeling a little better, went for a swim in the Seine. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but in the early hours of 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack. He was 36 years old.\nThe suddenness of Bizet's death, and awareness of his depressed mental state, fuelled rumours of suicide. Although the exact cause of death was never settled with certainty, physicians eventually determined the cause as \"a cardiac complication of acute articular rheumatism\". News of the death stunned the Paris musical world, and because Galli-Mari\u00e9 was too upset to appear, that evening's performance of \"Carmen\" was cancelled and replaced with Boieldieu's \"La dame blanche\".\nMore than 4,000 people were present at the funeral on 5 June, at the \u00c9glise de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, just to the north of the Op\u00e9ra. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who included Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, L\u00e9on Hal\u00e9vy and Massenet. An orchestra, under Jules Pasdeloup, played \"Patrie\", and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from \"Carmen\". At the burial which followed at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet had been struck down just as he was becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his peroration. After a special performance of \"Carmen\" at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique that night, the press, which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier, now declared Bizet a master.\nMusic.\nEarly works.\nBizet's earliest compositions, chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises, give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist. Dean sees evidence in the piano work \"Romance sans parole\", written before 1854, of \"the conjunction of melody, rhythm and accompaniment\" that is characteristic of Bizet's mature works. Bizet's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini's \"Guillaume Tell\". Critics have found it unremarkable, but the Symphony in C of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert. In Dean's view, the symphony has \"few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth\". The critic Ernest Newman suggests that Bizet may at this time have thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music, before an \"inner voice\" (and the realities of the French musical world) turned him towards the stage.\nOrchestral, piano and vocal works.\nAfter his early Symphony in C, Bizet's purely orchestral output is sparse. The \"Roma\" symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly, in Dean's view, with its juvenile predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod and contains passages that recall Weber and Mendelssohn. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; he calls it a \"misfire\". Bizet's other mature orchestral work, the overture \"Patrie\", is similarly dismissed: \"an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism\".\nThe musicologist Hugh Macdonald argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived from the 12-movement \"Jeux d'enfants\" for piano four-hands (1871) and the \"musique de sc\u00e8ne\" for Daudet's play \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\" (1872): \"Jeux\" resulted in the \"Petite suite\" of 1873, which has five movements \"(Marche\u2014Berceuse\u2014Impromptu\u2014Duo\u2014Galop)\", while the \"musique de sc\u00e8ne\" resulted in two suites, one from the year of the premiere compiled by Bizet \"(Pr\u00e9lude\u2014Menuet\u2014Adagietto\u2014Carillon)\" and the other from 1879 compiled posthumously by Guiraud \"(Pastorale\u2014Intermezzo\u2014Menuet\u2014Farandole)\". According to Macdonald, in all three Bizet demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.\nBizet's piano works have not entered the concert pianist's repertoire and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt. The exception is the above-described \"Jeux d'enfants\" duet suite; here Bizet avoids the virtuoso passages that so dominate his solo music. The early solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin; later works, such as the \"Variations chromatiques\" or the \"Chasse fantastique\", owe more to Liszt.\nMost of Bizet's songs were written in the period 1866\u201368. Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse, and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice. Much of Bizet's larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early \"Te Deum\", which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as \"a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet's unfitness to write religious music.\"\nDramatic works.\nBizet's early one-act opera \"Le docteur Miracle\" provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, \"many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation\". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements in many of his earliest works: \"[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved.\" Until \"Carmen\", however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.\nIn \"Don Procopio\", Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in \"Don Pasquale\", a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet's fingerprints emerge unmistakably. In his first significant opera, \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\", Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, the music in Dean's view rises at times \"far above the level of contemporary French opera\". Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the cavatina\" Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre\" played by two French horns over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst Herv\u00e9 Lacombe, \"resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest\". While the music of \"Les p\u00eacheurs\" is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera's Eastern setting, in \"La jolie fille de Perth\", Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood, though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera's Act III seduction scene.\nFrom Bizet's unfinished works, Macdonald highlights \"La coupe du roi de Thul\u00e9\" as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in \"Carmen\" and suggests that had \"Clarissa Harlowe\" and \"Gris\u00e9lidis\" been completed, Bizet's legacy would have been \"infinitely richer\". As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera, he encountered critical hostility. In the case of \"Djamileh\", the accusation of \"Wagnerism\" was raised again, as audiences struggled to understand the score's originality; many found the music pretentious and monotonous, lacking in both rhythm and melody. By contrast, modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that \"Djamileh\" is \"a truly enchanting piece, full of inventive touches, especially of chromatic colour.\"\nRalph P. Locke, in his study of \"Carmen's\" origins, draws attention to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain. Grout, in his \"History of Western Music\", praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion. Among the opera's early champions were Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and particularly Wagner, who commented: \"Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head.\" Another champion of the work was Friedrich Nietzsche, who claimed to know it by heart; \"It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere\". By broad consent, \"Carmen\" represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of op\u00e9ra comique.\nLegacy.\nAfter Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet. Even \"Carmen\" was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score. The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from \"Carmen\" and the \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\" suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death. However, the 20th century saw increased interest. \"Don Procopio\" was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of \"Les p\u00eacheurs de perles\" was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses. After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, Sir Thomas Beecham. Excerpts from \"La coupe du roi de Thul\u00e9\", edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the BBC on 12 July 1955, and \"Le docteur Miracle\" was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group. \"Vasco da Gama\" and \"Ivan IV\" have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music. \"Carmen\", after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878). It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life\u2014\"not idealised life but life as actually lived\".\nThe music critic Harold C. Schonberg surmises that, had Bizet lived, he might have revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, according to Dean, developed the idea \"till it became threadbare\". Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes\u2014Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ri in \"L'Arl\u00e9sienne\", Jos\u00e9 in \"Carmen\"\u2014is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the B minor \"Pathetique\". Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. \"The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction.\"\nIn Bizet's family circle, his father Adolphe died in 1886. Bizet's son Jacques killed himself in 1922 after an unhappy love affair. Jean Reiter, Bizet's elder son, had a successful career as press director of \"Le Temps\", became an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and died in 1939 at the age of 77. In 1886, Genevi\u00e8ve married \u00c9mile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, Marcel Proust. She showed little interest in her first husband's musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs. She died in 1926; in her will, she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had \"produced a remarkable work within the previous five years\". Winners of the prize include Tony Aubin, Jean-Michel Damase, Henri Dutilleux, and Jean Martinon.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its known isotopes are extremely radioactive, and have only been created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 30 seconds. Copernicium was first created in February 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It was named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus on his 537th anniversary.\nIn the periodic table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element and a group 12 element. During reactions with gold, it has been shown to be an extremely volatile element, so much so that it is possibly a gas or a volatile liquid at standard temperature and pressure.\nCopernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ from its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones, and it may have more similarities to the noble gases such as radon rather than its group 12 homologues. Calculations indicate that copernicium may show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all. It has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements. Predictions vary on whether solid copernicium would be a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. Copernicium is one of the heaviest elements whose chemical properties have been experimentally investigated.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nCopernicium was first created on 9 February 1996, at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element was created by firing accelerated zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277. (A second was originally reported, but was found to have been based on data fabricated by Ninov, and was thus retracted.)\nPb + Zn \u2192 Cn* \u2192 Cn + n\nIn May 2000, the GSI successfully repeated the experiment to synthesize a further atom of copernicium-277.\nThis reaction was repeated at RIKEN using the Search for a Super-Heavy Element Using a Gas-Filled Recoil Separator set-up in 2004 and 2013 to synthesize three further atoms and confirm the decay data reported by the GSI team. This reaction had also previously been tried in 1971 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, to aim for 276Cn (produced in the 2n channel), but without success.\nThe IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) assessed the claim of copernicium's discovery by the GSI team in 2001 and 2003. In both cases, they found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim. This was primarily related to the contradicting decay data for the known nuclide rutherfordium-261. However, between 2001 and 2005, the GSI team studied the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs, and were able to confirm the decay data for hassium-269 and rutherfordium-261. It was found that the existing data on rutherfordium-261 was for an isomer, now designated rutherfordium-261m.\nIn May 2009, the JWP reported on the claims of discovery of element\u00a0112 again and officially recognized the GSI team as the discoverers of element 112. This decision was based on the confirmation of the decay properties of daughter nuclei as well as the confirmatory experiments at RIKEN.\nWork had also been done at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia from 1998 to synthesize the heavier isotope 283Cn in the hot fusion reaction 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn; most observed atoms of 283Cn decayed by spontaneous fission, although an alpha decay branch to 279Ds was detected. While initial experiments aimed to assign the produced nuclide with its observed long half-life of 3\u00a0minutes based on its chemical behaviour, this was found to be not mercury-like as would have been expected (copernicium being under mercury in the periodic table), and indeed now it appears that the long-lived activity might not have been from 283Cn at all, but its electron capture daughter 283Rg instead, with a shorter 4-second half-life associated with 283Cn. (Another possibility is assignment to a metastable isomeric state, 283mCn.) While later cross-bombardments in the 242Pu+48Ca and 245Cm+48Ca reactions succeeded in confirming the properties of 283Cn and its parents 287Fl and 291Lv, and played a major role in the acceptance of the discoveries of flerovium and livermorium (elements 114 and 116) by the JWP in 2011, this work originated subsequent to the GSI's work on 277Cn and priority was assigned to the GSI.\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, copernicium should be known as \"eka-mercury\". In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called \"ununbium\" (with the corresponding symbol of \"Uub\"), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it \"element 112\", with the symbol of \"E112\", \"(112)\", or even simply \"112\".\nAfter acknowledging the GSI team's discovery, the IUPAC asked them to suggest a permanent name for element 112. On 14 July 2009, they proposed \"copernicium\" with the element symbol Cp, after Nicolaus Copernicus \"to honor an outstanding scientist, who changed our view of the world\".\nDuring the standard six-month discussion period among the scientific community about the naming,\nit was pointed out that the symbol \"Cp\" was previously associated with the name \"cassiopeium\" (cassiopium), now known as lutetium (Lu). Moreover, Cp is frequently used today to mean the cyclopentadienyl ligand (C5H5). Primarily because cassiopeium (Cp) was (until 1949) accepted by IUPAC as an alternative allowed name for lutetium, the IUPAC disallowed the use of Cp as a future symbol, prompting the GSI team to put forward the symbol Cn as an alternative. On 19 February 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus' birth, IUPAC officially accepted the proposed name and symbol.\nIsotopes.\nCopernicium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes have been reported with mass numbers 277 and 280\u2013286, and one unconfirmed metastable isomer in 285Cn has been reported. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission, and copernicium-283 may have an electron capture branch.\nThe isotope copernicium-283 was instrumental in the confirmation of the discoveries of the elements flerovium and livermorium.\nHalf-lives.\nAll confirmed copernicium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter, and isotopes with an odd neutron number have relatively longer half-lives due to additional hindrance against spontaneous fission. The most stable known isotope, 285Cn, has a half-life of 30\u00a0seconds; 283Cn has a half-life of 4\u00a0seconds, and the unconfirmed 285mCn and 286Cn have half-lives of about 15 and 8.45\u00a0seconds respectively. Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than one\u00a0second. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives on the order of 0.1\u00a0seconds, and the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than a few decades, for they are predicted to lie near the center of the theoretical island of stability, and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10\u221212 times as abundant as lead.\nThe lightest isotopes of copernicium have been synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products (except for 277Cn, which is not known to be a decay product), while the heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 283Cn; the three heavier isotopes, 284Cn, 285Cn, and 286Cn, have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers.\nIn 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium-281 nuclei, which were claimed to have undergone alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with decay energy 10.68\u00a0MeV and half-life 0.90\u00a0ms, but their claim was retracted in 2001 as it had been based on data fabricated by Ninov. This isotope was truly produced in 2010 by the same team; the new data contradicted the previous fabricated data.\nThe missing isotopes 278Cn and 279Cn are too heavy to be produced by cold fusion and too light to be produced by hot fusion. They might be filled from above by decay of heavier elements produced by hot fusion, and indeed 280Cn and 281Cn were produced this way. The isotopes 286Cn and 287Cn could be produced by charged-particle evaporation, in the reaction 244Pu(48Ca,\u03b1\"x\"n) with \"x\" equalling 1 or 2.\nPredicted properties.\nVery few properties of copernicium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that copernicium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemical properties have been measured, as well as the boiling point, but properties of the copernicium metal remain generally unknown and for the most part, only predictions are available.\nChemical.\nCopernicium is the tenth and last member of the 6d series and is the heaviest group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group\u00a012 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. A standard reduction potential of +2.1\u00a0V is predicted for the Cn2+/Cn couple. Copernicium's predicted first ionization energy of 1155\u00a0kJ/mol almost matches that of the noble gas xenon at 1170.4\u00a0kJ/mol. Copernicium's metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal\u2013metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15\u201320\u00a0kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury. In opposition to the earlier suggestion, ab initio calculations at the high level of accuracy predicted that the chemistry of singly-valent copernicium resembles that of mercury rather than that of the noble gases. The latter result can be explained by the huge spin\u2013orbit interaction which significantly lowers the energy of the vacant 7p1/2 state of copernicium.\nOnce copernicium is ionized, its chemistry may present several differences from those of zinc, cadmium, and mercury. Due to the stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects, Cn2+ is likely to have a [Rn]5f146d87s2 electronic configuration, using the 6d orbitals before the 7s one, unlike its homologues. The fact that the 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized, it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues, especially in the possible +4 oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, copernicium may form the +2 and perhaps +4 oxidation states. The diatomic ion Hg22+, featuring mercury in the +1 oxidation state, is well-known, but the Cn22+ ion is predicted to be unstable or even non-existent. Copernicium(II) fluoride, CnF2, should be more unstable than the analogous mercury compound, mercury(II) fluoride (HgF2), and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements. As the most electronegative reactive element, fluorine may be the only element able to oxidize copernicium even further to the +4 and even +6 oxidation states in CnF4 and CnF6; the latter may require matrix-isolation conditions to be detected, as in the disputed detection of HgF4. CnF4 should be more stable than CnF2. In polar solvents, copernicium is predicted to preferentially form the CnF5- and CnF3- anions rather than the analogous neutral fluorides (CnF4 and CnF2, respectively), although the analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The anions CnCl42- and CnBr42- should also be able to exist in aqueous solution. The formation of thermodynamically stable copernicium(II) and (IV) fluorides would be analogous to the chemistry of xenon. Analogous to mercury(II) cyanide (Hg(CN)2), copernicium is expected to form a stable cyanide, Cn(CN)2.\nPhysical and atomic.\nCopernicium should be a dense metal, with a density of 14.0\u00a0g/cm3 in the liquid state at 300\u00a0K; this is similar to the known density of mercury, which is 13.534\u00a0g/cm3. (Solid copernicium at the same temperature should have a higher density of 14.7\u00a0g/cm3.) This results from the effects of copernicium's higher atomic weight being cancelled out by its larger interatomic distances compared to mercury. Some calculations predicted copernicium to be a gas at room temperature due to its closed-shell electron configuration, which would make it the first gaseous metal in the periodic table. A 2019 calculation agrees with these predictions on the role of relativistic effects, suggesting that copernicium will be a volatile liquid bound by dispersion forces under standard conditions. Its melting point is estimated at and its boiling point at , the latter in agreement with the experimentally estimated value of . The atomic radius of copernicium is expected to be around 147\u00a0pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.\nIn addition to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital is expected to be destabilized due to spin\u2013orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Predictions of the expected band structure of copernicium are varied. Calculations in 2007 expected that copernicium may be a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2\u00a0eV, crystallizing in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure. However, calculations in 2017 and 2018 suggested that copernicium should be a noble metal at standard conditions with a body-centered cubic crystal structure: it should hence have no band gap, like mercury, although the density of states at the Fermi level is expected to be lower for copernicium than for mercury. 2019 calculations then suggested that in fact copernicium has a large band gap of 6.4 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0eV, which should be similar to that of the noble gas radon (predicted as 7.1\u00a0eV) and would make it an insulator; bulk copernicium is predicted by these calculations to be bound mostly by dispersion forces, like the noble gases. Like mercury, radon, and flerovium, but not oganesson (eka-radon), copernicium is calculated to have no electron affinity.\nExperimental atomic gas phase chemistry.\nInterest in copernicium's chemistry was sparked by predictions that it would have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period\u00a07 and group\u00a012, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium is expected to have the ground state electron configuration [Rn] 5f14 6d10 7s2 and thus should belong to group\u00a012 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element\u00a0112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.\nThe first chemical experiments on copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5\u00a0minutes. Analysis of the data indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April\u2013May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR\u2013PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. (The 242Pu + 48Ca fusion reaction has a slightly larger cross-section than the 238U + 48Ca reaction, so that the best way to produce copernicium for chemical experimentation is as an overshoot product as the daughter of flerovium.) In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties were interpreted to show that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold. This agrees with general indications from some relativistic calculations that copernicium is \"more or less\" homologous to mercury. However, it was pointed out in 2019 that this result may simply be due to strong dispersion interactions.\nIn April 2007, this experiment was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed and indicated that copernicium has adsorption properties in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84\u00a0\u00b0C, so that it may be a gas at standard conditions.\nBecause the lighter group 12 elements often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments were conducted in 2015 to deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide was observed, with -\u0394\"H\"adsCn(t-Se) &gt; 48\u00a0kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as the stability of the group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His works are distinguished by a vivid, humane, and sympathetic depiction of contemporary social issues. Considered an director, Vidor approached multiple genres and allowed the subject matter to determine the style, often pressing the limits of film-making conventions.\nHis most acclaimed and successful film in the silent era was \"The Big Parade\" (1925). Vidor's sound films of the 1940s and early 1950s arguably represent his richest output. Among his finest works are \"Northwest Passage\" (1940), \"Comrade X\" (1940), \"An American Romance\" (1944), and \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946). His dramatic depictions of the American western landscape endow nature with a sinister force where his characters struggle for survival and redemption.\nVidor's earlier films tend to identify with the common people in a collective struggle, whereas his later works place individualists at the center of his narratives.\nHe was considered an \"actors' director\": many of his players received Academy Award nominations or awards, among them Wallace Beery, Robert Donat, Barbara Stanwyck, Jennifer Jones, Anne Shirley, and Lillian Gish.\nVidor was nominated five times by the Academy Awards for Best Director. In 1979, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his \"incomparable achievements as a cinematic creator and innovator.\" Additionally, he won eight national and international film awards during his career, including the Screen Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 1957.\nIn 1962, he was head of the jury at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival.\nEarly life and career.\nVidor was born into a well-to-do family in Galveston, Texas, the son of Kate (n\u00e9e Wallis) and Charles Shelton Vidor, a lumber importer and mill owner. His paternal grandfather, K\u00e1roly Vidor, was a refugee of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, who adopted the Americanized named \"Charles\" when he settled in Galveston in the early 1850s, and fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Vidor's mother, Kate Wallis, of Scotch-English descent, was a relative of the second wife of noted frontiersman and politician Davy Crockett. \"King\" was his given name, not a sobriquet, and honored his mother's favorite brother, King Wallis.\nAt the age of six, Vidor witnessed the devastation of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. Based on that formative experience, he published a historical memoir of the disaster titled \"Southern Storm\" for the May 1935 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. In an interview with the Directors Guild of America (DGA) in 1980 Vidor recalled the horrors of the hurricane's effects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNear the end of production for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's \"The Wizard of Oz\", Vidor was called in to direct the remaining scenes set in Kansas. His contributions include the cyclone sequence and the musical number, \"Over the Rainbow.\"\nVidor was introduced to Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science by his mother at a very early age. Vidor would endow his films with the moral precepts of the faith, a \"blend of pragmatic self-help and religious mysticism.\"\nVidor attended grade school at the Peacock Military Academy, located in San Antonio, Texas.\nAmateur apprenticeship in Galveston.\nAs a boy, Vidor engaged in photographing and developing portraits of his relatives with a Box Brownie camera.\nAt the age of sixteen Vidor dropped out of a private high school in Maryland and returned to Galveston to work as a nickelodeon ticket taker and projectionist. As an 18-year-old amateur newsreel cameraman Vidor began to acquire skills as a film documentarian. His first movie was based on footage taken of a local hurricane (not to be confused with the 1900 Galveston hurricane). He sold footage from a Houston army parade to a newsreel outfit (titled \"The Grand Military Parade\") and made his first fictional movie, a semi-docucomedy concerning a local automobile race, \"In Tow\" (1913).\nHotex Motion Picture Company.\nVidor, in a partnership with vaudevillian and movie entrepreneur Edward Sedgwick formed the Hotex Motion Picture Company in 1914 (\"HO\" for Houston, \"TEX\" for Texas) to produce low-budget one- or two-reelers. The enterprise garnered a national press release in Moving Picture World announcing its formation. Only still photos survive from these comedy-adventures, for which Hotex failed to collect any royalties.\nIn 1915, newlyweds Vidor and actress Florence Arto Vidor along with business partner Sedgwick, moved to California in search of employment in the emerging Hollywood movie industry, arriving on the West Coast virtually penniless.\nHollywood apprenticeship: 1915\u20131918.\nBased on a screen test arranged by Texas actress Corinne Griffith and shot by Charles Rosher in Hollywood, Florence Vidor procured a contract with Vitagraph Studios, marking the start of her successful movie career. Vidor obtained minor roles acting at Vitagraph and Inceville studios (the spy drama \"The Intrigue\" (1916) survives, in which he plays a chauffeur). As a low-level office clerk at Universal, he was fired for trying to present his own scripts under the pseudonym \"Charles K. Wallis\", but soon was rehired by the studio as a writer of shorts.\nJudge Willis Brown series.\nBeginning in 1915, Vidor served as screenwriter and director on a series of shorts about the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents by social reformer Judge Willis Brown. Written and produced by Brown, Vidor filmed ten of the 20-film series, a project in which Vidor declared he had \"deeply believed\". A single reel from \"Bud's Recruit\" is known to survive, the earliest extant footage from Vidor's film directing career.\nBrentwood Film Corporation and the \"Preachment\" films, 1918\u20131919.\nIn 1918, at the age of 24, Vidor directed his first Hollywood feature, \"The Turn in the Road\" (1919), a film presentation of a Christian Science evangelical tract sponsored by a group of doctors and dentists affiliated as the independent Brentwood Film Corporation. Vidor recalls of his first foray into Hollywood film-making:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wrote a script [The Turn in the Road] and sent it around\u00a0... and nine doctors put up $1,000 each\u00a0... and it was a success. That was the beginning. I didn't have time to go to college.\nVidor would make three more films for the Brentwood Corporation, all of which featured as yet unknown comedienne Zasu Pitts, who the director had discovered on a Hollywood streetcar. The films \"Better Times\", \"The Other Half\", and \"Poor Relations\", all completed in 1919, also featured future film director David Butler and starred Vidor's then wife Florence Arto Vidor (married in 1915), a rising actor in Hollywood pictures. Vidor ended his association with the Brentwood group in 1920.\n\"Vidor Village\" and First National Exhibitors, 1920\u20131925.\nKing Vidor next embarked on a major project in collaboration with a New York-based film exhibitor First National. In a bid to compete with the increasingly dominant Hollywood studios, First National advanced Vidor funding to build a small film production facility in Santa Monica, California, dubbed \"Vidor Village\". King Vidor issued a founding statement entitled \"Creed and Pledge\" that set forth moral anodynes for film-making, inspired by his Christian Science sympathies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe in the motion picture that carries a message to humanity.\nI believe in the picture that will help humanity to free itself from the shackles of fear and suffering that have so long bound it in chains.\nI will not knowingly produce a picture that contains anything that I do not believe to be absolutely true to human nature, anything that could injure anyone or anything unclean in thought or action.\nNor will I deliberately portray anything to cause fright, suggest fear, glorify mischief, condone cruelty or extenuate malice.\nI will never picture evil or wrong, except to prove the fallacy of its line.\nSo long as I direct pictures, I will make only those founded on the principles of right, and I will endeavor to draw upon the inexhaustible source of good for my stories, my guidance and my inspiration.\nHis \"manifesto\" was carried in \"Variety\" magazine's January 1920 issue.\nThe first production from Vidor Village was his \"The Jack Knife Man\" (1920), a bleak and bitter story of an orphaned boy raised by an impoverished yet kindly hermit, performed by former stage actor Fred Turner. The recluse achieves financial success and is ultimately rewarded with the affection of a hard-nosed but soft-hearted widow, played by Lillian Leighton. Redolent with the precepts of the \"Creed and Pledge\", the film's \"relentless realism\" did not please the executives at First National. They demanded entertainment that would garner a mass share of box-office receipts so as to fill their theaters.\nAs film critic and biographer John Baxter observed: \"[t]his experience had a fundamental effect on Vidor's attitude toward film-making.\" Under pressure \"as the studio system began to harden into place\", the 26-year-old Vidor began to craft his films to conform to prevailing standards of the period. His 1920 film \"The Family Honor\" exemplifies this shift towards romantic comedies and away from the ideals that had informed \"The Jack Knife Man\".\nVidor's \"The Sky Pilot\" (1921) was a big-budget western-comedy shot on location in the high Sierra Nevada of California. John Bowers stars as the intrepid preacher and Colleen Moore (soon to be famous as the quintessential Hollywood \"flapper\") as the girl he loved and rescued from a deadly cattle stampede. The natural landscapes serve as an essential dramatic component in the film, as they would in subsequent Vidor movies. The cost overruns cut into First National profits, and they declined to fund any further Vidor projects.\nVidor and Moore began a three-year romance on the set of \"The Sky Pilot\" that became \"a Hollywood legend.\" In 1963, almost 40 years later, the couple resumed their relationship and remained close until Vidor's death in 1982.\n\"Love Never Dies\" (1921) is a \"rural love story\" with a spectacular disaster scene depicting a locomotive and box cars derailing and plunging into a river below. The dramatic presentation of rivers served as a standard motif in Vidor films. Impressed with this Vidor sequence, producer Thomas H. Ince helped to finance the picture.\nIn 1922, Vidor produced and directed films that served as vehicles for his spouse, Florence Vidor, notable only for their \"artificiality\". These works conformed to the comedies of manners and romantic melodramas that were typical of his contemporary, Cecil B. DeMille at Famous Players\u2013Lasky studios. Later, Vidor admitted to being overawed by DeMille's talents. Florence Vidor, in her later career, frequently starred in DeMille productions.\nVidor's next picture, \"Conquering the Woman\", was an unabashed imitation of DeMille's outstanding drama \"Male and Female\" (1919), starring Gloria Swanson. Vidor followed up with \"Woman, Wake Up\" and \"The Real Adventure\" (both 1922) and each depicting a female struggling successfully to assert herself in a male dominated world. As such, these may be considered as early examples of feminist-oriented cinema, but with entirely conventional endings.\nBy the early 1920s, Florence Vidor had emerged as a major film star in her own right and wished to pursue her career independent of her spouse. The couple divorced in 1926, and shortly thereafter Florence married violinist Jascha Heifetz. Vidor would soon marry model and future film actress Eleanor Boardman.\nVidor Village went bankrupt in 1922 and Vidor, now without a studio, offered his services to the top executives in the film industry.\nMetro and \"Peg o' My Heart\" (1922).\nFilm producer Louis B. Mayer engaged Vidor to direct Broadway actress Laurette Taylor in a film version of her famous juvenile role as Peg O'Connell in \"Peg o' My Heart\", written by her husband J. Hartley Manners. Despite viewing screen tests supplied by director D. W. Griffth, Vidor was anxious that the aging Taylor (born 1884) would not be convincing as her 18-year-old stage character on screen. Biographer Marguerite Courtney describes their first encounter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in [her] frowzy wig and dead white makeup, the famous star looked closer to forty than eighteen. At the first sight of Laurette [Vidor] experienced acute relief. She came toward him smiling, and his camera-minded eye saw at once a face all round and animated, essentially youthful. Pumping her hand he burst out impulsively \"For Heaven's sake, let's make a test with your own lovely hair!\"\nThe process of adapting the stage version to film was nevertheless fraught with difficulties, complicated by a romantic attachment between director and star. The final product proved cinematically \"lifeless\".\nPleased with \"Peg o' My Heart\" box-office receipts, Mayer matched Vidor and Taylor again, resulting in a second feature film success, \"Happiness\" (1923) also written by Manners, with Taylor playing a charming Pollyanna-like character. The film would mark Vidor's final collaboration with the couple.\nNext, Vidor was entrusted to direct Mayer's top female star Clara Kimball Young in \"The Woman of Bronze\", a 1923 melodrama that resembled the formulaic films he had created with Florence Vidor at Vidor Village.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM): 1923\u20131944.\nSilent era: 1923\u20131928.\nVidor's yeoman service to Louis B. Mayer secured him entr\u00e9e into Goldwyn Pictures in 1923, a holding soon to be amalgamated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Samuel Goldwyn and other film producers of the early 1920s favored \"literary\" texts as the basis for movie screenplays. Parvenu-rich movie executives wished to provide a patina of class or \"tone\" to an industry often regarded as vulgar and cash-driven.\nVidor was content to adapt these \"prestigious properties\" so securing his reputation as a reliable studio asset. His work during this period did not rise to the level of his later work, but a few films stand out. \"Wild Oranges\" (1924), from a story by Joseph Hergesheimer, is notable as a harbinger of his best work in the sound era. The natural features of the coastal regions of Georgia are endowed with sinister and homicidal potential, where a fugitive arrives to terrorize rural residents. As such, the film exhibits Vidor's trademark use of nature to symbolize aspects of the human conflict.\nVidor and the John Gilbert collaborations: 1925\u20131926.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer's cast of rising movie stars included soon-to-be matinee idol John Gilbert. Vidor directed him in \"His Hour\" (1924), based on an Elinor Glyn \"febrile romance\", and is one of the few films from Vidor's output of that period to survive. Gilbert, as the Russian nobleman Prince Gritzko, was so ardently performed as co-star Aileen Pringle's seducer that one scene was deleted.\nVidor's typically \"routine\" movies of this period include \"Wine of Youth\" (1924) and \"Proud Flesh\" (1925) emphasize the \"time-honored virtues\" of familial and matrimonial loyalty, even among the liberated Jazz Age flappers.\nKing Vidor's tenure as a studio stringer was at an end. His next feature would transform his career and have a resounding impact on the late silent film era: \"The Big Parade\".\nA silent-era magnum opus: \"The Big Parade\": 1925.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"One of his least satisfactory silent films ... \"The Big Parade\" does not wear well: the portrait of World War I is softened and sentimentalized out of existence, soldiers portrayed as innocents thrust into the maw of battle, the cannons wreathed in scriptwriter's roses ... The scenes on the Western Front look trivial alongside contemporary photographs: the lice, the rats, and roaches, the urine and blood, the disease, fear, and horror of the true events are altogether lost in this version.\"\u2014Biographer Charles Higham, in \"The Art of the American Film\" (1973).\nIn 1925 Vidor directed \"The Big Parade\", among the most acclaimed films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success. \"The Big Parade\", a war romance starring John Gilbert, established Vidor as one of MGM's top studio directors for the next decade. The film would influence contemporary directors G. W. Pabst in \"Westfront 1918\" and Lewis Milestone in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", both 1930. Producer Irving Thalberg arranged for Vidor to film two more Gilbert vehicles: \"La Boh\u00e8me\" and \"Bardelys the Magnificent\", both released in 1926. In \"La Boh\u00e8me\", a film of \"great and enduring merit\", leading lady Lillian Gish exerted considerable control over the film's production. \"Bardelys the Magnificent,\" a picaresque swashbuckler mimicked the films of Douglas Fairbanks. Vidor would spoof the movie on his own \"Show People\" (1928) with comedienne Marion Davies.\nVidor's next film would be a startling departure from romantic entertainment to an exposure of the \"cruel deception of the American dream\".\n\"The Crowd\" (1928) and cinematic populism.\nIn the late 1920s European films, especially from German directors, exerted a strong influence on filmmakers internationally. Vidor's \"The Crowd \" resonates with these populist films, a \"pitiless study\" of a young working man's descent into isolation and loss of morale who is ultimately crushed by the urban \"assembly line\", while his wife struggles to maintain some order in their relationship. Though the most uncharacteristic of Vidor's pictures, it was his personal favorite: the picture, he said \"came out of my guts.\"\nEmploying relatively unknown actors, the film had modest box office success, but was widely praised by critics. In 1928, Vidor received his first Oscar nomination for Best Director. M-G-M executives, who had been content to allow Vidor an \"experimental\" film, found the bleak social outlook of \"The Crowd\" troubling \u2013 reflected in their one-year delay in releasing the film. \"The Crowd\" has since been recognized as one of the \"masterpieces\" of the late silent era.\nThe Marion Davies comedies, 1928\u20131930.\nCosmopolitan Pictures, a subsidiary of M-G-M studios and controlled by influential newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, insisted that Vidor direct Marion Davies \u2013 Hearst's longtime mistress \u2013 in these Cosmopolitan-supervised films, to which Vidor acquiesced. Though not identified as a director of comedies, Vidor filmed three \"\"screwball\"-like comedies that revealed Davies talents with her \"drive-you-to-distraction persona\".\n\"The Patsy\", a comedy of manners, brought Marie Dressler and Dell Henderson, veterans of Mack Sennett \"slapstick\" era out of retirement to play Davies' farcical upper-class parents. Davies performs a number of amusing celebrity imitations she was known for at social gatherings at Hearst's San Simeon estate, including Gloria Swanson, Lillian Gish, Pola Negri and Mae Murray.\nThe scenario for \"Show People\" (1928) was inspired by the glamorous Gloria Swanson, who began her film career in slapstick. Davis' character Peggy Pepper, a mere comic, is elevated to the high-style star Patricia Pepoire. Vidor spoofs his own recently completed \"Bardelys the Magnificent\" (1926), an over-the-top swashbuckling costume drama featuring romantic icon John Gilbert. Some of the best-known film stars of the silent era appeared in cameos, as well as Vidor himself. \"Show People\" remains the enduring picture of the Vidor\u2013Davies collaborations.\nVidor's third and final film with Davies was his second sound film (after \"Hallelujah\" (1929)): \"Not So Dumb\" (1930), adapted from the 1921 Broadway comedy \"Dulcy\" by George S. Kaufman. The limitations of early sound, despite recent innovations, interfered with the continuity of Davies' performance that had enlivened her earlier silent comedies with Vidor.\nEarly sound era: 1929\u20131937.\nIn early 1928, Vidor and his spouse Eleanor Boardman were visiting France in the company of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. There Vidor mixed with literary expatriates, among them James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway. Vidor was shaken by news that US film studios and theaters were converting to sound technology and he returned quickly to Hollywood, concerned about the impact on silent cinema. Adjusting to the advent of sound, Vidor enthusiastically embarked upon his long-desired project of making a picture about rural black American life incorporating a musical soundtrack. He quickly completed writing the scenario for \"Hallelujah\" and began recruiting an all African-American cast.\nM-G-M studios had not yet decided which emerging sound technology they would invest in, Vitaphone or Movietone, a decision that would determine what camera system Vidor would use. Vidor circumvented the dilemma by appealing directly to President of Lowe's Inc. Nicholas Schenck, who authorized Vidor to begin shooting outdoor location sequences without sound and with the caveat that Vidor waive his $100,000 salary.\n\"Hallelujah\" (1929).\nVidor's first sound film \"Hallelujah\" (1929) combines a dramatic rural tragedy with a documentary-like depiction of black agrarian community of sharecroppers in the South. Daniel L. Haynes as Zeke, Nina Mae McKinney as Chick and William Fontaine as Hot Shot developed a love-triangle that leads to a revenge murder. A quasi-musical, Vidor's innovative integration of sound into the scenes, including jazz and gospel adds immensely to the cinematic effect.\nVidor, a third-generation Texan, encountered black workers employed at his father's sawmills when he was a child, and there he became familiar with their spirituals. As an adult, he was not immune to the racial prejudices common among whites in the South of the 1920s. His paternalistic claim to know the character of the \"real negro\" is reflected in his portrayal of some rural black characters as \"childishly simple, lecherously promiscuous, fanatically superstitious, and shiftless\". Vidor, nonetheless, avoids reducing his characters to Uncle Tom stereotypes and his treatment bears no resemblance to the overt racism in D. W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915).\nThe black sharecroppers resemble more the poor white agrarian entrepreneurs Vidor praised in his 1934 \"Our Daily Bread\", emphasizing the class, rather than race, of his subjects. The film emerges as a human tragedy in which elemental forces of sexual desire and revenge contrast with family affection and community solidarity and redemption.\n\"Hallelujah\" enjoyed an overwhelmingly positive response in the United States and internationally, praising Vidor's stature as a film artist and as a humane social commentator. Vidor was nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards of 1929.\nM-G-M 1930\u20131931: \"Billy the Kid\" and \"The Champ\".\nFilmed just before passage of the Production Code of 1933, Vidor's \"Billy the Kid\" is free of the fixed moral dualities that came to typify subsequent Good Guy vs. Bad Guy Westerns in Hollywood. Starring former football champion Johnny Mack Brown as Billy and Wallace Beery as his nemesis Sheriff Pat Garrett, the protagonists display a gratuitous violence that anticipates Vidor's 1946 masterpiece \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946). Homicidal behavior resonates with the brutal and deadly desert landscape, Hemingwayesque in its brevity and realism. Studio executives were concerned that the excessive violence would alienate audiences, though the Prohibition era in the United States was saturated with news of the gangster-related killings.\nShot partially in the new 70 mm Grandeur system, the film was conceived by producers to be an epic, but few cinemas were equipped to handle the new wide-screen technology. The film did poorly at the box-office.\nUpon his return to M-G-M after completing \"Street Scene\" for Samuel Goldwyn, Vidor embarked on his second picture starring actor Wallace Beery, this time with child actor Jackie Cooper in \"The Champ\". Based on a story by Francis Marion, Vidor adapts a standard plot about a socially and economically impaired parent who relinquishes a child to insure his/her escape from squalid conditions to achieve an upwardly mobile future. The film is a descendant of director Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\" (1921), as well as Vidor's own early silent shorts for Judge Willis Brown. Vidor owed M-G-M a more conventional and \"fool-proof\" production after executives allowed him to make the more experimental \"Street Scene\" in 1931. \"The Champ\" would prove to be a successful vehicle for Beery and propel him to top-rank among M-G-M movie stars.\n\"Bird of Paradise\" and RKO Pictures : Sojourn in Hawaii, 1932.\nAfter finishing \"The Champ\", Vidor was loaned to Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) to make a \"South Seas\" romance for producer David Selznick filmed in the US territory of Hawaii. Starring Dolores del R\u00edo and Joel McCrea, the tropical location and mixed-race love theme in \"Bird of Paradise\" included nudity and sexual eroticism.\nDuring production Vidor began an affair with script assistant Elizabeth Hill that led to a series of highly productive screenplay collaborations and their marriage in 1937. Vidor divorced his wife, actress Eleanor Boardman shortly after \"Bird of Paradise\" was completed.\nGreat Depression: 1933\u20131934.\n\"The Stranger's Return\" (1933) and \"Our Daily Bread\" (1934) are Depression era films that present protagonists who flee the social and economic perils of urban America, plagued by high unemployment and labor unrest to seek a lost rural identity or make a new start in the agrarian countryside. Vidor's expressed enthusiasm for the New Deal and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's exhortation in his first inaugural in 1933 for a shift of labor from industry to agriculture.\nIn \"The Stranger's Return\", a city girl (Miriam Hopkins) abandons her life in a great metropolis to visit her grandfather (Lionel Barrymore) in Iowa, the aging patriarch of a working farm. Her arrival upsets the schemes of parasitic relatives to seize the property in anticipation of Grandpa Storr's passing. The scenario presents the farm as \"bountiful\", even in the midst of the Dust Bowl where banks seized tens-of-thousands of independent family farms in the Midwest and drove millions into low wage seasonal agricultural labor. The picture is a paean to family \"blood\" ties and rural generational continuity, manifested in the granddaughter's commitment (though raised in New York City) to inherit the family farm and honor its agrarian heritage.\nVidor continued his \"back to the land\" theme in his 1934 \"Our Daily Bread\". The picture is the second film of a trilogy he referred to as \"War, Wheat and Steel\". His 1925 film \"The Big Parade\" was \"war\" and his 1944 \"An American Romance\" was \"steel\". \"Our Daily Bread\" \u2013 \"wheat\" \u2013 is a sequel to his silent masterpiece \"The Crowd\" (1928).\n\"Our Daily Bread\" is a deeply personal and politically controversial work that Vidor financed himself when M-G-M executives declined to back the production. M-G-M was uncomfortable with its characterization of big business, and particularity banking institutions, as corrupt.\nA struggling Depression-era couple from the city inherit a derelict farm, and in an effort to make it a productive enterprise, they establish a cooperative in alliance with unemployed locals who possess various talents and commitments. The film raises questions as to the legitimacy of the American system of democracy and to government imposed social programs.\nThe picture garnered a mixed response among social and film critics, some regarding it as a socialistic condemnation of capitalism and others as tending towards fascism \u2013 a measure of Vidor's own ambivalence in organizing his social outlook artistically.\nThe Goldwyn films: 1931\u20131937.\n\"Street Scene\" (1931), \"Cynara\" (1932), \"The Wedding Night\" (1935), \"Stella Dallas\" (1937)\nDuring the 1930s Vidor, though under contract to M-G-M studios, made four films under loan-out to independent producer Samuel Goldwyn, formerly with the Goldwyn studios that had amalgamated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924. Goldwyn's insistence on fidelity to the prestigious literary material he had purchased for screen adaptations imposed cinematic restraints on his film directors, including Vidor. The first of their collaborations since the silent era was \"Street Scene\" (1931)\nThe adoption of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Elmer Rice depicts a microcosm in a major American metropolis and its social and economic inequalities. The cinematic limitations imposed by a single set restricted to a New York City block of tenements building and its ethnically diverse inhabitants presented Vidor with unique technical challenges. He and cinematographer George Barnes countered and complemented these structural restrictions by using a roving camera mounted on cranes, an innovation made possible by recent developments in early sound technology.\nThe excellent cast, drawn largely from the Broadway production, contributed to the critical success of the film, as did the huge publicity campaign engineered by Goldwyn. Street Scene's immense box-office profits belied the financial and economic crisis of the early Depression years, when movie studios feared bankruptcy.\n\"Cynara\" (1932), a romantic melodrama of a brief, yet tragic affair between a British barrister and a shopgirl, was Vidor's second sound collaboration with Goldwyn. Starring two of Hollywood's biggest stars of the period, Ronald Colman and Kay Francis, the story by Francis Marion is a cautionary tale concerning upper- and lower-class sexual infidelities set in England. Framed, as in the play and novel, in a series of flashbacks told by the married barrister Warlock (Colman), the story ends in honorable redemption for the barrister and death for his mistress. Vidor was able to inject some \"pure cinema\" into a picture that was otherwise a \"dialogue-heavy\" talkie: \"Colman [in London] tears up a piece of paper and throws the pieces out a window, where they fly into the air. Vidor cuts to St. Mark's Square in Venice (where Francis, his spouse is vacationing), with pigeons flying into the air\".\nIn his third collaboration with Goldwyn, Vidor was tasked with salvaging the producer's huge investment in Soviet-trained Russian actress Anna Sten. Goldwyn's effort to elevate Sten to the stature of Dietrich or Garbo had thus far failed despite his relentless promotion when Vidor began directing her in \"The Wedding Night\" (1935).\nA tale of a doomed affair between a married New Yorker (Gary Cooper) (whose character Vidor based on novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald) and a farm girl (Sten) from an Old World Polish family, Vidor provided thoughtful direction to Cooper and Sten while cinematographer Gregg Toland's devised effective lighting and photography. Despite good reviews the picture did not establish Sten as a star among movie-goers and she remained \"Goldwyn's Folly\".\nIn 1937 Vidor made his final and most profitable picture with Samuel Goldwyn: \"Stella Dallas\". A remake of Goldwyn's most successful silent movie, the 1925 \"Stella Dallas\", also an adaption of Olive Higgins Prouty's popular novel. Barbara Stanwyck stars as the eponymous \"martyr of motherhood\" in the sound re-make. Vidor analyzed director Henry King's handling of his silent production and incorporated or modified some of its filmic structure and staging. Stanwyck's performance, reportedly without undue oversight by Vidor, is outstanding, benefited by her selective vetting of Belle Bennett's famous portrayal. Vidor contributed to defining Stanwyck's role substantially in the final cut, providing a sharper focus on her character and delivering one of the great tear-jerkers in film history.\nDespite the success of the film it would be his last with Goldwyn, as Vidor had tired of the producer's outbursts on the set. Vidor emphatically declined to work with the \"mercurial\" producer again.\nParamount Pictures: 1935\u20131936.\n\"So Red the Rose\" (1935) and \"The Texas Rangers\" (1936)\nParamount production manager at Paramount Pictures, Ernst Lubitsch, persuaded Vidor to undertake the direction of a film based on a story that afforded a \"\"Southern\" perspective, \"So Red the Rose\", an American Civil War epic.\nThe topic appealed to the Texas-bred Vidor and he offered a dual vision of the antebellum South's response to the war among the white planter class, sentimentalizing their struggle and defeat. Here, the western \"pioneer\" plantation owners possess less of the anti-Northern fury that led to secession by their \"Old South\" counterparts. The scion of the estate, Duncan Bedford (Randolph Scott) initially refuses to join the Confederate army (\"I don't believe Americans should fight Americans\") but his sister Vallette Duncan (Margaret Sullavan) scorns his pacifism and singlehandedly diverts her slaves from rebellion. The white masters of the \"Portobello\" plantation in Mississippi emerge from the conflict content that North and South made equal sacrifices, and that a \"New South\" has emerged that is better off without its white aristocracy and slavery. With Portobello in ruins, Valette and Duncan submit to the virtues of hard work in a pastoral existence.\nThe novel \"So Red the Rose\" (1934) by Stark Young in its narrative and theme anticipates author Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" (1936). Vidor, initially tapped to direct Mitchell's epic, was ultimately assigned to director George Cukor.\nThe box-office failure of \"So Red the Rose\" led the film industry to anticipate the same for Cukor's adaption of Mitchell's Civil War epic. To the contrary, \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) enjoyed immense commercial and critical success.\nAt a period in the 1930s when Western theme films were relegated to low-budget B movies, Paramount studios financed an A Western for Vidor at $625,000 (lowered to $450,000 when star Gary Cooper was replaced with Fred MacMurray in the lead role.) \"The Texas Rangers\", Vidor's second and final film for Paramount reduced, but did not abandon, the level of sadistic and lawless violence evidenced in his \"Billy the Kid\". Vidor presents a morality play where the low-cunning of the outlaws \"cum\" vigilantes heroes is turned to the service of law-and-order when they kill their erstwhile accomplice in crime \u2013 the \"Polka Dot Bandit.\".\nThe film's scenario and script was penned by Vidor and wife Elizabeth Hill, based loosely on \"The Texas Rangers: A History of Frontier Defense of the Texas Rangers\" by Walter Prescott Webb. Made on the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Texas Ranger Division the picture includes standard B western tropes, including Indian massacres of white settlers and a corrupt city official who receives small town justice at the hands of a jury composed of saloon denizens. The film presages, as does Vidor's \"Billy the Kid\" (1931), his portrayal of the savagery of civilization and nature in producer David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946).\nIn an effort to retain Vidor at Paramount, the production head William LeBaron offered him a biopic of Texas icon, Sam Houston. Vidor emphatically declined: \"... \"I've [had] such a belly-full of Texas after the Rangers that I find myself not caring whether Sam Houston takes Texas from the Mexicans or lets them keep it.\"\nScreen Directors Guild.\nIn the 1930s Vidor became a leading advocate for the formation of the Screen Directors Guild (SDG) (called the Directors Guild of America (DGA) since 1960 when television directors joined its ranks.)\nIn an effort to enlarge movie director's meager influence in studio production decisions, Vidor personally exhorted a dozen or more leading directors, among them Howard Hawks, William Wellman, Ernst Lubitsch and Lewis Milestone to form a union, leading to the incorporation of the SDG in January 1936. By 1938, the collective bargaining unit had grown from a founding membership of 29 to an inclusive union of 600, representing Hollywood directors and assistant directors. The demands under Vidor's tenure at SDG were mild, seeking increased opportunities to examine scripts before filming and to make the initial cut on a movie.\nAs the SDG's first president, and a founding member of the anti-Communist group the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, Vidor failed to bring the SDG into affiliation with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) that had already organized actors and screenwriters (deemed a \"Bolshevik\" political front by anti-communist critics). Not until 1939 would the directors sign an accord with these sister guilds, under then SDG president Frank Capra.\nM-G-M: 1938\u20131944.\nUpon completion of \"Stella Dallas\" and his disaffection from Samuel Goldwyn, Vidor returned to M-G-M under a five-film contract that would produce \"The Citadel\" (1938), \"Northwest Passage\" (1940), \"Comrade X\" (1940), \"H. M. Pulham, Esq.\" (1941) and \"An American Romance\" (1944). In 1939, Vidor would also direct the final three weeks of primary filming for \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939).\nFilm historian John Baxter describes the demands that the studio system at M-G-M had on an auteur director such as Vidor in this period:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;M-G-M's assembly line system caught up with even top directors like Vidor, who could be called on to pass judgment on a new property or even prepare a project, only to find themselves a few days later shifted to something else.\nThese unconsummated projects at M-G-M include \"National Velvet\" (1944) and \"The Yearling\" (1946), the later in which Vidor presided over a failed attempt to produce a population of juvenile deer who would be age-appropriate throughout the production (female deer refused to reproduce out of season). Both films would be completed by the director Clarence Brown. Vidor further invested six months shooting an Amazon River survival-adventure, \"The Witch in the Wilderness\" from which he was diverted to perform pre-production for \"Northwest Passage\" (1940). This period would be one of transition for Vidor but would lead to an artistic phase where he created some of his richest and most characteristic works.\nThe Citadel: The first picture under the contract and the first under the Screen Directors Guild (SDG) was \"The Citadel\" in 1938. Filmed in England at a time the British government and trade unions had placed restrictions designed to extract a portion of the highly lucrative American movie exports to the British Isles. M-G-M, as a tactical olive branch, agreed to hire British actors as cast members for \"The Citadel\" and provided them generous compensation. (American actress Rosalind Russell and Vidor were the only two non-Britons who served on the film's production).\nThe movie is a close adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel of the same name, an expos\u00e9 of the mercenary aspects of the medical profession that entices doctors to serve the upper-classes at the expense of the poor. Vidor's Christian Science-inspired detachment from the medical profession influence his handling of the story, in which an independent doctor's cooperative is favored over both socialized medicine and a profit-driven medical establishment.\nThe protagonist, Dr. Andrew Manson (Robert Donat) ultimately resorts to an act of anarchism by using explosives to destroy a disease-producing sewer, but emerges personally vindicated. \nA success at the Academy Awards, the film garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Donat), Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.\nDuring the late 1930s M-G-M enlisted Vidor to assume artistic and technical responsibilities, some of which went uncredited. The most outstanding of these was his shooting of the black-and-white \"Kansas\" sequences in \"The Wizard of Oz\", including the notable musical production in which Dorothy Judy Garland sings \"Over the Rainbow\". Portions of the Technicolor sequences that depict Dorothy and her companions lulled into sleep on a field of poppies were also handled by Vidor.\nThe sound era saw the eclipse of the Western movie that had its heyday in the silent era and by the 1930s the genre was relegated to the producers of B movies. By the end of the decade high-budget films depicting the Indian Wars in the America of the 18th and 19th century reappeared, notably Ford's \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" (1939) and DeMille's \"North West Mounted Police\" (1940)\nIn the summer of 1939, Vidor began filming a Western-themed picture in Idaho using the three-strip Technicolor system. The picture that emerged is one of his \"master works\": \"Northwest Passage\" (1940).\nNorthwest Passage: Based on an American colonial-era epic novel, the film describes a punitive expedition against an Abenaki (Iroquois) village by a unit of British Army irregulars during the French and Indian Wars. Major Robert Rogers (Spencer Tracy) leads his green-clad \"Roberts Rangers\" on a grueling trek through 200 miles of wilderness. The Rangers fall upon the village and brutally exterminate the inhabitants who are suspected of assaulting white settlements. A demoralized retreat ensues led by Rogers. Under retaliatory attack by Indians and a savage landscape the Rangers are pushed to the limits of their endurance, some reduced to cannibalism and madness.\nThe script by Laurence Stallings and Talbot Jennings (and several uncredited writers) conveys the unabashed anti-Indian hatred that motivates Roger's men to their task. The level of violence anticipates film noir of the post-World War II period and the McCarthy era.\nVidor began filming in July 1939, just weeks before war was declared in Europe and the isolationist or interventionist policies were widely debated. The film influenced tropes that appeared in subsequent war films, depicting small military units operating behind enemy lines and relying on harsh tactics to destroy enemy combatants. The relevance of \"Northwest Passage\"'s sanguinary adventurer to contemporary Americans confronted with a looming world war is never made explicit but raises moral questions on \"military virtue\" and how a modern war might be conducted. Though Vidor was \"anti-fascist\" his political predilections are left unstated in \"Northwest Passage\".\nVidor established an unusually close professional relationship with the film's star, Spencer Tracy, and the actor delivered what Vidor considered a performance of \"tremendous conviction\".\nVidor used Technicolor's three-strip camera system for the film, marking his first full film in color. The two 800-pound [365\u00a0kg] rented Technicolor cameras had to be transported by train. The color photography conveys the scenics of Payette Lake, injecting documentary realism into key sequences. Notable are those of the Rangers portaging boats through a rugged mountain pass, and the famous river \"human chain\" crossing. Despite its significant box office earnings, \"Northwest Passage\" failed to recoup its $2\u00a0million production costs. The cinematography earned an Oscer nomination in that category.\nComrade X: A political comedy set in the Soviet Union, \"Comrade X\" (1940) was conceived as a vehicle for M-G-M's glamorous acquisition Hedy Lamarr, in the hopes they might duplicate the profits they reaped from M-G-M star Greta Garbo in Ninotchka (1939). \"Comrade\" X is played by Clark Gable, a cynical American journalist who exposes Stalin-era cultural falsifications in his dispatches to his newspaper in the United States. Lamarr plays a Moscow tram conductor. Her coldly logical persona ultimately proves susceptible to Gable's America-inspired enthusiasms. Released in December 1940, the scurrilous tone of the dialogue toward the USSR officials was consistent with US government posture in the aftermath of the Hitler\u2013Stalin Pact of August 1939. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 (after America's entry into WWII in December 1941), Russians became US allies in the war effort against the Axis powers. Reflecting these developments, M-G-M executives, just six months after the film's release, inserted a disclaimer assuring audiences that the movie was only a farce, not a hostile critique of the USSR. Writer Walter Reisch, who also scripted Ninotchka, earned an Oscar nomination for best original story.\nVidor disparaged the picture as \"an insignificant light comedy\" that afforded him \"a change of pace.\" Vidor's next picture would be a cold-eyed examination of the institution of marriage and a much more personal work: \"H.M. Pulham, Esq.\" (1941).\nH. M. Pulham, Esq.: With wife and screenwriting partner Elizabeth Hill, Vidor adapted John P. Marquand's highly popular novel of the same name. A story of a married man tempted to revive an affair with an old flame, Vidor draws upon memories of a failed romance from his own youth.\nHarry Pulham (Robert Young), a member of the New England's conservative upper-middle class, is stultified by the respectable routines of life and a proper marriage to his wife Kay (Ruth Hussey). Vidor examines Pulham's past in a series of flashbacks that reveal a youthful affair Harry had with an ambitious German immigrant, Marvin Myles (Hedy Lamarr) at a New York advertising agency. They prove incompatible, largely due to different class orientation and expectations: Marvin pursues her dynamic career in New York and Harry returns to the security of his Bostonian social establishment. In an act of desperate nostalgia, Pulham attempts to rekindle the relationship 20 years later, to no avail. His attempt at rebellion failed, Harry Pulham consciously submits to a life of conformity that falls short of freedom but offers self-respect and a modest contentment.\n\"H. M. Pulham, Esq\" was completed by Vidor after years of manufacturing \"conventional successes\" for M-G-M. The calm certitude of Harry Pulham in the face of enforced conformity may reflect Vidor's determination to artistically address larger issues in contemporary American society. His next, and final movie for M-G-M, would be the \"Steel\" component of his \"War, Wheat and Steel\" film trilogy: \"An American Romance\" (1944).\nAn American Romance: Rather than demonstrate his patriotism by joining a military film unit Vidor attempted to create a paean to American democracy. His 1944 An American Romance represents the \"steel\" installment of Vidor's \"War, Wheat and Steel\" trilogy and serves as his \"industrial epic\".and emerged from an extremely convoluted screenwriting evolution. Vidor personifies the relationship between man and the natural resources on which struggles to impose his purpose on nature.\nThe lead role of immigrant Stefan Dubechek was offered to Spencer Tracy but the actor declined, an acute disappointment for the director who had greatly admired Tracy's performance in his \"Northwest Passage\" (1940). Vidor's dissatisfaction with the studio's casting, including lead Brian Donlevy, led Vidor to concentrate on the industrial landscape to reveal the motivations of his characters.\nDespite producer Louis B. Mayer's personal enthusiasm for the picture, his studio deleted 30 minutes from the movie, mostly essential human interest sequences and only preserving the abundant documentary scenes. Disgusted by M-G-M's mutilations, Vidor terminated his 20-year association with the studio. The film received negative reviews and was a financial failure. Some critics noted a shift in Vidor's focus from working class struggles to celebrating the ascent of a \"Ford-like\" industrial magnate. Film historian Raymond Durgnat considers the picture \"his least personal, artistically weakest and most spiritually confused.\"\nThe failure of \"An American Romance\", after an artistic investment of three years, staggered Vidor and left him deeply demoralized. The break with M-G-M presented an opportunity to establish a more satisfying relationship with other studio producers. Emerging from this \"spiritual\" nadir he would create a Western of great intensity: \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946).\nA sound era magnum opus: \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946).\nAt the end of 1944 Vidor considered a number of projects, including a remake of his silent era Wild Oranges (1924), this time with producer David O. Selznick.\nWhen Selznick purchased the rights to Niven Busch's novel \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1944, Vidor agreed to rewrite Oliver H. P. Garrett's screenplay and direct a miniature Western, \"small\" but \"intense\". Selznick's increasingly grandiose plans for the production involved his wish to promote the career of actress-mistress Jennifer Jones and to create a movie rivaling his successful 1939 \"Gone with the Wind\". Selzick's personal and artistic ambitions for \"Duel in the Sun\" led to conflicts with Vidor over development of the themes which emphasized \"sex, violence and spectacle\". Vidor walked off the set just before primary filming was completed, unhappy with Selznick's intrusive management. The producer would enlist eight additional directors to complete the picture. Though the final cut was made without Vidor's participation, the production reflects the participation of these talented filmmakers, among them William Dieterle and Josef von Sternberg. Vidor was awarded sole screen credit after Directors Guild arbitration. \n\"Duel in the Sun\" is a melodramatic treatment of a Western theme concerning a conflict between two generations of the McCanles family. The elderly and crippled McCanles Lionel Barrymore presides with an iron fist over his a vast cattle estate with his invalid wife Laura Belle Candles Lillian Gish. Their two sons, Lewt and Jess, are polar opposites: the educated Jess \"the good son\" Joseph Cotten takes after his refined mother, while Lewt \"the bad son\" Gregory Peck emulates his domineering cattle baron father. The adoption of the young orphan girl Pearl Chavez, the \"half-breed\" offspring of a European gentleman and a native-American mother, whom Pearl's father has murdered and been executed for his crime, introduces a fatal element into the McCanles family. The \"film noir\" ending includes an attempted fratricide and a suicide-like love pact, destroying the McCanles family.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The iconic film director D. W. Griffith, famous for his silent classics \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919) and \"Way Down East\" (1920) both starring Lillian Gish, visited the \"Duel in the Sun\" set unannounced during filming. Abashed, Gish and co-star Barrymore became tongue-tied. Vidor was compelled to insist that Griffith withdraw, and the chastened Griffith complied graciously.\nThe \"unbridled sexuality\" portrayed by Vidor between Pearl and Lewt created a furor that drew criticism from the US Congressmen and film censors, which led to the studio cutting several minutes before its final release.\nSelznick launched \"Duel in the Sun\" in hundreds of theaters, backed by a multiple-million dollar promotional campaign. Despite the film's poor critical reception (termed \"Lust in the Dust\" by its detractors) the picture's box office returns rivaled the highest-grossing film of the year, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946).\nFilm archivist Charles Silver offered this appraisal of the Vidor-Selznick collaboration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"[W]hen Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones) rides out to kill Lewt (Gregory Peck), she is uncannily transformed into a phantasm of a young resolute Mrs. McCanles (Lillian Gish), thus killing the son she despises via the daughter she never had. This is perhaps the most outrageous conceit of an entirely outrageous movie, and it is brilliant. As Andrew Sarris has said: 'In cinema, as in all art, only those who risk the ridiculous have a real shot at the sublime.' In Duel in the Sun, an older, less hopeful, but still enterprising King Vidor came damn close to the bullseye.\"\n\"On Our Merry Way\" (\"A Miracle Can Happen\"), Universal Studios 1948.\nIn the aftermath of his critical failures in \"An American Romance\" (1944) and \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), Vidor disengaged from Hollywood film production to purchase his Willow Creek Ranch in Paso Robles, California.\n\"A Miracle Can Happen\" (1948) is a film sketch that Vidor participated in with co-director Leslie Fenton during this period of relative inactivity. A \"low-budget\" Universal Studios release of the early baby boom era, this \"omnibus\" presents vignettes filmed or performed by an array of actors and directors (some of them returning from service in the armed forces) among them Burgess Meredith, Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, James Stewart, John Huston and George Stevens. (An episode with British actor Charles Laughton was cut from the final release, a disappointment to Vidor.) The picture's title was changed shortly after opening to \"On Our Merry Way\" to promote its comedic virtues. Vidor dismissed the film from his oeuvre in later years.\nIn 1948 Vidor was diverted from making a series of 16mm Westerns for television and produced on his ranch when Warner Brothers studios approached him to direct an adaption of author Ayn Rand's controversial novel \"The Fountainhead\". Vidor immediately accepted the offer.\nWarner Brothers: 1949\u20131951.\nVidor's three films for Warner Brothers studios\u2014\"The Fountainhead\" (1949), \"Beyond the Forest\" (1949) and \"Lightning Strikes Twice\" (1951)\u2014were crafted to reconcile the excessive and amoral violence displayed in his \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946) with a constructive presentation of American individualism that comported with his Christian Science precepts of morality.\nThe Fountainhead (1949): Unhappy with the screen adaptation offered by Warner Brothers for Ayn Rand's 1938 novel \"The Fountainhead\", Vidor asked the author to write the script. Rand accepted but inserted a caveat into her contract requiring that she authorize any deviation from the book's story or dialogue. Vidor accepted the provision.\nRand's political philosophy of Objectivism is distilled through the character of architect Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), who adopts an uncompromising stance on the physical integrity of his proposed designs. When one of his architectural projects is compromised, he destroys the building with dynamite. At his trial, Roark offers a principled and forthright defense for his act of sabotage and is exonerated by the jury. Though Vidor was committed to developing his own populist notion of American individualism, Rand's didactic Objectivist scenario and script informs much of the film. The Roark character is loosely based on the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, both in the novel and Vidor's film version.\nVidor's most outstanding cinematic innovation in \"The Fountainhead\" is his highly stylized images of the Manhattan high-rise interiors and skylines. The urban landscapes, created by Art Director Edward Carrere were strongly influenced by German Expressionism and contribute to the film's compelling \"film noir\" character. The eroticism inherent in the sets resonate with the on-screen sexual tension, augmented by the off-screen affair between Cooper and Patricia Neal, who plays the architect's ally-adversary Dominique Francon.\n\"The Fountainhead\" enjoyed profitable box-office returns but a poor critical reception. Satisfied with his experience at Warner's, Vidor signed a two-film contract with the studio. In his second picture he would direct Warner's most prestigious star Bette Davis in Beyond the Forest (1949).\nBeyond the Forest (1949): A lurid \"noir\" melodrama that tracks the descent of a petty-bourgeois Madame Bovary-like character, Rosa Moline (Bette Davis) into marital infidelity, murder and a sordid death, the picture has earned a reputation as a \"Camp\" classic. The film is often cited for providing the phrase \"What a dump!\", appropriated by playwright Edward Albee in his 1962 \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and its 1966 \"screen\" adaptation.\nDespising the role assigned her by producer Jack Warner and feuding with director Vidor over her character's portrayal, Davis delivers a startling performance and one of the best of her mid-career. The role of Rosa Molina would be her last film with Warner Brothers after seventeen years with the studio.\nVidor's characterization of Davis as the unsophisticated Gorgon-like Rosa (the film was titled \"La Garce\", \"[The Bitch]\", in French releases) were widely rejected by her fans and contemporary film critics and reviews \"were the worst of Vidor's career.\" \nVidor and Max Steiner inserted a leitmotif into those sequences where Rosa obsessively longs for escape from the dull, rural Loyalton to the cosmopolitan and sophisticated Chicago. The \"Chicago\" theme surfaces (a tune made famous by Judy Garland) in an ironic style reminiscent of film composer Bernard Herrmann. Steiner earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Score.\nLightning Strikes Twice (1951): His final picture for Warner Brothers, Vidor attempted to create a \"film noir\" tale of a deadly love triangle starring Richard Todd, Ruth Roman and Mercedes McCambridge, a cast that did not suit Vidor. A standard Warner's melodrama, Vidor declared that the picture \"turned out terribly\" and is largely unrepresentative of his work except in its western setting and its examination of sexual strife, the theme of the film. Vidor's next project was proposed by producer Joseph Bernhard after pre-production and casting were nearly complete: \"Japanese War Bride\" (1952).\n\"Japanese War Bride\" (1952): Twentieth Century Fox.\nThe topic of the film, white racial prejudice in post-WWII America, had been addressed in a number of Hollywood films of the period, including directors Joseph Losey's \"The Lawless\" (1950) and Mark Robson's \"Home of the Brave\" (1949).\nThe story by co-producer Anson Bond concerns wounded Korean War veteran Jim Sterling (Don Taylor), who returns with his bride, Japanese nurse Tae (Shirley Yamaguchi), to his parents' farm in California's Central Valley. Conflicts arise when Jim's sister-in-law falsely accuses Tae of infidelity, sparking conflicts with the neighboring Nisei-owned farm. The picture locates acts of racism towards non-whites as personal neurosis rather than socially constructed prejudice. Vidor's artistic commitments to the film were minimal in a production that was funded as a B Movie, though he meticulously documents the experience of workers in field and factory.\nBefore beginning direction of \"Japanese War Bride\", Vidor had already arranged with Bernhard to finance his next project and perhaps \"the last great film\" of his career: \"Ruby Gentry\" (1952).\n\"Ruby Gentry\" (1952): Twentieth Century Fox.\nWith \"Ruby Gentry\", Vidor revisits the themes and scenario of \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946), in which an impoverished young woman, Jennifer Jones (Ruby n\u00e9e Corey, later Gentry), is taken in by a well-to-do couple. When the foster mother dies (Josephine Hutchinson) Ruby marries the widower (Karl Malden) for security, but he too dies under circumstances that cast suspicions on Ruby. She is harried by her evangelical preacher-sibling (James Anderson) and her love affair with the son of a local land-owing scion (Charlton Heston) leads to a deadly shootout, a climax that recalls Vidor's violent 1946 Western.\nVidor deferred his own salary to make the low-budget work, filming the \"North Carolina\" landscapes on his California ranch. American critics generally disparaged the movie.\nFilm historian Raymond Durgnat champions \"Ruby Gentry\" \"as a truly great American film...\"film noir\" imbued with new fervor\" that combines a radical social understanding with a Hollywood veneer and an intensely personal artistic statement. Vidor ranks \"Ruby Gentry\" among his most artistically gratifying works: \"I had complete freedom in shooting it, and Selznick, who could have had an influence on Jennifer Jones, didn't intervene. I think I succeeded in getting something out of Jennifer, something quite profound and subtle.\" The swamp sequence where Ruby and her lover Boake hunt one another is \"perhaps the best sequence [Vidor] ever filmed.\" \"Ruby Gentry\" showcases the essential elements of Vidor's oeuvre depicting the extremes of passion inherent in humanity and nature. Vidor commented on these elements as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"There's one scene I like a lot...because it corresponds to something vital. It's the scene where the girl [Jennifer Jones] has the barrage demolished. At the moment when the earth is flooded, the man [Charlton Heston] is destroyed. All his ambitions crumble. I think there is a fine symbol there\".\nAutobiography: \"A Tree is a Tree\".\nIn 1953, Vidor's autobiography entitled \"A Tree is a Tree\" was published and widely praised. Film critic Dan Callahan provides this excerpt the book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I believe that every one of us knows that his major job on earth is to make some contribution, no matter how small, to this inexorable movement of human progress. The march of man, as I see it, is not from the cradle to the grave. It is instead, from the animal or physical to the spiritual. The airplane, the atom bomb, radio, radar, television are all evidences of the urge to overcome the limitations of the physical in favor of the freedom of the spirit. Man, whether he is conscious of it or not, knows deep inside that he has a definite upward mission to perform during the time of his life span. He knows that the purpose of his life cannot be stated in terms of ultimate oblivion.\"\nLight's Diamond Jubilee, General Electric, 1954.\nAs part of the 75th Anniversary of Thomas Edison's invention of electric light, Vidor adapted two short stories for television produced by David O. Selznick. The production aired on all the major American TV networks on October 24, 1954.\nVidor's contributions included \"A Kiss for the Lieutenant\" by author Arthur Gordon starring Kim Novak, an amusing romantic vignette, as well as an adaption of novelist John Steinbeck's short story \"Leader of the People\" (1937) (from his novella \"The Red Pony\") in which a retired wagon-master, Walter Brennan, rebuffed by his son Harry Morgan, finds a sympathetic audience for his War Horse reminiscences about the Old West in his grandson Brandon deWilde. Screenwriter Ben Hecht wrote the scripts for both segments.\nIn 1954 Vidor, in collaboration with longtime associate and screenwriter Laurence Stallings, pursued a remake of the director's silent era \"The Turn in the Road\" (1919). Vidor's persistent efforts to revive this Christian Science-themed work spanning 15 years in the post-war period was never consummated, though a cast was proposed for an Allied Artists production in 1960. Setting aside this endeavor, Vidor opted to film a Western with Universal-International, \"Man Without a Star\" (1955).\n\"Man Without a Star\", 1955.\nBased on a story by Dee Linford of the same name and scripted by Borden Chase, \"Man Without a Star\" is an iconographic Western tale of remorseless struggle between a wealthy rancher Reed Bowman (Jeanne Crain) and small homesteaders. Saddle-tramp and gunman Dempsey Rae (Kirk Douglas) is drawn into the vortex of violence, that Vidor symbolizes with ubiquitous barbed-wire. The cowboy ultimately prevails against the hired gunslinger Steve Miles (Richard Boone) who had years ago murdered Rae's younger brother.\nKirk Douglas acted as both the star and uncredited producer in a collaborative effort with director Vidor. Neither was entirely satisfied with the result. Vidor failed to fully develop his thematic conception, the ideal of balancing personal freedoms with conservation of the land as a heritage.\nVidor and Douglas succeeded in creating Douglas's splendid character, Dempsey Rae, who emerges as a vital force, especially in the saloon-banjo sequence that screenwriter Borden Chase termed \"pure King Vidor\".\n\"Man Without a Star\", rated as \"a minor work\" by biographer John Baxter, marks a philosophical transition in Vidor's outlook towards Hollywood: the Dempsey Rae figure, though retaining his personal integrity, \"is a man without a star to follow; no ideal, no goal\" reflecting a declining enthusiasm by the director for American topics. Vidor's final two movies, the epics \"War and Peace\" (an adaptation of the novel by Russian author Leo Tolstoy), and \"Solomon and Sheba\", a story from the Old Testament, followed the director's realization that his self-conceived film proposals would not be welcomed by commercial movie enterprises. This pair of historical costume dramas were created outside Hollywood, both filmed and financed in Europe.\n\"War and Peace\" (1956).\nContrary to his aesthetic aversion to adapting historical spectaculars, in 1955 Vidor accepted independent Italian producer Dino De Laurentis's offer to create a screen adaption of Leo Tolstoy's vast historical romance of the late-Napoleonic era, \"War and Peace\" (1869). In the public domain, \"War and Peace\" was under consideration for adaption by several studios. Paramount Pictures and De Laurenti rushed the film into production before a proper script could be formulated from Tolstoy's complex and massive tale, requiring rewrites throughout the shooting. The final cut, at three hours, was necessarily a highly compressed version of the literary work.\nTolstoy's themes of individualism, the centrality of family and national allegiance and the virtues of agrarian egalitarianism were immensely appealing to Vidor. He commented on the pivotal character in the novel, Pierre Bezukhov (played by Henry Fonda): \"The strange thing about it is the character of Pierre is the same character I had been trying to put on the screen in many of my own films.\"\n Vidor was unsatisfied with the choice of Henry Fonda for the role of Pierre, and argued in favor of British actor Peter Ustinov. He was overruled by Dino de Laurentis, who insisted that the central figure in the epic appear as a conventional romantic leading man, rather than as the novel's \"overweight, bespectacled\" protagonist. \n Vidor sought to endow Pierre's character so as to reflect the central theme of Tolstoy's novel: an individual's troubled striving to rediscover essential moral truths. The superficiality of the script and Fonda's inability to convey the subtleties of Pierre's spiritual journey thwarted Vidor's efforts to actualize the film's theme. Recalling these interpretive disputes, Vidor remarked that \"though a damn good actor... [Fonda] just did not understand what I was trying to say.\"\nVidor was delighted with the vitality of Audrey Hepburn's performance as Natasha Rostova, in contrast to the miscasting of the male leads. His assessment of the centrality of Natasha is based in the process of her maturation: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Natasha permeated [War and Peace's] entire structure as the archetype of womankind which she so thoroughly represents. If I were forced to reduce the whole story of War and Peace to some basically simple statement, I would say that it is a story of the maturing of Natasha. She represents, to me, the anima of the story and she hovers over it all like immortality itself.\"\nCinematographer Jack Cardiff devised one of the film's most visually striking sequences, the sunrise duel between Pierre (Henry Fonda) and Kuragin (Tullio Carminati), shot entirely on a sound-stage. Vidor performed second-production duties to oversee the spectacular battle reenactments and director Mario Soldati (uncredited) shot a number of scenes with the principal cast.\nAmerican audiences showed modest enthusiasm at the box-office, but \"War and Peace\" was well received by film critics. The movie was met with huge popular approval in the USSR, a fact alarming to Soviet officials, coming as it did near the height of Cold War hostilities between America and Russia. The Soviet government responded in 1967 with its own heavily financed adaption of the novel, War and Peace (film series) (1967).\n\"War and Peace\" garnered Vidor further offers to film historical epics, among these \"King of Kings\" (1961), (directed by Nicholas Ray) as well as a project to develop a script about the life of 16th Century Spanish author Miguel Cervantes. Vidor finally settled on the Old Testament story of Solomon and Sheba, with Tyrone Power and Gina Lollobrigida tapped as the star-crossed monarchs. This would be Vidor's final Hollywood film of his career.\n\"Solomon and Sheba\" (1959).\n\"Solomon and Sheba\" is one of a cycle of bible-based epics popular favored by Hollywood during the 1950s. The film is best remembered as the Vidor's last commercial production of his long career in Hollywood.\nA tragic footnote is attached to this picture. Six weeks into production the leading man, 45-year-old star Tyrone Power, suffered a heart attack during a climactic sword fight scene. He died within the hour. Considered the \"ultimate nightmare\" for any major movie production, the entire film had to be re-shot, with the lead role of Solomon now recast with Yul Brynner.\nThe death of Tyrone Powers was less a financial disaster and more a creative loss. Vidor was bereft of an actor who had grasped the complex nature of the Solomon figure, adding depth to Powers' performance. Brynner and Vidor were instantly at loggerheads when the leading man substituted a portrayal of an \"anguished monarch\" for an Israelite king who would \"dominate each situation without conflict.\" Vidor reported, \"it was an attitude that affected the depth of his performance and probably the integrity of the film.\"\nLeading lady Gina Lollobrigida adopted Brynner's approach to her character development of her Queen of Sheba, adding another facet of discord with the director.\n\"Solomon and Sheba\" includes some impressive action sequences, including a widely cited battle finale in which Solomon's tiny army faces an approaching onslaught of mounted warriors. His troops turn their burnished shields to the sun, the reflected light blinding the enemy hordes and sending them careening into an abyss. Astonishing sequences such as these abound in Vidor's work, prompting film historian Andrew Sarris to observe \"Vidor was a director for anthologies [who] created more great moments and fewer great films than any director of his rank.\"\nDespite the setbacks that plagued the production and the ballooning costs associated with the reshoot, Solomon and Sheba \"more than earned back its costs.\"\nContrary to claims that \"Solomon and Sheba\" ended Vidor's career, he continued to receive offers to film major productions after its completion. The reasons for the director's disengagement from commercial film-making are related to his age (65) and to his desire to pursue smaller and more personal movie projects. Reflecting on independent productions, Vidor remarked, \"I'm glad I got out of it.\"\nPost-Hollywood projects, 1959\u20131981.\n\"Truth and Illusion: An Introduction to Metaphysics\" (1964).\nIn the mid-1960s Vidor crafted a 26-minute 16mm movie that sets forth his philosophy on the nature of individual perception. Narrated by the director, and quoting from theologian-philosophers Jonathan Edwards and Bishop Berkeley, the images serve to complement the abstract ideas he sets forth. The film is a discourse on subjective idealism, which maintains that the material world is an illusion, existing only in the human mind: humanity creates the world they experience.\nAs Vidor describes in Whitmanesque terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Nature gets the credit for what in truth should be reserved for ourselves: the rose for its scent, the nightingale for its song, the sun for its radiance. The poets are entirely mistaken; they should address their lyrics to themselves and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation.\"\n\"Truth and Illusion\" provides an insight into the significance of Vidor's themes in his work, and is consistent with his Christian Science precepts.\nMicheal Neary served as assistant director on the film, and Fred Y. Smith completed the editing. The movie was never released commercially.\n\"The Metaphor\": King Vidor meets with Andrew Wyeth (1980).\nVidor's documentary \"The Metaphor\" consists of a number of interviews between the director and painter Andrew Wyeth. Wyeth had contacted Vidor in the late 1970s expressing admiration for his work. The artist emphasized that much of his material had been inspired by the director's 1925 war-romance \"The Big Parade\".\nThe documentary records the discussions between Vidor and both Wyeth and his spouse Betsy. A montage is formed by inter-cutting images of Wyeth's paintings with short clips from Vidor's \"The Big Parade\". Vidor attempts to reveal an \"inner metaphor\" demonstrating the sources of artistic inspiration.\nConsidering the film only a work in progress at the time of his death, the documentary had its premiere at the American Film Institute in 1980. \nIt was never given a general release and is rarely screened.\nUnproduced film projects.\n\"Northwest Passage (Book 2)\": Vidor attempted to make a sequel to his film \"Northwest Passage\" in which Rogers' Rangers find the Northwest Passage, although filming never began because author Kenneth Roberts refused to cooperate with the project, and because MGM thought the cost in making the first film in Technicolor had proven prohibitive enough.\n\"Bright Light\" (late 1950s): a biographical study of Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy.\n\"Conquest\" (formerly The Milly Story): In 1960, Vidor resumed efforts to make a sound version of his 1919 \"The Turn in the Road\". His reconceived screenplay concerns a Hollywood director disillusioned with the film industry who inherits a gas station from his father in the fictional Colorado town of \"Arcadia\". The script's dialogue contains oblique references to a number of Vidor's silent films including (\"The Big Parade\" (1925) and \"The Crowd\" (1928)). \"Conquest\" introduces a mysterious young woman, \"a feminine archetype\" (a figure in Jungian philosophy) who serves as \"the answer to everyone's problems\" while pumping gas at the station. She disappears suddenly, leaving the director inspired, and he returns to Hollywood. Impressed by Italian director Federico Fellini's \"8 \u00bd\" (1963), Vidor briefly corresponded with Fellini while writing \"Conquest\". Vidor soon abandoned his 15-year effort to make the \"unfashionable\" movie, despite Sid Grauman \u2013 like Vidor an adherent to Christian Science \u2013 having purchased the rights. Even the modest budgetary requests were rejected by the tiny Allied Artists and they dropped the project.\n\"The Marble Faun\": a \"quite faithful\" version of the 1860 story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\"The Crowd\": Vidor developed revisions of his 1928 silent masterpiece, including a 1960s sequel of Ann Head's 1967 novel \"Mr and Mrs Bo Jo Jones\" (made as a TV feature without his input), and in the early 1970s another effort, \"Brother Jon\".\n\"A Man Called Cervantes\": Vidor was involved in script writing for an adaption of Bruno Frank's novel, but withdrew from the project, unhappy with script changes. The movie was shot and released in 1967 as \"Cervantes\", but Vidor withdrew his name from the production.\n\"William Desmond Taylor\": Vidor researched the murder of silent era actor-director William Desmond Taylor, killed under mysterious circumstances in 1922. Though no screenplay was forthcoming, author Sidney D. Kirkpatrick alleges in his novel, \"A Cast of Killers\" (1986), that Vidor solved the murder.\n\"The Actor\": In 1979, Vidor sought financing for a biography of the ill-fated James Murray, star of Vidor's \"The Crowd\" (1928).\nAcademic Presentations.\nVidor lectured occasionally on film production and directing in the late 1950s and the 1960s at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. He published a non-technical handbook providing anecdotes from his film career, \"On Film Making\", in 1972.\nOn at least one occasion, Vidor made a presentation to film historian Arthur Knight's class at USC.\nVidor as actor: \"Love and Money\" (1982).\nVidor served as an 'extra\" or made cameo appearances during his film career. An early film still exists from an unidentified Hotex Motion Picture Company silent short made in 1914, when he was 19 years old (he wears a Keystone Cop costume and false beard). While attempting to break into Hollywood as a director and screenwriter, Vidor took \"bit parts\" for Vitagraph Studios and Inceville in 1915\u20131916. During the height of his fame he made a number of cameo appearances in his own films, including \"The Patsy\" in 1926, \"Show People\" in 1928, and \"Our Daily Bread\" in 1934. \nHe did not appear as a featured actor until 1981, at the age of 85. Vidor provided a \"charming\" tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Walter Klein, a senile grandfather, in director James Toback's \"Love and Money\". Vidor's motivation in accepting the role was a desire to observe contemporary movie-making technology. \"Love and Money\" was released in 1982, shortly before Vidor's death.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1944 Vidor, a Republican, joined the anti-communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.\nVidor published his autobiography, \"A Tree is a Tree\", in 1953. This book's title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor's Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film's production budget. A budget-minded producer told him, \"A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in Griffith Park\" (a nearby public space which was frequently used for filming exterior shots).\nKing Vidor was a Christian Scientist and wrote occasionally for church publications.\nMarriages.\nVidor was married three times and had three daughters:\nDeath.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"King Vidor died of a heart attack on November 1, 1982. The previous weekend he and his longtime friend [and former lover in their early careers] Colleen Moore had driven up to San Simeon, William Randolph Hearst's \"Castle\", to watch home movies made when they had been Hearst's guests there, sixty years before.\"\nVidor died at age 88 of a heart attack at his ranch in Paso Robles, California, on November 1, 1982.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAcademy Awards and nominations.\nOther awards.\nIn 1964, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

It is the last living species in the order Ginkgoales, which first appeared over 290 million years ago. Fossils similar to the living species, belonging to the genus \"Ginkgo\", extend back to the Middle Jurassic epoch approximately 170 million years ago. The tree was cultivated early in human history, remains commonly planted, and is widely regarded as a living fossil.\n\"G. biloba\" is a long-lived, disease-resistant, dioecious tree with unique fan-shaped leaves, capable of clonal reproduction, and known for its striking yellow autumn foliage and resilience in disturbed environments. It was known historically as \"silver fruit\" or \"white fruit\" in Chinese and called \"ginkgo\" due to a centuries-old transcription error. It is closely related to cycads and characterized by unique seeds that resemble apricots but are not true fruits. \n\"G. biloba\", once widespread but thought extinct in the wild for centuries, is now commonly cultivated in East Asia, with some genetically diverse populations possibly representing rare wild survivors in southwestern China's mountainous regions. Some \"G. biloba\" trees have survived extreme events like the Hiroshima atomic bomb and others showcasing extreme longevity; \"G. biloba\" specimens have been measured in excess of 1,600 years, and the largest living trees are estimated to exceed 3,500 years. Today it is widely planted in cities worldwide for its pollution tolerance and ornamental value.\n\"G. biloba\" can pose health risks including potential carcinogenicity, allergic reactions, poisoning from seeds due to ginkgotoxin, drug interactions, and adverse effects such as bleeding and neurological symptoms, especially with excessive or improper use. \"G. biloba\" wood is valued for its durability and used in crafts and sake-making, while its seeds are popular in Asian cuisine despite health risks. While widely marketed for cognitive benefits, clinical research shows limited medical effectiveness except possibly for dementia, with approval in the European Union but not by the United States Food and Drug Administration.\nDescription.\nGinkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of , with some specimens in China being over 40 meters (131 feet). The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep-rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood, and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos durable, with some specimens estimated to be more than 3,500\u00a0years old.\nLeaves.\nThe leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network. Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as dichotomous venation. The leaves are usually , but sometimes up to long. The old common name, \"maidenhair tree\", derives from the leaves resembling pinnae of the maidenhair fern, \"Adiantum capillus-veneris\". Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep saffron yellow.\nThe species is heterophyllous (two types of leaves); those on the long shoots are thicker, have higher rates of photosynthesis, higher vein density and leaf hydraulic conductance, while those on the short shoots are better at handling drought. Leaves of long shoots are also usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between the veins. They are borne both on the more rapidly growing branch tips, where they are alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered at the tips. Leaves are green both on the top and bottom and have stomata on both sides. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow and then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to fifteen\u00a0days). Leaves of the cultivar 'Tubifolia' have funnel-shaped leaves.\nBranches.\nGinkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees. From the axils of these leaves, \"spur shoots\" (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth. Short shoots have short internodes (they may grow only one to two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.\nGinkgo prefers full sun and grows best in environments that are well-watered and well-drained. The species shows a preference for disturbed sites; in the \"semiwild\" stands at Tianmu Mountains, many specimens are found along stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges. Accordingly, ginkgo retains a prodigious capacity for vegetative growth. It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of the trunk (lignotubers, or basal chichi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion. Old specimens are also capable of producing aerial roots on the undersides of large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil. These strategies are evidently important in the persistence of ginkgo; in a survey of the \"semiwild\" stands remaining in Tianmushan, 40% of the specimens surveyed were multi-stemmed, and few saplings were present.\nReproduction.\n\"Ginkgo biloba\" is dioecious, with separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis. Sex conversion, wherein certain branches of a tree change sexes, has been observed. This phenomenon is difficult to research because of its rarity, as well as the practice of grafting female branches onto otherwise male trees that was common in 19th century Europe.\nFemale plants do not produce cones. Two ovules are formed at the end of a stalk, and after wind pollination, one or both develop into fruit-like structures containing seeds. The fruits are 1.5\u20132\u00a0cm long, with a soft, fleshy, yellow-brown outer layer (the sarcotesta) that is attractive in appearance, but contains butyric acid (also known as butanoic acid) and smells foul like rancid butter or vomit when fallen. Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the \"shell\" of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the nucellus surrounding the female gametophyte at the center.\nThe fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses, and algae. The sperm are large (about 70\u201390\u00a0micrometres) and are similar to the sperm of cycads, which are slightly larger. \"Ginkgo\" sperm were first discovered by the Japanese botanist Sakugoro Hirase in 1896. The sperm have a complex multi-layered structure, which is a continuous belt of basal bodies that form the base of several thousand flagella which have a cilia-like motion. The flagella/cilia apparatus pulls the body of the sperm forwards. The sperm have only a tiny distance to travel to the archegonia, of which there are usually two or three. Two sperm are produced, one of which successfully fertilizes the ovule. Fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs just before or after they fall in early autumn. Embryos may develop in the seeds before or after they drop from the tree.\nGenome.\nChinese scientists published a draft genome of \"Ginkgo biloba\" in 2016. The tree has a large genome of 10.6\u00a0billion DNA nucleobase \"letters\" (the human genome has three billion) and about 41,840\u00a0predicted genes which enable a considerable number of antibacterial and chemical defense mechanisms. 76.58% of the assembled sequence turned out to be repetitive sequences.\nIn 2020, a study in China of ginkgo trees up to 667 years old showed little effects of aging, finding that the trees continued to grow with age and displayed no genetic evidence of senescence, and continued to make phytochemicals indefinitely.\nPhytochemicals.\nExtracts of ginkgo leaves contain phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, alkylphenols, and polyprenols.\nTaxonomy.\nCarl Linnaeus described the species in 1771, the specific epithet \"biloba\" derived from the Latin \"bis\", \"twice\" and \"loba\", \"lobed\", referring to the shape of the leaves. Two names for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury, a placement by Nelson as \"Pterophyllus salisburiensis\" and the earlier \"Salisburia adiantifolia\" proposed by James Edward Smith. The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic resembling \"Adiantum\", the genus of maidenhair ferns.\nThe scientific name \"Ginkgo\" is the result of a spelling error that occurred three centuries ago. \"Kanji\" typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters \u9280\u674f used for \"ginnan\" can also be pronounced \"ginky\u014d\". Engelbert Kaempfer, the first Westerner to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in the notes that he later used for the \"Amoenitates Exoticae\" (1712) with the \"awkward\" spelling \"ginkgo\". This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer; taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable \"ky\u014d\" into account, a more precise romanization following his writing habits would have been \"ginkio\" or \"ginkjo\". Linnaeus, who relied on Kaempfer when dealing with Japanese plants, adopted the spelling given in Kaempfer's \"Flora Japonica\" (\"Amoenitates Exoticae\", p.\u00a0811). Kaempfer's drawing can be found in Hori's article.\nClassification.\nThe relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta). The sarcotesta has a strong smell that most people find unpleasant.\nThe ginkgo is classified in its own division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus \"Ginkgo\" and is the only extant species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales other than \"G. biloba\" are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene.\nPhylogeny.\n\"Ginkgo biloba\" is a living fossil, with fossils recognisably related to modern ginkgo from the early Permian (Cisuralian), with likely oldest record being that of \"Trichopitys\" from the earliest Permian (Asselian) of France, over 290 million years old. The closest living relatives of the clade are the cycads, which share with the extant \"G. biloba\" the characteristic of motile sperm.\nSuch plants with leaves that have more than four veins per segment have customarily been assigned to the taxon \"Ginkgo\", while the taxon \"Baiera\" is used to classify those with fewer than four veins per segment. \"Sphenobaiera\" has been used for plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf stem.\nRise and decline.\nFossils attributable to the genus \"Ginkgo\" first appeared in the Middle Jurassic. The genus \"Ginkgo\" diversified and spread throughout Laurasia during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.\nThe Ginkgophyta declined in diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the Paleocene, \"Ginkgo adiantoides\" was the only \"Ginkgo\" species left in the Northern Hemisphere, while a markedly different (and poorly documented) form persisted in the Southern Hemisphere. Along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids, the species diversity in the genus \"Ginkgo\" drops through the Cretaceous, at the same time the flowering plants were on the rise; this supports the hypothesis that, over time, flowering plants with better adaptations to disturbance displaced \"Ginkgo\" and its associates.\nAt the end of the Pliocene, \"Ginkgo\" fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of central China, where the modern species survived.\nLimited number of species.\nIt is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of \"Ginkgo\" can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day \"G.\u00a0biloba\" (including \"G.\u00a0adiantoides\") and \"G.\u00a0gardneri\" from the Paleocene of Scotland.\nAt least morphologically, \"G. gardneri\" and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been ecotypes or subspecies. The implications would be that \"G. biloba\" had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation.\nWhile it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).\nAdaptation to a single environment.\nGiven the slow rate of evolution of the genus, \"Ginkgo\" possibly represents a pre-angiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments. \"Ginkgo\" evolved in an era before flowering plants, when ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming low, open, shrubby canopies. \"Ginkgo\"'s large seeds and habit of \"bolting\" \u2013 growing to a height of 10\u00a0meters before elongating its side branches \u2013 may be adaptations to such an environment.\nModern-day \"G. biloba\" grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained, and the extremely similar fossil \"Ginkgo\" favored similar environments: The sediment record at the majority of fossil \"Ginkgo\" localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed environments, such as along streams. \"Ginkgo\", therefore, presents an \"ecological paradox\" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity).\nEtymology.\nThe older Chinese name for this plant is \u9280\u679c, meaning \"silver fruit\", pronounced \"y\u00edngu\u01d2\" in Mandarin or \"Ngan-gwo\" in Cantonese. The current commonly used names are \u767d\u679c (), meaning 'white fruit', and (), meaning 'silver apricot'. The name \u9280\u674f was translated into Japanese as \u30a4\u30c1\u30e7\u30a6 () or \u304e\u3093\u306a\u3093 () and into Korean as \uc740\ud589 (). \u9280\u674f had been particular terminology used during the Song dynasty for tributary reasons in place of the then contemporary \u9d28\u811a (\"duckfeet\", from its leaves) in northeast China where it commonly grew.\nThe genus name is regarded as a misspelling of the Japanese pronunciation () reading the aforementioned kanji found in Chinese herbology literature such as (Daily Use Materia Medica) (1329) and \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" published in 1578.\nDespite its spelling, which is due to a complicated etymology including a transcription error, \"ginkgo\" is usually pronounced , which has given rise to the common alternative spelling \"gingko\". The spelling pronunciation is also documented in some dictionaries.\nEngelbert Kaempfer first introduced the spelling \"ginkgo\" in his book of 1712. It is considered that he may have misspelled \"Ginkjo\" or \"Ginkio\" (both consistent with his treatment of Japanese in the same work) as \"Ginkgo\". This misspelling was included by Linnaeus in his book and has become the name of the tree's genus. The specific epithet is New Latin for \"two-lobed\".\nDistribution and habitat.\nAlthough \"Ginkgo biloba\" and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the world, its habitat had shrunk by two\u00a0million years ago.\nFor centuries, it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now a common tree cultivated throughout eastern China, Korea, and Japan. Many municipalities in China, Korea and Japan use ginkgos as street trees, and ginkgo leaves are the emblem of prominent educational institutions such as the University of Tokyo and Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. Despite their widespread habitat, high genetic uniformity exists among ginkgo trees, with some Chinese scholars suggesting that ginkgo trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over about 1,000\u00a0years. A study demonstrates a greater genetic diversity in Southwestern China populations, supporting glacial refugia in mountains surrounding the eastern Tibetan Plateau, where several old-growth candidates for wild populations have been reported. Whether native ginkgo populations still exist has not been demonstrated unequivocally, but there is genetic evidence that these Southwestern populations may be wild, as well as evidence that the largest and oldest \"G. biloba\" trees may be older than surrounding human settlements.\nWhere it occurs in the wild, Ginkgo is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic loess (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5. While cultivated specimens can survive in a variety of environments (such as a subtropical climate), the wild ginkgo is native to areas with a mostly temperate climate.\nCultivation.\nGinkgo has long been cultivated in China. It is common in the southern third of the country. Some planted trees at temples are believed to be over 1,500\u00a0years old. The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in Japanese temple gardens, where the tree was seen by the German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer. Because of its status in Buddhism and Confucianism, the ginkgo has also been widely planted in Korea and in Japan since the 14th century; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with ginkgos seeding into natural forests. Ginkgo has been commonly cultivated in North America for over 200\u00a0years and in Europe for close to 300, but during that time, it has never become significantly naturalized.\n\"G. biloba\" is also commonly manually planted in cities across the United States and Europe. This species is highly tolerant to pollution and serves as a visually appealing, shade-providing tree in many cities and gardens.\nMany intentionally planted ginkgos are male cultivars grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The popular cultivar 'Autumn Gold' is a clone of a male plant.\nThe disadvantage of male \"Ginkgo biloba\" trees is that their pollen is highly allergenic. They have an OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale) rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2.\nFemale cultivars include 'Liberty Splendor', 'Santa Cruz', and 'Golden Girl', the latter so named because of the striking yellow color of its leaves in the fall; all female cultivars release zero pollen.\nMany cultivars are listed in the literature in the UK, of which the compact 'Troll' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nGinkgos adapt well to the urban environment, tolerating pollution and confined soil spaces. They rarely have disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few insects.\nGinkgos are popular subjects for growing as miniature landscapes known as \"penjing\" and \"bonsai\"; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. The trees are easy to propagate from seed.\nHiroshima.\nExtreme examples of the ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima, Japan, where six trees growing between from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living organisms in the area to survive the blast. Although almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were killed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon healthy again, among other \"hibakujumoku\" (trees that survived the blast).\nThe six trees are still alive. They are marked with signs at temple (planted in 1850), Shukkei-en (planted about 1740), J\u014dsei-ji (planted 1900), at the former site of Senda Elementary School near Miyukibashi, at the My\u014dj\u014din temple, and an Edo period-cutting at Anraku-ji temple.\n1000-year-old ginkgo at Tsurugaoka Hachimang\u016b.\nAt the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b's shrine in the city of Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, an ancient ginkgo tree stands beside the stone entry staircase. According to legend, the tree has stood there since the founding of the shrine circa 1063. The tree is nicknamed \"kakure-ich\u014d\" (hiding ginkgo), because of an Edo period legend in which sh\u014dgun Minamoto no Sanetomo was assassinated in 1219 by his nephew, Kugy\u014d, who had hidden behind the tree to ambush the sh\u014dgun.\nModern scholarship has established that ginkgos arrived from China in the 14th century, and a 1990 tree-ring measurement indicated the \"kakure-ich\u014d's\" age to be about 500 years.\nOn 10 March 2010, the tree blew down in a storm, but the stump has since sprouted vigorously.\n1,400-year-old ginkgo tree at Gu Guanyin.\nThe grounds of the Buddhist temple at Gu Guanyin in the Zhongnan Mountains feature a ginkgo tree reputed to be 1,400 years old. The tree itself is a popular tourist attraction.\nToxicity.\nSince 2016, \"G. biloba\" extract is classified as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nWhen eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the seeds may cause poisoning by ginkgotoxin (4'-O-methylpyridoxine, MPN), as found in a few case reports. A heat-stable compound not destroyed by cooking, MPN may cause convulsions, which were alleviated by treatment with pyridoxine phosphate (vitamin B6), according to limited studies.\nSome people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating. These people should handle the seeds with care, wearing disposable gloves, when preparing them for consumption. The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis, or blisters similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy.\nSide effects of using ginkgo supplements may include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness. Although use of standardized \"Ginkgo biloba\" leaf extracts in moderate amounts appears to be safe, excessive use may have undesirable effects, especially in terms of drug interactions. The dosing of anticoagulants, such as warfarin or antiplatelet medication, may be adversely affected by using ginkgo supplements.\nAccording to a systemic review, the effects of ginkgo on pregnant women may include increased bleeding time, and there is inadequate information about safety during lactation.\nGinkgo pollen may produce allergic reactions. \"Ginkgo biloba\" leaves and sarcotesta contain ginkgolic acids \u2013 which are highly allergenic \u2013 long-chain alkylphenols, such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other \"Toxicodendron\" spp.) Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience an allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations. The level of these allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from \"Ginkgo biloba\" was restricted to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority. Overconsumption of seeds from \"Ginkgo biloba\" can deplete vitamin B6.\nUses.\nThe wood of \"Ginkgo biloba\" is used to make furniture, chessboards, carving, and casks for making sak\u00e9; the wood is fire-resistant and slow to decay.\nCulinary.\nDespite the health risks in certain cases, the nut-like kernels of the seeds are esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional ingredient in Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in \"congee\", and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha's delight). Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called \"ginnan\") to dishes such as \"chawanmushi\", and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes. Grilled ginkgo nuts with salt are also a popular item at izakayas as a snack with beer and other Japanese food. In Korea, ginkgo nuts are stir-fried and eaten, or are used to garnish foods such as sinseonro.\nResearch and safety.\nAlthough extracts of \"G. biloba\" leaf are often marketed as cognitive enhancers, there is no evidence for effects on memory or attention in healthy people. Systematic reviews have shown there is no evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo extract in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, or altitude sickness.\n\"G. biloba\" and its extracts are not approved as a drug in the United States and do not have sufficient clinical evidence for uses as a therapy, according to a 2023 review. The United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health concludes that despite extensive research, ginkgo has not been conclusively proved as effective for any health condition, including dementia, cognitive decline, or other disorders for which it is commonly marketed.\nA 2021 umbrella review concluded that \"G. biloba\" may be useful and safe for improving cognitive function and daily living activities in people with Alzheimer's disease. A 2018 review concluded that 22- to 24-week treatment with a \"G. biloba\" extract improved behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and reduced caregiver distress compared to placebo. A 2017 overview of systematic reviews concluded that \"G. biloba\" extract may modestly improve cognitive function and daily living in dementia when taken at doses over 200\u202fmg per day for at least 22 weeks. A 2016 systematic review concluded that \"G. biloba\" extract reduced tardive dyskinesia symptoms in people with schizophrenia and is generally safe.\nIn 2014, the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency concluded that powdered ginkgo leaf extract is effective and safe for improving cognitive function and quality of life in people with mild dementia, and licensed it as a medicine in member states of the EU.\nFDA warning letters.\nOver the period 2021-2023, the US FDA issued warning letters to manufacturers of ginkgo dietary supplements for false advertising about health claims and misbranding of their products as non-approved drugs.\nTraditional medicine.\nGinkgo has been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least the 11th century CE. Ginkgo seeds, leaves, and nuts have traditionally been used to treat various ailments, such as dementia, asthma, bronchitis, and kidney and bladder disorders. However, there is no conclusive evidence that ginkgo is useful for any of these conditions.\nIn culture.\nThe ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony. The tree is the official tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, and the symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf. Since 1948, the badge of Tokyo University has been two ginkgo leaves (designed by Shoichi Hoshino), which became the university logo in 2004 with a redesign. The logo of Osaka University has been a simplified ginkgo leaf since 1991 when designer Ikko Tanaka created it for the university's sixtieth anniversary.\nIn professional sumo, wrestlers ranked in the two highest divisions ( and ) wear an elaborate topknot called because it resembles the leaf of the ginkgo tree.\nGinkgo is an official tree of Seoul since 1971, designated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The order has a long fossil record extending back to the Early Permian around 300 million years ago from fossils found worldwide. The order was a common component of Permian and Triassic flora before the super dominance of conifers. \nEvolution.\nGinkgophyta and Cycadophyta have a very ancient divergence dating to the early Carboniferous. The earliest representative of the group in the fossil record is probably \"Trichopitys\" from the Asselian (299-293 million years ago) of France. The earliest representatives of \"Ginkgo\", represented by reproductive organs similar to the living species, first appear in the Middle Jurassic, alongside other, related forms such as \"Yimaia\" and \"Karkenia\", which have differently arranged reproductive structures and seeds associated with \"Ginkgo\"-like leaves. The diversity of Ginkgoales declined during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, coincident with the rise of flowering plants, with all Ginkgophytes aside from \"Ginkgo\" being extinct by the end of the Cretaceous. The only remaining Ginkgophyte was \"Ginkgo adiantoides\" \u2013 a polymorphic species. Modern \"Ginkgo\" trees are native to China.\nReproduction.\n\"Ginkgo\" trees produce ovulate and pollen-bearing structures. These structures are dioecious, in that male and female structures come from different \"Ginkgo\" plants. The pollen organs are very similar to angiospermous catkins. They come from the axils of the bud scales, and the leaves from the \"Ginkgo\" tree spur shoots. Pollen is contained in sacs of two to four at the tips of sporophylls on the strobiloid. Ovules of \"Ginkgo\" trees come from stalks from leaf axils on the short shoots, each containing two ovules. The ovule is fertilized by the flagellated male gametes, which can move about freely. This fertilization process begins on the tree itself in the spring. The swollen fruit-like ovules, about 2\u20133\u00a0cm in diameter, fall from the tree in the fall, and fertilization continues into the winter/spring. This ovule contains a single large seed, similar to that of a cycad.\nMorphology.\nGinkgophyte wood.\nFossils that appear \"Ginkgo\"-like are filed under a morphogenus called \"Ginkgoxylon, Ginkgomyeloxylon,\" or \"Protoginkgoxylon\". Fossilized ginkgophyte wood is not commonly found in the record, possibly because it degrades easily, and possibly because it is difficult to tell apart from the much more pervasive conifer samples. Like conifer wood, it has secondary thin-walled xylem and a primary vascular system composed of eustele and bifacial vascular cambium. The tracheids in the secondary xylem rays have pitting that occurs only on the walls and is circularly bordered.\nGinkgophyte foliage.\n\"Ginkgophyte\" foliage has stayed largely consistent since the Mesozoic. Its historically wide territory makes it an important leaf morphology, and its unique stomata and isotopic profile give it a key role in recreations of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Leaf fossils that resemble the Ginkgophytes are known as \"Ginkgoites\". There are similar, now extinct, morphogens, such as \"Sphenobaiera\", which describes fan-shaped, deeply divided leaves without clear petioles.\nThe distinctive shape of the modern \"Ginkgo biloba\" gives the impression of a very narrow leaf morphology, but the group is varied and diverse. The genus \"Ginkgo\" by itself contains a range of morphologies. \"Ginkgo digitata\", from the Jurassic, has long, wedge-shaped laminae with the intercostal regions covered in stomata and resin bodies, while \"G. pluripartita\" has at most 2\u00a0cm-long leaves and is intercostally hypostomatic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Because leaves can take such diverse forms within a single species, these are a poor measure of diversity, although differing structures of wood point to the existence of diverse ginkgo forests in ancient times.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are sometimes placed in a division Lycopodiophyta or Lycophyta or in a subdivision Lycopodiophytina. They are one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants; the group contains extinct plants that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). Lycophytes were some of the dominating plant species of the Carboniferous period, and included the tree-like Lepidodendrales, some of which grew over in height, although extant lycophytes are relatively small plants.\nThe scientific names and the informal English names used for this group of plants are ambiguous. For example, \"Lycopodiophyta\" and the shorter \"Lycophyta\" as well as the informal \"lycophyte\" may be used to include the extinct zosterophylls or to exclude them.\nDescription.\nLycophytes reproduce by spores and have alternation of generations in which (like other vascular plants) the sporophyte generation is dominant. Some lycophytes are homosporous while others are heterosporous. When broadly circumscribed, the lycophytes represent a line of evolution distinct from that leading to all other vascular plants, the euphyllophytes, such as ferns, gymnosperms and flowering plants. They are defined by two synapomorphies: lateral rather than terminal sporangia (often kidney-shaped or reniform), and exarch protosteles, in which the protoxylem is outside the metaxylem rather than vice versa. The extinct zosterophylls have at most only flap-like extensions of the stem (\"enations\") rather than leaves, whereas extant lycophyte species have microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein), rather than the much more complex megaphylls of other vascular plants. The extinct genus \"Asteroxylon\" represents a transition between these two groups: it has a vascular trace leaving the central protostele, but this extends only to the base of the enation. See .\nZosterophylls and extant lycophytes are all relatively small plants, but some extinct species, such as the Lepidodendrales, were tree-like, and formed extensive forests that dominated the landscape and contributed to the formation of coal.\nTaxonomy.\nClassification.\nIn the broadest circumscription of the lycophytes, the group includes the extinct zosterophylls as well as the extant (living) lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives. The names and ranks used for this group vary considerably. Some sources use the names \"Lycopodiophyta\" or the shorter \"Lycophyta\" to include zosterophylls as well as extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives, while others use these names to exclude zosterophylls. The name \"Lycopodiophytina\" has also been used in the inclusive sense. English names, such as \"lycophyte\", \"lycopodiophyte\" or \"lycopod\", are similarly ambiguous, and may refer to the broadly defined group or only to the extant lycophytes and their closest extinct relatives.\nThe consensus classification produced by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification in 2016 (PPG\u00a0I) places all extant (living) lycophytes in the class Lycopodiopsida. There are around 1,290 to 1,340 such species. For more information on the classification of extant lycophytes, see .\nPhylogeny.\nA major cladistic study of land plants was published in 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. In 2004, Crane et al. published some simplified cladograms, based on a number of figures in Kenrick and Crane (1997). Their cladogram for the lycophytes is reproduced below (with some branches collapsed into 'basal groups' to reduce the size of the diagram).\nIn this view, the \"zosterophylls\" comprise a paraphyletic group, ranging from forms like \"Hicklingia\", which had bare stems, to forms like \"Sawdonia\" and \"Nothia\", whose stems are covered with unvascularized spines or enations. The genus \"Renalia\" illustrates the problems in classifying early land plants. It has characteristics both of the non-lycophyte rhyniophytes \u2013 terminal rather than lateral sporangia \u2013 and of the zosterophylls \u2013 kidney-shaped sporangia opening along the distal margin.\nA rather different view is presented in a 2013 analysis by Hao and Xue. Their preferred cladogram shows the zosterophylls and associated genera basal to both the lycopodiopsids and the euphyllophytes, so that there is no clade corresponding to the broadly defined group of lycophytes used by other authors.\nSome extinct orders of lycophytes fall into the same group as the extant orders. Different sources use varying numbers and names of the extinct orders. The following phylogram shows a likely relationship between some of the proposed Lycopodiopsida orders.\nEvolution of microphylls.\nWithin the broadly defined lycophyte group, species placed in the class Lycopodiopsida are distinguished from species placed in the Zosterophyllopsida by the possession of microphylls. Some zosterophylls, such as the Devonian \"Zosterophyllum myretonianum\", had smooth stems (axes). Others, such as \"Sawdonia ornata\", had flap-like extensions on the stems (\"enations\"), but without any vascular tissue. \"Asteroxylon\", identified as an early lycopodiopsid, had vascular traces that extended to the base of the enations. Species in the genus \"Leclercqia\" had fully vascularized microphylls. These are considered to be stages in the evolution of microphylls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67972", "revid": "38455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67972", "title": "Urolagnia", "text": "Paraphilia associated with urine or urination\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;Urolagnia, also known as urophilia, is a paraphilia in which sexual excitement is associated with urine or urination. Etymologically, the term comes from the Greek , meaning 'urine', and , meaning 'lust'. A golden shower is slang for the practice of urinating on another person for sexual pleasure, while the term watersports is more inclusive of other sexual acts involving urine.\nSexual acts may involve urine being ingested or bathed in, urinating on another person or item (such as bedwetting), and self-soiling. Other expressions of urolagnia may primarily involve the smell of urine.\nOmorashi, a fetish for having a full bladder or someone else experiencing the discomfort or pain of a full bladder, is sometimes considered part of urolagnia.\nFrequency.\nA 2007 study counted members of Internet discussion groups with the word fetish in their name; of the groups about body parts or features, 9% belonged to groups about body fluids (including but not limited to urolagnia).\nJennifer Eve Rehor of San Francisco State University points out that such data as exists on what she calls \"unconventional\" or \"kink\" sexual behavior is generally problematic because of the way that it has been collected, through criminal and clinical case studies. Behavior that appears neither in criminal trials nor in clinical studies (for example, because the individuals concerned do not commonly seek professional help) is therefore under-reported. Rehor therefore surveyed 1,764 female participants in \"kink\" behavior (mostly association with BDSM) in 2010\u201311, receiving 1,580 valid responses. What Rehor calls \"urine play\" is relatively infrequent, with only 36.52% of her sample reporting having done it or having had it done to them. In contrast, 93.99% of her sample reported having done spanking or having had it done to them, and 61.96% reported having used or been exposed to feathers/fur. It is impossible to extrapolate Rehor's data onto the general population, as the habits of the general population are different than participants in \u201ckink\", but her study does give a guide to prevalence in the North American BDSM community.\nIn Channel 4's 2017 nationwide Great British Sex Survey, watersports (meaning urolagnia) was ranked ninth in popularity among sexual fetishes in the United Kingdom.\nIn psychiatry.\nThe DSM-III-R (1987) version of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM) renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), and provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which included urolagnia. Other specified paraphilic disorder is the term currently used by the fifth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5) to refer to any of the many other paraphilic disorders that are not explicitly named in the manual, including urolagnia. In order to be diagnosable, the interest must be recurrent and intense, present for at least six months, and cause marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. When a specific paraphilic disorder cannot be identified or the clinician chooses not to specify it for some other reason, the \"unspecified paraphilic disorder\" diagnosis may be used instead.\nParaphilias such as urolagnia have been described as fetishes. On 18 June 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) published ICD-11, in which Fetishism is now removed as a psychiatric diagnosis. Moreover, discrimination against fetish-having (and BDSM) individuals is considered inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the United Nations and The World Health Organization.\nPhysical health.\nThe World Health Organization has found that the pathogens contained in urine rarely pose a health risk. However, it does caution that in areas where \"Schistosoma haematobium\", a parasitic flatworm, is prevalent, it can be transmitted from person to person.\nIn media.\nA table in Larry Townsend's \"The Leatherman's Handbook II\" (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) which is generally considered authoritative states that a yellow handkerchief is a symbol for urolagnia in the handkerchief code, which is employed usually among gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Wearing the handkerchief on the left indicates the top, dominant, or active partner; on the right indicates the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. However, negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color \"only because the idea of the hankie turns them on\" or \"may not even know what it means\".\nSex scenes depicted by Bill Schmeling routinely involve BDSM with an emphasis on bodily fluids, including urolagnia. Another notable artist that depicted urolagnia was Touko Laaksonen (\"Tom of Finland\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such tombs are located in many nations and are usually high-profile national monuments. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following World War I, a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single tomb, containing the body of one such unidentified soldier.\nHistory.\nA shrine in Jinju, Korea, which commemorated those who died in defense of Korea during the Imjin War in 1592, has been described as the first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is, however, more inclusive, in that it is a memorial to all who died in defense of the city against the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, civilian as well as soldier. Beginning in 1593, when the Ministry of Rites received permission to perform a sacrifice for all who died in the battle, not only the identifiable bodies, the state offered sacrifices for the dead twice a year in spring and autumn until 1908, when the practice was ended by royal edict.\nThe first known monument of an unknown soldier in Europe is the ('Valiant Soldier Square') created in 1849 to commemorate the First Schleswig War, in Fredericia, Denmark.\nFrance and the United Kingdom.\nDuring the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Reverend David Railton had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the British Army as a chaplain on the Western Front, which bore the pencil-written legend \"An Unknown British Soldier\".\nHe suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an \"Unknown Warrior\", proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the Dean of Westminster, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and later from King George V, responding to a wave of public support. At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of Le Souvenir fran\u00e7ais proposed the idea of burying \"an unknown soldier\" in the Panth\u00e9on. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law in September 1919.\nThe United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their 'monumental' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on Armistice Day 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was created at Westminster Abbey, while in France \"La tombe du soldat inconnu\" was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.\nOther countries.\nThe idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the United States unveiled its own Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Portugal its T\u00famulo do Soldado Desconhecido, and Italy its \"Tomba del Milite Ignoto\". Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.\nIn Chile and Ukraine, the second 'unknown tombs' were unveiled to commemorate \"The Unknown Sailor\".\nIn Serbia, soldiers of World War I are commemorated by the Monument to the Unknown Hero on the mountain of Avala.\nIn the Philippines, the \"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\" at the \"Libingan ng mga Bayani\" (\"Cemetery of the Heroes\") is the cemetery's most prominent structure.\nSymbolism.\nThe Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a soldier who is unidentified (or \"known but to God\" as the stone is sometimes inscribed). These remains are considered impossible to identify, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country's unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.\nIdentification.\nMany soldiers have been identified by DNA analysis. The first one to be analyzed was an airman from the Vietnam War.\nExamples.\nTombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67990", "revid": "274535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67990", "title": "Nijinsky (horse)", "text": "Canadian-bred Thoroughbred racehorse (1967\u20131992)\nNijinsky (21 February 1967 \u2013 15 April 1992) was a Canadian-bred, Irish-trained champion Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was the outstanding two-year-old in Europe in 1969 when he was unbeaten in five races. In the following season, he became the first horse for thirty-five years to win the English Triple Crown, a feat that has not been repeated as of 2025. He is regarded as one of the greatest European flat racehorses of the 20th century.\nHe was also historically important for establishing the international reputation of his sire Northern Dancer, though Nijinsky was atypical of Northern Dancer progeny in size and conformation. Retired to stud, he became the leading sire in Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the leading broodmare sire in North America. As a winner of top-class races from 6 to 14 furlongs, Nijinsky is also considered to be among the most versatile of the great horses of the 20th century.\nBackground.\nNijinsky, a bay horse with a white heart on his forehead and three white feet, was bred at E. P. Taylor's Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Northern Dancer, the winner of the 1964 Kentucky Derby who went on to become one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. His dam, Flaming Page, by Bull Page, was a successful racemare, winning the 1962 Queen's Plate. At stud, she produced only two other foals. One of these was Fleur by Victoria Park, who produced the 1977 Epsom Derby winner The Minstrel by Northern Dancer; the other was Minsky, champion Irish two-year-old in 1970 and full brother to Nijinsky. Nijinsky was a big, powerful and handsome horse with great presence, standing \u00a0hands high, resembling his dam rather than his sire in stature and conformation, traits he tended to pass on to his offspring.\nHe was offered for sale at the Windfields Farm's annual yearling auction where he was bought for $84,000 () by the American minerals magnate and industrialist Charles W. Engelhard Jr., acting on the advice of the Irish trainer Vincent O'Brien. It was Engelhard's wife Jane who decided that the colt should be named after the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Nijinsky was shipped to Ireland, where he was trained by O'Brien at Ballydoyle, County Tipperary.\nRacing career.\n1969: two-year-old season.\nNijinsky's first four races were all at the Curragh. In June, he started at odds of 4/11 and won the six-furlong Erne maiden race easily. He followed up with wins in the Anglesey Stakes and the Railway Stakes. On his fourth appearance, he was extended for the first time in the Beresford Stakes. He won decisively from Decies, a colt who went on to win the Irish 2000 Guineas in 1970. Having proved himself the best of the Irish two-year-olds, he was sent to England in October to contest the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden for the first time by Lester Piggott, he was held up at the back of the six-horse field before moving through easily to take the lead inside the final furlong, earning top rating in the British Free Handicap.\n1970: three-year-old season.\nSpring.\nOn his first appearance as a three-year-old, Nijinsky beat the four-year-old Deep Run in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh in April. The colt was then sent back to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas over one mile. He started the 4/7 favourite against thirteen opponents. Nijinsky took the lead two furlongs from the finish and, without being put under any pressure by Piggott, pulled clear to win by two and a half lengths from Yellow God. The second had won the Ascot 2,000 Guineas trial and the previous year's Gimcrack Stakes, as well as finishing a close second in the Middle Park Stakes.\nSummer.\nNijinsky's opposition in the Derby at Epsom was stronger and he started at odds of 11/8 \u2013 the only time he was ever odds against. His rivals were headed by the French-trained colts Stintino and Gyr. The veteran French trainer Etienne Pollet had delayed his retirement for a year to guide Gyr, a son of his champion Sea-Bird, through his three-year-old season. Nijinsky was held up by Piggott as usual before moving forward in the straight, by which time Gyr was in front and pulling clear of the Prix Lupin winner, Stintino. A furlong and a half from the finish, Piggott used his whip on Nijinsky. The favourite responded immediately, catching Gyr in a few strides and pulling ahead to win from him by two and a half lengths, with Stintino third.\nThe winning time of 2:34.68 was the fastest Epsom Derby since 1936. Nijinsky's time for the last two furlongs of the race (10.6 and 11.25 seconds, respectively) was of sprint championship-winning standard. Piggott claimed that he was \"always cantering\", while Bill Williamson, who rode Gyr, said that \"Nijinsky was just too good\". Gyr subsequently franked the form by easily winning the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.\nOn the day before the Derby, Nijinsky had overcome a severe bout of colic which could have threatened his life.\nOn 27 June, Nijinsky followed up his Epsom win by taking the Irish Derby at the Curragh. Ridden by Liam Ward, he started at odds of 4/11 and accelerated late to win by three lengths from Meadowville. In July, Nijinsky raced against older horses in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. His five opponents included winners of major races: Blakeney (1969 Epsom Derby), Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes), Crepellana (Prix de Diane) and Caliban (Coronation Cup). Without being extended, Nijinsky moved through to take the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two lengths from Blakeney despite being eased down to a canter in the closing stages.\nIn August, Nijinsky contracted ringworm, which seriously affected his training schedule. The horse lost most of the hair on his body.\nAutumn.\nNijinsky appeared to be recovering after being placed on a \"rich\" diet including raw eggs and Irish Stout, and was sent to Doncaster for the St. Leger in September. In the one mile and six furlongs race, he was attempting to become the first horse since Bahram 35 years earlier to complete the English Triple Crown. He started the 2/7 favourite and won comfortably, although his margin of victory over Meadowville was only one length. As of 2024, he is the last horse to accomplish the feat of sweeping the English Triple Crown: since 1970 only Reference Point (1987), Nashwan (1989), Sea The Stars (2009) and Camelot (2012) have won two of the three races, but Oh So Sharp won the filly's version of the Triple Crown in 1985.\nIn his next race, Nijinsky was sent to France for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris in October. Having kept Nijinsky well to the rear, at least 10 lengths back, Piggott produced him in the straight but was baulked twice before making his run on the wide outside. However, 150m from the finish Nijinsky caught front runners Miss Dan and Sassafras and took a slight lead. In the last strides, Nijinsky appeared to veer left away from Piggott's whip and Sassafras, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, produced a renewed effort to regain the advantage and win by a head. Many, including trainer Vincent O'Brien, felt that Piggott had lost ground on Nijinsky, drawn unfavourably on the wide outside, throughout the race, given the colt far too much ground to make up and left his challenge too late while all the while Sassafras had taken the shortest possible route. Piggott, who was heavily criticised by the media and racing public, said that in his opinion Nijinsky was past his peak for the year. It is beyond dispute that Nijinsky was a most unlucky loser. Piggott commented: \"Certainly Nijinsky would have won had he not swerved almost in the shadow of the post, and certainly he would have won had his initial finishing run not been blocked on the final bend\".\nLess than two weeks after his first, Nijinsky ran his last race in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. Although he had been known to sweat freely before some of his previous races, Nijinsky on this occasion appeared to become particularly nervous and anxious before the start. In the race itself, he ran well below his best form and was beaten 3/4 length at odds of 4/11 by the five-year-old English horse Lorenzaccio. O'Brien on this occasion concurred with Piggott, saying that Nijinsky appeared to have \"lost his fire.\" Nijinsky was retired to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky having been syndicated in August for $5,440,000.\nAssessment and honours.\nNijinsky was given a rating of 138 by Timeform, the second-highest for a winner of the Epsom Derby up to that time. He was Timeform's Horse of the Year for 1970. Nijinsky was also voted British Horse of the Year by the Racecourse Association, gaining 38 of the 40 votes.\nIn 2018 Nijinsky was rated the greatest-ever Epsom Derby winner by a panel of experts assembled by the \"Daily Telegraph\". In 2021, the \"Sporting Life\" ranked Nijinsky's Derby win no. 1, ahead of Sea Bird, in their top-40 runnings of the race. In their book \"A Century of Champions\", John Randall and Tony Morris rated Nijinsky as a \"great\" Derby winner and the best Irish racehorse of the 20th century.\nVincent O'Brien named Nijinsky and Sir Ivor as the best horses he had trained, placing Nijinsky first \"for brilliance.\" Lester Piggott concurred: \"I think Nijinsky probably on his day was the most brilliant horse I've ever ridden\". Piggott added later that Nijinsky, during the summer of 1970 when he won the 2,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, was \"an unbeatable horse\" Piggott was adamant, however, that running in the St Leger led to the horse not winning at Longchamps.\nIn 1970, a film was made about his racing career entitled \"A Horse Called Nijinsky\". Narrated by Orson Welles, it was released in British cinemas and in 1988 released on VHS video. The Nijinsky team also was voted winners of the 1970 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. Among the more unusual tributes, a Cabernet Sauvignon wine and a variety of winter wheat have been named in Nijinsky's honour. Bronze statues of him stand at Ballydoyle and at The Curragh racecourse.\nStud record.\nHaving been sent to stand at stud in the United States, Nijinsky was registered there as Nijinsky II.\nThe horse was an excellent sire. He sired 155 Stakes/Group winners (18.1% of 862 total foals) and 519 individual winners (60.2%), ranging over the full range of distances at which he excelled as a racehorse. He is the only sire to have a winner of the Kentucky and Epsom Derbies in the same year (1986). The horse was champion sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1986 and champion broodmare sire in the United States in 1993 and 1994.\nHis notable progeny included:\nNijinsky was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth II and she visited him as often as possible at Claiborne Stud.\nNijinsky was euthanised in April 1992 as a result of \"the infirmities of old age\" after suffering from laminitis since 1985. He is buried at Claiborne Farm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After a design competition was held in 1928, the winning project was completed in 1932. The site now also includes the gravesites of two other unknowns, one from World War II and one from the Korean War, who were buried under two slabs between it and the Memorial Amphitheater behind it.\nOther nations also have national burial sites for unknowns from the First World War (also known as the Great War), such as the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Portugal, and Italy. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is in the United Kingdom and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in France. Nations have presented their highest awards or medals to each other's unknown soldier.\nThe World War I \"Unknown\" is a recipient of the Medal of Honor, the Victoria Cross, and several other foreign nations' highest service awards. The U.S. Unknowns from World War II and Korea have also received the Medal of Honor. \nThe Tomb is guarded around-the-clock by a Tomb Guard from the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment, \"The Old Guard\". An elaborate ceremony, the Changing of the Guard, takes place every half-hour from April through September and hourly from October through March.\nTomb of 1921.\nOn 4 March 1921, the United States Congress approved the burial of an unidentified American serviceman from World War I in the plaza of the new Memorial Amphitheater. On 11 November 1921, the unknown soldier brought back from France was interred below a three-level marble tomb. The bottom two levels are six granite sections each and the top at least nine blocks with a rectangular opening in the center of each level through which the unknown remains were placed through the tomb and into the ground below. A stone slab, rather than marble, covers the rectangular opening.\nTomb of 1931.\nSince 1921, the intent was to place a superstructure on top of the Tomb, but it was not until 3 July 1926, that Congress authorized the completion of the Tomb and the expenditure of $50,000, . (The completed cost was $48,000.) A design competition was held and won by architect Lorimer Rich and sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones. An appropriation from Congress for the work was secured, and on 21 December 1929, a contract for completion of the Tomb itself was entered into. The Tomb would consist of seven pieces of marble in four levels (cap, die, base and sub-base) of which the die is the largest block with the sculpting on all four sides.\nQuarrying the Yule marble (3.9 miles south of Marble, Colorado by the Vermont Marble Company) was a one-year process beginning in 1930. The cap was quarried on the first attempt but the base required three tries. The large middle block also required three tries. In late January 1931, the 56-ton middle block was lifted out of the quarry. The quarrying involved 75 men. When the block was separated from the mountain inside the quarry it weighed 124 tons. A wire saw was then brought into the quarry to cut the block down to 56 tons.\nOn 3 February 1931, the block reached the marble mill site (in the town of Marble) after a four-day trip from the quarry. There it was crated, then shipped to Vermont on 8 February. The block was sawed to final size in West Rutland, Vermont, and fabricated by craftsmen in Proctor, Vermont, before it was shipped by train to Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. By September, all seven blocks were on the grounds of the Tomb site, at Arlington.\nAssembly began in September 1931. An imperfection was found in the base, requiring three more quarryings. By the end of December 1931, the assembly was completed. Finishing work followed, with the carvings on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers under the direction of sculptor Thomas Jones. (The brothers also carved the Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial, among others). The Tomb was completed without formal ceremony on 9 April 1932.\nThe Tomb was placed at the head of the grave of the World War I Unknown. West of this grave are the crypts of Unknowns from World War II (south) and Korea (north). Between the two lies a crypt that once contained an Unknown from Vietnam (middle). His remains were positively identified in 1998 through DNA testing as First Lieutenant Michael Blassie, United States Air Force, and were removed. Those three graves are marked with white marble slabs flush with the plaza.\nThe Tomb has a flat-faced form and is relieved at the corners and along the sides by neo-classical pilasters set into the surface with objects and inscriptions carved into the sides. The 1931 symbolism of the objects on the north, south, and east sides changed over time.\n North and South panel with 3 wreaths on each side represent (in 1931) \"a world of memories\" but later the six major battles engaged in by American forces in France: Ardennes, Belleau Wood, Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, Meuse-Argonne, Oisiu-Eiseu, and Somme. Each wreath has 38 leaves and 12 berries.\n East panel that faces Washington, DC, are three Greek figures representing Peace, Victory, and \"American Manhood\" \u2013 but later \"Valor\" instead of \"American Manhood\"\n West panel is inscribed with (centered on the panel):\n HERE RESTS IN\n HONORED GLORY\n AN AMERICAN\n SOLDIER\n KNOWN BUT TO GOD\nTomb Dimensions\nas of 2004 (xxx)* 1931 die block dimension coming out of the quarry.\nThe Unknown of World War I.\nOn Memorial Day, 1921, four unknown servicemen were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France, Aisne-Marne, Meuse-Argonne, Somme, and St. Mihiel. U.S. Army Sgt. Edward F. Younger, who was wounded in combat, highly decorated for valor and received the Distinguished Service Cross, selected the Unknown of World War I from four identical caskets at the city hall in Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne, France, on 24 October 1921. Younger selected the World War I Unknown by placing a spray of white roses on one of the caskets. He chose the second casket from the right. The chosen Unknown was transported to the United States aboard . Those remaining were interred in the Meuse Argonne Cemetery, France.\nThe World War I Unknown lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda from his arrival in the United States until Armistice Day 1921. On 11 November 1921, President Warren G. Harding officiated at the interment ceremonies at the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. During the ceremony, the World War I Unknown was awarded the Victoria Cross by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, on behalf of King George V of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Victoria Cross was placed with the soldier. Other Allied nations also awarded the American Unknown Soldier with decorations, including the Legion of Honour, M\u00e9daille Militaire, and Croix de Guerre from France, the War Cross from Czechoslovakia, the Gold Medal for Bravery from Italy, the Virtuti Militari from Poland, and the Virtutea Militara from Romania.\nEarlier, on 17 October 1921, the British Unknown Warrior had been conferred the U.S. Medal of Honor by General of the Armies John Pershing.\nThe Unknowns of World War II and Korea.\nOn 3 August 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as a general during World War II, signed a bill to select and pay tribute to the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War. The selection ceremonies and the interment of these Unknowns took place in 1958. The World War II Unknown was selected from remains exhumed from cemeteries in Europe, Africa, Hawaii, and the Philippines.\nTwo Unknowns from World War II, one from the European Theater and one from the Pacific Theater, were placed in identical caskets and taken aboard and placed on either side of the Korean unknown. Navy Hospital Corpsman 1st Class William R. Charette, then the U.S. Navy's only active-duty Medal of Honor recipient who was an enlisted man, selected the right-hand casket as the World War II Unknown. The casket of the remaining WWII unknown received a solemn burial at sea.\nThe Korean unknown had been selected from four unknown Americans who died in the Korean War that were disinterred from the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. Army Master Sergeant Ned Lyle made the final selection. The unselected unknowns were re-interred there.\nThe caskets of the WWII and Korean unknowns arrived in Washington on 28 May 1958, where they lay in the Capitol Rotunda until the morning of 30 May, when they were carried on caissons to Arlington National Cemetery. President Eisenhower awarded each the Medal of Honor, and the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War were interred in the plaza beside their World War I comrade.\nThe Unknown of Vietnam.\nThe Vietnam Unknown service member was originally designated by Medal of Honor recipient U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Allan Jay Kellogg Jr., during a ceremony at Pearl Harbor.\nEach branch of the Armed Services took part in the transportation to honor the unknown. Marines from Marine Barracks Hawaii consisted of an Honor Guard of nine enlisted men and Lt. Denis Muller. The designated Vietnam Unknown was transported aboard , where the Marines stood guard over the casket during the voyage to Naval Air Station Alameda, California. At Travis, the debarkation ceremony turned the remains over to the USAF on 24 May 1984. The next day, the remains of the Unknown were flown from Travis Air Force Base, California, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. Once there the remains were turned over to the US Army, where the remains were taken to Fort McNair for placement upon the horse-drawn wagon which later carried the Unknown to the Capitol Rotunda for display before interment. While on display for public viewing, all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces stood in honor, guarding the casket of the Unknown for two weeks.\nMany Vietnam veterans and President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan visited the Vietnam Unknown in the U.S. Capitol. An Army caisson carried the Vietnam Unknown from the Capitol to the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, 28 May 1984.\nPresident Reagan presided over the funeral, presented the Medal of Honor to the Vietnam Unknown, and acted as next of kin by accepting the interment flag at the end of the ceremony. The interment flags of all Unknowns at the Tomb of the Unknowns are on view in the Memorial Display Room.\nIdentification of the Unknown.\nIn 1994, Ted Sampley, a POW/MIA activist, determined that the remains of the Vietnam Unknown were likely those of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, who was shot down near An L\u1ed9c, Vietnam, in 1972. Sampley published an article in his newsletter and contacted Blassie's family, who attempted to pursue the case with the Air Force's casualty office without result. In January 1998, CBS News broadcast a report based on Sampley's investigation which brought political pressure to support the identification of the remains. The body was exhumed on 14 May 1998. Based on mitochondrial DNA testing, Department of Defense scientists confirmed the remains were those of Blassie. The identification was announced on 30 June 1998, and on 10 July, Blassie's remains arrived home to his family in St. Louis, Missouri; he was reinterred at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery on 11 July.\nRe-designation of the crypt.\nThe slab over the crypt that once held the remains of the Vietnam Unknown has since been replaced. The original inscription of \"Vietnam\" has been changed to \"Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen 1958 \u2013 1975\" as a reminder of the commitment of the Armed Forces to the fullest possible accounting of missing service members. It was decided that the crypt would remain vacant.\nTomb Guards.\nTomb Guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (TUS) are volunteer, enlisted, United States Army soldiers assigned to the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as \"The Old Guard\" (TOG) at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall (originally Fort Myer). TOG soldiers who have the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of 11B basic infantry or 31B military police are eligible to volunteer and apply to serve as Tomb Guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (TUS). The TUS has been called the \"Tomb of the Unknowns\" when referring to the combined three or four burials from World War I, World War II, Korea (and Vietnam), but it is still officially called the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. \nTomb Guards make it their goal to earn the Tomb Guard Identification Badge (TGIB). The Tomb Guard Identification Badge (TGIB) is awarded after the Tomb Guard Sentinel passes a series of tests, including one on the history of Arlington National Cemetery.\nThe first military guards at \"The Tomb\" were troopers from the 3rd Cavalry, \"Brave Rifles\", who were posted nearby on Fort Myer. Since 6 April 1948, (known then as \"Army Day\"), when the regiment was reactivated, it has been guarded by soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment, \"The Old Guard\". The Old Guard is also posted to Fort Myer, Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. It is considered one of the highest honors within the American military to serve as a Sentinel at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Fewer than 20 percent of all volunteers are accepted for training and of those only a fraction pass training to become full-fledged Tomb Guards. The Tomb Guard Identification Badge is the third least-awarded qualification badge of the United States Army; as of 26 December 2023, they number 868, including 26 which have been revoked and 9 \"administrative errors\". It is preceded by the 154 Military Horseman Identification Badges and the 17 Astronaut Badges.\nThe soldier \"walking the mat\" does not wear rank insignia, so as not to outrank the Unknowns, whatever their ranks may have been. Non-commissioned officers (usually the Relief Commander and Assistant Relief Commanders), do wear insignia of their rank when changing the guard only. They have a separate uniform (without rank) that is worn when they actually guard the Unknowns or are \"posted.\"\nThe sentinels will confront people who cross the barriers at the tomb or whom they perceive to be disrespectful or excessively loud; requesting all in attendance to remain silent and standing prior to the beginning of a guard change.\nOn 9\u201310 November 2021, in honor of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier's centennial commemoration, members of the public were allowed to walk on the plaza and lay flowers for the first time since 1925. Arlington National Cemetery has permitted the public to lay flowers at the Tomb on the four succeeding Memorial Days since the Centennial.\nWeapons.\nTomb guards are always equipped with a rifle and bayonet as well as a sidearm, with the changes in exact weaponry reflecting the changes in the Army. Past weapons have been the M1903 Springfield and M1 Garand rifles, as well as the M1911 and M9 pistols. Guards are currently equipped with the M14 rifle and the Sig Sauer P320 M17 9mm.\nWalking the mat.\nThere is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the Tomb and crypts. The tomb guard:\nAfter each turn, the guard executes a sharp \"shoulder-arms\" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the Tomb and any possible threat.\nOut of respect for the interred, the sentinels command silence at the tombs, and all persons are requested to stand if able. If the guard walking the mat must vocally confront a disturbance from spectators, or a threat, the routine is interrupted and remains so until the disturbance is under control. The sentinel will exit the mat, place the weapon in port arms position, and confront the disturbance. Once under control, the sentinel then walks on the pavement to the other side of the mat, turns to shoulder arms, and resumes the routine from the point of interruption.\nTwenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowed\u2014the 21-gun salute.\nThe mat is usually replaced twice per year: before Memorial Day and before Veterans Day. This is required because of the wear on the rubber mat by the special shoes worn by tomb guards. The sentinels have metal plates built into the soles and inner parts of their shoes to allow for a more rugged sole and to give the signature click of the heel during maneuvers. The sentinels wear sunglasses because of the bright reflection from the marble surrounding the Tomb and the Memorial Amphitheater.\nChanging of the Guard.\nWhile Arlington National Cemetery is open, during the day in the summer months from 1 April to 30 September, the guard is changed every half-hour. During the winter months, from 1 October to 31 March, the guard is changed every hour. While the cemetery is closed to the public (5PM - 8AM daily), the guard is changed every two hours. The ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever Arlington National Cemetery is open.\nThe guard change is very symbolic but also conducted in accordance with Army regulations. The relief commander or assistant relief commander, along with the incoming guard, are both required for a guard change to take place. The relief commander orders the outgoing guard to \"pass on your orders\" to the incoming guard. The outgoing guard will say to the incoming guard, \"Post and orders remain as directed.\" The incoming guard's response is always \"Orders acknowledged.\" During changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony, the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain \"silent and standing\" throughout the entire event. In some occurrences, the public is also asked to refrain from taking flash pictures (mostly during inclement weather).\nOn 4 October 2021, the first all-female changing of the guard took place to honor Sergeant of the Guard Sgt. Chelsea Porterfield, who was the first woman to hold that position.\nDedication.\nA civilian guard was first posted at the Tomb on 17 November 1925, to prevent, among other things, families from picnicking on the flat marble slab with views of the city. Posting of a military guard began at 7:30 in the morning on 25 March 1926. The first 24-hour guard was posted on 2 July 1937 at midnight. The watch has been maintained continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, since that time. Inclement weather, terrorist attacks, and more have never caused the watch to cease.\nSince 1948, the tomb guards, a special platoon within the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), work on a team rotation of 24 hours on, 24 hours off, for five days, taking the following four days off. A guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his uniform\u2014heavy wool, regardless of the time of year\u2014for the next day's work. In addition to preparing the uniform, guards also conduct physical training, tomb guard training, participate in field exercises, cut their hair before the next workday, and at times are involved in regimental functions as well. Tomb guards are required to memorize 35 pages of information about Arlington National Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one.\nA special Army decoration, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge, is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions (from a pool of more than 300), a uniform inspection with two gigs (errors) or fewer (measured to 1/64\"), and a test on the guard-changing sequence. After serving honorably for a period of nine months, and having passed the sequence of tests, a tomb guard is permanently awarded the Badge. Since the first award on 7 February 1958, fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this badge, including four women. A small number of tomb guard Identification Badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as Guards before 1959. The Tomb Guard Identification Badge is the only badge awarded by the United States Army that can be revoked after a soldier has left the military. The Regimental Commander of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment has the authority to revoke a badge from any Guard (past or present) for any act that would bring discredit upon the Tomb of the Unknowns.\nThe badge was designed in 1956 and was first issued to members of the Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns on 7 February 1958. The badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item, meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the honor guard. Upon leaving the duty, the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers. In 1963, a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform, even after the soldier's completion of duty at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\nIn keeping with the dedication to duty Tomb Guards have demonstrated, 2021 served as a centennial commemoration for The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Throughout 2021, the cemetery held events leading up to the centennial ceremony on 11 November 2021. The public was able to experience and participate in the commemorative events in many ways, both at the cemetery and virtually.\nDamage and repair to the Tomb Monument.\nCracking and weathering caused concerns for the long-term preservation of the Tomb Monument. A November 1963 report first recorded horizontal cracking of the monument's marble die block. Though this was the first time that the damage was documented, the report made it clear that the cracks had become visible some time before that date.\nIn 1963\u20131964, there were two cracks\u2014referred to as \"primary\" and \"secondary\"\u2014extending approximately around the die block. By 1974, they had extended to . They grew another over the next 15 years. Inspection determined that the cracks had increased horizontally since 1990. Analysis also indicated that the cracks were not surficial but extended partially through the block and would eventually extend all the way through.\nThe 1990 report documented deterioration of the marble's surface. As much as of the marble surface was lost through weathering. The study projected that before 2010, the Tomb Monument would have been weathered enough to have a negative effect on the experience of the visitors and concluded that the only solutions were to enclose or replace the monument.\nSeveral options were considered to deal with the damage. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery determined that proper repair could return the Tomb Monument to an acceptable appearance. However, because the cracks would continue to lengthen and widen, continuous grouting, regrouting, touch-up, monitoring, and maintenance would be required. Therefore, a report commissioned by Arlington National Cemetery and published in June 2006 confirmed the Cemetery's conclusion that \"replacement of the three pieces of the Tomb Monument is the preferred alternative\". A final decision was scheduled to be made on 30 September 2007.\nIn 2003, John Haines, a retired car dealer, offered to donate a large slab of marble to Arlington National Cemetery to replace the existing marble. Haines paid $31,000 for the marble slab. The marble was not removed from the quarry, however, because imperfections were found and the block was rejected.\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation objected to the plan to replace the authentic Tomb Monument. The Trust expressed concern that Arlington National Cemetery sought to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry, which experts agreed was likely to eventually crack.\nThe Trust observed that the Cemetery's own 1990 report recommended that the monument be repaired and that the Cemetery, in fact, commissioned Oehrlein Architects to repair the stone. In 2007, Mary Oehrlein informed Congressional staff members that: \"The existing monument can easily be repaired, as was done 17 years ago, using conventional conservation methods to re-grout the cracks. Once repaired, the fault lines would be virtually invisible from the public viewing areas.\"\nOn 26 September 2007, U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka announced that an amendment crafted together with Senator Jim Webb would be added to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 1585) that would require a report on the plans of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to replace the monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns. The secretaries would be required to advise Congress on the efforts to maintain and preserve the monument. Additionally, they would have to provide an assessment on the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather than replacing the Tomb Monument. Finally, if the secretaries chose replacement, they would have to report those plans and detail how they intended to dispose of the existing monument. Once the report was provided, the secretaries were prevented from taking action to replace the monument for at least 180 days. The Akaka-Webb amendment was included in the bill by unanimous consent of the Senate. An amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill authorized a review of the monument's condition. The bill also authorized repair, but not replacement, of the monument. Final passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2008 (H.R. 4986) was signed by President Bush on 28 January 2008.\nIn June 2009 Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that the monument was to be repaired, not replaced. In 2010, the cracks were filled but the repairs lasted only a few months. As of June 2011, the cemetery was struggling to repair the cracks in the monument, one of which measured long, with another at . In September 2011, the cracks were filled again and on 21 October 2011, inspection by the Corps of Engineers and other experts pronounced the repairs a success.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She also voiced roles in \"Incredibles 2\" (2018) and \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\" (2021). For playing the nun Sister Agnes in \"Conclave\" (2024), she garnered a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\nRossellini received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the HBO film \"Crime of the Century\" (1996). She received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series nomination for \"Chicago Hope\" (1997). She also has guest starred in the sitcoms \"Friends\" and \"30 Rock\" as well as the dramas \"Alias\" and \"The Blacklist\". She portrayed Simone Beck in the HBO series \"Julia\" (2022).\nEarly life.\nRossellini was born in Rome, the daughter of Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, who was of Swedish and German descent, and Italian director Roberto Rossellini, who was born in Rome from a family originally from Pisa, Tuscany. She has three siblings from her mother: her fraternal twin sister Isotta Ingrid Rossellini, who is an adjunct professor of Italian literature, a brother, Robertino Ingmar Rossellini; and a half-sister, Pia Lindstr\u00f6m, who formerly worked on television and is from her mother's first marriage with Petter Lindstr\u00f6m. She has four other siblings from her father's two other marriages: Romano (who died at age nine), Renzo, Gil, and Raffaella. Growing up, she received \"a liberal Catholic education\".\nRossellini was raised in Rome, as well as in Santa Marinella and Paris. She underwent an operation for appendicitis at the age of five. At 11, she was diagnosed with scoliosis. To correct it, she had to undergo an 18-month ordeal of painful stretchings, body casts and surgery on her spine using pieces of one of her shin bones. Consequently, she has incision scars on her back and shin.\nAt 19, she went to New York City, where she attended Finch College, while working as a translator and as a television reporter for RAI. She also appeared intermittently on \"L'altra Domenica\" (\"The Other Sunday\"), a TV show featuring Roberto Benigni. However, she decided not to stay full-time in New York until her marriage to Martin Scorsese (1979\u20131982), whom she met when she interviewed him for RAI.\nCareer.\nModeling.\nAt the age of 28, her modeling career began, when she was photographed by Bruce Weber for \"British Vogue\" and by Bill King for American \"Vogue\". During her career, she has also worked with many other renowned photographers, including Richard Avedon, Steven Meisel, Helmut Newton, Peter Lindbergh, Norman Parkinson, Eve Arnold, Francesco Scavullo, Annie Leibovitz, Denis Piel, and Robert Mapplethorpe. Her image has appeared on such magazines as \"Marie Claire\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Vanity Fair\", and \"Elle\". In March 1988, an exhibition dedicated to photographs of her, called \"Portrait of a Woman\", was held at the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris.\nRossellini's modeling career led her into the world of cosmetics, when she became the exclusive spokesmodel for the French cosmetics brand Lanc\u00f4me in 1982, replacing Nancy Dutiel in the United States and Carol Alt in Europe. At Lanc\u00f4me, in 1990, she was involved in product development for the fragrance Tr\u00e9sor. In 1996, when she was 43, she was removed as the face of Lanc\u00f4me for being \"too old\". In 2016, at the age of 63, she was rehired by Lanc\u00f4me's new female CEO, Francoise Lehmann, as a global brand ambassador for the company.\nIn October 1992, Rossellini modelled for Madonna's controversial book \"Sex\". Rossellini also appeared in Madonna's music video for her successful Top 5 hit song \"Erotica\", released in autumn 1992.\nRossellini was the inaugural brand ambassador for the Italian Silversea Cruises company in 2004, and she appeared in print ads and on their website. Barbara Muckermann, the senior vice-president of worldwide marketing and communications in 2004, said at the time of the announcement, \"Isabella is the ideal personification of Silversea's exclusive standard of elegance, glamour and sophistication.\"\nFilm and television.\nRossellini made her film debut with a brief appearance as a nun opposite her mother in the 1976 film \"A Matter of Time\". Her first role was the 1979 film \"Il Prato\", and then in 1980 she appeared in Renzo Arbore's film \"Il pap'occhio\" with her then husband Martin Scorsese.\nFollowing her mother's death in 1982, Rossellini was cast in her first American film, \"White Nights\" (1985). This was followed by her notable role as the tortured nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens in the David Lynch film \"Blue Velvet,\" in which she also contributed her own singing. Other significant film roles during this period include her work in \"Cousins\" (1989), \"Death Becomes Her\" (1992), \"Fearless\" (1993), and \"Immortal Beloved\" (1994). In 1996, she appeared as herself in an episode of the TV series \"Friends\" called \"The One with Frank Jr.\"\nIn 2003, Rossellini was a recurring character on the television series \"Alias\". In that same year, she also appeared in the Canadian film \"The Saddest Music in the World\", directed by Guy Maddin. In 2004, she played the High Priestess Thar in the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries \"Legend of Earthsea\", and the director Robert Lieberman stated that Rossellini \"brings a very big persona to the screen. She carries a great deal of beauty. We needed someone who had a feeling of authority to be this kind of mother superior type and at the same time not be totally dour and unattractive.\"\nIn 2006, Rossellini appeared in several television documentaries. First, she narrated a two-hour television special on Italy for the Discovery Channel's \"Discovery Atlas\" series. Then, alongside Segway PT inventor Dean Kamen, she spoke about her past and current activities on an episode of \"Iconoclasts\", a series that featured on the Sundance Channel (known as SundanceTV from 2014 onwards), an independent film network founded by film industry veteran Robert Redford. The Sundance Channel then purchased the 2006 Guy Maddin-directed short film \"My Dad Is 100 Years Old\", a tribute that Rossellini created for her father. In the film, she played almost every role, including Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock and her mother, Ingrid Bergman. Rossellini's twin sister, Isotta Ingrid, criticized the short film, calling it an \"inappropriate\" tribute.\nIn 2007, Rossellini guest starred on two episodes of the television show \"30 Rock\", playing Alec Baldwin's character's ex-wife. Around the same time, Rossellini enrolled at New York University where she undertook an undergraduate degree in Art and Environmental Studies, and then pursued with a master's degree at Hunter College in New York to study animal behavior. Then the Sundance Channel commissioned her to contribute a short-film project to the environmental program \"The Green\". Rossellini explained in a 2013 interview:\nThey contacted me again when they had allocated some money to experiment in making a web series. At first, I thought I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to write and then thought it might be really fun to do little short films about animals. This is how the first three episodes of \"Green Porno\" came about. When I showed them the pilot, Sundance commissioned eight more. It was a huge hit!\nDebuting in 2008, the first series of \"Green Porno\" had over 4\u00a0million views on YouTube and two further seasons were produced; there are 18 episodes in the series. Rossellini worked with a small budget for \"Green Porno\" and she was responsible for the scripts, helped to design the creatures, directed the episodes, and is the primary actor in the series. In each of the episodes, she acts out the mating rituals and reproductive behaviour of various animals while commentary is played.\n\"Green Porno\" was followed by two other animal-themed television productions: \"Seduce Me: The Spawn of Green Porno\" and \"Mammas\". \"Seduce Me: The Spawn of Green Porno\" is a five-episode online series that was premiered in mid-2010 and explores the topic of animal courtship. As with \"Green Porno\", Rossellini wrote, directed and acted in the series; she is also a producer of the series. Rossellini explained in 2010, \"I always wanted to make films about animals \u2013 there's not an enormous audience, but there's an enormous audience for sex.\"\n\"Mammas\" debuted in the United States on 12 May 2013, Mother's Day weekend there, and is a celebration of the maternal aspects of the animal world. Rossellini is again the primary actor and plays the maternal versions of animals such as spiders and hamsters. Rossellini explained in a 2013 interview part of the research process for \"Mammas\": \"First of all it's about diversity. When talking about motherhood, I would find examples of ten different species that either don't get pregnant in the belly but in the mouth or back. Or species that abandon their children all-together so that I don't tell ten stories that are too similar.\"\nAfter the completion of her \"Green Porno\" productions, Rossellini acted in the film \"Enemy\", with Jake Gyllenhaal, which was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Rossellini praised the film during a TIFF interview: \"I love the subtlety of the film. It reminded me of Kafka. It's very metaphysical, but yet it's also a solid thriller. It made me leap up out of my seat at the end.\" Rossellini also played the silent film actor Rudolph Valentino's mother in Vlad Kozlov's \"Silent Life\", a feature-length version of the director's silent, black-and-white short film \"Daydreams of Rudolph Valentino\". Kozlov's film was due for release in 2012, but, as of February 2014, the film has not been officially released.\nRossellini was the president of the jury for the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in 2011. In April 2015, she was announced as the president of the jury for the section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2016, Rossellini was cast as Rita Marks, the matriarch of the Marks crime family in the Hulu original series, \"Shut Eye\".\nIn 2023, Rossellini was honoured with Lifetime Achievement Award at the 18th Rome Film Festival.\nIn 2024, Rossellini received acclaim for her portrayal of Sister Agnes in the political drama, \"Conclave\", opposite Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow, for which she received an Academy Award nomination.\nOn February 15, 2025, it was announced that Rossellini would be joining the cast of Ryan Murphy's upcoming television series, \"The Beauty\". On February 26, 2025, it was announced that she had been cast in Mike Newell's Wallis Simpson biopic, \"The Bitter End\", playing opposite Joan Collins. Rossellini is also set to star in Jeremiah Zagar's upcoming film \"The Painted Bride\", alongside actors Jeremy Allen White and Mandy Patinkin.\nThe distribution rights to a documentary starring Rossellini, \"A Season with Isabella Rossellini\", were secured by Escapade Media in September 2025. The documentary, directed by Marian Lacombe, sees Rossellini reflecting on her life as a celebrated model as well as her colorful life.\nStage and live performance.\nIn 2004, Rossellini acted in an Off-Broadway production of Terrence McNally's \"The Stendhal Syndrome\", with Richard Thomas.\nRossellini's friend, Carole Bouquet, also a model who later became an actress, suggested that \"Green Porno\" could be transformed into a lecture format with a longer duration. Bouquet then introduced Rossellini to the French filmmaker and screenwriter, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, and they created a 70-minute-long monologue that expands upon the \"Green Porno\" films. The structure of the performance is in accordance with the types of reproductive systems:\nSome animals reproduce with male and female; some animals change sex \u2013 they start female and they end male or vice-versa. Some fish do that. Some animals are hermaphrodites \u2013 they don't need anybody, they have both vaginas and penises. Then we have animals that don't need sex at all, they just clone themselves.\nIn the live show, Rossellini explores the topics of homosexuality (\"I think society has made the mistake of seeing the act of making love or mating as an act of reproduction, when actually it is used for other things, too. Animals use it for social events, bonding, solving conflict and so on.\") and maternal instincts, and has explained that her research has influenced her perspective on societal notions of beauty: \"If you look at nature, there is no perfection. Everything is always evolving and adapting according to whatever the environmental pressure. The more diversity there is, the more things are going to survive.\"\nRossellini debuted the live version of \"Green Porno\" at the Adelaide Festival of Arts on 15 March 2014 and was warmly received by the audience. The show was the first of the 2014 program to sell out. Much of the production and backstage documentary footage was shot and directed by her nephew, Tommaso Rossellini.\nRossellini's \"smallest circus in the world\", a stage play exploring the ability of animals to think, was premiered in May 2018, at the Jerome Robbins Theater of the Baryshnikov Arts Center. The play \"addresses the scientific discoveries about animal minds, intelligence, and emotions. Joined onstage by various animals portrayed by Pan, her trained dog, Rossellini transforms herself into Aristotle, Descartes, B.F. Skinner, Charles Darwin, and more, to deliver a vivid monologue about the brilliance of the animal kingdom\".\nRossellini performed \"Link Link Circus\" (as in Ring Ring) as a benefit for The Gateway Performing Arts Center of Suffolk County, in Bellport, New York, the south shore Long Island village where she is a local organic farmer. \"Link Link Circus\" is performed by Rossellini in a black and red ringmaster's tailcoat, with the assistance of her dog, Peter Pan, who performs a few tricks and is costumed as other animals including a chicken and a dinosaur. In addition to Rossellini and Pan, the production includes puppets, handled by puppeteer Schuyler Beeman, and still photos, home movies, animation and excerpts from her \"Green Porno\" film series projected on a large screen behind the set decorated with Rossellini's childhood toys, including a marionette stage and a toy upright piano, which Rossellini plays in the show. The set was designed by Andy Byers, who is also the costume designer and composer for the show. In promoting the show, which was performed twice at The Gateway, Rossellini appeared in Long Island's \"Newsday\". Proceeds from The Gateway production of \"Link Link Circus\" also benefited The Plaza Cinema &amp; Media Arts Center, a non-profit located near Rossellini's Bellport home in Patchogue, New York.\nRossellini has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney's Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World, most recently appearing in the 2019 and 2022 seasons.\nRossellini is set to premiere a new one-woman show in March 2026. The show is expected to blend performance, personal storytelling, and reflections on art, nature, and identity.\nActivism.\nRossellini is involved in conservation efforts. She is the president and director of the Howard Gilman Foundation \u2013 a leading institution focused on the preservation of wildlife, arts, photography and dance \u2013 and she has been a board member of the Wildlife Conservation Network. She received US$100,000 from Disney to help with her conservation efforts in those two organizations. She has also helped with the Central Park Conservancy, and is a major benefactor of the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society in Bellport, Long Island, where she is a part-time resident.\nRossellini is involved in training guide dogs for the blind. She is a former trustee of the George Eastman House and a 1997 George Eastman Award honoree for her support of film preservation. She is also a National Ambassador for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF.\nPersonal life.\nRossellini holds dual Italian and United States citizenship. She speaks Italian, French and English fluently. She is a naturalized American citizen.\nRossellini married filmmaker Martin Scorsese in 1979. After she and Scorsese divorced in 1982, Rossellini was married to Jon Wiedemann from 1983 to 1986. Rossellini has a daughter, Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann (born 1983), and an adopted son, Roberto (born 1993).\nFilmmaker David Lynch and Rossellini were a couple from 1986 to 1991. She was also engaged to actor Gary Oldman from 1994 to 1996.\nShe has always lived near her twin sister Isotta Ingrid, while growing up in Rome or residing in New York City.\nRossellini raises and trains future guide dogs for the Guide Dog Foundation.\nAwards and recognition.\nAlso in 1997, Rossellini was awarded The George Eastman Award. In 1998, she received an Honourable Mention at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival for her role in the film \"Left Luggage\". In 2013, she was awarded with the Berlinale Camera at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2016, she was granted an honorary doctorate by the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nRossellini has written four books:\nThe third title was published as a written tribute alongside the short film, \"My Dad Is 100 Years Old\", and used the script from the short film as its basis. To accompany the third series of \"Green Porno\", Rossellini produced a multimedia collection that contains a book and DVD, both of which give additional information for the series' third season. These were released in 2008. Further backstage material was released filmed by her nephew, Tommaso.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Modern gaviiformes are found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia (Europe, Asia and debatably Africa), though prehistoric species were more widespread.\nClassification and evolution.\nThere are five living species, and all are placed in the genus \"Gavia\". The loons were formerly often considered to be the most ancient of the northern hemisphere bird families; this idea grew basically out of the perceived similarity of shape and (probably) habits between loons and the entirely unrelated extinct Cretaceous order Hesperornithiformes. In particular \"Enaliornis\", which was apparently an ancestral and plesiomorphic member of that order, was sometimes used to support claims of Albian (Early Cretaceous) Gaviiformes. \nMore recently, it has become clear that the Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes are the most ancient groups of modern birds, and these being distinct by the end of the Albian 100 million years ago (Ma), while just possible, is not at all well-supported. Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both groups were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes or in even older classifications as the Urinatores. The family name Urinatoridae was used for the family Gaviidae. This was derived from Latin \"Urinator\" meaning \"diver\". However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups (grebes and divers) are not that closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong that even the most modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.\nThe Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy still allied the loons with the grebes in its massively polyphyletic \"Ciconiiformes\", and it is almost certain that the relationships of loons lie with \"some\" of the orders placed therein. Namely, other recent authors have considered loons to share a rather close relationship with seabirds such as penguins (Sphenisciformes), tubenoses (Procellariiformes), waders (Charadriiformes) \u2013 and perhaps the newly discovered clade Mirandornithes which unites grebes (Podicipediformes) and their closest living relatives, the flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes). It is perhaps notable that some early penguins had skulls and beaks that were in many aspects similar to those of the known living and fossil Gaviiformes.\nFossil record.\nIn prehistoric times, the loons had a more southerly distribution than today, and their fossils have been found in places such as California, Florida and Italy. The conflicting molecular data regarding their relationships is not much resolved by the fossil record; though they seem to have originated at the end of the Late Cretaceous like their presumed relatives, modern loons are only known with certainty since the Eocene. By that time almost all modern bird orders are at least strongly suspected to have existed \u2013 if not known from unequivocally identified specimens \u2013 anyway.\nThe oldest known stem-gaviiform is \"Nasidytes\" from the Early Eocene aged London Clay of England, dating to around 55 million years ago.\n\"Colymboides\" is widely known from early Priabonian \u2013 about 37 million years ago (Ma) in the Late Eocene \u2013 to Early Miocene (late Burdigalian, less than 20 Ma) limnic and marine rocks of western Eurasia north of the Alpide belt, between the Atlantic and the former Turgai Sea. It is usually placed in the Gaviidae already, but usually in a subfamily Colymboidinae, with the modern-type loons making up the Gaviinae. But the \"Colymboides\" material is generally quite distinct from modern loons, and may actually belong in a now-extinct family of primitive gaviiforms. Furthermore, the supposed genus could well be paraphyletic, so that for example \"Dyspetornis\" \u2013 which is now contained therein \u2013 might have to be separated again. A leg of an undescribed small diver was found in the Late Oligocene deposits at Enspel (Germany); it too may or may not belong to \"Colymboides\". Of the crown genus \"Gavia\", nearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date, and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members of them are rather small (some are smaller than the red-throated loon). Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope's Rule.\nSome older fossils are sometimes assigned to the Gaviiformes. From the Late Cretaceous, the genera \"Lonchodytes\" (Lance Formation, Wyoming) and \"Neogaeornis\" (Quinriquina Formation, Chile) have been described; both are usually allied with orders which are considered related to loons. In particular the latter is still sometimes explicitly proposed as a primitive loon as they both were initially, but other authors consider \"Neogaeornis\" a hesperornithiform; note however that neither Gaviiformes nor Hesperornithiformes are known from the Southern Hemisphere or anywhere near it. \"Lonchodytes\" was more certainly quite close to loons, but probably closer still to some of the loons' relatives. \"Eupterornis\" from the Paleocene of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Vesle (France) has some features reminiscent of loons, but others seem more similar to Charadriiformes such as gulls (Laridae). A piece of a carpometacarpus supposedly from Oligocene rocks near Lusk, Wyoming was described as \"Gaviella pusilla\", but this handbone also shows some similarities to the plotopterids which were flightless wing-propelled divers and if these are apomorphic would make an unconvincing member of the Gaviidae (though it still could be a small-winged gaviiform in a yet-undescribed family \"Gaviellidae\"): while the carpometacarpus in \"Gavia\" is somewhat convergent to that of wing-propelled divers, enabling the wings to be used as rudders for quick underwater turns, \"Colymboides\" still had an unspecialized plesiomorphic hand. \"Parascaniornis\", sometimes allied to the loons by early authors, was eventually determined to be a junior synonym of the hesperornithiform \"Baptornis\". A supposed mid-Eocene diver fossil form Geiseltal (Germany) was erroneously assigned to \"Gavia\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A total of 25 medals (12 silver for winners, 13 bronze for runner-up, none for third) were awarded. The medals were later denoted as 37 modern medals (12 gold, 13 silver, 12 bronze). All of the events except the marathon were held in the Panathinaiko Stadium, which was also the finish for the marathon. Events were held on 6 April, 7 April, 9 April, and 10 April 1896 (all dates are according to the Gregorian calendar). Altogether, 63 athletes, all men, from nine nations competed. This made athletics the most international of the nine sports at the 1896 Games.\nSummary of events.\nThe American team of 11, which featured only one national champion, was dominant, taking 9 of the 12 titles. No world records were set, because few international top competitors had participated. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible.\nThe heats of the 100 metres were the first Olympic event to be conducted, and the winner of the first heat, Francis Lane, can thus be considered the first Olympic winner. The first Olympic champion was crowned in the triple jump, Harvard student James Connolly. Connolly also did well in the other jumping events, placing second in the high jump and third in the long jump.\nMany other athletes were versatile as well. Thomas Burke won both the 100 metres and 400 metres, a feat not since repeated, while London-based Australian Edwin Flack won the 800 and 1500 metres races. Robert Garrett, a Princeton student, won two first and two second places. His first title was in the discus throw, an event originating from the Ancient Olympics, but never before held at an international event. Garrett had attempted to train for the event with a 10 kilogram replica of a discus, but had given up as it was too heavy. When he learned the actual competition discus weighed only 2 kilograms, he entered the event after all, and won it, to the dismay of the Greek public, who considered their throwers \"unbeatable\".\nA second event held for the first time in international competition was the marathon foot race. It was conceived by Michel Br\u00e9al, a friend of Pierre de Coubertin, based on the legend of Pheidippides. This Athenian soldier first completed a two-day run to seek Spartan help against the invading Persians in the Battle of Marathon, and then ran from the town of Marathon to Athens days later to announce the victory, dying as a result of his heroic efforts. The race started in Marathon, and ran for 40 kilometres over dusty roads to Athens. The Greek public, disappointed as there had not yet been a Greek victor in athletics, was overjoyed when it was announced during the race that a Greek runner had taken the lead. When Spiridon Louis, a water carrier from Maroussi, arrived in the stadium he was accompanied by the Greek Crown Prince on his final lap. Louis would never again compete in a race, but his victory made him a national hero.\nThe exploits of Louis, Garrett, Connolly, and Flack would be chronicled in the 1984 NBC miniseries, \"The First Olympics: Athens, 1896\".\nThe day after the official marathon Stamata Revithi ran the 40-kilometer course in 5 hours 30 minutes, finishing outside Panathinaiko Stadium. She was denied entry into the official competition since the 1896 Olympics excluded women from competition.\nSchedule.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Olympic schedule legend/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedal summary.\nThese medals were retroactively assigned by the International Olympic Committee; at the time, winners were given a silver medal and runners-up bronze medals. Athletes coming third received no award.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 63 athletes from 9 nations competed at the Athens Games. Due to the nature of participation at the Games of the time not being fully through National Olympic Committees, there is a lack of clarity on which nations competed. For instance, Olympedia lists 1 athlete from Cyprus and 2 from Smyrna in counting 11 nations, but also notes the participation of \"Cyprus and Smyrna as part of the Greek team\". Further, Chile claims to have had a competitor participate, which would increase the total to 64 athletes from 10 nations, but other sources list Luis Subercaseaux as not having started.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68005", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68005", "title": "Loon", "text": "Family of birds\nLoons (North American English) or divers (British / Irish English) are a group of aquatic birds found in much of North America and northern Eurasia. All living species of loons are members of the genus Gavia, family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes.\nDescription.\nLoons, which are the size of large ducks or small geese, resemble these birds in shape when swimming. Like ducks and geese, but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are connected by webbing. The loons may be confused with the cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), but can be distinguished from them by their distinct call. Cormorants are not-too-distant relatives of loons, and like them are heavy-set birds whose bellies, unlike those of ducks and geese, are submerged when swimming. Loons in flight resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to their bulky bodies. The bird points its head slightly upwards while swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight, the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.\nMale and female loons have identical plumage, which is largely patterned black-and-white in summer, with grey on the head and neck in some species. All have a white belly. This resembles many sea-ducks (Merginae) \u2013 notably the smaller goldeneyes (\"Bucephala\") \u2013 but is distinct from most cormorants, which rarely have white feathers, and if so, usually as large rounded patches rather than delicate patterns. All species of loons have a spear-shaped bill.\nMales are larger on average, but relative size is only apparent when the male and female are together. In winter, plumage is dark grey above, with some indistinct lighter mottling on the wings, and a white chin, throat and underside. The specific species can then be distinguished by certain features, such as the size and colour of the head, neck, back and bill. Reliable identification of loons in winter is often difficult even for experts \u2013 particularly as the smaller immature birds look similar to winter-plumage adults, making size an unreliable means of identification.\nGaviiformes are among the few groups of birds in which the young moult into a second coat of down feathers after shedding the first one, rather than growing juvenile feathers with downy tips that wear off, as is typical in many birds. This trait is also found in tubenoses (Procellariiformes) and penguins (Sphenisciformes), both relatives of the loons.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nLoons are excellent swimmers, using their feet to propel themselves above and under water. However, since their feet are located far back on the body, loons have difficulty walking on land, though they can effectively run short distances to reach water when frightened. Thus, loons avoid coming to land, except for mating and nesting. \nLoons fly strongly, though they have high wing loading (mass to wing area ratio), which complicates takeoff. Indeed, most species must run upwind across the water's surface with wings flapping to generate sufficient lift to take flight. Only the red-throated loon (\"G. stellata\") can take off from land. Once airborne, loons are capable of long flights during migration. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, who have implanted satellite transmitters in some individuals, have recorded daily flights of up to 1078\u00a0km in a 24-hour period, which probably resulted from single movements. North European loons migrate primarily via the South Baltic and directly over land to the Black Sea or Mediterranean. Loons can live as long as 30 years and can hold their breath for as long as 90 seconds while underwater.\nLoons are migratory birds, and in the winter months, they move from their northern freshwater lake nesting habitats to southern marine coastlines. They are well-adapted to this change in salinity, however, because they have special salt glands located directly above their eyes. These glands filter out salts in their blood and flush this salty solution out through their nasal passages, which allows them to immediately consume fish from oceans and drink saltwater after their long migration.\nCommon loons sometimes form social gatherings of several adults in late summer. Studies in North America suggest that these events are attended largely by non-breeding individuals and relate to territory assessment and social familiarity rather than foraging or migration.\nDiet and feeding.\nLoons find their prey by sight. They eat mainly fish, supplemented with amphibians, crustaceans and similar mid-sized aquatic fauna. Specifically, they have been noted to feed on crayfish, frogs, snails, salamanders and leeches. They prefer clear lakes because they can more easily see their prey through the water. The loon uses its pointy bill to stab or grasp prey. They eat vertebrate prey headfirst to facilitate swallowing, and swallow all their prey whole.\nTo help digestion, loons swallow small pebbles from the bottoms of lakes. Similar to grit eaten by chickens, these gastroliths may assist the loon's gizzard in crushing the hard parts of the loon's food, such as the exoskeletons of crustaceans and the bones of frogs and salamanders. The gastroliths may also be involved in stomach cleaning as an aid to regurgitation of indigestible food parts.\nLoons may inadvertently ingest small lead pellets, released by anglers and hunters, that will contribute to lead poisoning and the loon's eventual death. Jurisdictions that have banned the use of lead shot and sinkers include but are not limited to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Michigan, some areas of Massachusetts, Yellowstone National Park, Canada, Great Britain, and Denmark.\nReproduction.\nLoons nest during the summer on freshwater lakes and/or large ponds. Smaller bodies of water (up to 0.5\u00a0km2) will usually only have one pair. Larger lakes may have more than one pair, with each pair occupying a bay or section of the lake. The red-throated loon, however, may nest colonially, several pairs close together, in small Arctic tarns and feed at sea or in larger lakes, ferrying the food in for the young.\nLoons mate on land, often on the future nest site, and build their nests close to the water, preferring sites that are completely surrounded by water, such as islands or emergent vegetation. Loons use a variety of materials to build their nests, including aquatic vegetation, pine needles, leaves, grass, moss and mud. Sometimes, nest material is almost lacking. Both males and females build the nest and incubate jointly for 28 days. If the eggs are lost, the pair may re-nest, usually in a different location. Since the nest is very close to the water, rising water may induce the birds to slowly move the nest upwards, over a metre.\nDespite the roughly equal participation of the sexes in nest building and incubation, analysis has shown clearly that males alone select the location of the nest. This pattern has the important consequence that male loons, but not females, establish significant site-familiarity with their territories that allows them to produce more chicks there over time. Sex-biased site-familiarity might explain, in part, why resident males fight so hard to defend their territories.\nMost clutches consist of two eggs, which are laid in May or June, depending upon latitude. Loon chicks are precocial, able to swim and dive right away, but will often ride on their parents' back during their first two weeks to rest, conserve heat, and avoid predators. Chicks are fed mainly by their parents for about six weeks, but gradually begin to feed themselves over time. By 11 or 12\u00a0weeks, chicks gather almost all of their own food and have begun to fly. In 2019, a necropsy of a bald eagle found floating on a Maine lake (beside the floating body of a loon chick) found that the eagle had been stabbed through the heart by an adult loon's beak.\nBiologists, especially from Chapman University, have extensively studied the mating behaviour of the common loon (\"G. immer\"). Contrary to popular belief, pairs seldom mate for life. Indeed, a typical adult loon is likely to have several mates during its lifetime because of territorial takeover. Each breeding pair must frequently defend its territory against \"floaters\" (territory-less adults) trying to evict at least one owner and seize the breeding site. Territories that have produced chicks in the past year are especially prone to takeovers, because nonbreeding loons use chicks as cues to indicate high-quality territories. One-third of all territorial evictions among males result in the death of the owner; in contrast, female loons usually survive. Birds that are displaced from a territory but survive usually try to re-mate and (re)claim a breeding territory later in life. \nIn 2020, a loon hatched for the first time in over a century in Southeastern Massachusetts at Fall River. The chicks were relocated in 2015 with the hopes of re-establishing breeding and nesting patterns.\nEtymology and taxonomy.\nThe European Anglophone name \"diver\" comes from the bird's habit of catching fish by swimming calmly along the surface and then abruptly plunging into the water. The North American name \"loon\" likely comes from either the Old English word \"lumme\", meaning lummox or awkward person, or the Scandinavian word \"lum\" meaning lame or clumsy. Either way, the name refers to the loon's poor ability to walk on land.\nAnother possible derivation is from the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish word \"lom\" for these birds, which comes from Old Norse \" l\u00f3mr\", possibly cognate with English \"lament\", referring to the characteristic plaintive sound of the loon. \nThe scientific name \"Gavia\" refers to seabirds in general. The scientific name \"Gavia\" was the Latin term for the smew (\"Mergellus albellus\"). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and just happens to be another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish. It is not likely that the ancient Romans had much knowledge of loons, as these are limited to more northern latitudes and since the end of the last glacial period seem to have occurred only as rare winter migrants in the Mediterranean region.\nThe term \"gavia\" was transferred from the ducks to the loons only in the 18th century. Earlier naturalists referred to the loons as \"mergus\" (the Latin term for diving seabirds of all sorts) or \"colymbus\", which became the genus name used in the first modern scientific description of a \"Gavia\" species (by Carl Linnaeus) in 1758. Unfortunately, confusion about whether Linnaeus' \"wastebin genus\" \"Colymbus\" referred to loons or grebes abounded. North American ornithologists used the genus name to refer to grebes, while Europeans used it for loons, following Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Richard Bowdler Sharpe.\nThe International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature tried to settle this issue in 1956 by declaring \"Colymbus\" a suppressed name unfit for further use and establishing \"Gavia\", created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons. However, the situation was not completely resolved even then, and the following year the ICZN had to act again to prevent Louis Pierre Vieillot's 1818 almost-forgotten family name Urinatoridae from overruling the much younger Gaviidae. Some eminent ornithologists such as Pierce Brodkorb tried to keep the debate alive, but the ICZN's solution has been satisfactory.\nSystematics and evolution.\nAll living species are placed in the genus \"Gavia\". It has been suggested that the genus \"Gavia\" originated in Europe during the Paleogene. The earliest species, \"G. egeriana\", was found in early Miocene deposits in Dolnice in the Czech Republic. During the remainder of the Miocene, \"Gavia\" managed to disperse into North America via the Atlantic coastlines, eventually making their way to the continent's Pacific coastlines by the Late Miocene. Study of the interrelationships of the extant species has found that the red-throated loons are the most basal of the five species.\nFossil record.\nNearly ten prehistoric species have been named to date in the genus \"Gavia\", and about as many undescribed ones await further study. The genus is known from the Early Miocene onwards, and the oldest members are rather small (some are smaller than the red-throated loon). Throughout the late Neogene, the genus by and large follows Cope's Rule (that population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time). \nList of fossil \"Gavia\" species\nList of fossil \"Gavia\" specimens\n\"\"Gavia\" portisi\" from the Late Pliocene of Orciano Pisano, Italy, is known from a cervical vertebra that may or may not have been from a loon. If so, it was from a bird slightly smaller than the common loon. Older authors were quite sure the bone was indeed from a \"Gavia\" and even considered \"G. concinna\" a possibly junior synonym of it. This is now regarded as rather unlikely due to the quite distinct range and age. The Early Pliocene \"Gavia\" skull from Empoli (Italy) was referred to \"G. concinna\", and thus could conceivably have been of \"\"G.\" portisi\" if that was indeed a loon. The holotype vertebra may now be lost, which would make \"\"G.\" portisi\" a \"nomen dubium\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of 347,342 as of 2024, it is the 11th-largest city in Spain, and the largest in northern Spain. The Bilbao metropolitan area has 1,037,847 inhabitants, making it the most populous metropolitan area in northern Spain. The comarca of Greater Bilbao is the fifth-largest urban area in Spain. Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the Greater Basque region.\nBilbao is located in the north-central part of Spain, some south of the Bay of Biscay, where the economic social development is located, where the estuary of Bilbao is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small mountain ranges with an average elevation of . Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by Iberian standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.\nAfter its foundation in the late 13th century by Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, head of the powerful Haro family, Bilbao was one of the commercial hubs of the Basque Country that enjoyed significant importance in the Crown of Castile. This was due to its thriving port activity based on the export of wool and iron commodities extracted from the Biscayan quarries to all over Europe.\nThroughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind Barcelona. At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities. Nowadays, Bilbao is a vigorous service city that is experiencing an ongoing social, economic, and aesthetic revitalisation process, started by the iconic Bilbao Guggenheim Museum, and continued by infrastructure investments, such as the airport terminal, the rapid transit system, the tram line, the Azkuna Zentroa, and the currently under development Abandoibarra and Zorrozaurre renewal projects.\nBilbao is also home to football team Athletic Club, a significant symbol for Basque nationalism due to its promotion of only Basque players and being one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history.\nOn 19 May 2010, the city of Bilbao was recognised with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, awarded by the city state of Singapore. Considered the Nobel Prize for urbanism, it was handed out on 29 June 2010. On 7 January 2013, its mayor, I\u00f1aki Azkuna, received the 2012 World Mayor Prize awarded every two years by the British foundation The City Mayors Foundation, in recognition of the urban transformation experienced by the Biscayan capital since the 1990s. On 8 November 2017, Bilbao was chosen the Best European City 2018 at The Urbanism Awards 2018, awarded by the international organisation The Academy of Urbanism.\nToponymy and symbols.\nThe official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. Euskaltzaindia, the official regulatory institution of the Basque language, has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, \"Bilbao\" and \"Bilbo\", the historical name is \"Bilbo\", while \"Bilbao\" is the official name. Although the term \"Bilbo\" does not appear in old documents, in the play \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" by William Shakespeare, there is a reference to swords presumably made of Biscayan iron which he calls \"bilboes\", suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.\nThere is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century, the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja (\"Old Bilbao\"). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day. One possible origin was suggested by the engineer Evaristo de Churruca. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: \"Bil-Ibaia-Bao\". The historian Jos\u00e9 Tussel G\u00f3mez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words \"bello vado\", beautiful ford. On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present Casco Viejo is located, would be called \"billa\", which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now Bilbao La Vieja is located, would be called \"vaho\", Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao, which was also written as \"Bilvao\" and \"Biluao\", as documented in its municipal charter. An \"-ao\" ending is also present in nearby Sestao and Ugao, that could be explained from Basque \"aho\", \"mouth\".\nDemonym.\nThe demonym is \"bilba\u00edno, -a\"\", although the popular pronunciation \"bilbaino/a\" (sic) is also frequent. In Basque, it is \"bilbotar\", which is sometimes also used in Spanish, generally within the Basque Country. \nThe village is affectionately known by its inhabitants as the \"\" meaning \"hole\", since it is surrounded by mountains. The nickname \"botxero\" is derived from this nickname. Another nickname that Bilbao receives is that of \"chimbos\", which comes from birds that were hunted in large numbers in these places during the 19th century.\nThe titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao's traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.\nTitles.\nBilbao holds the historic category of township (\"villa\"), with the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten\" (\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta\"). It was the Catholic Monarchs who awarded the title \"Noble Town\" (\"Noble Villa\") on 20 September 1475. Philip III of Spain, via a letter in 1603 awarded the town the titles of \"Very noble and very loyal\". After the siege of Bilbao, during the First Carlist War, on 25 December 1836, the title of \"Unbeaten\" was added.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms is emblazoned as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a silver field a bridge with two eyes, added to the church of San Ant\u00f3n of its colour and to its sinister two sable wolves walking and in stick, on waves of azure and silver.It has its origins in the 14th century and has remained with the same symbols since then, although its presentation has been adapted according to the destiny of the coat of arms. The durability of this shield is due to the representativeness of the symbols that appear. The navigable estuary and the stone bridge, prior to the founding of the town.\u00a0 The wolves, typical of the coat of arms of the founder of the town in 1300, Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, son of Diego Lope D\u00edaz de Haro (Lope comes from the Latin Lupus (wolf)) were added by the town council to represent the founder. Later, the fortress or castle that guarded the bridge was added and, when it was demolished in 1366, it was replaced by the temple of San Ant\u00f3n that was built in its place and inaugurated in 1433.\nFlag.\nThe flag that represents the city is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colours red and white are the historical ones of the villa.\nThe Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the \" Bilbao Consulate \" was wearing was white with a red Cross of Burgundy. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one \" Bilbao Consulate \" are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.\nThe definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town's representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.\nAlthough it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about \"the use of the crimson colour of the Lordship of Biscay, or of the cross of Saint Andrew\" but without reaching any resolution to the effect.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nRemains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount Malmas\u00edn, dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC. Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as \"Amanun Portus\", cited by Pliny the Elder, or with \"Flaviobriga\", by Ptolemy.\nMedieval Bilbao.\nAncient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the Church of San Ant\u00f3n. Bilbao was founded at the very end of the thirteen century, kick-starting a period in the fourteenth century, during which approximately three-quarters of the Biscayan cities were developed, among them Portugalete in 1323, Ondarroa in 1327, Lekeitio in 1335, and Mungia and Larrabetzu in 1376. Diego L\u00f3pez V de Haro, then third Lord of Biscay, founded Bilbao through a municipal charter dated in Valladolid on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King Ferdinand IV of Castile in Burgos, on 4 January 1301. Diego L\u00f3pez established the new town on the right bank of the Nervi\u00f3n river, on the grounds of the \"elizate\" of Bego\u00f1a and granted it the \"fuero\" of Logro\u00f1o, a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.\nIn 1310 Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz I de Haro, niece of Diego L\u00f3pez V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from Castile towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from Ordu\u00f1a to Bermeo, at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the San Ant\u00f3n Bridge in Bilbao instead of the pass in Etxebarri, as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory. In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and Las Arenas. In 1372, John I of Castile strengthened even more the city's position by naming Bilbao a free port and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron. This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with Flanders and Great Britain.\nIn 1443 the Church of Saint Anthony the Great was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old \"alc\u00e1zar\". Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen Isabella I of Castile traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of Biscay. Her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon had already done so in 1476 in Gernika.\nModern age.\nOn 21 June 1511, Queen Joanna of Castile ordered the creation of the Consulate of the Sea of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate's control, the port of Bilbao became one of the most important of the kingdom. The first printing-press was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the Basque language was edited, entitled \"Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence\" by Dr. Betolaza.\nIn 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of Biscay, a title previously held by Bermeo. Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the \"\"Machinada\" of the salt\". The revolt ended with the execution of several of its leaders. The city had seen a continuous increase of its wealth, especially after the discovery of extensive iron deposits in the surrounding mountains, and by the end of the century it managed to overcome the economic crises that affected the rest of the kingdom, thanks in part to the increased trading of wool (which now used the port of Bilbao instead of the one in Santander), and to the iron ore and its commerce with England and the Netherlands.\nContemporary Bilbao.\nNapoleonic invasion and Carlist wars.\nThe French invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against Napoleonic rule took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the Battle of Bail\u00e9n. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a on 16 August. Beginning in February 1810, the city was under the command of Pierre Thouvenot, general of the French army and Baron of the Empire, who had become the head of the Military Government of \"Vizcaya\", which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France, but the Peninsular War and ultimately the Battle of Vitoria made those plans impossible.\nThe Basque Country was one of the main sites of battles during the First Carlist War, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent Maria Christina, known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother Carlos of Borb\u00f3n, known as Carlists. The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui tried to take the city during the siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near Bego\u00f1a and died some time after in the town of Zegama. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general Baldomero Espartero defeated the Carlists in the Battle of Luchana. The city was untouched by the Second Carlist War, which took place mostly in Catalonia, but was again an important scenario during the Third Carlist War; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.\nDespite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the BBVA) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the City Hall building, the Basurto Hospital and the Arriaga Theatre. The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably Basque nationalism under Sabino Arana, which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the Basque Nationalist Party.\nCivil war and Francoist dictatorship.\nThe Spanish Civil War in Bilbao started with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the Republican forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with multiple bombings by Nationalist bombers. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city. In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.\nWith the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local airport. Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by Francoism. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides. It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the \"Euskalduna\" shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the separatist organisation ETA was created from Basque nationalist movements. During the 1960s the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the University of Bilbao, the first public university, was established. It would later be integrated into the University of the Basque Country.\nDemocracy and urban renewal.\nAfter the end of Francoist Spain and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, in a process known in Spain as the transition, Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time Basque nationalists rose to power. With the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1979, Vitoria-Gasteiz was elected the seat of the government and therefore the \"de facto\" capital of the Basque Autonomous Community, although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labour demands and the arrival of cheap labour from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.\nOn 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as \"Aste Nagusia\", the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two people and causing important destructions in the city's infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million pesetas (around \u20ac360 million)\nSince the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and urban renewal, starting with the opening of the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum (the so-called \"Guggenheim effect\"), and continuing with the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, Santiago Calatrava's Zubizuri, the metro network by Norman Foster, the tram, the Iberdrola Tower and the Zorrozaurre development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metr\u00f3poli-30 and Bilbao R\u00eda 2000 were created to monitor these projects.\nGeography.\nBilbao is located near the northern edge of the Iberian Peninsula, about from the Bay of Biscay. It covers an area of , of which are urban and the remaining consist of the surrounding mountains. The official average altitude is , although there are measurements between and . It is also the core of the \"comarca\" of Greater Bilbao. It is surrounded by the municipalities of Derio, Etxebarri, Galdakao, Loiu, Sondika, and Zamudio to the north; Arrigorriaga and Basauri to the west; Alonsotegi to the south; and Barakaldo and Erandio to the east.\nBilbao is located on the Basque threshold, the range between the larger Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. The soil is predominantly composed of mesozoic materials (limestone, sandstone, and marl) sedimented over a primitive paleozoic base. The relief of the province is dominated by NW-SE and WNW-ESE oriented folds. The main fold is the anticline of Bilbao which runs from the municipality of Elorrio to Galdames. Inside Bilbao there are two secondary folds, one in the northeast, composed of Mounts Artxanda, Avril, Banderas, Pikota, San Bernab\u00e9, and Cabras; and other in the south, composed of Mounts Kobetas, Restaleku, Pagasarri and Arraiz. The highest point in the municipality is Mount Ganeta, of , followed by Mount Pagasarri, of , both on the border with Alonsotegi.\nHydrology.\nThe main river system of Bilbao is also the hydrological artery of Biscay. The rivers Nervi\u00f3n and Ibaizabal converge in Basauri and form an estuary named variously \"estuary of Bilbao\", \"of the Nervi\u00f3n\", \"of the Ibaizabal\", or \"of the Nervi\u00f3n-Ibaizabal\". The estuary runs for and with a low flow (with an average of per second). Its main tributary is the river Cadagua, which rises in the Mena valley and has a basin of , mostly lying in the neighbouring province of Burgos. This river is also the natural border between Bilbao and Barakaldo.\nThe river has frequently suffered from human intervention, as seen in the dredging of its bottom, the building of docks on both banks and especially in the Deusto canal, an artificial waterway dug between 1950 and 1968 in the district of Deusto as a lateral canal, with the aim of facilitating navigation, sparing ships from the natural curves of the estuary. The project was stopped with left to complete, and it was decided to leave it as a dock. However, in 2007, a plan was approved to continue the canal and form the island of Zorrozaurre. This human intervention has also brought negative results in the quality of the water, after decades of toxic waste dumping causing a situation of anoxia (lack of oxygen), which almost eliminated the entire fauna and flora. However, in recent years this situation is being reversed, thanks to a dumping ban and natural regeneration. now it is possible to observe algae, tonguefishes, crabs, and seabirds, as well as occasional bathers in the summer months.\nThe estuary is also a natural border for several neighbourhoods and districts within the borough. Entering the municipality from the west it separates the districts of Bego\u00f1a and Ibaiondo, then Abando and Uribarri and lastly Deusto and Basurto-Zorroza.\nClimate.\nIts proximity to the Bay of Biscay gives Bilbao an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. Sleet is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months. Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of . There is also a drying trend in summer with only around of rainfall in July \u2013 but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.\nThe proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between .\nExtreme record observations in Bilbao are maximum (on 23 August 2023) and minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was on 26 August 1983 when severe flooding was caused by the Nervi\u00f3n river.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;According to INE, the population of Bilbao is 347,342 people as of 2024, distributed on a land area of , making Bilbao the largest city by population of the Basque Autonomous Community and of the Basque Country as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the Bilbao metropolitan area, with a population of 1,037,847 people.\nThe first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550. It is known that in 1530 Biscay had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by plagues that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564\u201368, and 1597\u20131601, the last being especially devastating. This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the Txorierri valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.\nSpanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by the Basque language. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak \"some Basque\", while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.\nMigration.\nOut of the 355,731 people residing in Bilbao in 2009, only 114,220 (32.1%) were born inside the municipality. Of the remainder, 114,908 were born in other Biscayan towns, while 9,545 were born in the other two Basque provinces, and 85,789 came from the rest of Spain (mainly Castile-Le\u00f3n and Galicia).\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population of the city is 56,629, equal to 16.3% of the total population. As of 2007, here are 127 different nationalities registered in Bilbao, although 60 of them represent fewer than 10 people each. As of 2024, the largest foreign communities are Colombians and Moroccans, with 9,743 and 5,196 respectively. Other nationalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants are Bolivians (4,309), Venezuelans (4,244), Nicaraguans (3,645), Paraguayans (2,657), Ecuadorians (1,939) and Romanians (1,797).\nGovernment.\nThe city of Bilbao is the capital of the province of Biscay and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the autonomous and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the Basque autonomous government, each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the Government of Spain has the official Government Subdelegation in the city.\nMunicipal government.\nBilbao is a municipality and has a mayor-council government system. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by universal suffrage and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative. The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 councillors. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the European Union. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.\nSince 1892 the seat of the government has been the Bilbao City Hall, located on the centric Ernesto Erkoreka Plaza and by the Estuary of Bilbao. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the San Ant\u00f3n Church but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaqu\u00edn Rucoba in Baroque style and was built in the former site of the San Agust\u00edn Monastery, which was destroyed during the First Carlist War. Since the Spanish transition to democracy, the city has been governed by the Basque Nationalist Party, often with support of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. I\u00f1aki Azkuna served as mayor from 1999 until his passing in 2014, when he was replaced by Ibon Areso. Azkuna was awarded the World Mayor prize in 2012. Since the 2019 municipal election, the councillors of the plenum have the following political distribution: 14 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party, 5 seats for the Socialist Party of the Basque Country, 4 seats for the EH Bildu coalition, 3 seats for Udalberri and 3 seats for the People's Party. The mayor is Juan Mari Aburto, chosen with 19 votes from the Basque Nationalist Party and the Socialist party.\nIn 2008 and 2010, Bilbao won the Municipal Transparency Prize, awarded by the Spanish division of Transparency International. In 2009 it came second, after Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e9s.\nDistricts.\nThe municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: \"barrutia\") which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: \"auzoa\"). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and elizates that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as Bilbao la Vieja. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of Bego\u00f1a and the river side of Uribarri. In the 19th century the merge of Abando into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the Mount Cobetas, such as Errekalde and Basurto. Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Bego\u00f1a and Deusto. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of slums, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga in the decade of 1990.\nEconomy.\nThe Bilbao metropolitan area comprises about 47% of the total population of the Basque autonomous community, out of which a 15% is registered in the municipality of Bilbao. The \"comarca\" of Greater Bilbao, in which the city occupies a central position, has a GDP per capita of \u20ac30,860, higher than the Spanish and European Union averages. The Bilbao metropolitan area has a nominal GDP amounting to $36,9\u00a0billion. Bilbao has been the economic centre of the Basque autonomous community since the original establishment of the Consulate of the Sea in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in Castilian products on the town's port. It was in the 19th century when the city experienced its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and siderurgy, both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.\nBanking.\nBanking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: \"Banco de Bilbao\") in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: \"Banco de Vizcaya\") in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the BBVA. The savings banks that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: \"Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao\") in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: \"Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya\") in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa (BBK), which would merge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities (Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form Kutxabank. There is also the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Bilbao and the Stock Exchange Market of Bilbao, founded in 1890.\nPort.\nThe historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 19th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at the mouth of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of Santurtzi. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called \"the super-port\", led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city, with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.\nThe port of Bilbao is a first-class commercial port and is among the top five of Spain. Over 200 regular maritime services link Bilbao with 500 ports worldwide. At the close of 2009 cargo movements amounted to 31.6\u00a0million tonnes, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries being the main markets. In the first semester of 2008, it received over 67,000 passengers and 2,770 ships. This activity contributed \u20ac419 million to the Basque GDP and maintains almost 10,000 jobs.\nMining and ironworks.\nIron is the main and most abundant raw material found in Biscay, and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main primary activity in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe. It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city's good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay. Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.\nTourism.\nThe first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of Las Arenas, in the municipality of Getxo in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.\nThe real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018. The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists. Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total Basque Country visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking San Sebasti\u00e1n. The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from Madrid and Catalonia. International travellers are predominantly French, crossing the border just to the east. The others arrive from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. Tourism generates about \u20ac300 million yearly for the Biscayan GDP. Bilbao also draws business tourism, having been equipped with facilities like the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall, and the Bilbao Exhibition Centre, in nearby Barakaldo.\nStock exchange.\nPlans to create a stock exchange market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890. Bilbao's institution is one of the country's four regional stock exchanges, joining Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia as Spain's commercial centres. It is owned by Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles.\nCityscape.\nUrban planning.\nIn its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (\"Somera\", \"Artecalle\", and \"Tender\u00eda\") surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small hermitage dedicated to the Apostle Saint James (the current St. James' Cathedral), which pilgrims visited on their way to Santiago de Compostela. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original \"Zazpikaleak\" or \"Seven Streets\". In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.\nIn 1861, engineer Amado L\u00e1zaro projected an \"ensanche\" inside the then-municipality of Abando with wide avenues and regular buildings, that took into account the hygienic ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on Barcelona's \"Eixample\", designed by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0. However, the project was dropped by the Bilbao City Council after considering it \"utopian and excessive\" because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, L\u00e1zaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.\nThe next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital annexed (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new \"ensanche\" project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Ach\u00facarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike L\u00e1zaro's, this project was significantly smaller, compassing against the original . It also featured a not so strict grid pattern, a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.\nBy 1925, the municipalities of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a, as well as part of Erandio were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of Loiu, Sondika, Derio, and Zamudio. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with . However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Bego\u00f1a regained their independence on 1 January 1983.\nOn 18 May 2010, the government of Singapore awarded Bilbao the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize, at the World Cities Summit 2010. It is considered the Pritzker of urbanism.\nArchitecture.\nBilbao's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from gothic, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and contemporary architecture. The Old Town features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the St. James' Cathedral or the Church of San Ant\u00f3n, included in the borough's coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a pedestrian zone during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the Basilica of Bego\u00f1a, dedicated to the patron saint of the province, Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a.\nSeventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town's boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the Zubizuri (Basque for \"white bridge\"), a pedestrian footbridge designed by Santiago Calatrava opened in 1997, and the Princes of Spain Bridge, also known as \"La Salve\", a suspension bridge opened in 1972 and redesigned by French conceptual artist Daniel Buren in 2007. The Deusto Bridge is a bascule bridge opened in 1936 and modelled after the Michigan Avenue Bridge, in Chicago. Between 1890 and 1893 the first transporter bridge (\"Puente Colgante\") in the world on the Nervion river, between Portugalete and Getxo, was built by Alberto Palacio (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.\nSince the deindustrialisation process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world's most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the Guggenheim Museum, located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse. The building, designed by Frank Gehry and inaugurated in October 1997, is considered among architecture experts as one of the most important structures of the last 30 years, and a masterpiece by itself. The museum houses part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation modern art collection. Another example is the Azkuna Zentroa, a wine warehouse built in 1909 and completely redesigned in 2010 by French designer Philippe Starck into a multi-purpose venue that consists of a cinema multiplex, a fitness centre, a library, and a restaurant, among other spaces. The Abandoibarra area is also being renovated, and it features not only the Guggenheim Museum, but also Arata Isozaki's tower complex, the Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall and the Iberdrola Tower, designed by Argentine architect C\u00e9sar Pelli which is, since its completion in 2011, the Basque Country's tallest skyscraper, high. Zorrozaurre is the next area to be redeveloped, following a 2007 master plan designed by Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. This peninsula was transformed into a island and will feature residential and commercial buildings, as well as the new BBK seat.\nParks and gardens.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], Bilbao has 18 public parks inside its limits, totalling of green spaces. Furthermore its green belt has a total area of , of which are urbanized. The largest parks are Mount Cobetas, of , and Larreagaburu, of , both located on the outskirts.\nThe Do\u00f1a Casilda Iturrizar Park is located in the district of Abando, near the town centre and covers an area of . It is named after a local benefactress who donated the grounds to the borough. It is an English-style garden designed by Ricardo Bastida and opened to the public in 1907. It features a dancing water fountain surrounded by a pergola, and a pond with many species of ducks, geese and swans, which gives the park the alternate name of \"Ducks' Park\", as known locally. In recent years, it was expanded to be connected with the Abandoibarra area. In Ibaiondo, the Etxeberria Park was built in the 1980s in the place where a steel mill previously stood. The original chimney was maintained as a homage of its industrial past. It covers an area of , on a sloped terrain that overlooks the Old Town. Other relevant public spaces inside the city include the Europa Park, the Miribilla Park, or the Memorial Walkway, a long walkway, with high lamps, located in the left bank of the estuary and that connects the main sights.\nMount Artxanda is easily accessible from the town centre by a funicular. There is a recreational area at the summit, with restaurants, a sports complex and a balcony with panoramic views. In the south, Mount Pagasarri receives hundreds of hikers every weekend since the 1870s, who seek its natural wonders. Its environment is officially protected since 2007.\nCulture.\nBilbao was appointed a \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in 2014 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.\nTheatres.\nThe main hall of the city is the Arriaga Theatre, reopened in 1985 as a municipal venue with a varied repertoire that includes dancing, opera, live music and theatre. Also very active are the Campos El\u00edseos Theatre and the Euskalduna Concert Hall. Other important venues include La Fundici\u00f3n, dedicated to contemporary dances and theatre; the Pabell\u00f3n 6, the Sala BBK and the Azkuna Zentroa.\nMuseums.\nBilbao has more than a dozen museums covering a range of fields including art, science, and sport, which have played a central role in Bilbao being named one of the most creative cities in the world.\nThe Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was inaugurated on 19 October 1997 and is work of the Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The museum's permanent collection is centred in the visual arts of the second half of the 20th century and the present, with relevant artworks from Richard Serra and Jeff Koons, although including as well temporary exhibitions with a more varied nature, like Russian art or engravings from Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nAnother important museum is the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, first established in 1908 and housing a notable collection of Spanish and European work from the 12th century to present times. The collection from before the 20th century is centred mainly around Spanish and Flemish artists such as El Greco, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, Francisco Goya and Anthony van Dyck. The museum also holds one of the best collections of Basque art, with works from the 19th century to present times. It has an eye-catching collection of avant-garde art, from the Post-Impressionism of Paul Gauguin to pop art and the expressionism of Francis Bacon.\nThe Basque Museum showcases Basque archaeology and ethnography, and holds frequent exhibitions on Basque history. The museum building itself is part of the heritage listing \"Conjunto hist\u00f3rico\". The city also has several specialised museums, like the Maritime Museum Estuary of Bilbao (\"Bilboko Itsasadarra Itsas Museoa\"), located next to the Estuary of Bilbao, which holds ships and other collection related to the region's fishing and shipbuilding culture, being particularly relevant the \"Carola\" crane, last remaining element of the Euskalduna shipyard that existed where the museum now stands.\nOther relevant museums are the Biscayan Archeological Museum (\"Arkeologi Museoa\") which holds important collections related to the region's prehistory, and the Diocesan Museum of Religious Art (\"Eleiz Museoa\"), both located in the Casco Viejo quarter.\nMusic.\nThe Euskalduna Concert Hall is home to frequent musical performances and it is home of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra (\"Bilbao Orkestra Sinfonikoa\") and the opera season programmed by the ABAO (Bilbao Association of Friends of the Opera). The Arriaga Theatre is frequently the host of numerous musical events, other notable stages include the Philharmonic Society of Bilbao (chamber music) and Bilborock (pop and rock music). The city hosts many different musical festivities, often funded by the city hall. Due to its scope, it is especially relevant the Bilbao BBK Live festival, which has been celebrated every year since 2006 and focuses on Basque, Spanish and international pop and rock music. Since the opening of the new San Mam\u00e9s Stadium in 2013, it has been often used as an open-air concert venue, the first ever concert being one from the American band Guns N' Roses in 2017. Other relevant music festivals include the \"Bilbao Distrito Jazz\" and the \"Bilbao Ars Sacrum\", the latter dedicated to religious music.\nBilbao is the birthplace of famous composer Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Arriaga, who lived his formative years in the city before moving to Paris at age 15. Also native from Bilbao were the soprano singer Josefa Cruz de Gassier and Natividad \u00c1lvarez, nicknamed \"Nati, la bilbainita\" (Spanish for \"Nati, the little one from Bilbao\") a dancer and castanets player who achieved national fame in the early 20th century. Also relevant is the Bilbao Choir Society (\"Bilboko Koral Elkartea\"), established in 1866. Important musical bands coming from the city include rock band \"Fito &amp; Fitipaldis\", Basque folk band \"Oskorri\" and folk-pop band \"Mocedades\".\nBilbao hosted the 2018 MTV Europe Music Awards.\nFestivals and events.\nBilbao hosts several regular festivals and events. The most relevant is the Big Week of the city (\"Aste Nagusia\"), celebrated annually since 1978 and lasting nine days. It is the city's main festival, attracting over 1,500,000 people every year. The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, Basque rural sports and bullfighting, as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the \"chupinazo\" or \"txupinazo\", which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities' herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the \"txosnas\", where the different \"konpartsak\" are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is \"Marijaia\", a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.\nBeyond the main festivities of the \"Aste Nagusia\", the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as Saint Agatha on 5 February, the celebrations of Our Lady of Bego\u00f1a on 11 October, the Day of Thomas the Apostle on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centred around the figure of Olentzero. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the \"Fiestas del Carmen\" in Santutxu and Indautxu, \"Fiestas Santiago\" in Bilbao la Vieja, \"Fiestas San Ignacio\" in San Inazio and \"Fiestas San Roque\" in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.\nThe city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centred exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.\nCuisine.\nTraditional Bilbao dishes are centred around products from the sea and the estuary, such as eels and cod. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of Biscay, including dishes such as \"bacalao al pil pil\" (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), \"bacalao a la vizca\u00edna\" (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of \"choricero\" peppers and onions), \"merluza en salsa verde\" (hake fish with green sauce), \"chipirones en su tinta\" (squid served with its own ink), \"morros a la vizca\u00edna\" (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), \"revuelto de perretxikos\" (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as \"canutillos de Bilbao\" (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), \"Pantxineta\" (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), rice cakes and \"bollos de mantequilla\" (butter buns).\nBilbao, as other Basque cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the \"pintxos\", which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include \"rabas\" (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), Spanish omelette (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), \"\" (stuffed mushrooms), \"tri\u00e1ngulos\" (Bilbao-style sandwiches), \"gildas\" (one or more olives, a \"guindilla\" pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).\nAs for beverages, typical from the region is the \"txakoli\", a white wine usually drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif. Biscayan \"txakoli\" (\"Bizkaiko Txakolina\") is a protected for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are cider, \"patxaran\" (sloe-flavoured liqueur) and \"Rioja\" wine.\nThere are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the Casco Viejo quarter. \"Txokos\" are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.\nLanguage.\nThe Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the Basque language, which is local to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as Bermeo or Lekeitio. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a figure of 37% in 2001. More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Bego\u00f1a and Abando.\nAccording to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks Basque fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.\nTransport.\nRoads and highways.\nBilbao is a relevant transport hub for northern Spain. Bilbao is connected to three major motorways and a series of minor roads of national and provincial level. The city lies on two international roads, the European route E70 that follows the coast of the Bay of Biscay and the cities of Santander and Gij\u00f3n to the west and with Eibar, San Sebasti\u00e1n and Bordeaux to the east. The European route E80 connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including Burgos and Salamanca and continuing to Lisbon, and Toulouse to the north. The AP-68 motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with Vitoria-Gasteiz, Logro\u00f1o and ending in Zaragoza.\nThe city is connected with the regions of Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia via the A-8 motorway and with Durango, Eibar, San Sebasti\u00e1n and the French border via the AP-8 motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in Miranda de Ebro with the A-1 to Madrid and in Zaragoza with the AP-2 to Barcelona.\nMinor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road N-634 which connects San Sebasti\u00e1n with Santiago de Compostela and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with Bermeo, while the BI-626 joins the city with Balmaseda. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.\nThe city's main arteries the Gran V\u00eda de Don Diego L\u00f3pez de Haro, which crosses the financial and business district of Abando and connecting it with the Casco Viejo to the east and the San Mam\u00e9s area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonom\u00eda Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the Estuary of Bilbao and the Kadagua river, including the La Salve and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the Mount Artxanda.\nAirports.\nBilbao is served by the Bilbao Airport (BIO), the busiest terminal in the Basque Country and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4\u00a0million passengers in 2018. It is located north of the borough, between the municipalities of Loiu and Sondika. 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including Iberia, Lufthansa, and TAP Portugal. Top destinations include London, Frankfurt, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, M\u00e1laga, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. It opened to the public in September 1948, with a regular flight to Madrid. On 19 November 2000, a new terminal building was opened, designed by Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava. In February 2009, a project was approved to expand the current building to double its capacity. Although originally expected to be completed by 2014, the 2008 financial crisis and the decrease of passenger traffic delayed it to at least 2019. No work has begun as of 2018.\nSome low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair, also use the Vitoria Airport (VIT) located in Foronda located 59\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) south of the city.\nRailways.\nLong-distance rail lines connect Bilbao with Madrid, Barcelona and other destinations in northern Spain. The city has three main railway stations: the Bilbao-Abando and Bilbao-Concordia railway stations are owned by Adif and operated by the Spanish railways Renfe, whereas the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station is owned by the Basque railway network ETS and operated by Euskotren and Metro Bilbao, serving short-distance local destinations.\nThe Bilbao-Abando station is the main railway station of the city, with Renfe running Iberian-gauge long-distance Alvia trains to Madrid and Barcelona, as well as Intercity services to Miranda de Ebro with connections possible to A Coru\u00f1a and Hendaye. During the summer there are special trains to M\u00e1laga. The station will be connected to the Basque Y high-speed train network around 2038, allowing for high speed AVE trains to operate between the Basque capitals and also to Madrid and other Spanish cities in the future. The arrival of the new high speed services will involve the creation of a completely new underground station that will replace the current infrastructure and merge Abando and Concordia into one single station. The construction is expected to begin in 2027.\nBilbao-Concordia station is located in close vicinity to Bilbao-Abando, and hosts the narrow-gauge railway services ran by Renfe. Renfe runs some regional trains to the cities of Santander and Le\u00f3n. Euskotren Trena runs regular commuter and regional services from the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station to Durango, Bermeo, Eibar and San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nPublic transport.\nPublic transport by rail and bus is organised by the \"Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa\" (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the Barik card, a form of electronic ticket valid across almost all public transport systems of the Bilbao metropolitan area and Biscay province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.\nThe mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. The Bilbao metro, established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections (Line 1 and Line 2). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in Etxebarri in the south all the way to Plentzia and Santurtzi by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and has since been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by Norman Foster. Line 3 of the metro is operated by Euskotren Trena, which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with Lezama and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the airport in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.\nRenfe operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro under the Cercan\u00edas brand and are collectively known as \"Cercan\u00edas Bilbao\". The four lines operated under the Cercan\u00edas name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as Muskiz or even outside of the Biscay province, like Amurrio. The four lines start in either the Bilbao-Abando or the Bilbao-Concordia railway stations.\nEuskotren also operates a tramway line under the brand Euskotren Tranbia. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the Bilbao-Atxuri Station and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mam\u00e9s football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.\nThe gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand Bilbobus and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as \"Gautxori\" (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The BizkaiBus network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in Biscay and some in \u00c1lava.\nA Brittany Ferries ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to Portsmouth (UK). MV Cap Finist\u00e8re ferry departs from the port of Bilbao, north west of the town centre. A service operated by Acciona Trasmediterranea served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. P&amp;O Ferries operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the Pride of Bilbao.\nPublic transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 minutes. Three percent of public transit passengers ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 minutes, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 10% travel more than in a single direction.\nInfrastructure.\nHealthcare.\nThe public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (\"Osakidetza\"), which has a network of medical centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the Basurto-Zorroza district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century. Its design was based on the Eppendorf Hospital of Hamburg, in (Germany), one of the most modern at the time. In 2008 the hospital was named the best hospital in customer support in Spain.\nHowever, the two largest hospitals that provide healthcare services to the inhabitants of the city are located outside of the city limits: the University Hospital of Gurutzeta/Cruces in neighbouring Barakaldo and the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in Galdakao. Other minor public hospitals located in the city include the Santa Marina Hospital and the Hospital of Urduliz, located in the metropolitan area.\nUtilities.\nThe headquarters of \"Iberdrola\", a multinational electric utility company are located in Bilbao. The company was created in 1992 after the merging of \"Iberduero\" and \"Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola\" and it is in charge of production and distribution of electricity. There are two thermal power stations located in the city's surroundings, one in Santurtzi and the other in Zierbena. The electricity produced in both these stations is then transferred to the electrical substation of G\u00fce\u00f1es by the company \"Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a\", which is the company responsible of moving electricity from the production stations to the final consumers. There is a combined cycle power station in the municipality of Amorebieta called \"Bizkaia Energia\", whose energy is transferred to the substation of Gatika.\nThe supply of all oil-based fuels distributed in the whole metropolitan area (gasoline, diesel fuel and butane) are produced in the oil refinery owned by \"Petronor\" in the municipalities of Muskiz and Abanto Zierbena. \"Petronor\" is a large oil company founded in Bilbao in 1968 and it currently comprises two partners, Repsol (85.98%) and Kutxabank (14.02%).\nSupply of drinking water is managed by the \"Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia\" (Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium), a public entity with the responsibility of managing the water infrastructure and distribution to many Biscayan municipalities, Bilbao and its metropolitan area included. The supply of drinking water for the city comes from the Uribarri-Ganboa and Urrunaga reservoirs, which are fed by the river Zadorra.\nEducation.\nThe Basque Country has a bilingual education system, with students able to choose between four linguistic models: A, B, D, and X, which differ in the prevalence of Basque or Spanish as the spoken and written language used in classes. In Bilbao, there is a prevalence of model D (where Basque is the vehicle language and Spanish is taught as a subject) in Primary School, while Compulsory Secondary Education students favour model B (where some subjects are in Basque and other in Spanish). Finally, 67% of Baccalaureate students choose model A (in which Spanish is the vehicle language and Basque is a subject). English is the most widespread foreign language taught, being the option for 97% of pre-university students.\nHigher education.\nTwo universities are seated in Bilbao. The older is the University of Deusto, founded by the Society of Jesus in 1886. It took its name from the then independent municipality of Deusto, annexed to Bilbao in 1925. It was the only higher education institute in the borough until the establishment in 1968 of the University of Bilbao, later to become the University of the Basque Country in 1980. This public university, which has a presence in the three provinces of the autonomous community, has its main Biscayan campus in the municipality of Leioa, although the Technical and Business faculties are based in Bilbao. Since 2014, Mondragon University has also a presence in the city through the innovation and entrepreneurial centre Bilbao Innovation Factory. In 2015, the offer of higher education in the city was expanded with the foundation of Dantzerti, the Higher School of Dramatic Arts and Dance of the Basque Country.\nSport.\nAs in the rest of Spain, football is the most popular competitive sport, followed by basketball. Some people are interested in basque sports, one of the oldest sports in Spain. One could enjoy a Basque pelota match in Bizkaia Frontoia, Bilbao. In addition, Bilbao offers many outdoor activities owing to its location by the sea amid the hilly countryside. Hiking and rock climbing in the nearby mountains are very popular. Watersports, especially surfing, are practised on the beaches of nearby Sopelana and Mundaka.\nClubs.\nThe main football club is Athletic Club, commonly known as Athletic Bilbao in English. It plays at the new San Mam\u00e9s stadium, which opened in 2013 and seats 53,332 spectators.\nAthletic Bilbao was one of the founding members of the Spanish football league, La Liga, and has played in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n (First Division) ever since \u2013 winning it on eight occasions. Its red and white striped flag can be seen throughout the city. Athletic is noted for its \"Basque policy\", in place since 1911, with only players born in or having a clear connection to the Basque region being allowed to represent the club.\nThe main basketball club is Bilbao Basket, which plays in the Spanish top division Liga ACB and their home venue is the Bilbao Arena. The main achievements of the clubs were being the runner-up of the Liga ACB during the 2010\u20132011 season, losing the final series 3\u20130 against FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet; as well as the runner-up of the EuroCup Basketball in the 2012\u20132013 edition, where they lost to the Russian team Lokomotiv Kuban.\nInternational relations.\nBilbao is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) and scheduled to take place each year at the start of May.\nIt is one of Britain's five Classic races, and at present it is the first to be run in the year. It also serves as the opening leg of the Triple Crown, followed by the Derby and the St\u00a0Leger, although the feat of winning all three has been rarely attempted in recent decades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Jockey colours header/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe 2000 Guineas Stakes was first run on 18 April 1809, and it preceded the introduction of a version for fillies only, the 1000 Guineas Stakes, by five years. Both races were established by the Jockey Club under the direction of Sir Charles Bunbury, who had earlier co-founded the Derby at Epsom. The races were named according to their original prize funds (a guinea amounted to 21 shillings, so the original prize was \u00a32,100).\nBy the mid-1860s, the 2000 Guineas was regarded as one of Britain's most prestigious races for three-year-olds. The five leading events for this age group, characterised by increasing distances as the season progressed, began to be known as \"Classics\". The concept was later adopted in many other countries.\nEuropean variations of the 2000 Guineas include the Irish 2,000 Guineas, the Mehl-M\u00fclhens-Rennen, the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Premio Parioli. Elsewhere, variations include the Australian Guineas and the Satsuki Sh\u014d.\nThe 2000 Guineas is served by trial races such as the Craven Stakes and the Greenham Stakes, but for some horses it is the first race of the season.

It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 115 yards (2,921 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.\nEstablished in 1776, the St Leger is the oldest of Britain's five Classic races. It is the last of the five to be run each year, and its distance is longer than any of the other four.\nThe St Leger is the final leg of the English Triple Crown, which begins with the 2000 Guineas and continues with the Derby. It also completes the Fillies' Triple Crown, following on from the 1000 Guineas and The Oaks. The St Leger has rarely featured Triple Crown contenders in recent decades, with the only one in recent years being the 2012 2,000 Guineas and Derby winner Camelot, who finished second in the St Leger.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe event was devised by Anthony St Leger, an army officer and politician who lived near Doncaster. It was initially referred to as \"A Sweepstake of 25 Guineas\", and its original distance was two miles. The rules stipulated that colts and geldings were to carry 8\u00a0st, and fillies would receive an allowance of 2\u00a0lb.\nThe inaugural running was held at Cantley Common on 24 September 1776. The first winner was an unnamed filly owned by the event's organiser, the 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. The filly was later named Allabaculia.\nThe title St Leger Stakes was decided at a dinner party held in 1778 at the Red Lion Inn located in the Market Place, Doncaster, to discuss the coming year's race. It was suggested that it should be called the Rockingham Stakes in honour of the host, the Marquess of Rockingham, but the Marquess proposed that it should be named instead after Anthony St Leger. That year the event was moved to its present location, Town Moor, in 1778.\nThe race came to national prominence in 1800, when a horse called Champion registered the first Derby\u2013St Leger double. Its length was cut to 1\u00a0mile, 6\u00a0furlongs and 193\u00a0yards in 1813, and despite some minor alterations has remained much the same ever since. The victory of West Australian in 1853 completed the first success in the Triple Crown.\nPost-1900.\nThe St Leger Stakes was closed to geldings in 1906. It was transferred to Newmarket during World War I, and the substitute event was called the September Stakes. It was cancelled in 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II, and the following year's edition was held at Thirsk in November. For the remainder of this period it was staged at Manchester (1941), Newmarket (1942\u201344) and York (1945).\nThe race was switched to Ayr in 1989 after the scheduled running at Doncaster was abandoned due to subsidence. The 2006 race took place at York because its regular venue was closed for redevelopment.\nThe St Leger Stakes has inspired a number of similar events around the world, although many are no longer restricted to three-year-olds. European variations include the Irish St. Leger, the Prix Royal-Oak, the Deutsches St. Leger and the St. Leger Italiano. Other national equivalents include the Kikuka-sh\u014d, the New Zealand St. Leger and the VRC St Leger.\nRecords.\nLeading jockey (9 wins):\nLeading trainer (16 wins):\nLeading owner (7 wins):\nWinners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn popular culture.\nAs the last of the classics, the race marks the end of summer in England. The popular adage \"sell in May and go away, come back on St Leger Day\" suggests investors should sell their shares in May and buy again after the race.\nThe Agatha Christie novel \"The A.B.C.

{"id": "68035", "revid": "46795639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68035", "title": "Female impersonation", "text": "Entertainment by a man dressed as a woman\nFemale impersonation is a type of theatrical performance where a man dresses in women's clothing for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience. While the term female impersonator is sometimes used interchangeably with drag queen, they are not the same. Drag as an art form is associated with queer identity whereas female impersonation may come from a wide a range of gender identity paradigms, including heteronormativity. Additionally, many drag artists view drag as a lived form of self-expression or creativity, and perceive drag as something that is not limited to the stage or to performance. In contrast, female impersonation is specifically limited to performance and may or may not involve an LGBTQI point of view.\nHistory of female impersonation.\nAncient Greece.\nThe concept of drag can be seen in the earliest forms of entertainment, including Ancient Greek theatre. In ancient western cultures, women often were not allowed to perform onstage or become actors, therefore male actors played the roles of women also. This demonstrates how female impersonation can be traced back to the earliest forms of entertainment and spectacle. Not only this, but men and boys were expected to dress as women, or in drag, for many religious ceremonies and rituals in Ancient Greece.\nThere is some controversy as to whether this is actually where drag emerged, or if it occurred later in history, in the 19th century with forms of entertainment such as minstrel shows and Shakespeare's plays, as he often incorporated male actors as female impersonators.\nUnited States.\nMinstrel shows.\nThe evolution of female impersonation and drag in the United States was influenced by minstrel shows. The term female impersonator was in wide use during the 19th century in theater in the United States to refer to a specific type of performer in minstrel shows and later vaudeville known as \"wench\" and \"dame\" roles. These roles were performed by both cisgender heterosexual men, and by queer men who were closeted and in some rare cases openly non-heterosexual. The actor Thomas L. Moxley was a celebrated blackface female impersonator who performed under the name Master Floyd in George Kunkel's Nightingales; a leading minstrel show of the 1850s and 1860s. \nThese shows were an example of how Blackface was used in a racist form of entertainment where the performers would mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American women as well. They performed in comedic skits, dances, and \"wench\" songs. Black people themselves were largely excluded from being performers as at this point in history. Blackface in minstrel shows emerged in c.\u20091820, but became more established with the creation of the character of Jim Crow, which was first performed in 1828. After the Civil War, performance troupes began to be composed of Black performers. The shows maintained popularity in American entertainment into the 1920s.\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century minstrel show female impersonators did not attempt to present the illusion of femininity, but rather lampooned cisgender women through a comic representation of women that did not attempt to completely remove the actor's masculine physical traits. Minstrel show female impersonators often employed sexist and racist stereotypes within bawdy humor to make fun of women, often black women, in blackface. This type of humor continued on the vaudeville and burlesque stage.\nVaudeville and 20th century female impersonators.\nThe broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the vaudeville shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s. In addition to the \"wench players\", minstrel shows developed the role of \"prima donnas\", who appeared more elegant and refined while still retaining their comedic elements. While the \"wenches\" were purely American creations, the \"prima donnas\" were inspired by both American and European cross-dressing shows, like Shakespearean actors and castrati. With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, Great Migration of African Americans, and an influx of immigrants, vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy. Near the end of the 19th century a new type of female impersonation, the female illusionist, began to appear in vaudeville. This type of performer did not use humor to denigrate women, but rather attempted to celebrate women by presenting a realistic looking woman in tasteful fashions of the period.\nWith vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna. They were known to perform song and dance routines with multiple outfit changes. George W. Munroe, who was known for portraying gossipy old Irish women, started in vaudeville in the late 19th century, and became a Broadway star; portraying the title role in the musical \"The Doings of Mrs. Dooley\" at the Grand Opera House in 1902. Other vaudeville female impersonators included Gilbert Sarony as his female character Giddy Gusher, Neil Burgess as the Widow Bedotte, and the Russell Brothers who portrayed Irish maids.\nIn New York City, famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge found success, and he eventually made his way to the Broadway stage performing as a woman. He published a magazine, \"Magazine and Beauty Hints\" (1913), which provided beauty and fashion tips, and he posed for corset and cosmetics advertisements. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Bothwell Browne was the top female impersonator of the West Coast. He performed at the Grand Opera House and Central Theater, among other venues, went on tour with United Vaudeville, and later appeared in the film Yankee Doodle in Berlin (1919), produced by Mack Sennett.\nAt this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished. However, African-American comedian Andrew Tribble found success as a female impersonator on Broadway and in Black Vaudeville. Connection with sex work and homosexuality eventually led to the decline of female impersonation during the Progressive Era. Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.\nIn the twentieth century some cross-gender impersonators, both female and male, in the United States became highly successful performing artists in nightclubs and theaters. There was a concerted effort by these working female impersonators in America, to separate the art of female impersonation from queer identity with an overt representation of working female impersonators as heterosexual. Some of the performers were in fact cisgender men, but others were closeted due to the politics and social environment of the period. It was criminal in many American cities to be homosexual, or for LGBTQ people to congregate, and it was therefore necessary for female impersonators to distance themselves from identifying as queer in order to avoid criminal charges. The need to hide queer identity was prevalent among female impersonators working in non-LGBTQ nightclubs before heteronormative audiences from the early 1900s to as late as the 1970s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1915, the U.S.-based not-for-profit educational association serves professionals and organizations with interest in supply management, providing education, training, qualifications, publications, information, and research.\nISM serves a community of over 50,000 members in more than 100 countries. It offers three qualifications, the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM), Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD), and the Associate Professional in Supply Management (APSM), in partnership with CAPS Research.\nHistory.\nInstitute for Supply Management originated in 1915 as the \"National Association of Purchasing Agents\" (NAPA).\nIn the early twentieth century, the purchasing function typically did not enjoy the full support of management, which was typically indifferent to its potential. Prior to 1915, local purchasing associations had formed in at least 10 major cities in the U.S., including in Buffalo (one of the most active groups, founded in 1904). Some purchasing officials decided to form a national group to advance their profession and share useful information among members, but support was spotty. Organizers had to overcome distrust over concerns that their participation would reveal trade secrets. As Charles A. Steele, president of NAPA stated in 1923:\n ...it had been a sort of unwritten rule that purchasers were one body of men who should not communicate with each other for fear that they might do the other fellow some good and themselves some harm.\nElwood B. Hendricks, a salesman working for the Thomas Publishing Company, became the driving force behind forming a national purchasing association. In 1913, Hendricks's plan began to bear fruit when he helped form the Purchasing Agents Association of New York that became the nucleus of the national organization. The New York group applied for and received a charter for NAPA in 1915. The first local groups to affiliate association were New York City and Pittsburgh in 1915 and Columbus in 1916. South Bend, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles followed in 1917. Buffalo affiliated with NAPA in 1918. By 1920 over 30 affiliates had joined and that number continued to grow. The group gave Hendricks an honorary lifetime membership.\nThe goals of NAPA were to:\nNAPA held its first convention in New York in 1916 with 100 of its 250 members in attendance. That year NAPA launched a magazine, \"The Purchasing Agent\", that was to have an immense impact on the success of the organization and eventually evolve into \"Inside Supply Management\" magazine. In 1918, approximately one thousand members were expected to attend that year's national convention.\nWorld War I and the 1920s.\nWith the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, NAPA offered its services to the war effort. Materials were in short supply and procurement had become more complicated as the U.S. government \"attempted to guide economic activity via centralized price and production controls\". During this period NAPA members helped establish purchasing courses at New York University and Harvard. The association began developing professional standards including a code of ethics for the purchasing profession.\nDuring World War I, NAPA called for the centralization of War Department purchasing to reduce inefficiency and graft. The association advocated standardization in the purchase and use of coal and the prosecution of profiteers. Its crusade for ethical standards resulted in the \"Purchasing Agent\u2019s Creed\" that observers hailed for decades as one of the outstanding moral statements in modern business. In 1928, it released the \"Standards for Buying and Selling\" with the recognition that buying and selling should be mutually profitable and that cooperation would reduce the cost of purchasing.\nGreat Depression and World War II.\nHarvard Business School published two purchasing textbooks and it developed case studies about purchasing problems, all under the auspices of NAPA. The association commissioned a two-volume work on purchasing practices and procedures.\nIn 1931, the association established the J. Shipman Gold Medal Award, the highest honor in the field, bestowed on an individual for exceptional performance in supply management.\nNAPA created its Business Survey Panel in 1931 and began polling members on commodities. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using these reports when compiling information for the federal government. These reports eventually evolved into the association's market-moving report now known as the ISM Report On Business.\nWhen World War II broke out, NAPA kept its members updated on government requirements and regulations concerning wartime production. As the government placed controls on producers and consumers, many of NAPA\u2019s members played a critical role.\nN.A.P.A rebranded as NAPM.\nBy the 1950s, memberships reached 15,000. In the U.S., purchasing had transformed into a vital management function. In 1968, NAPA renamed itself the National Association of Purchasing Management, Inc. (NAPM).\nIn 1974, NAPM introduced the Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) qualification, the first professional certification in the field.\nIn 1976, NAPM conducted its first ever onsite plant training. NAPM became involved in minority and women's initiatives and elected May Warzocha as its first woman president in 1979. In 1987, it formed the Minority Business Development Group to assist members with their minority supplier programs.\nThe Report On Business continued to gain recognition as a reliable near-term economic barometer. In 1982, NAPM introduced the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) and in 1988 it added diffusion indexes and introduced a graph format. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce began including NAPM's data as a component of its Index of Leading Indicators and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve praised the Report. In 1998, the association developed the Non-Manufacturing Report On Business.\nTransformation to ISM.\nOver time, purchasing professionals were becoming more responsible for the larger function of the supply of goods and services instead of strictly purchasing. To more accurately reflect this expanded scope, NAPM members voted in April 2001 to change the organization's name to Institute for Supply Management (ISM).\nIn 2002, ISM launched its sustainability and social responsibility initiative, and in 2004 issued its ISM Principles of Social Responsibility, a first for the supply management profession.\nIn 2005, ISM partnered with the R. Gene and Nancy D. Richter Foundation to expand the R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program into the largest national scholarship program in the field of supply management. Together, in 2008, they established the ISM R. Gene Richter Scholarship Program Fund with a goal of funding scholarships on an ongoing basis.\nIn 2008, ISM introduced a new professional qualification, the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM), to succeed the Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) credential.\nIn 2011, ISM introduced the Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) certification to create experts who could help guide their companies through supplier diversity issues, harness underutilized, innovative suppliers and tap new markets. That same year, ISM began its Corporate Program to help the employees of corporate members perform at a higher level.\nIn 2023, ISM introduced the Associate Professional in Supply Management (APSM) certification to create a pathway for students to achieve the CPSM earlier in their careers.\nISM introduced the ISM Mastery Model in 2015. Later renamed to ISM Capability Model, it covers 16 core competencies and 73 sub-competencies. The model and its assessment tool identify employee skills gaps and solutions to close them. It allows companies to benchmark team member skills and create a development roadmap and set job expectations.\nSupply Management.\nISM defines supply management as:\n ...the identification, analysis, determination, procurement and fulfillment of the goods and services an organization needs to meet short- and long-term objectives. By managing external partners' capabilities and linking them to organizational goals, supply management contributes to the strategic direction of an organization through total cost and capabilities management.\nBy effective oversight and engagement of people, processes and relationships, supply management creates competitive advantage through innovation, cost management, quality improvement, asset optimization, risk mitigation, social responsibility and sustainability.\nTopics included as part of supply management:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCurrent Certification Programs.\nCertified Professional in Supply Management\u00ae (CPSM\u00ae).\nThe Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) certification addresses the changing demands of the profession and the international marketplace. According to ISM's 2025 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSM holder is $150,151.\nCertified Professional in Supplier Diversity\u00ae (CPSD\u00ae).\nISM's Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD) is the only certification for professionals whose responsibilities include supplier diversity. It is supported by various diversity organizations such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women's Business Enterprise National Council. According to ISM's 2025 annual salary survey, the average salary for a CPSD holder is $140,724.\nAssociate Professional in Supply Management\u00ae (APSM\u00ae).\nDuring the beginning of a supply chain career or transition, an APSM certification helps you stand out from the professional competition.\nLegacy Certification Programs.\nPrior to launching its current certification programs, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) offered two professional credentials. The Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) and the Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.) programs are no longer open to new applicants, but current credential holders remain eligible for recertification and lifetime certification. Both the C.P.M. and A.P.P. credentials were broadly designed for individuals working in private, public, and non-profit organizations.\nCertified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.).\nThe Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) designation was introduced in 1974, becoming the first major professional certification and the first nationally accepted standard of competence and knowledge in the rapidly rising field of purchasing and supply management. No longer offered for testing, ISM continues to recertify C.P.M.s who meet continuing education requirements. According to ISM's 2025 annual salary survey, the average salary for a Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.) is $161,455.\nAccredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.).\nThe Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.) program was established in 1996 for entry-level buyers primarily engaged in the tactical and operational side of purchasing and those working outside the organization's purchasing and supply management department but who have definite procurement responsibilities. No longer offered for testing, ISM continues to recertify A.P.P.s who meet continuing education requirements. According to ISM's 2025 annual salary survey, the average salary for an Accredited Purchasing Practitioner (A.P.P.) is $191,333.\nPublications.\n\"ISM Report On Business\".\nThe ISM Report On Business is one of the most reliable economic barometers of the U.S. economy. The Report is based on two national surveys of supply chain professionals tracking changes in the manufacturing, non-manufacturing sectors and hospital subsectors.\n\"Inside Supply Management\".\nISM publishes a members-only monthly magazine \"Inside Supply Management\".\nEducation.\nISM offers a curriculum addressing all areas of supply, but with a particular focus on sourcing and procurement, available in different formats.\nCAPS Research.\nCAPS Research, or the Center for Advanced Procurement Strategy, is a B2B nonprofit research center at Arizona State University, serving supply management leaders at Fortune 1000 companies. CAPS was established in 1986 at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University in partnership with Institute for Supply Management. It uses supply management KPIs to provide comprehensive benchmarking so companies can see how they compare to other organizations.\nControversies.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the early release of the June 2013 Manufacturing ISM \"Report On Business\" by mass media and information firm Thomson Reuters. According to a CNBC article high-speed trading surged 15 milliseconds before the report was scheduled to be released:\n ...ISM's manufacturing data was inadvertently sent out early by Thomson Reuters on June 3rd to its high-speed clients, many of whom immediately traded on the information. There was a sharp market reaction to that burst of trading, which prompted downward moves in the SPY ETF, which serves as an investing tool for traders to bet on the overall direction of the market. That downward surge [allowed insiders] more than enough time to profit from early knowledge of market-moving information.\nAfter a telephone inquiry from the SEC about the early release of the data, Thomson Reuters issued a statement explaining that the early release was due to a clock synchronization issue. At the SEC's request, the firm voluntarily provided a redacted copy of its contract with ISM. In an interview with CNBC, ISM CEO Thomas Derry said that after speaking with Thomson Reuters about the mechanics of their release process, he was confident it was an isolated occurrence. He also indicated that \u201cWe have not been contacted by any government entity.\u201d\nOn June 2, 2014, ISM released the ISM \"Report On Business\", its closely followed monthly manufacturing report, and then revised it twice in the span of about two-and-a-half hours, a highly unusual event. The initial figure of 53.2 was lower than anticipated and indicated a slowing of the pace of factory-sector growth, and this caused stocks to dip immediately. Economists disputed the report's accuracy.\nISM's final correction of 55.4 was almost in line with Wall Street expectations, indicating brisk growth, and the stock market rebounded quickly and closed the day with a modest gain. In a statement, ISM attributed the errant report to a software glitch that \"incorrectly used the seasonal adjustment factor from the previous month.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68038", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68038", "title": "Circular definition", "text": "Self-referential description of meaning\nA circular definition is a type of definition that uses the term(s) being defined as part of the description or assumes that the term(s) being described are already known. There are several kinds of circular definition, and several ways of characterising the term: pragmatic, lexicographic and linguistic. Circular definitions are related to circular reasoning in that they both involve a self-referential approach.\nCircular definitions may be unhelpful if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself.\nIn linguistics, a circular definition is a description of the meaning of a lexeme that is constructed using one or more synonymous lexemes that are all defined in terms of each other.\nApproaches to characterizing circular definitions.\nClassical.\nIn Plato's \"Meno\", several definitions of virtue are offered, the third of which states that virtue is the power of attaining good justly or with justice, where justice has already been defined as a form or aspect of virtue. Socrates, in response to Meno, states that the process of finding a definition will have to be started again because the wording offered defines virtue as a part of virtue.\nPragmatic.\nFrom a pragmatic point of view, circular definitions may be characterised in terms of new, useful or helpful information: a definition is deficient if the audience must either already know the meaning of the key term, or if the term to be defined is used in the definition itself. Such definitions lead to a need for additional information that motivated someone to look at the definition in the first place and, thus, violate the principle of providing new or useful information. Here are some examples:\nConsequently, when constructing systems of definitions, authors should use good practices that avoid producing viciously circular definitions. In many learner's dictionaries, circular definitions are greatly reduced by writing definitions using only the words in a constrained defining vocabulary.\nLexicographic.\nFrom a lexicographic point of view, the simplest form of circular definition in a dictionary is in terms of synonyms, and the number of steps for closing the definition chain into a circle is known as the \"depth\" of the circular definition: the circular definition \"object: a thing\" \u2192 \"thing: an object\" is a circular definition with a depth of two. The circular definition \"object: a thing\" \u2192 \"thing: an entity\" \u2192 \"entity: an object\" has a depth of three.\nThe classic \"genus-difference\" dictionary definition is in terms of nearest kind (\"genus proximum\") and specific differences (\"differentia specifica\"). This genus-difference description may be involved in producing circular definitions of part and kind relationships, for example: \"rake: an implement with three or more tines\" \u2192 \"tine: a part of a rake\". However, if more specific differences are added, then the effect of circularity may disappear: \"rake: a gardening implement with a long handle with three or more tines arranged on crossbar at 90\u00b0 to the handle and the tines at 90\u00b0 to both crossbar and handle\"; in this case, \"tine\" is most usefully defined with reference to \"rake\", but with additional differences providing points of comparison, e.g.: \"tine: a sharp spike at the end of a rake\". In practice, a pragmatic approach is often taken in considering the effects of circularity in dictionary definitions.\nCircular lexicographic (dictionary) definitions.\nDictionary entries are often given as examples of apparent circular definitions. Dictionary production, as a project in lexicography, should not be confused with a mathematical or logical activity, where giving a definition for a word is similar to providing an explanans for an explanandum in a context where practitioners are expected to use a deductive system. While, from a linguistic prescriptivist perspective, any dictionary might be believed to dictate correct usage, the linguistic descriptivist perspective recognizes that looking up words in dictionaries is not itself a rule-following practice independent of the give-and-take of using words in context. Thus, the example of a definition of oak given above (something that has catkins and grows from acorns) is not completely useless, even if \"acorn\" and \"catkin\" are defined in terms of \"oak\", in that it supplies additional concepts (e.g., the concept of catkin) in the definition. \nWhile a dictionary might produce a \"circle\" among the terms, \"oak\", \"catkin\", and \"acorn\", each of these is used in different (e.g., those related to plants, trees, flowers, and seeds) that generate ever-branching networks of usages. In another case it might produce a true circle. Taken as a whole, dictionaries are circular because each and every word is defined in terms of words that are also contained within the dictionary. ()\nDefinitions in lexicography can be broadly or narrowly circular. Narrowly circular definitions simply define one word in terms of another. A broadly circular definition has a larger circle of words. For example, the definition of the primary word is defined using two other words, which are defined with two other words, etc., creating a definitional chain. This can continue until the primary word is used to define one of the words used in the chain, closing the wide circle of terms. If all definitions rely on the definitions of other words in a very large, but finite chain, then all text-based definitions are ultimately circular. Extension (semantics) to the actual things that referring terms like nouns stand for, provided that agreement on reference is accomplished, is one method of breaking this circularity, but this is outside the capacity of a text-based definition.\nExamples of narrowly circular definitions in dictionaries.\nThe 2007 Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a \"hill\" and a \"mountain\" this way:\n hill - \"1: a usually rounded natural elevation of land lower than a mountain\"\n mountain - \"1a: a landmass that projects conspicuously above its surroundings and is higher than a hill\"\nMerriam-Webster's online dictionary provides another example of a circular definition with the words \"condescending\" and \"patronizing:\"\n Main Entry: condescending\n Function: adjective\n 1 : showing or characterized by condescension: patronizing\nFrom \"condescension\":\n Main Entry: condescension\n Function: noun\n 1 : voluntary descent from one's rank or dignity in relations with an inferior\n 2 : patronizing attitude or behavior\nTo \"patronize\":\n Main Entry: patronize\n Function: transitive verb\n 1 : to act as patron of: provide aid or support for\n 2 : to adopt an air of condescension toward: treat haughtily or coolly\nFrom the Oxford Dictionary of English: \nTherefore, a punishment means \"a \"punishment imposed for breaking a law, rule, or contract\" inflicted as \"punishment inflicted on someone as\" punishment inflicted or retribution exacted for an injury or wrong \"for a wrong or criminal act\" for an offence\". Obviously, this is not the final result of substitution as this would result in an endlessly long sentence.\nMathematical theory.\nFormal approaches to characterizing circular definitions are found in logic, mathematics and in computer science. A branch of mathematics called non-well-founded set theory allows for the construction of circular sets. Circular sets are good for modelling cycles, and, despite the field's name, this area of mathematics is well founded. Computer science allows for procedures to be defined by using recursion. Such definitions are not circular as long as they terminate.\nLinguistics.\nLinguistically, a circular definition is a description of the meaning of a lexeme that is constructed using one or more synonymous lexemes that are all defined in terms of each other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established in the United States in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. Similar SIC systems are also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the United Kingdom's Companies House.\nIn the United States, the SIC system was last revised in 1987 and was last used by the Census Bureau for the 1992 Economic Census, and has been replaced by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997. Some U.S. government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), continue to use SIC codes.\nThe SIC code for an establishment, that is, a unique business with a registered U.S. headquarters, was determined by the industry appropriate for the overall largest product lines of the company or organization of which the establishment was a part. The later NAICS classification system has a different concept, assigning establishments into categories based on each one's output.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of SIC was published in parts during 1938\u20131940, with revisions made in 1941\u20131942. The next edition was published in two parts in 1945 and 1949. Further revisions were issued in 1957, 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, and 1987.\nThe SIC code system has been used since the 1930s. It was developed by the Interdepartmental Committee on Industrial Statistics, established by the Central Statistical Board who developed the List of Industries for manufacturing, published in 1938, and the 1939 List of Industries for non-manufacturing industries, which became the first Standard Industrial Classification for the United States. The SIC system was last revised in 1987 and was last used by the Census Bureau for the 1992 Economic Census.\nThe Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, was tasked with revising the SIC system to reflect changing economic conditions. The OMB established the Economic Classification Policy Committee in 1992 to develop a new system representative of the current industrial climate. The result was the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, a collaborative effort between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. NAICS replaced the four-digit SIC code with a six-digit code, and it provided more flexibility in handling emerging industries (for example, the NAICS system more generally allows for \"Other...\" categories across industry groups). The new codes were implemented in Canada and the United States in 1997 and in Mexico one year later.\nNAICS classified establishments (workplace) by their main output, instead of classifying them with the larger firm or organization of which the establishment was a part. This gives more precise information on establishment and worker activities than the SIC system, but changed the meaning of the classifications somewhat, making some time series of data hard to sustain accurately. Fort and Klimek (2016) found using longitudinal data on establishments that the switch from SIC to NAICS reclassified large numbers of workers differently by industry/sector than NAICS does, notably by reclassifying some from the Manufacturing sector into Services.\nPurpose.\nIn the early 1900s, each branch of United States government agencies conducted business analysis using its own methods and metrics, unknown and meaningless to other branches. In the 1930s, the government needed standardized and meaningful methods to measure, analyze and share data across its various agencies. Thus, the Standard Industrial Classification system was born. SIC codes are four-digit numerical representations of major businesses and industries. SIC codes are assigned based on common characteristics shared in the products, services, production and delivery system of a business.\nStructure.\nSIC codes have a hierarchical, top-down structure that begins with general characteristics and narrows down to the specifics. The first two digits of the code represent the major industry sector to which a business belongs. The third and fourth digits describe the sub-classification of the business group and specialization, respectively. For example, \"36\" refers to a business that deals in \"Electronic and Other Equipment.\" Adding \"7\" as a third digit to get \"367\" indicates that the business operates in \"Electronic, Component and Accessories.\" The fourth digit distinguishes the specific industry sector, so a code of \"3672\" indicates that the business is concerned with \"Printed Circuit Boards.\"\nUses.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration utilize SIC codes in their reporting, although SIC codes are also used in academic and business sectors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updates the codes every three years and uses SIC to report on work force, wages and pricing issues. The Social Security Administration assigns SIC codes to businesses based on the descriptions provided by employers under the primary business activity entry on employer ID applications.\nLimitations.\nOver the years, the U.S. Census has identified three major limitations to using the SIC system. The first limitation surrounds its definition and mistaken classification of employee groups. For example, administrative assistants in the automotive industry support all levels of the business, yet the SIC defines these employees as part of the \"Basic Sector\" of manufacturing jobs when they should be reported as \"Non-Basic.\" Secondly, SIC codes were developed for traditional industries prior to 1970. Business has changed considerably since then from manufacturing-based to mostly service-based. As a result, and thirdly the SIC has been slow to recognize new and emerging industries, such as those in the computer, software, and information technology sectors.\nCodes.\nRange.\nThe SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division. The first 3 digits of the SIC code indicate the industry group, and the first two digits indicate the major group. Each division encompasses a range of SIC codes:\nTo look at a particular example of the hierarchy, SIC code 2024 (ice cream and frozen desserts) belongs to industry group 202 (dairy products), which is part of major group 20 (food and kindred products), which belongs to the division of manufacturing.\nList.\nThe following table is from the SEC's website, which allows searching for companies by SIC code in its database of filings. The acronym NEC stands for \"not elsewhere classified\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was introduced by former world chess champion Bobby Fischer in 1996 to reduce the emphasis on opening preparation and to encourage creativity in play. Chess960 uses the same board and pieces as classical chess, but the starting position of the pieces on the players' &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;home ranks&lt;/dfn&gt; is randomized, following certain rules. The random setup makes gaining an advantage through the memorization of openings unfeasible. Players instead must rely on their skill and creativity.\nRandomizing the main pieces had long been known as \"shuffle chess\", but Fischer introduced new rules for the initial random setup, \"preserving the dynamic nature of the game by retaining &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;bishops of opposite colors&lt;/dfn&gt; for each player and the right to castle for both sides\". The result is 960 distinct possible starting positions.\nIn 2008, FIDE added Chess960 to an appendix of the Laws of Chess. The first world championship officially sanctioned by FIDE, the FIDE World Fischer Random Chess Championship 2019, brought additional prominence to the variant. It was won by Wesley So. In 2022, Hikaru Nakamura became the new champion.\nRules.\nSetup.\nBefore the game, a starting position is randomly determined and set up, subject to certain requirements. White's pieces (not pawns) are placed randomly on the first &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt;, following two rules:\nThere are 960 possible starting positions. The starting position is usually chosen randomly by software, but can be done using multiple rolls of a standard six-sided die.\nBlack's pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to White's pieces. (For example, if the white king is randomly determined to start on f1, then the black king is placed on f8.) Pawns are placed on the players' second ranks as in classical chess.\nAfter setup, the game is played the same as classical chess in all respects, with the exception of castling from the different possible starting positions for king and rooks.\nCastling rules.\nAs in classical chess, each player may castle once per game, moving both the king and a rook in a single move; however, the castling rules were reinterpreted in Chess960 to support the different possible initial positions of king and rook. After castling, the final positions of king and rook are the same as in classical chess, namely:\nCastling prerequisites are the same as in classical chess, with some minor clarifications:\nFIDE's recommended procedure for castling unambiguously is first to move the king outside the playing area next to its final square, then to move the rook to its final square, then to move the king to its final square. Another recommendation is to verbally announce the intent to castle before doing so.\nHistory.\nVan Zuylen van Nijevelt's early contributions.\nThe concept of random chess, also known as shuffle chess, was first proposed by the Dutch chess enthusiast Philip Julius van Zuylen van Nijevelt (1743\u20131826). In his renowned treatise on chess, \"La Sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 aux \u00c9checs\", published in 1792, Van Zuylen van Nijevelt articulated his disdain for the repetitive patterns often found in standard chess openings. He proposed the idea of randomizing the starting positions of the main pieces to create a vast array of distinct situations, eliminating the possibility of pre-game memorization or extensive opening theory. Van Zuylen van Nijevelt's book, with its full title \"La Sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 aux \u00c9checs mise \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tout le monde, et particuli\u00e8rement des dames qui aiment cet amusement\" (\"Superiority in Chess brought into the reach of all, and particularly of ladies who love that amusement\"), gained significant popularity and was reprinted several times. Its influence extended beyond the Dutch-speaking world, as it was subsequently translated into multiple languages, spreading the idea of randomizing the initial positions of chess pieces to a wider audience. This early conception of random chess by Van Zuylen van Nijevelt laid the foundation for Chess960.\nVan Zuylen van Nijevelt's innovative approach to chess not only offered a solution to the repetitive nature of traditional openings but also paved the way for the exploration of chess variants that deviate from the conventional starting position. His quote within \"La Sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 aux \u00c9checs\" emphasizes the core principle behind random chess, stating, \"This produces a huge number of different situations, so that no one can study them beforehand,\" reflecting his desire to introduce an element of unpredictability and originality into the game of chess. The legacy of Van Zuylen van Nijevelt's contributions to the evolution of chess remains significant, with his early insights serving as a cornerstone for the development of various randomized chess variants, including Chess960.\nDevelopment and further evolution.\nThe pioneering work of Van Zuylen van Nijevelt found continued development through the efforts of his nephew, the Jonkheer Elias van der Hoeven (1778\u20131854), a Dutch diplomat. Van der Hoeven took the concept of shuffle chess further, potentially sharing his insights with Aaron Alexandre, evident from Alexandre's incorporation of the theory into his Encyclop\u00e9die des \u00e9checs in 1837.\nThe earliest documented games of shuffle chess were played between Van der Hoeven and Alexandre in Mannheim in 1842, with Alexandre emerging as the victor with a score of 3-0. One of these games is preserved in Sissa, the Netherlands' first long-standing chess journal, demonstrating an initial position with two advanced pawns on each side. A later game played by Van der Hoeven was against Baron von der Lasa (1818-1899), adhering more closely to the contemporary rules of random chess, except for the monochromatic bishop pairs.\nIn 1851, Van der Hoeven visited Willem Verbeek, the editor-in-chief of Sissa. Verbeek and Hancock, Verbeek's chess companion in Amsterdam during the 1850s, delved into shuffle chess, with their initial findings documented in the pages of the Sissa journal.\nVan der Hoeven's modifications to the original concept of random chess were published in Alexandre's Encyclop\u00e9die in 1837 and later republished in Sissa by an individual known as T. Scheidius. This variant began to be referred to as \"schaakspel, naar de wijze van jhr. Van der Hoeven\" or \"schaakspel \u00e0 la Van der Hoeven.\" \nFollowing Van der Hoeven's visit, the Sissa Chess Society received an invitation from the Philidor Chess Society in Amsterdam, in collaboration with Van der Hoeven, to organize a shuffle chess tournament. The aim was to promote the dissemination and popularity of the chess variant attributed to Van der Hoeven. Originally intended as a tournament among the eight prize winners of the 1851 Philidor-organized event, logistical challenges led to invitations being extended to other chess societies. Ultimately, a tournament with seven players from Amsterdam, along with the 74-year-old Van der Hoeven, was organized. Notable participants included Maarten van 't Kruijs (Philidor), J. Seligmann (Philidor), H. Kloos (La Bourdonnais), M.M. Coopman, and F.G. Hijmans / S. Heijmans, supplemented by Mohr and J. van Praag. Van \u2019t Kruijs emerged as the winner of the tournament, reinforcing the growing sentiment that the removal of opening theory allows true chess talent to shine.\nFischer's influence and popularization.\nFischer's modification \"imposes certain restrictions, arguably an improvement on the anarchy of the fully randomized game in which one player is almost certain to start at an advantage\". Fischer started to develop his new version of chess after the 1992 return match with Boris Spassky. The result was the formulation of the rules of Fischer Random Chess in September 1993, introduced formally to the public under the name \"Fisherandom Chess\", on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nFischer's goal was to eliminate what he considered the complete dominance of opening preparation in classical chess, replacing it with creativity and talent. In a situation where the starting position was random it would be impossible to fix every move of the game. Since the \"opening book\" for 960 possible opening systems would be too difficult to devote to memory, the players must create every move originally. From the first move, both players must devise original strategies and cannot use well-established patterns. Fischer believed that eliminating memorized book moves would level the playing field.\nDuring summer 1993, Bobby Fischer visited L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polg\u00e1r and his family in Hungary. All of the Polgar sisters (Judit Polg\u00e1r, Susan Polgar, and Sofia Polgar) played many games of Fischer Random Chess with Fischer. At one point Sofia beat Fischer three games in a row. Fischer was not pleased when the father, L\u00e1szl\u00f3, showed Fischer an old chess book that described what appeared to be a forerunner of Fischer Random Chess. The book was written by Izidor Gross and published in 1910. Fischer then changed the rules of his variation in order to make it different. There are games of shuffle chess recorded as early as 1852 but Fischer is generally credited with the improvements of fixing the colors of bishops, placing the king between the rooks, and defining the castling process. In a later radio interview, Fischer explained his reasoning for proposing a revision of shuffle chess, rather than a game with new pieces (and a larger board), as the \u201cnew chess\u201c:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I love chess, and I didn't invent Fischerandom chess to destroy chess. I invented Fischerandom chess to keep chess going. Because I consider the old chess is dying, it really is dead. A lot of people come up with other rules of chess-type games, with 10\u00d78 boards, new pieces, and all kinds of things. I'm really not interested in that. I want to keep the old chess flavor. I want to keep the old chess game. But just making a change so the starting positions are mixed, so it's not degenerated down to memorization and prearrangement like it is today.\u2014\u200a\nNaming.\nThe variant has held a number of different names. It was originally known as \"Fischerandom Chess\", the name given by Fischer, or \"Fischerandom\". In the FIDE Laws of Chess, it is called \"Chess960\".\nThe name \"Chess960\" was proposed by Hans-Walter Schmitt, chairman of the Frankfurt Chess Tigers e.V. He started a brainstorming process for creating a new name, which had to meet the requirements of leading grandmasters; specifically, that it (a) should not contain part of the name of any grandmaster; (b) should not include negatively biased or \"spongy\" elements (such as \"random\" or \"freestyle\"); and (c) should be universally understood.\nThe name \"Chess960\" (pronounced \"Chess nine-sixty\") reflects the 960 possible starting positions in the game.\nIn conversations with Helgi \u00d3lafsson, Bobby Fischer discussed the initiative that renamed the variant \"Chess960\" and remarked, \"They believe my image is so bad that they have given it another name.\" Fischer later expressed that he liked the name \"Chess960\" and sometimes used the name.\nChess960 tournaments hosted by the Saint Louis Chess Club since 2019 are branded as \"Chess 9LX\", a name trademarked by the Saint Louis Chess Club, where the name is a combination of the Arabic numeral 9 and the Roman numerals LX (60). \nThe name \"Freestyle chess\", which is also a trademarked name, has been used by the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge and the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour promoted by Magnus Carlsen and Jan Henric Buettner.\nTheory.\nThe study of openings in Chess960 is in its infancy, but fundamental opening principles still apply, including: protect the king, control the central squares (directly or indirectly), and develop rapidly, starting with the less valuable pieces.\nUnprotected pawns may also need to be dealt with quickly. Many starting positions have unprotected pawns, and some starting positions have up to two that can be attacked on the first move. For example, in some Chess960 starting positions (see diagram), White can attack an unprotected black pawn on the first move, whereas in classical chess it takes two moves for White to attack, and there are no unprotected pawns.\nWhite's advantage.\nIt has been argued that two games should be played from each starting position, with players alternating colors, since the advantage offered to White in some initial positions may be greater than in classical chess.\nHowever, Sesse (which used Stockfish 9) evaluated the starting positions (SP) to be between 0.00 and 0.57, with an average of 0.18 advantage for White. BBNNRKRQ (SP 80) was the least balanced position with 0.57 advantage for White, while 27 different starting positions evaluate as equal, or 0.00 advantage for White or Black, for example BBRNNQKR (SP 432). The standard chess starting position RNBQKBNR (SP 518) was evaluated at 0.22 advantage for White. Hence, on average, a Chess960 starting position is actually 18.2% more balanced than the standard starting position.\nTournaments.\nMainz Championships.\n\"Note: None of the Mainz championships were recognized by FIDE. Furthermore, they were all played with rapid time controls.\"\nComputers.\nIn 2005, chess program The Baron played two Fischer Random Chess games against Chess960 World Champion Peter Svidler, who won 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd. The chess program Shredder, developed by Stefan Meyer-Kahlen of Germany, played two games against Zolt\u00e1n Alm\u00e1si from Hungary, where Shredder won 2\u20130.\nTCEC has held TCEC FRC since 2019 where Stockfish has won every edition except the 2021 edition which was won by Komodo. Since 2022, they have also held tournaments for an additional variant called DFRC (Double Fischer Random Chess) or FRD (Fischer Random Double), which arrange the starting positions for White and Black separately instead of requiring them to be mirrored. There are thus 960 \u00d7 960 = 921,600 possible starting positions, and more potential for the positions to be unbalanced. These events have all been won by Stockfish.\nMiscellaneous matches.\nFrom February 9 to 13, 2018, a Chess960 match between former classical World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen and the unofficial Fischer Random Chess world champion Hikaru Nakamura was held in H\u00f8vikodden, Norway. The match consisted of 8 rapid and 8 blitz games, with the rapid games counting double. Each position was used in two games, with colors reversed. Carlsen prevailed with a score of 14\u201310.\nSaint Louis Chess Club's Champions Showdown: Chess 9LX.\n2018 \u2013 From September 11 to 14, 2018, the Saint Louis Chess Club held a Chess960 event, but they did not yet call their event 'Chess 9LX'. (They started next year.) The playing format consisted of individual matches, each pair of players facing the same five different starting positions, with 6 rapid games (counting 2 points each) and 14 blitz games (counting 1 point each). \"Players and scores:\"\n2019 \u2013 The playing format once again consisted of individual matches. \"Players and scores:\"\n2020 \u2013 The playing format changed to a round robin. The event was won by both (There was no tiebreaker) former world (standard) chess champion Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura. Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura got 6/9. Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian got 5\u00bd/9. Wesley So scored 5/9, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Leinier Dominguez Perez got 4/9. Garry Kasparov scored 3\u00bd/9, Peter Svidler 3/9 and Alireza Firouzja 2\u00bd/9.\n2021 \u2013 The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Leinier Dom\u00ednguez P\u00e9rez.\n2022 \u2013 The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Fabiano Caruana who defeated Alireza Firouzja in armageddon.\n2023 \u2013 The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. Sam Sevian won with 7/9. Wesley So, Levon Aronian and Sam Shankland got 6/9. Fabiano Caruana scored 5\u00bd/9, Hikaru Nakamura 4/9, Jeffrey Xiong 3\u00bd/9, Garry Kasparov 3/9, Leinier Dominguez 2\u00bd/9 and Ray Robson 1\u00bd/9.\n2024 \u2013 The playing format was a round robin with 10 players. The event was won by Fabiano Caruana.\nFIDE World Championships 2019 and 2022.\nOn April 20, 2019, the first world championship in Fischer Random Chess officially recognized by FIDE was announced. It ended on November 2, 2019. In the finals, Wesley So defeated the former and four-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen 13\u00bd\u20132\u00bd (4 wins, 0 losses, 2 draws) to become the inaugural world Fischer Random Chess champion.\nIn the announcement, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich commented: It is an unprecedented move that the International Chess Federation recognizes a new variety of chess, so this was a decision that required to be carefully thought out. But we believe that Fischer Random is a positive innovation: It injects new energies and enthusiasm into our game, but at the same time it doesn't mean a rupture with our classical chess and its tradition. It is probably for this reason that Fischer Random chess has won the favor of the chess community, including the top players and the world champion himself. FIDE couldn't be oblivious to that: It was time to embrace and incorporate this modality of chess.\nOn August 19, 2022, the second world championship was announced for later in 2022, in Iceland. This is exactly half a century after the World Chess Championship 1972 held in Iceland between Fischer and Boris Spassky. On October 30, Hikaru Nakamura played the finals against Ian Nepomniachtchi, who had earlier knocked out Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura won in the armageddon after drawing the match 2\u20132.\nFreestyle Chess.\nThe eight-player Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge was the first major Chess960 tournament that used classical chess time controls. It took place in Germany from February 9\u201316, 2024. Fischer Random world champion Nakamura was reportedly invited, but did not play in the event. Magnus Carlsen won the tournament by defeating Fabiano Caruana in the finals.\nFollowing the success of the first tournament, organizers Carlsen and Jan Henric Buettner launched the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour in 2025, comprising five \"Grand Slam\" tournaments and one open tournament. The winner of the tour will be awarded the title of Freestyle Chess Champion.\nCoding games and positions.\nRecorded games must convey the Fischer Random Chess starting position. Games recorded using the Portable Game Notation (PGN) can record the initial position using Forsyth\u2013Edwards Notation (FEN), as the value of the \"FEN\" tag. Castling is notated the same as in classical chess (except PGN requires letter \"O\", not number \"0\"). Note that not all chess programs can handle castling correctly in Fischer Random Chess games. To correctly record a Fischer Random Chess game in PGN, an additional \"Variant\" tag (not \"Variation\" tag, which has a different meaning) must be used to identify the rules; the rule named \"Fischerandom\" is accepted by many chess programs as identifying Fischer Random Chess, though \"Chess960\" should be accepted as well. This means that in a PGN-recorded game, one of the PGN tags (after the initial seven tags) would look like this: [Variant \"Fischerandom\"].\nFEN is capable of expressing all possible starting positions of Fischer Random Chess; however, unmodified FEN cannot express all possible positions of a Chess960 game. In a game, a rook may move into the back row on the same side of the king as the other rook, or pawn(s) may be underpromoted into rook(s) and moved into the back row. If a rook is unmoved and can still castle, yet there is more than one rook on that side, FEN notation as traditionally interpreted is ambiguous. This is because FEN records that castling is possible on that side, but not \"which\" rook is still allowed to castle.\nA modification of FEN, X-FEN, has been devised by Reinhard Scharnagl to remove this ambiguity. In X-FEN, the castling markings \"KQkq\" have their expected meanings: \"Q\" and \"q\" mean a-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively), and \"K\" and \"k\" mean h-side castling is still legal (for White and Black respectively). However, if there is more than one rook on the baseline on the same side of the king, and the rook that can castle is not the outermost rook on that side, then the file letter (uppercase for White) of the rook that can castle is used instead of \"K\", \"k\", \"Q\", or \"q\"; in X-FEN notation, castling potentials belong to the outermost rooks by default. The maximum length of the castling value is still four characters. X-FEN is upwardly compatible with FEN, that is, a program supporting X-FEN will automatically use the normal FEN codes for a traditional chess starting position without requiring any special programming. As a benefit, all 18 pseudo FRC positions (positions with traditional placements of rooks and king) still remain uniquely encoded.\nThe solution implemented by chess engines like Shredder and Fritz is to use the letters of the columns on which the rooks began the game. This scheme is sometimes called Shredder-FEN. For the traditional setup, Shredder-FEN would use HAha instead of KQkq.\nSimilar variants.\nThere are several variants based on randomization of the initial setup. \"Randomized Chess, in one or other of its many reincarnations, continues to attract support even, or perhaps especially, that of top players.\"\nRemarks\nAny variant with N starting positions can exist with mirroring (or rotating) white and black otherwise it means another (double) variant with N2 starting positions. In any variant the castling is not possible in any case or is possible only when king and rook are on their traditional starting squares, or as follows:\nAfter castling with the nearest rook to the column:\nThe double chess2880 without castling is known as Transcendental chess (or TC).\nChess18 is the subset of Chess960 in which the kings and rooks are fixed on the same positions as in the standard starting position (rooks on the a and h files; king on the e file). Due to this, castling always works as with orthodox rules, preserving more of the feel of ordinary chess. This allows some opening knowledge to still have practical relevance, as one could practically learn a few short lines for each of the eighteen starting positions, with the potential to be a much more significant aspect of the game than in Chess960 for top players, though it does not reach the extent of orthodox chess, in which memorizing many long computer lines is a common practice. However, Chess18 excludes all starting positions where White has a large advantage (such as corner squares with bishops), and makes early blunders less common by making it impossible for a bishop to attack an undefended pawn after White's first move. Further, due to the lower diversity in starting positions, Chess18 has much less positional diversity than is offered by Chess960. Chess18 positions are more likely than Chess960 positions to resemble structures found in traditional chess.\nAs discussed above in 'Castling rules', Chess870 and Chess90 are the partitioning subsets of Chess960 in which a player, respectively, never needs or may need to give up castling rights on one side to castle on the other side.\nChess480\nIn \"Castling in Chess960: An appeal for simplicity\", John Kipling Lewis proposes alternative castling rules which Lewis has named \"Orthodox Castling\".\nThe preconditions for castling are the same as in Chess960, but when castling,\n... the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards (or over) the rook, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has just crossed (if it is not already there). If the king and rook are adjacent in a corner and the king cannot move two spaces over the rook, then the king and rook exchange squares.\nUnlike Chess960, the final position after castling in Chess480 will usually \"not\" be the same as the final position of a castling move in traditional chess. Lewis argues that this alternative better conforms to how the castling move was historically developed.\nLewis has named this chess variation \"Chess480\"; it follows the rules of Chess960 with the exception of the castling rules. Although a Chess480 game can start with any of 960 starting positions, the castling rules are symmetrical (whereas the Chess960 castling rules are not), so that mirror-image positions have identical strategies; thus there are only 480 \"effectively\" different positions. The number of starting positions could be reduced to 480 without losing any possibilities, for example by requiring the white king to start on a light (or dark) square.\nThere are other claims to the nomenclature \"Chess480\"; Reinhard Scharnagl defines it as the white queen is always to the left of the white king.\nDavid O'Shaughnessy argues in \"Castling in Chess480: An appeal for sanity\" that the Chess480 rules are often not useful from a gameplay perspective. In about 66% of starting positions, players have the options of castling deeper into the wing the king started on, or castling into the center of the board (when the king starts on the b-, c-, f-, or g-files). An example of poor castling options is a position where the kings start on g1 and g8 respectively. There will be no possibility of \"opposite-side castling\" where each player's pawns are free to be used in pawn storms, as the kings' scope for movement is very restricted (it can only move to the h- or e-file). These \"problem positions\" play well with Chess960 castling rules.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

Thompson", "text": "American politician\nRichard Wigginton Thompson (June 9, 1809 \u2013 February 9, 1900) was the Secretary of the Navy under President Rutherford B. Hayes.\nEarly life.\nThompson was born in Culpeper County, Virginia. He left Virginia in 1831 and lived briefly in Louisville, Kentucky before finally settling in Lawrence County, Indiana. There, he taught school, kept a store, and studied law at night. Admitted to the bar in 1834 and he practiced law in Bedford, Indiana. \nPolitical career.\nState career.\nHe served four terms in the Indiana General Assembly from 1834 to 1838. He served as President pro tempore of the Indiana Senate for a short time and briefly held the office of acting Lieutenant Governor.\nFederal Politics.\nIn the presidential election of 1840, he zealously advocated the election of William Henry Harrison. Thompson then represented Indiana in the United States Congress, serving in the United States House of Representatives from 1841 to 1843 and again from 1847 to 1849.\nDuring the 1850s Thompson and some of his fellow Whigs (such as his friend Schuyler Colfax) transferred allegiance to the American Party, better known as the Know Nothing Party. They did so due to their suspicion of the increased immigration from Ireland and Germany, but also because of the view of the northern portion of the American Party to be opposed to slavery. In time Thompson and his allies would allow an alliance of their portion of the Whig Party (which was collapsing with the American Party to prevent victories in elections by the Democratic Party.\nIn the election of 1860 Thompson was his state's leader of those who organized the Constitutional Union Party. At the May convention, Indiana first supported John McLean, but fell in behind John Bell on the second ballot. Thompson was placed on the National Committee, but gave up the on third party strategy in August and supported Abraham Lincoln so as not to risk a Democratic victory in Indiana.\nFollowing the American Civil War, Thompson served as judge of the 18th Circuit Court of the state of Indiana from 1867 to 1869. Active in Republican politics, he was the Platform Committee chairman at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he offered Vice President Schuyler Colfax's name for renomination at the 1872 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, and gave the nominating speech for Oliver H. P. Morton for president at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him Secretary of the Navy; and he held that office until December 1880.\nSecretary of the Navy.\nThompson, as Secretary of the Navy, had never been among the leading figures of the Cabinet (William Evarts, John Sherman, or Carl Schurz) nor had been even a close colleague and friend of President Hayes like Vice President William Wheeler. Even the Postmaster General, David Key, who was the second Confederate veteran to serve in a Federal Cabinet since the American Civil War was more notable. Reputedly Thompson was unprepared for his post. A popular (if suspect) story is that he was taken for a tour of one of our warships, and went below deck becoming thunderstruck and shouting, \"My God, the durned thing's hollow!!\" Thompson (being from Indiana) was not from a state with a seacoast, but Indiana has several rivers running through it. It is not hard to believe Thompson was on a steamboat at some point and saw the inside of it.\nWhen he assumed the role of Secretary of the Navy he was replacing Grant's Secretary for nearly eight years, George Robeson. Whatever was the situation caused or allowed by Robeson's handling of the Navy, Thompson offered little additional guidance. His most notable involvement in any naval activity was actually on the sidelines: when Lt. George Washington De Long and James Gordon Bennett Jr. set up the USS \"Jeannette\" Expedition to the North Pole in 1879, Thompson gave some advice to the preparations, but seemed determined to watch the extent of Government involvement in the project. His waffling (about escort vessels and later rescue vessels) were somewhat irritating. While not responsible for that tragedy, Thompson certainly did not help matters by his hair-splitting legalisms.\nIn 1880 a new matter arose that had a bearing with Thompson leaving his post. The French were in the process of funding the new Panama Canal Company under Comte Ferdinand de Lesseps. The Hayes administration, while willing to keep good relations with the French, were fully suspicious about a French-owned Canal across the Isthmus of Panama as a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Thompson was aware of this. But Thompson was also approached by the American-based section of the Panama Company with a job offer. The American section was headed and funded by J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., then headed by Jessie Seligman. The Seligmans were old friends of former President Ulysses S. Grant and had offered Grant the position of the Presidency of the Canal Company. But Grant refused it. Looking around for a replacement they turned to Thompson. He accepted and then resigned from the Cabinet. Later on, this whole matter became an issue before the Congressional Committee that questioned both Seligman and Thompson. Eventually, Thompson would leave the Panama Company, but his reputation was somewhat tarnished by the situation. He was not connected with it at the time of the great scandalous collapse of the enterprise in 1889.\nLater life and honors.\nRetiring to Indiana, Thompson lived out the remainder of his days in his adopted state. He died in 1900 at Terre Haute, Indiana.\nThe United States Navy destroyer USS \"Thompson\" (DD-305) was named in his honor.\nHe was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Alabama (Psi chapter), and an active Freemason and member of Terre Haute Lodge No. 19, F&amp;AM, serving as the Master of Terre Haute Lodge No. 19 in 1859 &amp; 1860.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the namesake of the destroyer USS \"Thompson\" (DD-627).\nBiography.\nHe was born in Corsica, Pennsylvania, of Protestant Scotch and Irish descent to Judge of the Jefferson County PA court John Jamison Thompson and Agnes Kennedy.\nNavy days.\nThompson was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 30 July 1864. Graduating tenth in the class of 1868, Thompson first went to sea in \"Contoocook\" in the West Indian Squadron. He later served in \"Franklin\", \"Richmond\", and \"Guard\" of the Mediterranean Squadron; as well as in USS \"Wachusett\" and at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island. Commissioned ensign on 19 April 1869, and promoted to master on 12 July 1870, he resigned from the Navy on 18 November 1871, to study law in his brother's office. \nLawyer.\nAfter he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1872, he was still not satisfied with his legal training so he studied law at Harvard, graduating in 1874. Thompson subsequently practiced law in Boston and was a member of the Boston Common Council from 1876 to 1878.\nMetallurgist.\nThompson later became interested in mining and smelting enterprises, by which he earned his fortune. He became president of Orford Copper and Nickel Company, and it was at his refinery in Constable Hook New Jersey where he earned https://, \"Method of obtaining sulphide of nickel\".\nA Boston entrepreneur named W. E. C. Eustis from Milton bought what was to become the Orford Nickel and Copper Company in 1865 in order to develop a mineral deposit discovered near Sherbrooke, Quebec, in Orford, Quebec. In March 1878 Eustis, Thompson, Robert Gilmour Leckie, Charles Carroll Colby and Walter W. Beckett established the Orford Nickel and Copper Company in Quebec. Thompson et al established the New Jersey refinery to process the ore from Orford there.\nOrford Copper was the generatrix in 1900 of the Ontario Smelting Company and Orford Village which Thompson set up near what was to become known as Copper Cliff, at Cobalt Street. \nIn 1902 Orford Copper merged with the Canadian Copper Company and American Nickel Works, into the International Nickel Company of Canada, of which he served as chairman for at least a decade.\nResidence.\nIn 1907 he lived in a stone mansion at 1607 23rd Street NW in Washington, D.C. which was recently built by New York attorney Frank Ellis. The mansion is in the Beaux-arts style and was designed by the firm of Carr\u00e8re and Hastings which designed many significant buildings of the era. Ellis sold the mansion to Roumania in 1921 and it has been used as its embassy ever since.\nPhilanthropy.\nHe was an organizer of the Navy Athletic Association and the donor of the Thompson Cup, which is awarded to the member of the Navy Midshipmen who contributes most to the advancement of athletics at the Naval Academy. His interest in sport then extended to the Olympic Games, and was twice president of the American Olympic Association, once for the 1912 Summer Olympics, and again for the 1924 games. In 1912, he was also elected president of the New York Athletic Club. He also helped to organize the New York Chapter of the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and served as its first president and as a trustee of the Naval Academy Alumni Association at Annapolis, Maryland.\nThompson was president of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers and president of the Navy League, and owner of the yacht \"Katrina\". He also visited Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class, by the Emperor. He also received the Order of Vasa by the government of Sweden, and the Cross of Commander, French Legion of Honor, by the French government.\nThompson became a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) in 1874 through the Massachusetts commandery. He was active in MOLLUS affairs and was elected commander in chief 27 October 1927, and served in that capacity until his death.\nHe was also a companion of the Naval Order of the United States and a strong supporter of the Navy League of the United States.\nHe co-edited the \"Confidential Correspondence of Gustavus Vasa Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy\" for the Navy Historical Society.\nDeath and family life.\nRobert Means Thompson was married to Sarah Gibbs, daughter of Rhode Island governor, William C.

It is based on Herman Wouk's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1951 novel of the same name. Set in the Pacific theatre of World War II, the film depicts the events on board a U.S. Navy destroyer-minesweeper and the subsequent court-martial of its executive officer for mutiny.\nThe film was released by Columbia Pictures on June 24, 1954. It was well-received by critics and was the second highest-grossing film in the United States in 1954. At the 27th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Humphrey Bogart. Edward Dmytryk was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award.\nPlot.\nDuring World War II, newly commissioned Ensign Willis Seward \"Willie\" Keith reports to the minesweeper USS \"Caine\", where he meets career officer Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, the ship\u2019s executive officer, and aspiring novelist and communications officer Lieutenant Thomas Keefer. Soon after, Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg is assigned command of the \"Caine\". The eccentric Queeg instills strict discipline on the lax crew, making him unpopular with them, but admired by Keith.\nDuring a gunnery target towing exercise, Queeg is distracted berating Keith and Keefer over a crewman\u2019s appearance, resulting in the ship steering over and cutting the towline, setting the target adrift. Queeg tries to cover up the incident.\nAssigned to escort a group of landing craft during an invasion of a small Pacific island, Queeg abandons his mission before he reaches the designated departure point, and instead orders the dropping of a yellow dye marker, leaving the landing craft to fend for themselves. Queeg asks his officers for their support, but they remain silent and nickname him \"Old Yellowstain\", which implies cowardice.\nKeefer, believing Queeg to be paranoid, encourages Maryk to consider relieving Queeg on the basis of mental incapacity under Article 184 of Navy Regulations. Though Maryk angrily rejects that possibility, he does begin keeping a medical log documenting the captain's behavior.\nWhen strawberries go missing from the officers' mess, Queeg convenes an elaborate investigation to determine the culprit. The investigation involves searching the ship and stripping all crew members. Convinced of Queeg's instability, Maryk asks Keefer and Keith to go with him to see Admiral Halsey about the matter. Arriving aboard Halsey's flagship, Keefer backs down and they return to the ship.\nAt the height of a typhoon, Maryk urges the captain to reverse course into the wind and take on ballast, but Queeg refuses and virtually freezes up on the bridge. Maryk, supported by Keith, relieves Queeg of command under Article 184. The \"Caine\" returns to San Francisco, where Maryk and Keith face a court-martial for mutiny. Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a temporarily grounded naval aviator and an attorney before entering the Navy, becomes Maryk's defense counsel.\nAt the court-martial, Keefer claims he never observed any mental illness in Queeg and was \"flabbergasted\" when he was relieved. Under Greenwald's relentless cross-examination, Queeg exhibits odd behavior on the stand, including his habit of rolling two steel balls in his hand symbolizing his mental instability, and Maryk is acquitted.\nFollowing the acquittal, the officers of the \"Caine\" hold a party, where Keefer receives a frosty reception from Maryk. A drunken Greenwald arrives and berates all the officers for not appreciating Queeg's long service and failing to give him the support he asked for, instead of deriding him as an incompetent. Greenwald claims their mistreatment of Queeg, who had been suffering from \"battle fatigue\" from his previous combat service in the Atlantic, caused the captain to ultimately become indecisive during the typhoon. He denounces Keefer as the real \"author\" of the mutiny and throws a glass of champagne, the \"yellow wine\", in Keefer's face. The rest of the officers walk out, leaving Keefer alone in the room.\nKeith, now married to his girlfriend May Wynn, is promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade), and assigned to a new Allen M. Sumner-class destroyer commanded by now-Commander De Vriess, his first captain on the \"Caine\".\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Humphrey Bogart as LCDR Philip Francis Queeg\nPre-production.\nWriting.\nHerman Wouk had already adapted his novel as a stage play, \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial\", which premiered on Broadway in January 1954 and ran for more than a year. The play was directed by Charles Laughton and was a critical as well as a commercial success. Wouk was initially selected to write the screenplay, but director Dmytryk was dissatisfied with his draft. He replaced the novelist with Stanley Roberts, an experienced screenwriter. Roberts later quit the production after being told to cut the screenplay so the film could be kept to two hours. The 50 pages worth of cuts were made by Michael Blankfort, who received an \"additional dialog\" credit.\nThe film differs from the novel, which focused on the Keith character, who became secondary in the film. The film instead focuses on Queeg. Independent producer Stanley Kramer \"mollified the Navy\" by modifying the Queeg characterization to make him less of a madman, as portrayed by Wouk, and more a victim of battle fatigue. Studios did not want to purchase the film rights to Wouk's novel until cooperation of the U.S. Navy was settled. Kramer purchased the rights himself for an estimated $60,000 \u2013 $70,000. The Navy's reluctance to cooperate led to an unusually long pre-production period.\nCasting and director.\nStanley Kramer and Columbia Pictures intended to cast Humphrey Bogart as Philip Queeg. Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn knew that Bogart wanted the part and took advantage of that fact, and he was eventually able to force Bogart to settle for much less than his usual $200,000 salary. \"This never happens to Cooper or Grant or Gable, but always to me\", Bogart complained to his wife, Lauren Bacall.\nVan Johnson was loaned to Columbia by MGM, where he was under contract. Being cast as Maryk was a breakthrough for the actor, who felt that he had been in a \"rut\" by being typecast in light roles. During the filming of the scene off Oahu in which Maryk swims fully clothed to retrieve a line, his character is warned that there are sharks in the water; these sharks do not appear on camera, but the actor's life was saved when a real-life Navy rifleman shot one which was approaching. Lee Marvin was cast as one of the sailors, not only for his acting, but also because of his knowledge of ships at sea. Marvin had served in the U.S. Marines from the beginning of American involvement in World War II through the Battle of Saipan in 1944, during which he was wounded. As a result, he became an unofficial technical advisor for the film.\nBefore choosing Dmytryk for \"The Caine Mutiny\", Kramer had hired the director for three low-budget films. Dmytryk had previously been blacklisted, and the success of the film helped revive his career.\n\"The Caine Mutiny\" would be the first feature role in Robert Francis's short four-film Hollywood career, as he was killed when the private plane he was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff from Burbank Airport in California on July 31, 1955.\nProduction.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography took place between June 3 and August 24, 1953 under the initial working title of \"Authority and Rebellion\".\nIn addition to the Pearl Harbor and San Francisco Bay Area locations, including the \"Caine\" steaming back and forth several times under the Golden Gate Bridge, the romantic subplot features scenes shot on location at Yosemite National Park.\nThe , a destroyer minesweeper, was one of the ships chosen to represent the USS \"Caine\" in the film. The \"Rodman\" had one less smokestack than the actual s on which Wouk served, and had more anti-aircraft guns. Completed in 1941, she was a much more modern ship than the 1918-manufactured \"Clemson\"-class destroyer minesweepers had been. True to the theme of the novel, the actual minesweepers of Wouk's service, the and the , were both outdated ships by the time the film was made. The \"Zane\" was retired shortly after the war, and the \"Southard\" was scuttled in October 1945 after running aground in Okinawa with Wouk serving as Executive Officer. One of the primary inspirations for the book and the movie came from Wouk's experience as second in command of the \"Southard\" when she ran aground in Okinawa as a result of Typhoon Ida in September 1945. The Essex-class aircraft carrier was used in depicting the abortive visit to Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. aboard his unnamed flagship.\nColumbia claimed the film contained the longest continuous courtroom scene without a cut, running to 977 feet, surpassing a scene in \"The Life of Emile Zola\".\nNavy involvement.\nThe Navy was initially uncomfortable with both the portrayal of a mentally unbalanced man as the captain of one of its ships and the word \"mutiny\" in the film's title. After Stanley Roberts' shooting script was completed and approved by the Navy after 15 months of negotiations, the Department agreed to cooperate with Columbia Pictures by providing access to its ships, planes, combat boats, Pearl Harbor, the port of San Francisco, and Naval Station Treasure Island for filming. Dmytryk recalled in his memoir that after \"noisy\" protests from the Navy subsided, the film production received wholehearted cooperation. This included the conversion of two soon to be decommissioned destroyer/destroyer minesweepers, and , as facsimiles to portray the USS \"Caine\".\nAn epigraph appears on screen immediately following the opening credits that reads: \"There has never been a mutiny in a ship of the United States Navy. The truths of this film lie not in its incidents, but in the way a few men meet the crisis of their lives.\" In 1842, an incipient mutiny was quashed before it occurred on board the US Navy Brig USS \"Somers\".\nMusic.\nThis was the last of a number of Bogart films scored by composer Max Steiner, mostly for Warner Bros. The main title theme, \"The Caine Mutiny March\", was included in RCA Victor's collection of classic Bogart film scores, recorded by Charles Gerhardt and the National Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe lyrics of the song, \"Yellowstain Blues\", which mocked Queeg's perceived cowardice during the landing incident, were drawn from the source novel.\nSoundtrack.\nThe original soundtrack album for \"The Caine Mutiny\" was not officially released until 2017, and copies of the soundtrack made before that are very rare. Perhaps a dozen copies survive. RCA Victor planned an LP release with musical excerpts on the first side and the complete dialogue of the climactic court-martial scene on side two, but Herman Wouk believed that including this scene was an infringement on his recently opened Broadway play dealing with the court-martial. He threatened to prohibit Columbia Pictures from making any further adaptations of his work. According to Wouk, \"Columbia head Harry Cohn looked into the matter, called me back, and said in his tough gravelly voice, 'I've got you beat on the legalities, but I've listened to the record and it's no goddamn good, so I'm yanking it.'\" Max Steiner's score was finally released by Intrada Records in 2017 as Special Collection Volume ISC 382.\nReception.\nThe film premiered in New York City on June 24, 1954, and went into general release on July 28. Made on a budget of $2 million, it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1954, earning $8.7 million in theatrical rentals in the United States. It was the most successful of Kramer's productions, some of which had previously lost money, and put his entire production company \u2013 as well as Columbia Pictures \u2013 in the black.\nThe film got a major pre-release boost three weeks before its premiere when Bogart as Queeg appeared on the cover of the June 7, 1954 issue of \"Time\" magazine. The accompanying cover story (\"Cinema: The Survivor\") praised Bogart's portrayal of Queeg as \"a blustering, secretive figure in Navy suntans, who brings the hollow, driven, tyrannical character of Captain Queeg to full and invidious life, yet seldom fails to maintain a bond of sympathy with his audience. He deliberately gives Queeg the mannerisms and appearance of an officer of sternness and decision, and then gradually discloses him as a man who is bottling up a scream, a man who never meets another's eyes. In the courtroom scene, Bogart's Queeg seems oblivious of his own mounting hysteria. Then, suddenly, he knows he is undone; he stops and stares stricken at the court, during second after ticking second of dramatic and damning silence.\"\nFilm critic Pauline Kael mentions that the film was a fiasco because the material disintegrated in the photography, direction and acting.\nDirector Edward Dmytryk felt \"The Caine Mutiny\" could have been better than it was and should have been three and a half to four hours long to fully portray all the characters and complex story, but Columbia's Cohn insisted on a two-hour limit. Reviewing the film in \"The New York Times\", Bosley Crowther wrote that the job of condensing Wouk's novel to two hours had been achieved \"with clarity and vigor, on the whole.\" His reservations concerned the studio's attempt to \"cram\" in \"more of the novel than was required\", such as the \"completely extraneous\" love affair between Keith and May Wynn, which Crowther found to be a plot diversion that weakened dramatic tension. Although he doubted whether the novel had a structure suited for film, he noted that Roberts had \"endeavored to follow it faithfully.\" The result, he argued, was that the court-martial became \"an anticlimax\" as it repeated Queeg's visible collapse seen in the typhoon but still considered the core of the film \"smartly and stingingly played\" and \"though somewhat garbled\" was still \"a vibrant film.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 41 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Humphrey Bogart is superb as a domineering captain with brittle composure in \"The Caine Mutiny\", an inquisitive courtroom drama teeming with memorable performances.\"\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"The Caine Mutiny\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nLegacy.\nIn his book \"American Literature on Stage and Film\", historian Thomas S. Hischak says that Dmytryk handled both the action sequences and character portrayals deftly, and calls Queeg's breakdown during the trial \"the stuff of movie legend.\"\nThe film and novel influenced the drafters of the 25th Article Of Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which set forth conditions for removing the President of the United States. John D. Feerick, former dean of Fordham University School of Law, who assisted in drafting the amendment, told \"The Washington Post\" in 2018 that the film was a \"live depiction\" of the type of crisis that could arise \"if a president ever faced questions about physical or mental inabilities but disagreed completely with the judgment\", which was not dealt with in the Constitution. Lawmakers and lawyers drafting the amendment wanted no such \"Article 184 situation\" as depicted in the film, in which the Vice President of the U.S. or others could topple the President by merely saying that the President was \"disabled\".\nCultural influence.\nWhen Michael Caine, born Maurice Micklewhite, first became an actor he adopted the stage name \"Michael White\". He was later told by his agent that another actor was already using the same name, and that he had to come up with a new one immediately. Speaking to his agent from a telephone box in Leicester Square in London, he looked around for inspiration. Being a fan of Bogart, he noted that \"The Caine Mutiny\" was being shown at the Odeon Cinema, and adopted a new name from the movie title. Caine has often joked in interviews that, had he looked the other way, he would have ended up as \"Michael One Hundred and One Dalmatians\".\nVince Gilligan used a clip of the film in a \"Breaking Bad\" episode titled \"Madrigal\", originally transmitted in 2012, and has stated that \"The Caine Mutiny\" was one of his favorite movies as a child. The final scene of \"Chicanery\", an episode of the \"Breaking Bad\" spinoff series \"Better Call Saul\", is an homage to the film's climactic courtroom scene.\nIn \"\", members of the human resistance serve aboard the submarine USS \"Jimmy Carter\" piloted by a reprogrammed Terminator that has been named \"Queeg\" by the crew.\nIn the \" episode \", the obsessive Commodore Matt Decker, portrayed by William Windom, fusses constantly with two futuristic tape cartridges, much as Captain Queeg rubs together two bearing balls. Windom publicly acknowledged that Decker's behavior was based on Queeg's.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

North of this, in the centre of the county, is Sherwood Forest, the remnant of a large ancient woodland.\nHistory.\nNottinghamshire lies on the Roman Fosse Way, and there are Roman settlements in the county; for example at Mansfield, and forts such as at the Broxtowe Estate in Bilborough. The county was settled by Angles around the 5th century, and became part of the Kingdom, and later Earldom, of Mercia. However, there is evidence of Saxon settlement at the Broxtowe Estate, Oxton, near Nottingham, and Tuxford, east of Sherwood Forest. The name first occurs in 1016, but until 1568, the county was administratively united with Derbyshire, under a single Sheriff. In Norman times, the county developed malting and woollen industries.\nThe village of Edwinstowe close to Sherwood Forest took the name from Edwin of Northumbria, who died in 633 nearby and was provisionally buried in St Mary's Church, Edwinstowe.\nWilliam the Conqueror in 1066 made Sherwood Forest a Royal Forest for hunting which was frequently visited by the Mercian and later Kings.\nWilliam's 1086 Domesday Book identified certain areas in Nottinghamshire being under the land of King Edward the Confessor these included Mansfield and Sutton in Ashfield, amongst other places including Skegby, Dunham-on-Trent, East Drayton, East Markham, Farnsfield, Warsop, Carburton, Edwinstowe, Carlton-on-Trent, Budby, Perlethorpe and Walesby.\nKing John's Palace ruin near Kings Clipstone was a royal residence for King John, the area being near to Sherwood Forest. King John's Palace was a place where William I met Richard I to congratulate him on his return from the crusades. King John died at Newark Castle in 1216.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the county held much needed minerals such as coal and iron ore, and had constructed some of the first experimental waggonways in the world; an example of this is the Wollaton wagonway of 1603\u20131616, which transported minerals from bell pit mining areas at Strelley and Bilborough, this led to canals and railways being constructed in the county, and the lace and cotton industries grew. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mechanised deeper collieries opened, and mining became an important economic sector. Although there are no remaining working mines in Nottinghamshire now.\nUntil 1610, Nottinghamshire was divided into eight Wapentakes. Sometime between 1610 and 1719, they were reduced to six \u2013 Newark, Bassetlaw, Thurgarton, Rushcliffe, Broxtowe, and Bingham, some of these names still being used for the modern districts. Oswaldbeck was absorbed in Bassetlaw, of which it forms the North Clay division, and Lythe in Thurgarton.\nMansfield and surrounding areas in Nottinghamshire in the 17th century became the centre of nonconformism in separation from the Church of England. In particular Mansfield became the birthplace of the Quakers with George Fox living in the town.\nNottinghamshire is famous for its involvement with the legend of Robin Hood. This is also the reason for the numbers of tourists who visit places like Sherwood Forest, City of Nottingham, and the surrounding villages in Sherwood Forest. To reinforce the Robin Hood connection, the University of Nottingham in 2010 has begun the Nottingham Caves Survey, with the goal \"to increase the tourist potential of these sites\". The project \"will use a 3D laser scanner to produce a three dimensional record of more than 450 sandstone caves around Nottingham\".\nNottinghamshire was mapped first by Christopher Saxton in 1576; the first fully surveyed map of the county was by John Chapman, who produced Chapman's Map of Nottinghamshire in 1774. The map was the earliest printed map at a sufficiently useful scale (one statute mile to one inch) to provide basic information on village layout, and the existence of landscape features such as roads, milestones, tollbars, parkland, and mills.\nNottinghamshire saw a slight change to its overall boundary in the extreme northern part of the county in 1974, when the villages of Blaxton, Finningley and Auckley (part) were merged into the Doncaster in South Yorkshire.\nPhysical geography.\nNottinghamshire, like Derbyshire, and South Yorkshire, sits on extensive coal measures, up to thick, and occurring largely in the north of the county. There is an oilfield near Eakring. These are overlaid by sandstones and limestones in the west, and clay in the east. The north of the county is part of the Humberhead Levels lacustrine plain. The centre and south west of the county, around Sherwood Forest, features undulating hills with ancient oak woodland. Principal rivers are the Trent, Idle, Erewash, and Soar. The Trent, fed by the Soar, Erewash, and Idle, composed of many streams from Sherwood Forest, run through wide and flat valleys, merging at Misterton. A point just north of Newtonwood Lane, on the boundary with Derbyshire is the highest point in Nottinghamshire; at , while Silverhill, a spoil heap left by the former Silverhill colliery, a human-made point often cited as the highest, reaches . The lowest is Peat Carr, east of Blaxton, at sea level; the Trent is tidal below Cromwell Lock.\nNottinghamshire is sheltered by the Pennines to the west, so receives relatively low rainfall at annually. The average temperature of the county is 8.8\u201310.1 degrees Celsius (48\u201350 degrees Fahrenheit). The county receives between 1321 and 1470 hours of sunshine per year.\nGreen belt.\nNottinghamshire contains one green belt area, first drawn up from the 1950s. Completely encircling the Nottingham conurbation, it stretches for several miles into the surrounding districts, and extends into Derbyshire.\nPolitics.\nNottinghamshire, including the city of Nottingham, is represented by eleven members of parliament; nine for the Labour Party, one Conservative and one Reform UK MP.\nFollowing the 2025 County Council election, Nottinghamshire County Council is controlled by Reform UK. The party went from having a single councillor before the election to winning a majority of the council's seats. The council is currently made up of 41 Reform UK councillors, 18 Conservatives, four Labour and three from local parties. Prior to the 2025 election, the council had been fully or partially controlled by the Conservative Party since 2017. The council had historically been under Labour control; the party held a majority on the council from 1981 to 2009.\nLocal government is devolved to seven local borough and district councils. Ashfield is controlled by the Ashfield Independents. Bassetlaw, Gedling and Mansfield are Labour-controlled. Newark and Sherwood is controlled by a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors. Rushcliffe is Conservative-controlled. Broxtowe is run by a minority Broxtowe Alliance administration. Nottingham City Council, which governs the Nottingham unitary authority and is independent of Nottinghamshire County Council, is majority Labour-controlled.\nPolitical control.\nNottinghamshire is a non-metropolitan county, governed by Nottinghamshire County Council and seven non-metropolitan district councils. Elections to the county council take place every four years, with the first election taking place in 1973. Following each election, the county council has been controlled by the following parties:\nEconomy and industry.\nThe regional economy was traditionally based on industries such as coal mining in the Leen Valley, and manufacturing. Since the invention of the knitting frame by local William Lee, the county, in particular Nottingham, became synonymous with the lace industry.\nIn 1998, Nottinghamshire had a gross domestic product (GDP) per-capita of \u00a312,000, and a total GDP of \u00a312,023\u00a0million. This is compared to a per-capita GDP of \u00a311,848 for the East Midlands, \u00a312,845 for England, and \u00a312,548 for the United Kingdom. Nottingham had a GDP per-capita of \u00a317,373, North Nottinghamshire \u00a310,176, and South Nottinghamshire \u00a38,448. In October 2005, the United Kingdom had 4.7% unemployment, the East Midlands 4.4%, and the Nottingham commuter belt area 2.4%.\nEducation.\nSecondary education.\nThe county has comprehensive secondary education with 47 state secondary schools, as well as 10 private schools. The City of Nottingham local education authority (LEA) has 18 state schools and six independent schools, not including sixth form colleges.\nA total of 9,700 pupils took GCSEs in the Nottinghamshire LEA in 2007. The best results were from the West Bridgford School, closely followed by Rushcliffe Spencer Academy and the Minster School in Southwell. In Nottingham, the best results came from the Trinity Catholic School and the Fernwood School in Wollaton.\nAt A-level, the highest performing institution was The Becket School, followed by the West Bridgford School. Some of Nottingham city best results tend to come from Nottingham High School, closely followed by the all-female Nottingham High School for Girls, both of which are privately run.\nWorksop College is another private school near to Worksop.\nHigher education.\nThe University of Nottingham is a Russell Group university and well-renowned, offering one of the broadest selections of courses in the UK. Nottingham Trent University is one of the most successful post-1992 universities in the UK. Nottingham is home to a campus of the University of Law. All three of these institutions combine to make Nottingham one of England's largest student cities. Nottingham Trent University also has an agricultural college near Southwell, while the University of Nottingham has one at Sutton Bonington.\nCulture.\nNottinghamshire is home to the Sherwood Forest, known for its association with the legend of Robin Hood.\nNottinghamshire contains the ancestral home of the poet Lord Byron, Newstead Abbey, which he sold in 1818. It is now owned by Nottingham City Council, and is open to the public. The acclaimed author D. H. Lawrence was from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire. Toton was the birthplace and home of English folk singer-songwriter Anne Briggs, well known for her song \"Black Waterside\". The north of the county is also noteworthy for its connections with the Pilgrim Fathers. William Brewster, for example, came from the village of Scrooby, and was influenced by Richard Clyfton, who preached at Babworth.\nNottinghamshire has international twinning arrangements with the province of Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) in western Poland, and with the province's capital city, Pozna\u0144.\nIn 2002, \"Crocus nudiflorus\" (Autumn crocus) was voted by the public as the county flower of Nottinghamshire.\nSport.\nNottinghamshire County Cricket Club (NCCC) are a first class county cricket club who play at Trent Bridge in West Bridgford. They won the County Championship in 2010.\nThe most successful football team within Nottinghamshire is Nottingham Forest, a Premier League club that won the 1978 English championship, and followed it up with winning the 1979 and 1980 European Cup titles although success has not been seen by most of their fans in living memory. Mansfield Town of League One and Notts County of League Two are the other professional teams in the county. Notts County are the world's oldest professional football club, being formed in 1862 and are world renowned for giving Juventus their black and white striped kit and opening their new stadium in 2011.\nOther notable sporting teams are the Nottingham Rugby Football Club, and the Nottingham Panthers Ice Hockey Club.\nFlag.\nAn unofficial flag for Nottinghamshire was created through a design competition organised by BBC Radio Nottingham, and registered with the vexillological charity the Flag Institute in 2011. It consists of a green field, on which is a red cross fimbriated (bordered) with white, on which a white shield containing the green figure of an archer is superimposed.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nBBC East Midlands is based in Nottingham and broadcasts news around the county; ITV Central also covers regional news in the county. Northern parts of the county such as Worksop and Retford in the Bassetlaw and Mansfield receive a better signals from the Emley Moor TV transmission so the area is covered by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire (West). Ashfield and parts of Newark get better signals from the Belmont TV tranmsitter that broadcast BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire (East).\nRadio.\nRadio stations for the county are:\nBBC Local Radio\nIndependent Local Radio\nCommunity Radio\nNewspapers.\nThe Nottingham Post is the county's local newspaper.\nDistricts and boroughs.\nSettlements and features.\nThe traditional county town, and the largest settlement in the historic and ceremonial county boundaries, is the City of Nottingham. The city is now administratively independent, but towns including Arnold, Carlton, West Bridgford, Beeston, and Stapleford are still within the administrative county, and West Bridgford is where the county council are based.\nThere are several market towns in the county. Newark-on-Trent is a bridging point of the Fosse Way and River Trent, but is actually an Anglo-Saxon market town with a now ruined castle. Mansfield, the second-largest settlement in the county after Nottingham, sits on the site of a Roman settlement, but grew after the Norman Conquest. Worksop, in the north of the county, is also an Anglo-Saxon market town which grew rapidly in the Industrial Revolution, with the arrival of canals and railways and the discovery of coal. Other market towns include Arnold, Bingham, Hucknall, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Tuxford, Retford and Sutton-in-Ashfield.\nThe main railway in the county is the Midland Main Line, which links London to Sheffield via Nottingham. The Robin Hood Line between Nottingham and Worksop serves several villages in the county. The East Coast Main Line from London to Doncaster, Leeds, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Scotland serves the eastern Nottinghamshire towns of Newark and Retford.\nThe M1 motorway runs through the county, connecting Nottingham to London, Leeds, and Leicester by road. The A1 road follows for the most part the path of the Great North Road, although in places it diverges from the historic route where towns have been bypassed. Retford was by-passed in 1961, and Newark-on-Trent was by-passed in 1964, and the A1 now runs between Retford and Worksop past the village of Ranby. Many historic coaching inns can still be seen along the traditional route.\nEast Midlands Airport is just outside the county in Leicestershire, while Doncaster Sheffield Airport lies within the historic boundaries of Nottinghamshire. These airports serve the county and several of its neighbours. Together, the airports have services to most major European destinations, and East Midlands Airport now also has services to North America and the Caribbean. As well as local bus services throughout the county, Nottingham and its suburbs have a tram system, Nottingham Express Transit.\nNottingham and its surrounding areas form part of the Nottingham Urban Area while Bassetlaw is a non-constituent part of the Sheffield City Region.\nPlaces of interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68055", "revid": "8560991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68055", "title": "Patron saint", "text": "Saint regarded as a heavenly advocate\nA patron saint, patroness saint, patron hallow or heavenly protector is a saint who in Catholicism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy is regarded as the heavenly advocate of a nation, place, craft, activity, class, clan, family, or person.\nThe term may be applied to individuals to whom similar roles are ascribed in other religions.\nIn Christianity.\nSaints often become the patrons of places where they were born or had been active. However, there were cases in medieval Europe where a city which grew to prominence obtained for its cathedral the remains or some relics of a famous saint who had lived and was buried elsewhere, thus making them the city's patron saint \u2013 such a practice conferred considerable prestige on the city concerned. In Latin America and the Philippines, Spanish and Portuguese explorers often named a location for the saint on whose feast or commemoration day they first visited the place, with that saint naturally becoming the area's patron.\nOccupations sometimes have a patron saint who had been connected somewhat with it, although some of the connections were tenuous. Lacking such a saint, an occupation would have a patron whose acts or miracles in some way recall the profession. For example, when the previously unknown occupation of photography appeared in the 19th century, Saint Veronica was made its patron, owing to how her veil miraculously received the imprint of Christ's face after she wiped off the blood and sweat.\nThe veneration or commemoration and recognition of patron saints or saints in general is found in Catholicism (including Eastern Catholicism), Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and among some Lutherans and Anglicans. According to the Catholic catechism a person's patron saint, having already attained the beatific vision, is able to intercede with God for their needs. \nApart from Lutheranism and Anglicanism, it is, however, generally discouraged in other Protestant branches, such as Reformed Christianity, where the practice is considered a form of idolatry.\nCatholicism.\nA saint can be assigned as a patron by a venerable tradition, or chosen by election. The saint is considered a special intercessor with God and the proper advocate of a particular locality, occupation, etc., and merits a special form of religious observance. A term in some ways comparable is \"titular\", which is applicable only to a church or institution.\nIn Islam.\nAlthough Islam has no codified doctrine of patronage on the part of saints, it has nevertheless been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic traditions that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. Martin Lings wrote: \"There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.\" As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, in a manner different from Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, \"patron saints\" are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the patron saint of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein.\nHowever, the Wahhabi and Salafi movements have latterly attacked the veneration of saints (as patron or otherwise), which they claim are a form of idolatry or \"shirk\". More mainstream Sunni clerics have critiqued this argument since Wahhabism first emerged in the 18th century.\nIn Druze faith.\nElijah and Jethro (Shuaib) are considered patron saints of the Druze people. In the Old Testament, Jethro was Moses' father-in-law, a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian. Muslim scholars and the Druze identify Jethro with the prophet Shuaib, also said to come from Midian. Shuaib or Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of the Druze who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet.\nDruze identify Elijah as \"al-Khidr\". Druze, like some Christians, believe that the Prophet Elijah came back as Saint John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul, Druze believe that El Khidr and Saint John the Baptist are one and the same; along with Saint George.\nDue to the Christian influence on the Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze's favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druzes and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druzes appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and the Prophet Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.\nIn Eastern religions.\nIn Hinduism, certain sects may devote themselves to the veneration of a saint, such as the Balmiki sect that reveres Valmiki.\nBuddhism also includes the idea of protector deities, which are called \"Dharma protectors\" (Dharmapala).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68056", "revid": "51014268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68056", "title": "DIVX", "text": "DVD-based format created as an alternative to video rental\nDIVX (Digital Video Express) is a discontinued digital video format. Created in part by Circuit City, it was an unsuccessful attempt to create an alternative to video rental in the United States by the mid\u2013late 1990s. The format's poor reception from consumers resulted in major financial losses for Circuit City and is credited with being part of the company's downfall.\nFormat.\nDIVX was a rental format variation on the DVD player in which a customer would buy a DIVX disc (similar to a DVD) for approximately US$4.50, which was watchable for up to 48\u00a0hours from its initial viewing. After this period, the disc could be viewed by paying a continuation fee to play it for two more days. Viewers who wanted to watch a disc an unlimited number of times could convert the disc to a \"DIVX silver\" disc for an additional fee. \"DIVX gold\" discs that could be played an unlimited number of times on any DIVX player were announced at the time of DIVX's introduction, but no DIVX gold titles were ever released.\nEach DIVX disc was marked with a unique barcode in the burst cutting area that could be read by the player, and used to track the discs. The status of the discs was monitored through an account over a phone line. DIVX player owners had to set up an account with DIVX to which additional viewing fees could be charged. The player would call an account server over the phone line to charge for viewing fees similar to the way DirecTV and Dish Network satellite systems handle pay-per-view.\nIn addition to the normal Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, DIVX discs used Triple DES encryption and an alternative channel modulation coding scheme, which prevented them from being read in standard DVD players. Most of the discs would be manufactured by United Kingdom-based Nimbus CD International.\nDIVX players manufactured by Zenith Electronics (who would go bankrupt shortly before the launch of the format), Thomson Consumer Electronics (RCA and ProScan), and Matsushita Electric (Panasonic) started to become available in mid-1998. These players differed from regular DVD players with the addition of a security IC chip (powered by ARM RISC and manufactured by VLSI) that controlled the encode/decode of the digital content. Mail systems were included on some players as well. Because of widespread studio support, manufacturers anticipated that demand for the units would be high. Initially, the players were approximately twice as expensive as standard DVD players, but price reductions occurred within months of release.\nHistory.\nDevelopment and launch.\nDIVX was introduced on September 8, 1997 (after previously being made under the code name Zoom TV), with the format under development since 1995. The format was a partnership between Circuit City and entertainment law firm Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca &amp; Fischer, with the former company investing $100 million into the latter firm. One advertiser attempted to sign with the company, but was unable to do so, which spurred a lawsuit between the two.\nThe product made a quiet showing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January 1998, but won the attention of 20th Century Fox, which on February 20, 1998 signed a deal to release their titles on the format. After multiple delays, the initial trial of the DIVX format was run in the San Francisco, California and Richmond, Virginia areas starting on June 8, 1998. Initially, only a single Zenith player was available starting at $499, along with 20 to 50 titles. Very few players sold during this time period, with The Good Guys chain alleging that fewer than 10 players were sold during this time period. A nationwide rollout began three months later, on September 21, again with only one Zenith player and 150 titles available in 190 stores in the western U.S.\nAt the format's launch, DIVX was sold primarily through the Circuit City, Good Guys, and Ultimate Electronics retailers. The format was promoted to consumers as an alternative to traditional video rental schemes with the promise of \"No returns, no late fees.\" Though consumers could just discard a DIVX disc after the initial viewing period, several DIVX retailers maintained DIVX recycling bins on their premises. On September 22, 1998, a fourth retailer, Canadian Future Shop, signed a contract with DIVX to stock the format, although only in 23 stores in the U.S. only. Thomson's player, after multiple delays, arrived on October 3, 1998, followed by Panasonic's on December 10. The format made its overall national debut on October 12, 1998. A marketing push began that November for the 1998 holiday season, with more than $1 million going into the campaign. The fortunes of the format would seemingly turn for the better in mid-December 1998, when a shortage of DVD players occurred. In total, 87,000 players were sold during the final quarter of 1998, with 535,000 discs across 300 titles being sold, although fewer than 17,000 accounts for DIVX were created.\nOpposition.\nAlmost immediately after the format's reveal, a movement on the Internet was initiated against DIVX, particularly in home theater forums by existing owners of the then-still nascent DVD format. Broader groups of consumers had environmental concerns with the format, since under the advertised \"no returns\" model a disc would be discarded as waste once the initial user was done with it, rather than being reused as they were under the traditional rental model. Both companies that created the DVD format (Sony and Toshiba) also denounced DIVX, as did major studio distributor Warner Home Video (who was the first major American studio to distribute DVD) and the DVD Forum (a consortium of developers on the format who standardized DVDs). Titles in the DIVX catalog were released primarily in pan and scan format with limited special features, usually only a trailer (although a few widescreen titles did arrive on the format in early December 1998). This caused many home theater enthusiasts to become concerned that the success of DIVX would significantly diminish the release of films on the DVD format in the films' original aspect ratios and with supplementary material. Some early demos were also noted to have unique instances of artifacting on the discs that were not present on standard DVDs. Many people in various technology and entertainment communities were afraid that there would be DIVX exclusive releases, and that the then-fledgling DVD format would suffer as a result. DreamWorks, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures, for instance, initially released their films exclusively on the DIVX format (something that DIVX did not originally intend to happen). DIVX featured stronger encryption technology than DVD (Triple DES instead of CSS), which many studios stated was a contributing factor in the decision to support DIVX. Others cited the higher price of DIVX-compatible DVD players and rental costs as their reason for opposing the format, with one declaring DIVX as \"holding my VCR hostage\". One online poll surveyed 786 people on the format, of which nearly 97% disapproved of the format's concept, and another poll in December 1998 reflected 86% disapproval even if the format were free \u2013 a testament to the fierce online backlash the format received. As early as December 1997, news outlets were already calling the format a failure for Circuit City.\nIn addition to the hostile Internet response, competitors such as Hollywood Video ran advertisements touting the benefits of \"Open DVD\" over DIVX, with one ad in the \"Los Angeles Times\" depicting a hand holding a telephone line with the caption: \"Don't let anyone feed you the line.\" The terminology \"Open DVD\" had been used by DVD supporters and later Sony themselves; in response to DIVX's labeling of DVD as \"Basic DVD\" and DIVX/DVD players as \"DIVX-enhanced\". Other retailers, such as Best Buy, also had their concerns, most of them citing possible customer confusion and cumbersomeness with the two formats. Pay-per-view companies were also concerned with the format intruding on their business sector, namely with their objective of single-use rentals of a film being offered to the consumer.\nEarly concerns of alleged or feared constant usage of the phone line proved to be somewhat exaggerated, as all players needed to do was verify its usage twice a month. Despite this, informational-freedom advocates were concerned that the players' \"dial-home\" ability could be used to spy on people's watching habits, as well as copyright and privacy concerns about its licensing of the media, with some alleging it violated fair-use laws entirely.\nAllegations of anti-competitive vaporware, as well as concerns within the software industry prompted David Dranove of Northwestern University and Neil Gandal of Tel Aviv University and University of California, Berkeley, to conduct an empirical study designed to measure the effect of the DIVX announcement on the DVD market. This study suggests that the DIVX announcement slowed the adoption of DVD technology. According to Dranove and Gandal, the study suggests that the \"general antitrust concern about vaporware seems justified\".\nDemise.\nRight after the launch of the format, Circuit City announced that despite a gain of 4.1% in net profit, huge expenses of launching that format (among other issues) massively undercut that profit. As early as September 1998, Circuit City was looking for partners to share their losses from the format's launch. Retailers such as Blockbuster Video did not carry the format at all. \nThe format's credibility suffered another blow when suspicions were raised about the nature of apparently independent pro-DIVX websites. Circuit City denied any involvement in creating these sites, one of which closed shortly after tech journalists tried to contact its webmaster.\nDIVX and Thomson Consumer Electronics teamed up in January 1999 to create another format made for high-definition video using existing DVD technology, predating the development of both Blu-ray and HD DVD by many years. The market share for DIVX players was 23% in January 1999, and by that March, around 419 titles were available in the DIVX format. Sales for the format quickly fell off after the 1998 holiday season, however, with all three third-party retailers pulling out of DIVX sales by that point. In May, studio support for DIVX would start to be phased out with Paramount refusing to convert their titles to \"Silver\" discs (and then later stopping DIVX releases entirely), and Disney increasing their DVD activity. By the format's first anniversary, the future of the format was very grim - with only five DIVX-compatible players (and no DIVX-compatible computer drives), 478 titles, and only Circuit City selling DIVX discs.\nThe format was discontinued on June 16, 1999, because of the costs of introducing the format, as well as its very limited acceptance by the general public and retailers. At the end of the format's life, Circuit City announced a $114 million after-tax loss, and Variety estimated the total loss on the scheme was around $337 million. Over the next two years, the DIVX system was phased out. Customers could still view all their DIVX discs and were given a $100 refund for every player that was purchased before June 16, 1999. All discs that were unsold at the end of the summer of 1999 were destroyed. The program officially cut off access to accounts on July 7, 2001. The player's Security Module, which had an internal Real-Time Clock, ceased to allow DIVX functions after 30 days without a connection to the central system. Unsold players were liquidated in online auctions, but not before being modified to remove the DIVX Security Module. As a result, certain player models demonstrated lockups when DIVX menus were accessed.\nOn the company website to announce discontinuation of the product on June 16, 1999, it stated: \"All DIVX-featured DVD players are fully functional DVD players and will continue to operate as such. All DIVX discs, including those previously purchased by consumers and those remaining in retailer inventories, can be viewed on registered players anytime between now and June 30, 2001. Subsequent viewings also will be available during that period. Discs can no longer be upgraded to unlimited viewing, known as DIVX Silver. Customers who have converted discs to DIVX Silver can continue viewing the discs until June 30, 2001, or can receive a full refund of the conversion price at their request\". This meant no DIVX discs could play any content after June 30, 2001, rendering the medium worthless.\nDIVX appeared as a \"dishonorable mention\" alongside \"PC World\"'s list of \"25 Worst Tech Products of All Time\" in 2006.\nHardware.\nA total of four DIVX players were released in 1998:\nSeveral DIVX players from other manufacturers were announced for the year 1999, but cancelled. This includes Harman Kardon, JVC, Pioneer and Kenwood, with the latter cancelling a late 1999 to early 2000 release.\nCustom Video Discs (CVD).\nCustom Video Discs (CVDs) are a specialised type of DVD used primarily by Swank Motion Pictures to distribute early-window theatrical content securely. Similar to the DIVX, CVDs employ additional content protection measures to restrict unauthorised copying and playback. Unlike DIVX\u2014which required proprietary players and online activation\u2014CVDs are designed to play only on standard DVD players and use embedded PIN codes (which is distributed via email or SMS messaging) in order to authorise playback.\nCVDs feature a plain white surface with black text and incorporate multiple layers of digital rights management (DRM) directly on the disc. The PIN system requires users to enter a four-digit code sent to authorised parties before playback can begin.

(\"RC\" stands for \"Rivest Cipher\".) He also devised the MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6 cryptographic hash functions.\nEducation.\nRivest earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1969, and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Stanford University in 1974 for research supervised by Robert W. Floyd.\nCareer.\nAt MIT, Rivest is a member of the Theory of Computation Group, and founder of MIT CSAIL's Cryptography and Information Security Group.\nRivest was a founder of RSA Data Security (now merged with Security Dynamics to form RSA Security), Verisign, and of Peppercoin.\nHis former doctoral students include Avrim Blum, Benny Chor, Sally Goldman, Burt Kaliski, Anna Lysyanskaya, Margrit Betke, Ron Pinter, Robert Schapire, Alan Sherman,\nand Mona Singh.\nResearch.\nRivest is especially known for his research in cryptography. He has also made significant contributions to algorithm design, to the computational complexity of machine learning, and to election security.\nCryptography.\nRivest, jointly with Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, introduced the RSA cryptosystem in 1978,[C1] which revolutionized modern cryptography by providing the first usable and publicly described method for public-key cryptography. Rivest had reportedly thought of the key idea behind the cryptosystem after having drunk large amounts of wine while celebrating Passover with Shamir and Adleman at a student's house. The three won the 2002 Turing Award for \"their ingenious contribution to making public-key cryptography useful in practice.\" The same paper was also the first to introduce Alice and Bob, the fictional heroes of many subsequent cryptographic protocols. In the same year, Rivest, Adleman, and Michael Dertouzos first formulated homomorphic encryption and its applications in secure cloud computing,[C2] an idea that would not come to fruition until over 40 years later when secure homomorphic encryption algorithms were finally developed.\nRivest was one of the inventors of the GMR public signature scheme, published with Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali in 1988,[C3]\nand of ring signatures, an anonymized form of group signatures invented with Shamir and Yael Tauman Kalai in 2001.[C7] He designed the MD4 and MD5 cryptographic hash functions, published in 1990 and 1992 respectively,[C4][C5] and a sequence of symmetric key block ciphers that include RC2, RC4, RC5, and RC6.[C6][C8]\nOther contributions of Rivest to cryptography include chaffing and winnowing, the interlock protocol for authenticating anonymous key-exchange, cryptographic time capsules such as LCS35 based on anticipated improvements to computation speed through Moore's law, key whitening and its application through the xor\u2013encrypt\u2013xor key mode in extending the Data Encryption Standard to DES-X, and the Peppercoin system for cryptographic micropayments.\nAlgorithms.\nIn 1973, Rivest and his coauthors published the first selection algorithm that achieved linear time without using randomization.[A1] Their algorithm, the median of medians method, is commonly taught in algorithms courses. Rivest is also one of the two namesakes of the Floyd\u2013Rivest algorithm, a randomized selection algorithm that achieves a near-optimal number of comparisons.[A2]\nRivest's 1974 doctoral dissertation concerned the use of hash tables to quickly match partial words in documents; he later published this work as a journal paper.[A3] His research from this time on self-organizing lists[A4] became one of the important precursors to the development of competitive analysis for online algorithms. In the early 1980s, he also published well-cited research on two-dimensional bin packing problems,[A5] and on channel routing in VLSI design.[A6]\nHe is a co-author of \"Introduction to Algorithms\" (also known as \"CLRS\"), a standard textbook on algorithms, with Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson and Clifford Stein. First published in 1990, it has extended into four editions, the latest in 2022.[A7]\nLearning.\nIn the problem of decision tree learning, Rivest and Laurent Hyafil proved that it is NP-complete to find a decision tree that identifies each of a collection of objects through binary-valued questions (as in the parlor game of twenty questions) and that minimizes the expected number of questions that will be asked.[L1] With Avrim Blum, Rivest also showed that even for very simple neural networks it can be NP-complete to train the network by finding weights that allow it to solve a given classification task correctly.[L3] Despite these negative results, he also found methods for efficiently inferring decision lists,[L2] decision trees,[L4] and finite automata.[L5]\nElections.\nA significant topic in Rivest's more recent research has been election security, based on the principle of software independence: that the security of elections should be founded on physical records, so that hidden changes to software used in voting systems cannot result in undetectable changes to election outcomes. His research in this area includes improving the robustness of mix networks in this application,[V1] the 2006 invention of the ThreeBallot paper ballot based end-to-end auditable voting system (which he released into public domain in the interest of promoting democracy),[V2] and the development of the Scantegrity security system for optical scan voting systems.[V3]\nHe was a member of the Election Assistance Commission's Technical Guidelines Development Committee.\nHonors and awards.\nRivest is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the International Association for Cryptologic Research, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Together with Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, he has been awarded the 2000 IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award and the Secure Computing Lifetime Achievement Award. He also shared with them the Turing Award. Rivest has received an honorary degree (the \"laurea honoris causa\") from the Sapienza University of Rome. In 2005, he received the MITX Lifetime Achievement Award. Rivest was named in 2007 the Marconi Fellow, and on May 29, 2008, he also gave the Chesley lecture at Carleton College. He was named an Institute Professor at MIT in June 2015.\nSelected publications.\nRivest's publications include:\nPersonal life.\nRivest is married to Gail Rivest with whom he has two sons, Alex Rivest, filmmaker, and Chris Rivest, entrepreneur and company co-founder.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The movement was initiated in 2000 by stuckists Billy Childish and Charles Thomson, with a manifesto, \"Remodernism\" in an attempt to introduce a period of new \"spirituality\" into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in Albuquerque was accompanied by an essay from University of California, Berkeley art professor, Kevin Radley. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.\nIn 2006, the Stedelijk Museum and the University of Amsterdam held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as authenticity, self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.\n In 2008, London \"Evening Standard\" critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three Turner Prize nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.\nHistory.\nOrigins and 2000 manifesto.\nCharles Thomson and Billy Childish, the founders of the stuckism art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism. Their \"Remodernism\" manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled \"towards a new spirituality in art\". Its premise is that the potential of the modernist vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges formalism.\nIt has a short introduction, summing up: \"Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash.\" This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the \"brainless destruction of convention.\" Point 7 states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.\nPoint 9 states: \"Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists.\" Point 12 links its use of the word \"God\" to enthusiasm\u2014from the Greek root \"en theos\" (to be possessed by God).\nThe summary at the end starts, \"It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry,\" and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because \"there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now.\"\nChildish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, who replied, \"You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto \"Remodernism\".\"\nExhibitions (2000\u20132009).\nIn March 2000 the Stuckists declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show \"The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota\". In April, remodernism was quoted in \"The Gulf News\" (UAE). In May \"The Observer\" newspaper announced a stuckist show: \"As the founding group of a self-named art movement called Remodernism, they stand on an art ticket that's against clever conceptualism and in favour of a more emotional and spiritual integrity in art via figurative painting.\"\nIn June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the Institute of Ideas. The same month the \"Students for Stuckism\" also gave \"a Remodernist show and talk\". The Institute of Remodernism was founded by Khatereh Ahmadi.\nIn 2001, Thomson stood in the UK general election, stating, \"The Stuckist Party aims to bring the ideas of Stuckism and Remodernism into the political arena.\"\nIn January 2002, Magnifico Arts presented the show \"ReMo: ReModernism\" of graduate students from the University of New Mexico. At an artists' talk, Kevin Radley, an art professor at the University of California, Berkeley said, \"Remodernism isn't about going backwards, but about surging forward.\" In an essay that accompanied the exhibition, Radley wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...there seems to be a re-emergence of confidence in the artist's singular voice\u2014a renewal of the belief that an artist can explore their own natures without the restraints of the ironic, the cynical or the didactic. To re-contact the notions of presence, reinvent their sense of beauty and renew our need for intimacy.\nThe show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.\nIn 2003, an independent group, the Stuckist Photographers, was founded by Andy Bullock and Larry Dunstan with a statement of endorsement for remodernism.\nIn 2004, the Defastenists, a new group of creatives in Ireland, declared themselves remodernist. A Remodernist art gallery, The Deatrick Gallery was founded in Louisville, Kentucky.\nAmerican film makers/photographers Jesse Richards and Harris Smith co-founded a new group remodernist film and photography with an emphasis on emotional meaning and characterised by elements of new-wave, no-wave, expressionist and transcendental film-making.\nStuckist artist Bill Lewis, interviewed by the BBC at the 2004 Liverpool Biennial, said that remodernism was \"not a movement as such\", but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm. To \"remodernise\" is to go \"back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes\". He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical \"in the true sense of the word\". New York stuckist artist, Terry Marks said that remodernism posited that modernism had started in a good direction, but veered from that into \"pure idea\" and that it was necessary to return to the starting point to take an as-yet unexplored alternative direction: \"to pursue art-making that's more concrete and accessible to more people, and find out where that leads us\".\nIn 2004, Luke Heighton wrote in \"The Future\" magazine, \"Remodernism, it seems, is here to stay whether we like it or not.\" Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand declared 2004 \"a good year for remodernism\u2014for having the gall to suggest that artists can have souls\".\nIn August 2005 an art show \"\" (a title taken from a line in the stuckist remodernism manifesto) was held at CBGBs 313 gallery in New York City. Artist and blogger Mark Vallen said, \"In the mid-1970s punk rock was born in a dank little New York nightclub called CBGB's. It all started when rockers like Television, the Ramones and Patti Smith launched a frontal assault on the monolith of corporate rock 'n roll. Now another artistic revolt, Remodernism, is about to widen its offensive from the birthplace of punk.\"\nOn 10 May 2006, the Stedelijk Museum and the University of Amsterdam staged a talk on remodernism by Daniel Birnbaum, contributing editor of \"Artforum\", and Alison Gingeras, Assistant Curator, Guggenheim Museum. The summary is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2006, artist Matt Bray said, \"I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them.\" In May 2007, with punk singer Adam Bray, he created the Mad Monk Collective in Folkestone, England, to promote remodernism.\nIn January 2008, London \"Evening Standard\" critic, Ben Lewis, said the year would see \"the invention of a new word to describe the modernist revival: 'remodernism,'\" which he applied later in the year to Turner Prize nominees Mark Leckey, Runa Islam and Goshka Macuga, as \"part of a whole movement reviving early 20th-century formalism\", praising Macuga for her \"heartfelt, modest and generous-spirited aesthetic\", of which he said there was more needed today. In April 2009, he described Catalina Niculescu, a Romanian artist using \"nostalgic\" 16mm film, as among a significant trend in art of fetishising the offcuts of modernism: \"Let's call it Remodernism.\"\nOn 27 August 2008, Jesse Richards published a \"Remodernist Film Manifesto\", calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\", use of intuition in filmmaking, as well as describing the remodernist film as being a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\". The manifesto criticizes Stanley Kubrick, filmmakers who use digital video, and Dogme 95. Point 4 says: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2009, Nick Christos and other students from Florida Atlantic University founded the Miami Stuckists group. Christos said, \n\"Stuckism is a renaissance of modernism\u2014it's re-modernism.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was born at Peterhof Palace, near Saint Petersburg.\nTatiana was the younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga and the elder sister of Grand Duchess Maria, Grand Duchess Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei. She was considered to be the most beautiful of all her sisters and the most aristocratic in appearance. She was known amongst her siblings as \"the governess\" for her domineering but also maternal ways. Tatiana was the closest of all the children to her mother (Tsarina Alexandra), often spending many hours reading to her. During World War I, she chaired many charitable committees and (along with her older sister, Grand Duchess Olga) trained to become a nurse. She tended to wounded soldiers on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo from 1914 to 1917. Her time as a nurse came to an end with her family's arrest in 1917 after the first Russian Revolution.\nHer murder by Bolshevik revolutionaries on 17 July 1918 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. Tatiana and all her siblings were soon rumored to have survived the murder, and dozens of impostors claimed to be surviving Romanovs; author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana. However, the deaths of all the last Tsar's family, including Tatiana, at the hands of Bolsheviks have since been established by scientific evidence.\nAppearance and personality.\nTatiana was a famous beauty. She was tall, slender, and elegant. She had dark auburn hair, gray eyes, and fine features. Many viewed her as the most beautiful of the four grand duchesses and the one who resembled their mother most. Her mother's lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden reflected that \"Tatiana was, to my mind, prettier than her sisters. She was taller than her mother, but so thin and so well built that her height was not a hindrance to her attractiveness. She had beautiful, regular features, and resembled some of the famous beauties among her royal relatives, whose family portraits decorated the walls of the palace.. She had dark hair, a rather pale complexion, and wide-apart eyes, that gave her a poetic far-away look.\" General Count Alexander Grabbe, wrote that \"the prettiest of the Grand Duchesses was Tatiana, the Tsar's second daughter. In her physical appearance and her serious and ardent nature, she most resembled her mother. Slender with auburn hair and clear gray eyes, she was strikingly good looking and enjoyed the attention her beauty commanded.\" According to Anna Vyrubova, \"when Tatiana grew up, she was the tallest and most graceful of all the Grand Duchesses, beautiful and romantic. Many officers fell in love with Tatiana, but there were no appropriate suitors for her.\" Meriel Buchanan described her beauty as \"almost mystical.\" Alexander Mossolov, head of the Imperial Chancellery, wrote that Tatiana was \"the best-looking of all the sisters.\" Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia called her \"the leading beauty of the family\". Her nanny Margaretta Eagar wrote that she was \"a very pretty child, remarkably like her mother, but delicate in appearance.\" In 1900, the British magazine, \"Woman at Home\", wrote that \"the flower of the flock, as far as looks are concerned ... is Grand Duchess Tatiana.\" Nicholas wrote that Tatiana was \"a very beautiful child\" and he often remarked that she reminded him of Alexandra. When she was 8, her tutor Pierre Gilliard said that she \"was prettier than her sister.\"\nDespite her high status, Tatiana did not use her Imperial title and her friends, family, and servants called her by her first name and patronym, Tatiana Nikolaevna. The only nicknames that can be found for her using primary sources are 'Tanechka' in a postcard from her cousin Princess Irina Alexandrovna, and 'Tan'ka' in some notes from her sister, Anastasia Nikolaevna. According to one story, Tatiana kicked her lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden for addressing her as \"Your Imperial Highness\" during a committee meeting, and she hissed, \"Are you crazy to speak to me like that?\" When she was 14, Tatiana called Chebotareva at her home on the telephone, and she spoke first to Chebotareva's 16-year-old son. Unaware of her identity, Gregory asked her to identify herself. She replied, \"Tatiana Nikolaevna\". He could not believe that he was speaking to a grand duchess, and he repeated his question. Again, Tatiana did not claim the imperial title of Grand Duchess and replied that she was \"Sister Romanova the Second\".\nTatiana was a practical, nurturing leader. Her sisters gave her the nickname \"The Governess\" and sent her as their group representative when they wanted their parents to grant a favour. Olga was 18 months older than Tatiana, but she uncomplainingly allowed Tatiana to be the leader of their group. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden recalled that \"It was Tatiana Nicolaevna who took care of the little ones, and who was a constant help to the Household, always willing to help them in arranging that their official duties should not clash with their private engagements.\" \nGilliard wrote that Tatiana was reserved and \"well balanced\" but less open and spontaneous than Olga. She was less naturally intelligent than Olga, but she was more hard-working and dedicated. Colonel Eugene Kobylinsky, the family's guard at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk, claimed that Tatiana \"had no liking for art\" and that \"it would have been better for her had she been a man.\"\nTatiana was interested in fashion. According to Sophie Buxhoeveden, \"Tatiana Nicolaevna loved dress. Any frock, no matter how old, looked well on her. She knew how to put on her clothes, was admired and liked admiration.\" Her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova wrote that Tatiana was talented in embroidery and crocheting and that she could dress her mother's hair as well as a professional hair stylist. Sophie Buxhoeveden remembered that Tatiana once dressed her hair when her hairdresser was unavailable.\nTatiana was the most sociable of the four sisters. According to Sophie Buxhoeveden, \"friends would have been welcome, but no young girls were ever asked to the Palace.\" Vyrubova noted that Tatiana was the most famous of the sisters in their lifetimes because of her vivacious personality and sense of duty. Vyrubova and Lili Dehn claimed that Tatiana longed for friends of her own age but that her high rank and her mother's distaste for society restricted her social life.\nLike her mother, Tatiana was deeply religious. She read her Bible frequently, studied theology, and struggled with the meaning of \"good and evil, sorrow and forgiveness, and man's destiny on earth\". She decided that \"one has to struggle much because the return for good is evil, and evil reigns.\" A.A. Mosolov claimed that Tatiana's reserved nature gave her a \"difficult\" character with more spiritual depth than that of her sister, Olga. Her English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, claimed that Tatiana viewed religion as a duty rather than a passion.\nOnly her closest friends and family were aware of her introspective side. \"With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent,\" Dehn recalled. \"She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers.\" Chebotareva loved the \"sweet\" Tatiana as if she were her daughter, and she claimed that Tatiana would hold her hand when she was nervous. \"I am so terribly embarrassed and frightened \u2013 I do not know whom I greeted and whom not,\" Tatiana told Chebotareva.\nLike her sisters, Tatiana was unworldly and naive. When she was young, she was shocked to learn that her governess Margaretta Eagar was paid for taking care of her. When Eagar told her that \"you have seen me get my money every month,\" Tatiana replied that \"I always thought it was a present to you.\" When her lady-in-waiting sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went into one of the stores. The shopkeepers did not recognize them because they wore nurses' uniforms. They left the shop without buying anything, because they didn't carry money with them and had no idea how to use it. The next day, they asked Chebotareva how to use money.\nFrench tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote that Tatiana and Olga were \"passionately devoted to one another.\"\nTatiana was closer to her mother than any of her sisters, and many considered her to be Alexandra's favorite daughter. \"It was not that her sisters loved their mother any less,\" recalled her French tutor Pierre Gilliard, \"but Tatiana knew how to surround her with unwearying attentions and never gave way to her own capricious impulses.\" On 13 March 1916, Alexandra wrote to Nicholas that Tatiana was the only one of their four daughters who \"grasped it\" when she explained her way of looking at things. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden wrote that Tatiana \"was closest in sympathy to her mother\" and \"the definite favorite of both her parents.\"\nTatiana was close to her father. Lili Dehn wrote that \"the Emperor loved her devotedly [and] they had much in common.\" She recalled that \"the sisters used to laugh, and say that, if a favour were required, \"Tatiana must ask Papa to grant it.\"\"\nEarly life.\nTatiana was born on 10 June 1897. She was the second child and daughter of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. She weighed 3.9\u00a0kg at birth, and Dr. Ott used forceps in her birth. When she regained consciousness from the chloroform used during the delivery, Alexandra saw the \"anxious and troubled faces\" around her and wept: \"My God, it is again a daughter. What will the nation say, what will the nation say?\" Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote that \"everyone was very disappointed as they had been hoping for a son.\" Grand Duke George Alexandrovich, Nicholas' younger brother, told Nicholas \"I was already preparing to go into retirement, but it was not to be.\" Under the Pauline Laws, the Imperial throne of Russia could not pass to a woman unless all legitimate male lines died out. As such, Nicholas' heir was his brother George unless he had a son. Grand Duchess Tatiana's siblings were Grand Duchesses Olga, Maria, Anastasia, and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. All of the children were close to one another and to their parents up until the end of their lives.\nOn 29 May 1897, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia recorded in his diary that Nicholas II had named Tatiana as an homage to the heroine in Alexander Pushkin's novel in verse \"Eugene Onegin\". According to him, he wanted to name his daughter after Olga and Tatiana, the sisters in the famous poem. Tatiana's title was \"Grand Princess\", but it was translated from Russian into English as \"Grand Duchess\".\nLike the other Romanov children, Tatiana was raised with austerity. She and her sisters slept on camp beds without pillows, took cold baths in the morning, and embroidered and knitted projects to be given as gifts or sold at charity bazaars.\nIn their household, Tatiana and Olga were known as \"The Big Pair\". They shared a bedroom and were very close to each another from early childhood. In the spring of 1901, Olga had typhoid fever and was confined to the nursery for several weeks. When she began to recover, Tatiana was permitted to see her older sister for five minutes but didn't recognize her. When her governess, Margaretta Eagar, told her that the sickly child was Olga, four-year-old Tatiana cried bitterly and protested that the pale, thin child couldn't be her beloved older sister. Eagar had difficulty persuading Tatiana that Olga would recover.\nRelationship with Grigori Rasputin.\nTatiana doted on her younger brother, Tsarevich Alexei. However, the long-awaited heir had frequent, severe attacks of hemophilia. Tatiana, her mother, and her three sisters were all potential carriers of the hemophilia gene; the Tsarina was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who had passed down the hemophilia gene to her descendants. Tatiana's paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia reported that Maria, Tatiana's younger sister, hemorrhaged during an operation to remove her tonsils in December 1914. The operating doctor was so alarmed that the Tsarina needed to urge him to continue. Olga Alexandrovna claimed that all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and that they were carriers of the hemophilia gene. Symptomatic carriers of the gene are not hemophiliacs, but they can have symptoms of hemophilia, including an abnormally low blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding.\nThe Tsarina relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering \"starets\" or \"holy man\", and she credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich. Tatiana and her siblings viewed Rasputin as \"Our Friend\" and confided in him. In the autumn of 1907, Tatiana's father escorted his sister, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, to the nursery so that she could too meet Rasputin. Tatiana and her siblings all wore their long white nightgowns, and they were comfortable in Rasputin's presence. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the Imperial children a telegram, advising them to \"Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.\" In one letter, 11-year-old Tatiana asked Rasputin to visit her and lamented that she found it difficult to see her mother ill. \"But you know because you know everything,\" she wrote.\nSofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, one of the sisters' governesses, was horrified that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when they were in their nightgowns and requested that he be banned from the household. She told Grand Duchess Xenia that he visited Olga and Tatiana before them, spoke to them, and \"caressed\" them. The sisters hid Rasputin's presence from Tyutcheva, and they were afraid to talk to their governess about him. Tatiana was aware of the tension and feared her mother's reaction to Tyutcheva's actions. On 8 March 1910, the 12-year-old Tatiana wrote to her mother, \"I am so afr(aid) that S.I. can speak ... about our friend something bad. I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.\" Alexandra dismissed Tyutcheva.\nAll accounts agree that Rasputin had an innocent relationship with the children, but Nicholas did ask Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. Grand Duchess Xenia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. On 15 March 1910, she wrote in her diary that she could not understand why her brother and his family regarded Rasputin, whom she saw as only a \"khlyst\", as \"almost a saint\".\nMaria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, initially thought well of Rasputin, but she became disillusioned with him. In the spring of 1910, she claimed that Rasputin raped her, but the Tsarina refused to believe her because she saw Rasputin as holy. The Tsarina insisted to Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna that she had investigated Vishnyakova's claim but that \"they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.\" In 1913, the Tsarina dismissed Vishnyakova.\nThere were malicious rumors that Rasputin had seduced the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses. Rasputin had released the letters that the Tsarina and the grand duchesses had sent to him; although they were innocent in nature, they fueled the rumors about his alleged affairs. Pornographic cartoons depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the Tsarina and her four daughters as Anna Vyrubova stood nude in the background. Much to the Tsarina's displeasure, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder in 1916. On 6 December 1916, the Tsarina wrote to Nicholas that \"Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed.\"\nAllegedly, Tatiana was present at the site of Rasputin's murder, \"disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her\". Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had witnessed Rasputin's castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.\nIn his memoirs, A.A. Mordvinov reported that all four grand duchesses were \"cold and visibly terribly upset\" by Rasputin's death. According to him, they sat \"huddled up closely together\" on a sofa when they received the news. He wrote that they seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. On 21 December 1916, Tatiana attended Rasputin's funeral. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by Tatiana, her mother and her sisters.\nTatiana kept a notebook in which she recorded Rasputin's sayings: \"Love is Light and it has no end. Love is great suffering. It cannot eat, it cannot sleep. It is mixed with sin in equal parts. And yet it is better to love. In love one can be mistaken, and through suffering he expiates for his mistakes. If love is strong\u2014the lovers happy. Nature herself and the Lord give them happiness. One must ask the Lord that he teach to love the luminous, bright, so that love be not torment, but joy. Love pure, Love luminous is the Sun. The Sun makes us warm, and Love caresses. All is in Love, and even a bullet cannot strike Love down.\"\nYoung adulthood and World War I.\nAs a young teenager, Tatiana was given the rank of honorary colonel and assigned a regiment of soldiers, the Vosnesensky (Ascension) Lancers. She and Olga inspected the soldiers regularly.\nTatiana enjoyed the company of soldiers, but she was often shocked by their behavior. On 11 July 1911, a group of officers aboard the Imperial yacht gave Olga a portrait of Michelangelo's nude David, cut out from a newspaper. Indignant, the 14-year-old Tatiana wrote to her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, \"Olga laughed at it long and hard. And not one of the officers wishes to confess that he has done it. Such swine, aren't they?\"\nOn 14 July 1911, Tatiana laughed at her distant cousin Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia's engagement to Helen of Serbia. On 14 July 1911, she wrote to Olga, \"How funny if they might have children, can (she) be kissing him? What foul, fie!\"\nIn 1911, Tatiana and Olga witnessed the assassination of the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. On 10 September 1911, Nicholas later wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, that the event had upset both girls. Tatiana sobbed and both of them had trouble sleeping that night.\nWhen World War I broke out, Tatiana became a Red Cross nurse with her mother and Olga. They cared for wounded soldiers in a private hospital on the grounds of Tsarskoye Selo. According to Vyrubova, \"Tatiana was almost as skillful and devoted as her mother, and complained only that on account of her youth she was spared some of the more trying cases.\" Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, who worked with her at the hospital, described in her journal how she planned to boil silk while Tatiana was otherwise occupied, fearing that Tatiana would be too tired to help her. But Tatiana guessed what Chebotareva was doing. \"Why can you breathe carbolic acid and I can't?\" she asked Chebotareva and insisted on helping her with the work. In September 1914, she was named patron of a war aid committee called the Tatiana Committee. Tatiana was fiercely patriotic. On 29 October 1914, she apologized to her mother for disparaging the German in her presence; she explained that she thought of her mother as only Russian and that she had forgotten that the Tsarina was born in Germany. The Tsarina responded that she was offended by the Russian people's gossip about her German connections because she considered herself as completely Russian.\nOn 15 August 1915, Tatiana wrote to her mother that she wished she could do more to support Russia during the war: \"I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, my beloved ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man.\"\nRomances with soldiers.\nWhen she was 13, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her to leave her bed so that she could watch a soldier, with whom she was infatuated. On 20 April 1911, she wrote to the Tsarina, \"I would like so much to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn...Yes, Mama, and at the second division I will see whom I \"must\" see ... you know whom ...\".\nIn the December 2004 edition of the magazine \"Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record\", Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914. De Malama claimed that Dmitri was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo, where he developed a romantic relationship with Tatiana. In September 1914, Dmitri gave Tatiana a French bulldog, which she named \"Ortipo\". On 30 September 1914, she wrote to her mother, \"Forgive me about the little dog. To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything.\" When Ortipo died, Dmitri gave her another puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died with the rest of the family. Eighteen months after he gave Ortipo to Tatiana, Dmitri paid the Imperial family a visit. On 17 March 1916, the Tsarina wrote to Nicholas that \"my little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been \u2013 why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!\" In August 1919, Malama was killed while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.\nAccording to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, Tatiana was fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared for when he was wounded in 1915 and 1916. She claimed that Tatiana sat beside \"Volodia\" at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked to her in a low voice. She claimed that Tatiana and Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. She feared that the grand duchesses' flirtations with the wounded officers would damage their reputations.\nNegotiations for marriage.\nAllegedly, the Serbian king Peter I wanted Tatiana as a bride for his younger son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 delivered a letter to Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but he noticed that the Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during family dinners on his recent trips to St. Petersburg. There were also reports that the Windsors wanted to marry her to the Prince of Wales, with the future Edward VIII insisting he was impressed by her beauty and the way she tended to her younger brother. She was too young for her parents to seriously consider her marriage when potential suitors first surfaced, and negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I.\nCaptivity.\nThe family was arrested during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and imprisoned first at Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg, Siberia. The drastic change in circumstances and the uncertainty of captivity took its toll on Tatiana as well as on the rest of her family. \"She pines without work,\" wrote her fellow nurse Valentina Chebotareva after receiving a letter from Tatiana on 16 April 1917. \"It is strange to sit in the morning at home, to be in good health and not to go to the change of bandages!\" Tatiana wrote Chebotareva. Tatiana, apparently trying to advocate for her mother, asked her friend Margarita Khitrovo in a letter on 8 May 1917 why their fellow nurses did not write to Tsarina Alexandra directly. Chebotareva wrote in her journal that, while she pitied the family, she could not write directly to the Tsarina because she blamed her for the Revolution. \"If anyone wishes to write us, let them write directly,\" Tatiana wrote to \"my dear dove\" Chebotareva on 9 December 1917, after expressing concern for fellow nurses and a patient they had once treated together. Chebotareva's son, Gregory P. Tschebotarioff, noted the grand duchess's \"firm, energetic handwriting\" and how the letter \"reflected the nature which endeared her so much to my mother.\"\nTatiana's English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, recalled that Tatiana had grown razor thin in captivity and seemed \"haughtier\" and more inscrutable to him than ever. In April 1918 the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria to Yekaterinburg. The remaining children remained behind in Tobolsk because Alexei, who had had another attack of haemophilia, could not be moved. It was Tatiana who persuaded her mother to \"stop tormenting herself\" and make a decision to go with her father and leave Alexei behind. Alexandra decided that level-headed Tatiana must be left behind to manage the household and look after Alexei.\nDuring the month of separation from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Yekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Anna Demidova to Alexandra Tegleva gave the instructions on how to deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.\nPierre Gilliard later recalled his last sight of the imperial children at Yekaterinburg. \"The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ...\"\nDeath.\nAt Yekaterinburg, Tatiana occasionally joined her younger sisters in chatting with some of the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, \"pale as death\", and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She \"would be pleasant to the guards if she thought they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner,\" recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also spent a great deal of time sitting with her mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.\nOn 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The final entry in Tatiana's final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from the words of a well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: \"Your grief is indescribable, the Savior's grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world's sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation.\" The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was \"tumbled and disorderly\". They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana sat with her mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and just talked. As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him along with the rest of the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.\nLate that night, on the night of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms carrying pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family \"Well, we're going to get out of this place.\" They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect they were going to be killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.\nThe initial round of gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At that point the gunmen had to leave the room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had released from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her in the back of her head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.\nRomanov graves and DNA proof.\nFor decades, conspiracy theorists suggested that one or more of the family somehow survived the slaughter. The theories were reduced in scale, but still persisted, when the bodies of most of the family were found and identified from a mass grave discovered in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. The remaining conspiracies hinged on the fact that two bodies were missing, Tsarevich Alexei and one of the four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. For example, author Michael Occleshaw made the claim in his 1995 book \"The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor\" that Tatiana might have been rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on studying the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation of a Grand Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discounted this claim and continued to say that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Yekaterinburg.\nOn 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of twelve and fifteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and their brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassinations. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.\" The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes.\nPreliminary testing indicated a \"high degree of probability\" that the remains belonged to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on 22 January 2008. On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing proved that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters. With this result, all of the Tsar's family are accounted for.\nSainthood.\nIn 1981 Tatiana and her family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. In 2000, Tatiana and her family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church as a passion bearer.\nThe bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years to the day after they were murdered.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
