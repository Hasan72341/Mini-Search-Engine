Located at the mouth of Carmel Valley, California, it is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.\nFrom 1797 until 1833, Carmel Mission was the headquarters of all Alta California missions. It was headed by Saint Jun\u00edpero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784. It was also the seat of the second missions \"presidente\", Father Ferm\u00edn Francisco de Lasu\u00e9n, who was in charge of completing nine more mission churches.\nIn 1833 the mission buildings and lands were secularized by the Mexican government. By the mid-19th century, the Carmel Mission structures had fallen into disrepair. The chapel was saved from total destruction when the roof was rebuilt in 1884. In 1886, ownership of the mission was transferred from a group of Franciscans to the Diocese of Monterey. Ever since, Carmel Mission has been a parish within that diocese.\nBeginning in 1931, Harry Downie began restoring the mission and worked continuously on the project for the next 50 years. It is the only Spanish mission in California that has its original bell and bell tower. Carmel Mission contains the state's first library.\nHistory.\nMission Carmel ( The Carmel Mission) was the second mission built by Franciscan missionaries in Upper California. It was first established as Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, California near the native village of \"Tamo\" on June 3, 1770, by Father Jun\u00edpero Serra. It was named for Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, Italy, and was the site of the first Christian confirmation in Alta California.\nRelocation to Carmel Valley.\nPedro Fages, who served as military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, kept his headquarters in the polity's capitol, at the Presidio of Monterey. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on behalf of Fages' soldiers, and the two men did not get along. Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. The soldiers raped the Indian women and kept them as concubines. Serra wanted to put some distance between the mission's neophytes and Fages' soldiers.\nSerra found that the land at the mouth of Carmel Valley, where the Carmel River (named \"R\u00edo del Carmelo\" by Vizca\u00edno in 1603) runs into Carmel Bay, was better suited for farming. In May 1771, Spain's viceroy approved Serra's petition to relocate the mission. The mission was established in the new location on August 1, 1771; the first mass was celebrated on August 24, and Serra officially took up residence in the newly constructed buildings on December 24.\nThe name of the relocated mission was extended to \"Mission San Carlos Borromeo del R\u00edo Carmelo\". It was within a short distance of the Rumsen Ohlone villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel Valley. The mission was about from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen. The original building in Monterey continued to operate as the Royal Presidio's chapel and later became the current Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo.\nSerra's headquarters.\n\"Mission Carmel\", as it came to be known, was Serra's favorite and, because it was close to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, he chose it as his headquarters. When he died on August 28, 1784, he was interred beneath the chapel floor. After Serra's death, Father Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n replaced the adobe structure with one built of stone quarried from the nearby Santa Lucia Mountains.\nIndian baptisms.\nAfter the Carmel mission was moved to the mouth of Carmel Valley, the Franciscans began to baptize some natives. By the end of 1771, the population of the mission was 15 with an additional 22 baptized Indians, out of a total population of northern California of 60.\nFarming was not very productive and for several years the mission was dependent upon the arrival of supply ships. Historian Jame Culleton wrote in 1950, \"The summer of '73 came without bringing the supply ship. Neither Carmel nor Monterey was anything like self-supporting.\"\nTo improve baptismal rates, they sought to convert key members of the Esselen and Rumsen tribes, including chiefs. On May 9, 1775, Jun\u00edpero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, \"Pach-hepas\", the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. He was near death and was baptized in his home village at Xas\u00e1uan, about 10 leagues (about ) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name.\nForced labor.\nThe Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Over the years about 900 Esselen were baptized and brought to the \nTwo missions at Carmel Valley, Soledad, and San Antonio that surrounding their native land. There was extensive \"comingling of the Costanoan with peoples of different linguistic and cultural background during the mission period.\" The neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes. The number of natives who died at the missions were high. Deaths exceeded births and the population at Mission San Carlos peaked in 1795, when the population reached a total reported variously as either 876 or 927, but by 1823 the total had dwindled to 381.\nCrops and livestock.\nIn the beginning, the mission relied on bear meat from Mission San Antonio de Padua and supplies brought by ship from Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1. In 1779, four years after the first Esselen baptism, the Native Americans at Carmel Mission harvested 1,660 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of barley, 165 bushels of beans, and 85 bushels of maize. Four years later, the native laborers produced enough crops to support 700 people. The mission had more than 500 cattle and sheep.\nCarmel Mission continued to grow during most of the 18th century. By 1800, agriculture production at Carmel Mission was near its peak. The Mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,180 horses and cattle, and 4,160 smaller livestock, including sheep. The total grain harvested was about 3,700 bushels per year with a high of 7,400 in 1797. In December 1832, the mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,100 cattle, 3,300 sheep, 410 horses, and 8 mules.\nSecularized and abandoned.\nThe Mexican government was concerned that the missions remained loyal to the Catholic Church in Spain. Only eight months later, in August 1833, the government secularized all of the missions and their valuable lands. The government stipulated that half the mission lands should be awarded to the native people, but this purpose was never accomplished. Most mission property was bought by government officials or their wealthy friends. The priests could not maintain the missions without the Indians' forced labor and the mission and lands were soon abandoned. The Indians were forced from the mission by the new landowners. Some attempted to return to their native ways, and others found work as ranch hands or servants on farms and ranches.\nBy 1850, the mission was nearly a ruin. The stone chapel building was deteriorating while most of the adobe buildings were eroding away. The roof collapsed in 1852.\nRestoration.\nWhen Mexico ceded California to the United States following the Mexican\u2013American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored, but required that the owners provide legal proof of their title. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany filed a claim on February 19, 1853, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. He sought return of all former mission lands in the State. The state agreed to return the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens to the church.\nWhen the Roman Catholic Church gained full control of the buildings on October 19, 1859, the mission was in ruins. In 1884 Father Angel Casanova was able to gather enough private funds to replace the roof on the chapel sufficient to preserve it until the 1930s. In 1931 Monsignor Philip Scher hired master cabinet maker Henry John (\"Harry\") Downie who had an excellent reputation for restoring Spanish antiques. Scher initially asked Downie to restore some statues at the Carmel Mission but his job quickly expanded and he was put in charge of restoring the entire mission. Two years later, the church transferred the mission from the Franciscans to the local diocese and it became a regular parish church. Downie lived nearby in Carmel and worked almost daily for nearly 50 years to restore the mission, ancillary buildings, walls, and grounds. He painstakingly researched the church's architecture and site, often relying on original Spanish sources, and gathered genuine artifacts from across California.\nHe first restored the padres' quarters, then the roof of the chapel in 1936, and over the next five years the interior of the basilica. In 1941, he oversaw restoration of the former soldiers' quarters on the east side of the quadrangle. In 1943 he began restoration of a building that had been on the south side of the quadrangle, although nothing was left but the eroded adobe foundation and a few ruined walls. The building was originally a segregated, locked dormitory for girls called the monjero (nunnery). They were separated from their families at age 8. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.\nThe building was reconstructed and made into classrooms for Junipero Serra Elementary School. In 1946, the ruin on the east side of the quadrangle that had been the original padre's kitchen and a blacksmith shop was rebuilt. It is used today as a chapel. Downie also consulted on the restoration of the missions that are considered the most authentic, including San Luis Obispo, San Juan Bautista, and San Buenaventura. He also helped the Native Daughters of the Golden West to reconstruct Mission Soledad. He was knighted by Pope Pius and by King Juan Carlos of Spain.\nIn 1960, the mission was designated as a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII. In 1987, Pope John Paul II visited the mission as part of his U.S. tour.\nThe original bell nicknamed Ave Maria was made in Mexico City in 1807. It was placed at the Mission in 1820. When the mission was secularized in 1834, the bell was removed and held onto by local Native Americans for safekeeping. It was finally lost, but relocated once again, during restoration. It was re-installed in the mission bell tower in 1925.\nModern use.\nAs a result of Downie's dedicated efforts to restore the buildings, the Carmel mission church is one of the most authentically restored of all the mission churches in California. Mission Carmel has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. It is an active parish church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey.\nIn addition to its activity as a place of worship, Mission Carmel also hosts concerts, art exhibits, lectures, and numerous other community events. In 1986, then-pastor Monsignor Eamon MacMahon acquired a Casavant Fr\u00e8res organ with horizontal trumpets. Its hand-painted casework is decorated with elaborate carvings and statuary reflecting the Spanish decorative style seen on the main altar.\nThe mission also serves as a museum, preserving its own history and the history of the area. There are four specific museum galleries: the Harry Downie Museum, describing restoration efforts; the Munras Family Heritage Museum, describing the history of one of the most important area families; the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery, hosting rotating art exhibits as well as the monumental bronze and travertine cenotaph (1924) sculpted by Jo Mora; and the Convento Museum, which holds the cell Serra lived and died in, as well as interpretive exhibits. At one end of the museum is a special chapel room containing some of the vestments used by Serra.\nThe mission grounds were also the location of the Jun\u00edpero Serra School, a private Catholic school for kindergarteners through 8th grade operated by the Diocese of Monterey. The school opened in 1943 and closed at the end of the 2019\u20132020 school year.\nModern restoration.\nBetween 2000 and 2007, private funding provided funds to hire Fine Art Conservation Laboratories to conserve the major original Spanish Colonial oil paintings in the nave. The company had previously been responsible for the preservation and restoration of Spanish colonial art from the Mission Inn, Riverside, California, the Santa Barbara Mission, The Institute of Iberian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and from the Permanent Art Collection of Brigham Young University. The most important artwork conserved during their initial work was the \"Deposition\", a painting commissioned by Father Serra prior to his death. It now hangs in the vicinity of his tomb in the apse of the Carmel Mission.\nIn 2008, the non-profit Friends of Historic Carmel Mission was formed, independent of the Diocese of Monterey. The organization's goal was to assist the parish and diocese in restoring and preserving the historic landmark. After restoring nine mission bells and many artifacts, the Foundation became the sole funder for the restoration and changed its name to the Carmel Mission Foundation.\nIn 2012, the foundation began a $6.2 million capital project to restore the Basilica which had not been touched since 1937 and had been deemed unsafe by the California State Unreinforced Masonry Act. The project was the third major reconstruction of the Basilica since it was built in 1797. The contractors installed additional wood and steel beams to reinforce and tie the roof structure together. To strengthen the walls, they drilled over 300 center-cored vertical and horizontal holes in the thick walls, into which they inserted steel rods that were grouted in place. The bell tower dome was reinforced, cleaned and resurfaced.\nThe project also updated the electrical system and added a fire suppression system. The interior lighting was replaced, and custom-made chandeliers were added. Foundation issues were remedied and all tile was matched and restored. The project upgraded the radiant heating system and included construction of an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant restroom. The Basilica restoration was completed in 2013. Over the next few years, the foundation funded restoration of many artifacts in the museum and to preserve historic structures from further decay. This included the Muchado House built in 1883.\nIn 2016, the Foundation funded the restoration of the central courtyard at a cost of $2.2 million. The unsafe, cracked concrete surface was removed and new water and fire lines, drains, sewer, electrical, and communications lines were installed before a more durable concrete surface was poured to match that of the original aggregate poured in the late 1960s.\nThe courtyard fountain was restored. The large Santa Maria style barbecue pits that have been used for community barbecues since 1913 were reinforced and upgraded. The gardens were replanted with native plants and outdoor lighting and electrical was installed. The foundation also created the Serra Memorial Circle in the Courtyard to honor donors.\nThe foundation worked with the Mission Docent Association to conserve the Our Lady of Bethlehem statue, believed to be one of the oldest statues in California. In 2020, the front perimeter wall deteriorated. The foundation paid for emergency removal of the long perimeter wall and construction of a temporary wall until a permanent one can be designed and built.\nIn late 2020, The Carmel Mission Foundation began a $4 million project to restore and seismically strengthen the century old Downie Museum in time to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of Carmel Mission. The restoration removed restrooms from the rear of the building, doubling the museum's interior space. Paint covering the stone installed in 1920 surrounding the fireplace was removed.\nThe foundation is seeking additional funding to pay for seismic retrofits, infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the Mora Museum, Convento Museum, Blessed Sacrament Chapel, and the historic Orchard House Property.\nFolklore.\nThe Lost Padre Mines of the Carmel Mission have woven themselves into the tapestry of local folklore, with their legacy recounted through various accounts, including those within Randall Reinstadt's notable works such as \"Ghosts, Bandits, and Legends of Old Monterey, Carmel and Surrounding Areas\" and \"Tales and Treasures of California Missions.\" These narratives unveil a captivating history, suggesting that indigenous communities held knowledge of abundant gold deposits concealed within the untamed terrain of the Santa Lucia Mountains. As whispers of these riches echoed through time, the enigmatic Lost Padre Mines became a testament to the allure of hidden treasures and the enduring mystique of the land. Numerous iterations of these legends appear to have originated from long-time residents of Carmel Valley. It is plausible that this phenomenon can be attributed to some of the final descendants of the Mission Indians who resided and labored in the area.\nVandalism.\nOn September 27, 2015, in response to Serra's canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized. The statue of Serra was toppled and splattered with paint, and the cemetery, the mission doors, a fountain, and a crucifix were as well. The message \"Saint of Genocide\" was painted on the ground, and similar messages were painted elsewhere in the mission courtyard.\nNotable interments.\nSeveral notable people are buried in the church and churchyard, in the Carmel Mission Cemetery, also known as Mission Carmel Cemetery, and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Cemetery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the World Health Organization, a subluxation is a \"significant structural displacement\" and is therefore visible on static imaging studies, such as X-rays. Unlike real subluxations, the pseudoscientific concept of a chiropractic \"vertebral subluxation\" may or may not be visible on x-rays.\nThe term is used in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and chiropractic. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of chiropractic subluxations or proof they or their treatment have any effects on health.\nMedical.\nJoints.\nA subluxation of a joint is where a connecting bone is partially out of the joint. In contrast to a luxation, which is a complete separation of the joint, a subluxation often returns to its normal position without additional help from a health professional. An example of a joint subluxation is a nursemaid's elbow, which is the subluxation of the head of the radius from the annular ligament. Other joints that are prone to subluxations are the shoulders, fingers, kneecaps, ribs, wrists, ankles, and hips affected by hip dysplasia. A spinal subluxation is visible on X-rays and can sometimes impinge on spinal nerve roots, causing symptoms in the areas served by those roots. In the spine, such a displacement may be caused by a fracture, spondylolisthesis, rheumatoid arthritis, severe osteoarthritis, falls, accidents and other traumas.\nOphthalmology.\nA subluxation of the lens within the eye is called ectopia lentis, wherein it is displaced or malpositioned. Subluxated lenses are frequently found in those who have had ocular trauma and those with certain systemic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome and homocystinuria. Some subluxated lenses may require removal, as in the case of those that float freely or those that have opacified to form cataracts.\nDental.\nA subluxation of a tooth is a dental traumatic injury in which the tooth has increased mobility but has not been displaced from the mandible or maxilla. This is a common condition and one of the most common dental traumatic disorders. Dental subluxation is a non-dental-urgency condition, i.e., unlikely to result in significant morbidity if not seen within 24 hours by a dentist, and usually treated conservatively: good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking for several days. In painful situations, a temporary splinting of the injured tooth may relieve the pain.\nSubluxation may also occur in the mandible from the articular groove of the temporal bone. The mandible can dislocate in the anterior, posterior, lateral, or superior position. Description of the dislocation is based on the location of the condyle in comparison to the temporal articular groove.\nChiropractic.\nUnlike real subluxations, the pseudoscientific concept of a chiropractic \"vertebral subluxation\" may or may not be visible on x-rays. Nor may it involve a significant displacement or even pain or clear dysfunction. Straight chiropractors claim that vertebral subluxation has considerable health effects and also add a visceral component to the definition. Mainstream medicine and some mixer chiropractors consider these ideas to be pseudoscientific and dispute these claims, as there is no scientific evidence for the existence of chiropractic subluxations or proof they or their treatment have any effects on health.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was launched on 17 April 1941 and commissioned on 5 June with \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" Heinrich Heinsohn (12 February 1910 \u2013 6 May 1943) in command. Heinsohn commanded her for her entire career in the Kriegsmarine. In May 1941 he had arranged that the city of Landeck in Tyrol adopted the submarine within the then popular sponsorship programme (Patenschaftsprogramm), organising gifts and holidays for the crew, earning her the honorary name \"U-573 \"Landeck\"\".\nThe boat began her service career as part of the 3rd U-boat Flotilla when she conducted training; on 1 September 1941 she commenced operations with that flotilla. She was transferred to the 29th Flotilla, also for operations, on 1 January 1942. She was sold to the Spanish Navy that same year and became the Spanish submarine \"G-7\".\nDesign.\nGerman Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. \"U-573\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-573\" was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.\nGerman service.\n\"U-573\" conducted four war patrols, sinking just one ship.\nFirst, second and third patrols.\nHer operational career began with her departure from Kiel on 15 September 1941. She entered the Atlantic via the North Sea and the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. She almost reached the Labrador coast before heading for St. Nazaire in occupied France, docking on 15 November.\n\"U-573\"'s second patrol involved the boat slipping past the heavily defended Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, where she sank the Norwegian \"Hellen\" (5,289 GRT) with two torpedoes on 21 December 1941. She arrived at Pola in Croatia on 30 December.\nHer third sortie was relatively uneventful, starting and finishing in Pola between 2 February and 6 March 1942.\nFourth patrol and internment.\nOn 29 April 1942, \"U-573\" was attacked with depth charges by Lockheed Hudsons of No. 233 Squadron RAF, northwest of Algiers. Seriously damaged, she limped north to Spain, arriving in Cartagena on 2 May. International agreements allowed ships in neutral ports 24 hours to make emergency repairs before they were to be interned. The Spanish authorities granted \"U-573\" a three-month period for repairs, which prompted several strong protests from the British Embassy in Madrid. On 19 May Heinsohn flew from Madrid to Stuttgart, then travelled on to Berlin, in order to discuss the situation with the \"Kriegsmarine\". He returned by train via Hendaye (in southwest France) on 28 May. Realizing that even three months would not be enough to repair the boat, the \"Kriegsmarine\" sold the vessel to Spain for 1.5\u00a0million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. On 2 August 1942, at 10\u00a0am, (one day before the three-month period was due to expire), the Spanish navy commissioned the boat as the \"S01\".\n\"U-573\"'s crew suffered no casualties during her career in the \"Kriegsmarine\". The men had been interned in Cartagena and were gradually released in groups of two or three. The last five members of the crew left with \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" Heinsohn on 13 February 1943. He returned to the \"Kriegsmarinearsenal\" in Gotenhafen (Gdynia, Poland), then German-annexed Poland, In March he was ordered to Brest, then in German-occupied France to take command of , and died with all his crew two months later.\nSpanish service.\nWork started on the \"U-573\", now the \"G-7\", in August 1943 following the sale to Spain but took four years to complete. The damage caused by the British attack was found to be more extensive than was first thought; also German technical assistance and parts were difficult to obtain in the last years of World War II and after. In addition, Spain's economy was weak following the Spanish Civil War. Repairs were completed in early 1947 and on 5 November 1947 \"G-7\" was re-commissioned. The bow's net cutter and the 20mm anti aircraft cannon were removed.\nDespite the Type VII being out-dated by the end of World War II, \"G-7\" was the most modern of Spain's submarine fleet; her other vessels (two ex-Italian, and four home-built boats) dating from the early 1930s. \"G-7\" lacked radar and did not possess a snorkel. In 1951 development was started on a snorkel design by Empresa Nacional Baz\u00e1n, the Spanish shipbuilding company, but these came to nothing when the Spanish Navy bought the former US Navy submarine .\n\"G-7\"'s repairs were completed in 1947. In 1958 Arca-Filmproduktion GmbH rented \"G-7\" to take part in the semi-fictitious movie \"U 47 \u2013 Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Prien\", partially based on his patrol to Scapa Flow, where he sank .\nIn 1961 the Spanish Navy's submarine force was re-numbered, and \"G-7\" became \"S-01\".\nOne other U-boat was interned in Spain during World War II: .\nOn 2 May 1970 she was de-commissioned after 23 years service. She was auctioned for 3,334,751 Pts (about US$26,500), after which, despite efforts to save and preserve her as a museum, the submarine was broken up for scrap.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over the course of its first two decades, starting from the release of its first recordings in January 1948, Atlantic earned a reputation as one of the most important American labels, specializing in jazz, R&amp;B, and soul by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding. Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax. In 1967, Atlantic became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.\nIn 2004, Atlantic and its sister label Elektra were merged into the Atlantic Music Group. Craig Kallman is the chairman of Atlantic. Ahmet Ertegun served as founding chairman until his death on December 14, 2006, at age 83.\nHistory.\nFounding and early history.\nIn 1944, when their mother and sister returned to Turkey after the death of their father Munir Ertegun, Turkey's first ambassador to the U.S., brothers Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun remained in the United States. The brothers were fans of jazz and rhythm &amp; blues, amassing a collection of over 15,000 78 RPM records. Ahmet stayed in Washington to undertake post-graduate music studies at Georgetown University, and immersed himself in the Washington music scene. He entered the record business, which was enjoying a resurgence after wartime restrictions on the shellac used in manufacture had been lifted. He convinced the family dentist, Vahdi Sabit, to invest $10,000 and hired Herb Abramson, a dentistry student.\nHerb had worked as a part-time A&amp;R manager/producer for Al Green at the jazz label National Records, signing Big Joe Turner and Billy Eckstine. He founded Jubilee in 1946 but had no interest in its most successful musicians. In September 1947, he sold his share in Jubilee to his partner, Jerry Blaine, and invested $2,500 in Atlantic.\nAtlantic was incorporated in October 1947 and was run by Herb (president) and Ertegun (vice-president in charge of A&amp;R, production, and promotion). Herb's wife Miriam Abramson ran the label's publishing company, Progressive Music. She did most office duties until 1949, when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, \"Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her\" and Doc Pomus described her as \"an extraordinarily vitriolic woman\". When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company's chronic cash-flow shortage: \"... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time\". The label's office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson. In the early fifties, Atlantic moved from the Hotel Jefferson to offices at 301 West 54th St and then to 356 West 56th St.\nAtlantic's first recordings were issued in late January 1948 and included \"That Old Black Magic\" by Tiny Grimes and \"The Spider\" by Joe Morris. In its early years, Atlantic concentrated on modern jazz, although it released some country and western and spoken word recordings. Herb also produced \"Magic Records\", children's records with four grooves on each side. Each groove contained a different story, so the story played would be determined by the groove in which the stylus happened to land.\nIn late 1947, James Petrillo, head of the American Federation of Musicians, announced an indefinite ban on all recording activities by union musicians. This came into effect on January 1, 1948. The union action forced Atlantic to use almost all its capital to cut and stockpile enough recordings to last through the ban, which was expected to continue for at least a year.\nErtegun and Herb spent much of the late 1940s and early 1950s scouring nightclubs in search of talent. Ertegun composed songs under the alias \"A. Nugetre\", including Big Joe Turner's hit \"Chains of Love\", recording them in booths in Times Square, then giving them to an arranger or session musician. Early releases included music by Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard, The Cardinals, The Clovers, Frank Culley, The Delta Rhythm Boys, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie, Tiny Grimes, Al Hibbler, Earl Hines, Johnny Hodges, Jackie &amp; Roy, Lead Belly, Meade Lux Lewis, Professor Longhair, Shelly Manne, Howard McGhee, Mabel Mercer, James Moody, Joe Morris, Art Pepper, Django Reinhardt, Pete Rugolo, Pee Wee Russell, Bobby Short, Sylvia Syms, Billy Taylor, Sonny Terry, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Yancey, Sarah Vaughan, Mal Waldron, and Mary Lou Williams.\nFirst hits.\nIn early 1949, a New Orleans distributor phoned Ertegun to obtain Stick McGhee's \"Drinking Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee\", which was unavailable due to the closing of McGhee's previous label, Harlem Records. Ertegun knew Stick's younger brother Brownie McGhee, with whom Stick happened to be staying, so he contacted the McGhee brothers and re-recorded the song. When released in February 1949, it became Atlantic's first hit, selling 400,000 copies, and reached No. 2 after spending almost six months on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart \u2013 although McGhee himself earned just $10 for the session. Atlantic recorded 187 songs in 1949, more than three times the amount from the previous two years, and received overtures for a manufacturing and distribution deal with Columbia, which would pay Atlantic a 3% royalty on every copy sold. Ertegun asked about artists' royalties, which he paid. This surprised Columbia executives, who did not, and the deal was scuttled.\nOn the recommendation of broadcaster Willis Conover, Ertegun and Herb visited Ruth Brown at the Crystal Caverns club in Washington and invited her to audition for Atlantic. She was injured in a car accident en route to New York City, but Atlantic supported her for nine months and then signed her. \"So Long\", her first record for the label, was recorded with Eddie Condon's band on May 25, 1949. The song reached No. 6 on the R&amp;B chart. Brown recorded more than eighty songs for Atlantic, becoming its bestselling, most prolific musician of the period. Brown's success was so significant to Atlantic that the label became known colloquially as \"The House That Ruth Built\".\nJoe Morris, one of the label's earliest signings, scored a hit with his October 1950 song \"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\". It was the first Atlantic record issued in 45rpm format, which the company began pressing in January 1951. The Clovers' \"Don't You Know I Love You\" (composed by Ertegun) became the label's first R&amp;B No. 1 in September 1951. A few weeks later, Brown's \"Teardrops from My Eyes\" became its first million-selling record. She hit No. 1 again in March\u2013April 1952 with \"5-10-15 Hours\". \"Daddy Daddy\" reached No. 3 in September 1952, and \"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" with Connie Kay on drums reached No. 1 in February and March 1953. After Brown left the label in 1961, her career declined, and she worked as a cleaner and bus driver to support her children. In the 1980s she sued Atlantic for unpaid royalties; although Atlantic, which prided itself on treating artists fairly, had stopped paying royalties to some musicians. Ertegun denied this was intentional. Brown received a voluntary payment of $20,000 and founded the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1988 with a donation of $1.5 million from Ertegun.\nIn 1952 Atlantic signed Ray Charles, whose hits included \"I Got a Woman\", \"What'd I Say\", and \"Hallelujah I Love Her So\". Later that year The Clovers' \"One Mint Julep\" reached No. 2. In 1953, after learning that singer Clyde McPhatter had been fired from Billy Ward and His Dominoes and was forming The Drifters, Ertegun signed the group. Their single \"Money Honey\" became the biggest R&amp;B hit of the year. Their records created some controversy: the suggestive \"Such A Night\" was banned by radio station WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan, and \"Honey Love\" was banned in Memphis, Tennessee but both reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart.\nTom Dowd.\nRecording engineer and producer Tom Dowd played a crucial role in Atlantic's success. He initially worked for Atlantic on a freelance basis, but within a few years he had been hired as the label's full-time staff engineer. His recordings for Atlantic and Stax influenced pop music.\nAtlantic was one of the first independent labels to make recordings in stereo: Dowd used a portable stereo recorder which ran simultaneously with the studio's existing mono recorder. In 1953 (according to \"Billboard\") Atlantic was the first label to issue commercial LPs recorded in the experimental stereo system called binaural recording. In this system, recordings were made using two microphones, spaced at approximately the distance between the human ears. Thd left and right channels were recorded as two separate, parallel grooves. Playing them back required a turntable with a special tone-arm fitted with dual needles; it was not until around 1958 that the single stylus microgroove system (in which the two stereo channels were cut into either side of a single groove) became the industry standard. By the late 1950s stereo LPs and turntables were being introduced. Atlantic's early stereo recordings included \"Lover's Question\" by Clyde McPhatter, \"What Am I Living For\" by Chuck Willis, \"I Cried a Tear\" by LaVern Baker, \"Splish Splash\" by Bobby Darin, \"Yakety Yak\" by the Coasters and \"What'd I Say\" by Ray Charles. Although these were primarily 45rpm mono singles for much of the 1950s, Dowd stockpiled his \"parallel\" stereo takes for future release. In 1968 the label issued \"History of Rhythm and Blues, Volume 4\" in stereo. Stereo versions of Ray Charles \"What'd I Say\" and \"Night Time is the Right Time\" were included on the Atlantic anthology \"The Birth of Soul: The Complete Atlantic Rhythm &amp; Blues Recordings, 1952\u20131959\".\nAtlantic's New York studio was the first in America to install multitrack recording machines, developed by the Ampex company. Bobby Darin's \"Splish, Splash\" was the first song to be recorded on an 8-track recorder. It was not until the mid-1960s that multitrack recorders became the norm in English studios and EMI's Abbey Road Studios did not install 8-track facilities until 1968.\nAtlantic entered the LP market early: its first was \"This Is My Beloved\" (March 1949), a 10\" album of poetry by Walter Benton that was narrated by John Dall with music by Vernon Duke. In 1951, Atlantic was one of the first independent labels to press records in the 45rpm single format. By 1956 the 45 had surpassed the 78 in sales for singles. In April of that year, Miriam (Abramson) Bienstock reported to \"Billboard\" that Atlantic was selling 75% of its singles as 45s. During the previous year, 78s had outsold 45s by a ratio of two to one.\nJerry Wexler.\nIn February 1953, Herb Abramson was drafted into the U.S. Army. He moved to Germany, where he served in the Army Dental Corps, although he retained his post as president of Atlantic on full pay. Ertegun hired \"Billboard\" reporter Jerry Wexler in June 1953. Wexler is credited with coining the term \"rhythm &amp; blues\" to replace \"race music\". He was appointed vice-president and purchased 13% of the company's stock. Wexler and Ertegun formed a close partnership which, in collaboration with Tom Dowd, produced thirty R&amp;B hits.\nWexler's success for Atlantic was the result of going outside jazz to sign acts who combined jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues, such as Ray Charles, Joe Turner, and Aretha Franklin. Ertegun and Wexler realized many R&amp;B recordings by black musicians were being covered by white performers, often with greater chart success. LaVern Baker had a No. 4 R&amp;B hit with \"Tweedlee Dee\", but a rival version by Georgia Gibbs went to No. 2 on the pop chart. Big Joe Turner's April 1954 song \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was a No. 1 R&amp;B hit, but it only reached No. 22 on the pop chart. Bill Haley &amp; His Comets's version reached No. 7, selling over one million copies and becoming the bestselling song of the year for Decca. In July 1954, Wexler and Ertegun wrote a prescient article for \"Cash Box\" devoted to what they called \"cat music\"; the same month, Atlantic had its first major \"crossover\" hit on the \"Billboard\" pop chart when the \"Sh-Boom\" by The Chords reached No. 5 (although The Crew-Cuts' version went to No. 1). Atlantic missed an important signing in 1955 when Sun owner Sam Phillips sold Elvis Presley's recording contract in a bidding war between labels. Atlantic offered $25,000 which, Ertegun later noted, \"was all the money we had then\". But they were outbid by RCA's offer of $45,000. In 1990 Ertegun remarked, \"The president of RCA at the time had been extensively quoted in \"Variety\" damning R&amp;B music as immoral. He soon stopped when RCA signed Elvis Presley\".\nNesuhi Ertegun.\nAhmet's older brother Nesuhi was hired in January 1955. He had been living in Los Angeles for several years and had intermittent contact with his younger brother. But when Ahmet learned that Nesuhi had been offered a partnership in Atlantic's rival Imperial Records, he and Wexler convinced Nesuhi to join Atlantic instead. Nesuhi became head of artists and repertoire (A&amp;R), led the label's jazz division, and built a roster that included Shorty Rogers, Jimmy Giuffre, Herbie Mann, Les McCann, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane. By 1958 Atlantic was America's second-largest independent jazz label.\nNesuhi was also in charge of LP production. He was credited with improving the production, packaging, and originality of Atlantic's LPs. He deleted the old '100' and '400' series of 10\" albums and the earlier 12\" albums in Atlantic's catalog, starting the '1200' series, which sold for $4.98, with Shorty Rogers' \"The Swingin' Mr Rogers\". In 1956 he started the '8000' popular series (selling for $3.98) for the label's few R&amp;B albums, reserving the 1200 series for jazz. Joel Dorn became Nesuhi's assistant after his successful production of Hubert Laws' album \"The Laws of Jazz\".\nHerb Abramson departs.\nWhen Herb returned from military service in 1955, he realized that he had been replaced by Wexler as Ahmet's partner. Herb did not get along with either Wexler or Nesuhi Ertegun, and he had returned from military service with a German girlfriend, which precipitated his divorce from Miriam, a minor stockholder and Atlantic's business and publishing manager.\nBy 1958, relations between Herb and his partners had broken down. In December 1958 a $300,000 buy-out was arranged. His stock was split between Nesuhi Ertegun and Herb's ex-wife Miriam, who had in the meantime remarried to music publisher Freddy Bienstock (later the owner of the Carlin Music / Chappell Music publishing empire). Herb's departure opened the way for Ahmet Ertegun to take over as president of the label. The roles of the other executives with Herb's departure were Wexler as executive vice-president and general manager, Nesuhi Ertegun as executive vice-president in charge of the LP department and Miriam Bienstock as vice-president and also president of Atlantic's music publishing arm Progressive Music. Wexler was also executive vice-president of Progressive, and the Ertegun brothers were vice-presidents.\nExpansion.\nAtlantic played a major role in popularizing the genre that Jerry Wexler dubbed rhythm &amp; blues, and it profited handsomely. The market for these records exploded during late 1953 and early 1954 as R&amp;B hits crossed over to the mainstream (i.e. white) audience. In its tenth anniversary feature on Atlantic, \"Billboard\" noted, \"... a very big R&amp;B record might achieve 250,000 sales, but from this point on (1953\u201354), the industry began to see million sellers, one after the other, in the R&amp;B field\". \"Billboard\" said Atlantic's \"fresh sound\" and the quality of its recordings, arrangements, and musicians was a great advance from standard R&amp;B records. For five years Atlantic \"dominated the rhythm and blues chart with its roster of powerhouse artists\".\nBeginning in 1954, Atlantic created or acquired several subsidiary labels, the first being Cat Records. By the mid-1950s, Atlantic had an informal agreement with the French label Barclay, and the two companies regularly exchanged titles, usually jazz recordings. Atlantic also began to get recordings distributed in the United Kingdom, first through EMI on a 'one-off' basis. But in September 1955 Miriam Abramson traveled to the UK and signed a distribution deal with Decca. Miriam recalled, \"I would deal with people there who were not really comfortable with women in business, so...we would do business very quickly and get it over with\".\nA subsidiary label, Atco, was established in 1955 to keep Herb involved. After a slow start, Atco had considerable success with Bobby Darin. His early releases were unsuccessful, and Herb planned to drop him. But when Ertegun offered him another chance, the result was \"Splish Splash\", which Darin had written in 12 minutes. The song sold 100,000 copies in the first month and became a million-seller. \"Queen of the Hop\" made the Top 10 on both the US pop and R&amp;B charts and charted in the UK. \"Dream Lover\" reached No. 2 in the US and No. 1 in the UK and became a multi-million seller. \"Mack the Knife\" (1959) went to No. 1 in both the US and the UK, sold over 2 million copies, and won the 1960 Grammy Award for Record of the Year. \"Beyond the Sea\" became Darin's fourth consecutive Top 10 hit in the US and UK. He signed with Capitol and moved for Hollywood to attempt a movie career, but hits such as \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby\" and \"Things\" continued to benefit Atco through 1962. Darin returned to Atlantic in 1965. In 1965, Atlantic formed a budget label called Clarion Records. 21 albums were released simultaneously in 1965, all of them shown on the back cover of their releases. No further albums were issued as the label lasted less than a year.\nLeiber and Stoller.\nJerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wrote \"Smokey Joe's Cafe\", which became a hit for The Robins. Their label Spark was bought by Atlantic, and they were hired as America's first independent record producers, free to produce for other labels. Two members of The Robins formed The Coasters and recorded hits for Atlantic, such as \"Down in Mexico\" and \"Young Blood\". \"Yakety Yak\" became Atlantic's first No. 1 pop hit. Leiber and Stoller also wrote the hit \"Ruby Baby\" for The Drifters.\nRecord producer Phil Spector moved to New York to work with Leiber and Stoller. He learned his trade at Trey Records, a label in California owned by Lester Sill and Lee Hazlewood and distributed by Atlantic. Sill recommended Spector to Leiber and Stoller, who assigned him to produce \"Corrine, Corrina\" by Ray Peterson and \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\" by Curtis Lee. Both became hits, and Atlantic hired him as a staff producer. Ahmet Ertegun liked him, but Leiber said, \"He wasn't likable. He was funny, he was amusing\u2014but he wasn't nice\". Wexler disliked him. Miriam Bienstock called him \"a pain in the neck\". When Spector criticized Bobby Darin's songwriting, Darin had him thrown out of the house.\nAtlantic tolerated Spector, but with diminishing returns. He produced \"Twist and Shout\" for The Top Notes, and it flopped. Songwriter Bert Berns hated Spector's arrangement and thought it ruined the song, so Berns re-recorded it with The Isley Brothers and it became a hit. During his short time at Atlantic, Spector produced music for LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, Jean DuShon, and Billy Storm. In 1961, he left the label, returned to Los Angeles, and founded Philles Records with Lester Sill. Spector became one of the most successful record producers of the 1960s.\nAlthough Leiber and Stoller wrote many popular songs for Atlantic, their relationship with the label was deteriorating in 1962. The breaking point came when they asked for a producer's royalty. It was granted informally, but their accountant insisted on a written contract and an audit of Atlantic's accounts. The audit revealed Leiber and Stoller had been underpaid by $18,000. Although Leiber considered dropping the matter, Stoller pressed Atlantic for payment. Wexler replied that the payment would mean the end of their relationship with the label. Leiber and Stoller backed down, but the relationship ended anyway. Their assignment to work on The Drifter's next recording was given to Phil Spector.\nLeiber and Stoller worked briefly for United Artists, then started Red Bird with George Goldner. They had hits with \"Chapel of Love\" by The Dixie Cups and \"Leader of the Pack\" by The Shangri-Las, but Red Bird's finances were precarious. In 1964 they approached Jerry Wexler and proposed a merger with Atlantic. When interviewed in 1990 for Ertegun's biography, Wexler declined to discuss the matter, but Ertegun claimed these negotiations were a plan to buy him out. In September 1964, the Ertegun brothers and Wexler were in the process of buying out the company's other two shareholders, Sabit and Bienstock, and it was proposed that Leiber and Stoller buy Sabit's shares. Leiber, Stoller, Goldner, and Wexler suggested their plan to Ertegun at a lunch meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Leiber and Stoller told Ertegun they had no intention of buying him out, but Ertegun was aggravated by Goldner's attitude and was convinced Wexler was conspiring with them. Wexler told Ertegun if he refused, the deal would be done without him. But the Ertegun brothers held the majority of stock while Wexler controlled about 20 percent. Ertegun started lifelong grudges against Leiber and Stoller, and his relationship with Wexler was damaged.\nStax.\nAtlantic was doing so well in early 1959 that some scheduled releases were held back. The company enjoyed two successive months of gross sales of over $1 million that summer, thanks to hits by The Coasters, The Drifters, LaVern Baker, Ray Charles, Bobby Darin, and Clyde McPhatter. Months later the company was reeling from the successive loss of its two biggest artists, Bobby Darin and Ray Charles, who together accounted for one-third of sales. Darin moved to Los Angeles and signed with Capitol. Charles signed a contract with ABC-Paramount that included higher royalties, a production deal, profit-sharing, and eventual ownership of his master tapes. \"I thought we were going to die\", Wexler recalled. In 1990 he and Ertegun disputed the content of Charles's contract, which caused a rift. Ertegun remained friendly with Bobby Darin, who returned to Atlantic in 1966. Ray Charles returned to Atlantic in 1977.\nIn 1960, Atlantic's Memphis distributor Buster Williams contacted Wexler and told him he was pressing large quantities of \"Cause I Love You\", a duet between Carla Thomas and her father Rufus which was released by the small label Satellite. Wexler contacted the co-owner of Satellite, Jim Stewart, who agreed to lease the record to Atlantic for $1000 plus a small royalty\u2014the first money the label had ever made. The deal included a $5000 payment against a five-year option on all other records. Satellite was renamed Stax after the owners, Stewart and Axton. The deal marked the start of a successful eight-year association between the two labels, giving Stax access to Atlantic's promotions and distribution. Wexler recalled, \"We didn't pay for the masters...Jim paid for the masters and then he would send us a finished tape and we would put it out. Our costs began at the production level\u2014the pressing, and distribution, and promotion, and advertising\".\nThe deal to distribute Satellite's \"Last Night\" by The Mar-Keys on the Satellite label marked the first time Atlantic began marketing outside tracks on a non-Atlantic label.\nAtlantic began pressing and distributing Stax records. Wexler sent Tom Dowd to upgrade Stax's recording equipment and facilities. Wexler was impressed by the cooperative atmosphere at the Stax studios and by its racially integrated house band, which he called \"an unthinkably great band\". He brought Atlantic musicians to Memphis to record. Stewart and Wexler hired Al Bell, a disk jockey at a radio station in Washington D.C., to take over promotion of Stax releases. Bell was the first African-American partner in the label.\nAn after-hours jam by members of the Stax house band resulted in \"Green Onions\". The single was issued in August 1962 and became the biggest instrumental hit of the year, reaching No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 3 on the pop chart, selling over one million copies. Over the next five years Stax and its subsidiary Volt provided Atlantic with many hits, such as \"Respect\" by Otis Redding, \"Knock on Wood\" by Eddie Floyd, \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" by Sam and Dave, and \"Mustang Sally\" by Wilson Pickett.\nSoul years.\nAretha Franklin signed with Atlantic in 1966 after her contract with Columbia expired. Columbia tried to market her as a jazz singer. Jerry Wexler said, \"we're gonna put her back in church\". She rose to fame quickly and was called the Queen of Soul. Wexler oversaw production himself at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The result was seven consecutive singles that made both the US Pop and Soul Top 10: \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\" (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 9), \"Respect\" (Soul and Pop No. 1), \"Baby, I Love You\" (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 4), \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" (Soul No. 2, Pop No. 8), \"Chain of Fools\" (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 2), \"Since You've Been Gone\" (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 5), and \"Think\" (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 7).\nIn late 1961, singer Solomon Burke arrived at Jerry Wexler's office unannounced. Wexler was a fan of Burke's and had long wanted to sign him, so when Burke told Wexler his contract with his former label had expired Wexler replied: \"You're home. I'm signing you today\". The first song Wexler produced with Burke was \"Just Out of Reach\", which became a big hit in September 1961. The soul/country &amp; western crossover predated Ray Charles' similar venture by more than 6 months. Burke became a consistent big seller through the mid-1960s and scored hits on Atlantic into 1968. In 1962 folk music was booming and the label came very close to signing Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. Wexler and Ertegun pursued them vigorously, but the deal fell through at the last minute. They later discovered music publisher Artie Mogull had introduced their manager Albert Grossman to Warner Bros. executive Herman Starr, who had made the trio an irresistible offer that gave them complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music.\nThe mid-1960s British Invasion led Atlantic to change its British distributor. Decca had refused access to its British acts, who usually appeared in the US on the London subsidiary. In 1966, Atlantic signed a licensing deal with Polydor which included the band Cream, whose debut album was released by Atco in 1966. In 1967, the group traveled to Atlantic's studio in New York City to record \"Disraeli Gears\" with Tom Dowd; it became a Top 5 LP in both the US and the UK, with the single \"Sunshine of Your Love\" reaching No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Wexler dismissed developments in pop music, dubbing the musicians \"the rockoids\". However, Atlantic profited from moving into rock music in the 1970s when it signed Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.\nAcquisition by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts.\nDespite the huge success Atlantic was enjoying with its own artists and through its deal with Stax, by 1967, Jerry Wexler was seriously concerned about the disintegration of the old order of independent record companies; fearing for the label's future, he began agitating for it to be sold to a larger company. Label President Ahmet Ertegun still had no desire to sell, but the balance of power had changed since the abortive takeover attempt of 1962; Atlantic's original investor Dr Vahdi Sabit and minority stockholder Miriam Bienstock had both been bought out in September 1964 and the other remaining partner, Nesuhi Ertegun, was eventually convinced to side with Wexler. Since they jointly held more stock, Ahmet was obliged to agree to the sale.\nIn October 1967, Atlantic was sold to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for US$17.5 million, although all the partners later agreed that it was a poor deal that greatly undervalued Atlantic's true worth. Initially, Atlantic and Atco operated entirely separately from the group's other labels, Warner Bros. Records and Reprise Records, and management did not interfere with the music division, since their ailing movie division was losing money, while the Warner recording division was booming. By mid-1968 Warner's recording and publishing interests were generating 74% of the group's total profits.\nThe sale of Atlantic Records activated a clause in the distribution agreement with Stax Records calling for renegotiation of the distribution deal and at this point, the Stax partners discovered that the deal gave Atlantic ownership of all the Stax recordings Atlantic distributed. The new Warner owners refused to relinquish ownership of the Stax masters, so the distribution deal ended in May 1968. Atlantic continues to hold the rights to Stax recordings it distributed in the 1960s.\nIn the wake of the takeover, Jerry Wexler's influence in the company rapidly diminished; by his own admission, he and Ertegun had run Atlantic as \"utmost despots\" but in the new corporate structure, he found himself unwilling to accept the delegation of responsibility that his executive role dictated. He was also alienated from the \"rockoid\" white acts that were quickly becoming the label's most profitable commodities and dispirited by the rapidly waning fortunes of the black acts he had championed, such as Ben E. King and Solomon Burke. Wexler ultimately decided to leave New York and move to Florida. Following his departure, Ertegun\u2014who had previously taken little interest in Atlantic's business affairs\u2014took decisive control of the label and quickly became a major force in the expanding Warner music group.\nDuring 1968, Atlantic established a new subsidiary label, Cotillion Records. The label was originally formed as an outlet for blues and deep Southern soul. Its first single, Otis Clay's version of \"She's About A Mover\", was an R&amp;B hit. Cotillion's catalog quickly expanded to include progressive rock, folk-rock, gospel, jazz and comedy. In 1976, the label started focusing on disco and R&amp;B. Among its acts were the post-Curtis Mayfield Impressions, Slave, Brook Benton, Jean Knight, Mass Production, Sister Sledge, The Velvet Underground, Stacy Lattisaw, Lou Donaldson, Mylon LeFevre, Stevie Woods, Johnny Gill, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Garland Green, The Dynamics, The Fabulous Counts, and The Fatback Band. Cotillion was also responsible for launching the career of Luther Vandross, who recorded for the label as part of the trio Luther. Cotillion also released the triple-albums soundtrack of the Woodstock festival film in 1970. From 1970 it also distributed Embryo Records, founded by jazz flautist Herbie Mann after his earlier Atlantic contract had expired.\nIn addition to establishing Cotillion, Atlantic began expanding its own roster to include rock, soul/rock, progressive rock, British bands and singer songwriters. Two female artists were personally signed by Wexler, with album releases in 1969, Dusty Springfield (\"Dusty in Memphis\") and Lotti Golden (\"Motor-Cycle\"), although Golden also had a close working relationship with Ertegun, who was instrumental in her signing with the label. By 1969, the Atlantic 8000 series (1968\u201372) consisted of R&amp;B, rock, soul/rock and psychedelic acts. Other releases that year include albums by Aretha Franklin (\"Soul '69\"), Led Zeppelin (\"Led Zeppelin\"), Don Covay (\"House of Blue Lights\"), Boz Scaggs (\"Boz Scaggs\"), Roberta Flack (\"First Take\"), Wilson Pickett (\"Hey Jude\"), Mott the Hoople (\"Mott the Hoople\"), and Black Pearl (\"Black Pearl\").\nIn 1969, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was taken over by the Kinney National Company, and in the early 1970s the group was rebadged as Warner Communications. After buying Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records in 1970, Kinney combined the operations of all of its record labels under a new holding company, WEA, and also known as Warner Music Group. WEA was also used as a label for distributing the company's artists outside North America. In January 1970, Ahmet Ertegun was successful in his executive battle against Warner Bros. Records President Mike Maitland to keep Atlantic Records autonomous. As a result, Maitland was fired by Kinney president Steve Ross. Ertegun recommended Mo Ostin to succeed Maitland as Warner Bros. Records president. With Ertegun's power at Warners now secure, Atlantic was able to maintain autonomy through the parent company reorganizations and continue to do their own marketing, while WEA handled distribution.\nRock era.\nSome acts on the Atlantic roster in this period were British (including Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Yes, Bad Company and Phil Collins) and this was largely due to Ertegun. According to Greenberg, Ertegun had long seen the UK as a source of untapped talent. At his urging, Greenberg visited the UK six or seven times every year in search of acts to sign to the label.\nFor much of its early history, Jerry Wexler had been manager of the label, while Ertegun had concentrated on A&amp;R and had less interest in the business side. That changed after the sale to Warner. Although Ertegun had been forced into accepting the sale, he turned the situation to his advantage. He gained executive control of the label and influenced the Warner group. By contrast, Wexler was disenchanted by Atlantic's move into rock; he left in 1975. Wexler's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jerry L. Greenberg replaced him and played a role in Atlantic's success during the 1970s.\nIn seven years, Greenberg went from personal assistant to president of the label. Wexler had hired Greenberg and acted as his mentor, teaching him the daily operations of the record business. He learned how to treat musicians from Ertegun.\nSigning Led Zeppelin and CSN.\nIn 1968, by Peter Grant flew to New York with tapes of the debut album by British rock band Led Zeppelin. Ertegun and Wexler knew of the group's leader, Jimmy Page, through The Yardbirds. Their favorable opinion was reinforced by Dusty Springfield, who recommended Atlantic sign the band. Atlantic signed the band to an exclusive five-year contract. Atlantic described it in a press release as one of the \"most substantial deals\" in the label's history. Zeppelin recorded for Atlantic from 1968 to 1973. After the contract expired, they founded their label Swan Song and signed a distribution deal with Atlantic after being turned down by other labels.\nIn 1969, Stephen Stills was still signed to Atlantic under the contract dating from his time with Buffalo Springfield. His agent David Geffen went to Wexler to ask for Stills to be released from his Atlantic contract because Geffen wanted Stills' new group to sign with Columbia. Wexler lost his temper and threw Geffen out of his office, but Geffen called Ahmet Ertegun the next day, and Ertegun persuaded Geffen to convince Clive Davis at Columbia to let Atlantic sign Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.\nThe trio was formed following a chance meeting between members of three leading 1960s pop groups \u2013 Stephen Stills, David Crosby of The Byrds and Graham Nash of The Hollies. Stills and Crosby had been friends since the early 1960s; Nash had first met Crosby in the mid-1960s when The Byrds toured the UK, and he renewed the friendship when The Hollies toured the US in mid-1968. By this time creative tensions within The Hollies were coming to a head, and Nash had already decided to leave the group. Nash reunited with Crosby and met Stephen Stills (ex-Buffalo Springfield) at a party at the Los Angeles home of Cass Elliott in July 1968, during the Hollies US tour. After Crosby and Stills sang Stills' new composition \"You Don't Have To Cry\" that evening, Nash asked them to repeat it, and chimed in with an impromptu third harmony part. The trio's unique vocal chemistry was instantly apparent, so when Nash quit the Hollies in August 1968 and relocated to Los Angeles, the three immediately formed a trio, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. After failing their audition for Apple Records, thanks to Ertegun's intervention and negotiations with David Geffen, who represented Crosby and Nash, as well as Stills, they ultimately signed with Atlantic, who gave them virtually complete freedom to record their first album.\nThe signing was complicated by the fact that Nash was still under contract to Epic Records (The Hollies' US distributor), but Ertegun used his diplomatic prowess to overcome this by arranging a 'swap' \u2013 he released former Buffalo Springfield member Richie Furay from his Atlantic contract, allowing Furay's new group Poco to sign to Epic, and in exchange Columbia Records (the parent company of Epic) allowed Nash to sign to Atlantic. In the event, Ertegun and Atlantic were the clear winners. Poco achieved moderate success for Epic, but Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash's self-titled debut album (released in May 1969) became a huge and enduring hit, reaching #6 on the \"Billboard\" album chart, spawning two US Top 40 singles, becoming a multi-platinum seller and eventually earning a place in the \"Rolling Stone\" list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nHot on the heels of the huge success of CSNY and Led Zeppelin, British band Yes rapidly established themselves as one of the leading groups in the burgeoning progressive rock genre. Their success played a significant part in establishing the primacy of the long-playing album as the major sales format for rock music in the 1970s. After several lineup changes during 1969\u201370, the band settled into its \"classic\" incarnation, with guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who both joined during 1971. Although the extended length of much of their material made it somewhat difficult to promote the band with single releases, their live prowess gained them an avid following and their albums were hugely successful \u2013 their third LP \"The Yes Album\" (1971), which featured the debut of new guitarist Steve Howe, became their first big hit, reaching #4 in the UK and just scraping onto the chart in the US at #40. Beginning with their fourth album \"Fragile\", each of the eleven albums they released between 1971 and 1991 (including the lavishly packaged live triple-album \"Yessongs\") made the Top 20 in the US and the UK, and the double-LP \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" (1973) and \"Going For The One\" (1977) both reached #1 in the UK.\nMuch of Atlantic's renewed success as a rock label in the late 1970s can be attributed to the efforts of renowned A&amp;R manager John Kalodner. In 1974, the former photographer, record store manager and music critic joined Atlantic's New York publicity department. In 1975, Kalodner moved to the A&amp;R department, rose rapidly through the ranks, and in 1976 he was promoted to become Atlantic's first West Coast director of A&amp;R. Over the next four years he was instrumental in signing a string of major acts including Foreigner, AC/DC, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Kalodner built his reputation by signing acts that other labels had turned down, and perhaps the most significant example of his achievements in this area was his championing of the Anglo-American band Foreigner.\nThe group was the brainchild of expatriate British musicians Mick Jones (ex Spooky Tooth) and Ian McDonald, one of the founding members of King Crimson. The demo tapes of the songs that eventually became their debut album (including the song \"Feels Like The First Time\") were famously rejected by almost every major label, including Atlantic \u2013 although their tenacious manager Bud Prager later revealed that, in retaliation for a previous bad deal, he deliberately did not approach CBS (\"They had screwed me out of a lot of money, so I figured I would screw them out of Foreigner. The band was never even offered to them.\")\nPrager persisted with Atlantic, even though their A&amp;R department and label President Jerry Greenberg repeatedly rejected Foreigner. Kalodner's belief in the group (and a live audition) finally convinced Greenberg to allow Kalodner to sign them and take them on as his personal project. Even then, Kalodner was turned down by twenty-six producers before he found someone willing to take on the project. Despite all the resistance, Foreigner was a success. Their 1976 debut single \"Feels Like The First Time\" reached #4 on the Billboard singles chart, their self-titled debut album sold more than 4 million copies, and the subsequent singles from the album kept the group in the US charts continuously for more than a year. In the years that followed, Foreigner became one of Atlantic's biggest successes, and one of the biggest-selling groups in history, scoring a string of international hits and selling more than 80 million albums worldwide, including 37.5 million albums in the US alone.\nIn 1978, Atlantic finally broke the leading UK progressive group Genesis as a major act in the US. Ahmet Ertegun had first seen them perform in the Midwest on one of their early American tours, and it was on this occasion that he also became an ardent fan of their drummer/vocalist, Phil Collins. Jerry Greenberg signed the group to Atlantic in the US in 1973 on Ertegun's advice, but although they were very successful in Europe, Genesis remained at best a \"cult\" act in America for most of the Seventies. In the meantime, original lead singer Peter Gabriel had left the group in 1975, followed in 1977 by lead guitarist Steve Hackett, reducing the group to a three-piece. Ertegun was directly involved in the recording of the band's 1978 album \"...And Then There Were Three...\", personally remixing the album's projected first single \"Follow You, Follow Me\". Although the group did not use this version, it guided them in their subsequent production. Collins later commented, \"We didn't use his version, but we knew what he was getting at. He saw something more in there that wasn't coming out before\". The released version of \"Follow You, Follow Me\" gave Genesis their first hit single in the US, the album became their first American gold record, and the experience resulted in Ertegun and Collins becoming close friends.\nBy 1979, Genesis drummer and singer Phil Collins was considering branching out into a solo career. Reacting to the breakup of his first marriage, he had begun writing and recording new songs at home, which were considerably different from the material he had been recording with Genesis. Although many in the industry reportedly discouraged him from going solo, Collins was strongly supported by Ertegun, who encouraged him to record an album after hearing the R&amp;B-flavoured demo tapes Collins had recorded in his garage. Ertegun also insisted on changes to the song that became Collins' debut single. After hearing the song's sparsely arranged opening section, Ertegun said: \"Where's the backbeat, man? The kids won't know where it is \u2013 you've got to put extra drums on it\". Collins replied \"The drums come later,\" to which Ertegun retorted \"By that time the kids will have switched over to another radio station\". Acceding to Ertegun's demand, Collins took the unusual step of overdubbing extra drums on the finished master tape, and he later commented, \"He (Ertegun) was quite right\".\nBy early 1980, when Collins was recording his solo album, the record industry was suffering greatly from the impact of the worldwide economic recession, and many labels were beginning to cull their rosters and drop acts that were not providing major returns. At this same time, Genesis' contract with Atlantic was up for renewal, and Collins was yet to sign as a solo artist. As part of the negotiations, Collins and his bandmates wanted their own 'vanity' label, Duke Records, but according to Kalodner, and despite Ertegun's personal interest, the group's demands, and their relatively modest performance in the US made Atlantic executives ambivalent about the deal. Kalodner was overseeing the recording of Collins' solo album while Atlantic were vacillating about signing the band and Collins, but it was at this point that Kalodner was abruptly dismissed from Atlantic, although he was almost immediately recruited to head the A&amp;R division at the newly formed Geffen Records. Angered by his unceremonious ejection from Atlantic, he alerted Geffen to Collins' availability, but to his chagrin, neither Geffen nor any other US label showed interest. He then alerted Virgin Records boss Richard Branson, who immediately contacted Collins' manager Tony Stratton Smith and signed Collins to Virgin in the UK as a solo act.\nAlthough Ertegun subsequently disputed Kalodner's account of the Genesis/Collins contract saga, he agreed that the loss of Gabriel was a big mistake, and his regret about his handling of the matter was only compounded by Gabriel's subsequent success with Geffen. Much of this was due to Kalodner, who later admitted that, as soon as Gabriel was dropped from Atlantic, he realized he had made a mistake. In order to make amends to Gabriel, he alerted both CBS and Geffen to the fact that Gabriel was available, and after a bidding war, Gabriel signed with Geffen. They released his fourth solo album (a.k.a. \"Security\") in 1982 to wide acclaim, and Gabriel scored a minor US hit with the single \"Shock The Monkey\". Gabriel achieved huge international success with his fifth album \"So\" (1986), which reached #1 in the UK and #2 in the US and sold more than 5 million copies in the US. He then scored a US #1 hit with the R&amp;B-influenced single \"Sledgehammer\", which featured the legendary Memphis Horns, and which Gabriel later described as \"my chance to sing like Otis Redding\".\nLong Branch warehouse fire.\nA fire destroyed most of Atlantic's tape archive in the early morning of February 8, 1978. It had been stored in a non-air-conditioned warehouse in Long Branch, New Jersey. The four-story warehouse, located at 199 Broadway, was the former location of Vogel's Department Store, before it closed down in March 1975. The building was purchased less than a week earlier and had been scheduled to reopen as a Nadler's Furniture Center, in an effort to revitalize the downtown area.\nThe building was owned by the family of Sheldon Vogel, the chief financial officer of Atlantic at the time. He had recommended moving the company's multitracks and unreleased recordings to the building after Ertegun had complained about the aforementioned tapes taking up too much space in the company's Manhattan offices in New York.\nAlthough master tapes of the material in Atlantic's released back catalog survived due to being stored in New York, the fire destroyed or damaged an estimated 5,000\u20136,000 reels of tape, including virtually all of the company's unreleased master tapes, alternative takes, rehearsal tapes and session multi-tracks recorded between 1948 and 1969. Atlantic was one of the first labels to record in stereo; many of the tapes that were lost were stereo 'alternates' recorded in the late 1940s and 1950s (which Atlantic routinely taped simultaneously with the mono versions until the 1960s) as well as almost all of the 8-track multitrack masters recorded by Tom Dowd in the 1950s and 1960s. According to \"Billboard\" journalist Bill Holland, news of the fire was kept quiet, and one Atlantic staffer who spoke to Holland reported that he did not find out about it until a year later. Reissue producers and archivists subsequently located some tapes that were at first presumed 'lost', but which had survived because they had evidently been removed from the New Jersey archive years earlier and not returned. During the compilation of the Rhino-Atlantic John Coltrane boxed set, producer Joel Dorn located supposedly destroyed outtakes from Coltrane's seminal 1959 album \"Giant Steps\", plus other tapes including Bobby Darin's original Atco demo of \"Dream Lover\" (with Fred Neil playing guitar). Atlantic archivists have since rediscovered other 'lost' material including unreleased masters, alternative takes and rehearsal tapes by Ray Charles, Vann \"Piano Man\" Walls, Ornette Coleman, Lennie Tristano and Lee Konitz.\n40th Anniversary concert.\nIn May 1988, the label held a 40th Anniversary concert, broadcast on HBO. This concert, which was almost 13 hours in length, featured performances by a large number of their artists and included reunions of some rock legends like Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills, and Nash (being David Crosby's first full band performance since being released from prison).\n2000s.\nA country music division, which was founded in the 1980s, was closed in 2001.\nTime Warner sold Warner Music Group to a group of investors for $2.6 billion in late 2003. The deal closed in early 2004, consolidating Elektra Records and Atlantic into one label operated in the eastern United States.\nIn 2006, the label denied \"Weird Al\" Yankovic permission to release \"You're Pitiful\", a parody of James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful\", despite Blunt's approval. Atlantic said it was too early in Blunt's career, and it did not want him to be a one-hit wonder. Although Yankovic could have made the parody anyway, claiming fair use, his record label, Volcano Entertainment, thought it best not to \"go to war\" with Atlantic. The parody was released online for free on June 7. He later recorded two more parodies, \"White &amp; Nerdy\", and \"Do I Creep You Out\", both released September 26 to replace it. He wore T-shirts reading \"Atlantic Records sucks\" while performing live and, in the music video for \"White &amp; Nerdy\", he defaces Atlantic's article on Wikipedia, replacing the page with \"YOU SUCK!\" in large type, which resulted in many repeat vandals.\nIn 2007, the label celebrated its 60th anniversary with the May 2 PBS broadcast of the \"American Masters\" documentary \"Atlantic Records: The House that Ahmet Built\" and the simultaneous Starbucks CD release of \"Atlantic 60th Anniversary: R&amp;B Classics Chosen By Ahmet Ertegun\".\nThat year also saw Atlantic reach a milestone for major record labels. According to the \"International Herald Tribune\", \"More than half of its music sales in the United States are now from digital products like downloads on iTunes and ring tones for cellphones\", doing so \"without seeing as steep of a decline in compact disc sales as the rest of the industry\".\n2020s.\nIn the early 2020s, Atlantic Records adopted new strategies to adapt to the changing media landscape. With new avenues for talent discovery, such as platforms like TikTok, the record company expanded its consideration for new talents to newly emerging artists on social media. Musical acts such as Flyana Boss, Efflo and Flawed Mangoes have subsequently been signed by the label as a result. In 2024, Atlantic Records signed New Zealand and South Korean singer Ros\u00e9, a member of the girl group Blackpink, for her solo career. In September 2025, it was announced Hilary Duff had signed with the label, with plans to release her first album in a decade, as well as a docu-series chronically her return to music.\nNotable sublabels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The resulting electrically charged atom or molecule is called an ion. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons, and ions, or through the interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected.\nUses.\nEveryday examples of gas ionization occur within a fluorescent lamp or other electrical discharge lamps. It is also used in radiation detectors such as the Geiger-M\u00fcller counter or the ionization chamber. The ionization process is widely used in a variety of equipment in fundamental science (e.g., mass spectrometry) and in medical treatment (e.g., radiation therapy). It is also widely used for air purification, though studies have shown harmful effects of this application.\nProduction of ions.\nNegatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. The process is known as electron capture ionization.\nPositively charged ions are produced by transferring an amount of energy to a bound electron in a collision with charged particles (e.g. ions, electrons or positrons) or with photons. The threshold amount of the required energy is known as ionization energy. The study of such collisions is of fundamental importance with regard to the few-body problem, which is one of the major unsolved problems in physics. Kinematically complete experiments, i.e. experiments in which the complete momentum vector of all collision fragments (the scattered projectile, the recoiling target-ion, and the ejected electron) are determined, have contributed to major advances in the theoretical understanding of the few-body problem in recent years.\nAdiabatic ionization.\nAdiabatic ionization is a form of ionization in which an electron is removed from or added to an atom or molecule in its lowest energy state to form an ion in its lowest energy state.\nThe Townsend discharge is a good example of the creation of positive ions and free electrons due to ion impact. It is a cascade reaction involving electrons in a region with a sufficiently high electric field in a gaseous medium that can be ionized, such as air. Following an original ionization event, due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive ion drifts towards the cathode, while the free electron drifts towards the anode of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.\nIonization efficiency is the ratio of the number of ions formed to the number of electrons or photons used.\nIonization energy of atoms.\nThe trend in the ionization energy of atoms is often used to demonstrate the periodic behavior of atoms with respect to the atomic number, as summarized by ordering atoms in Mendeleev's table. This is a valuable tool for establishing and understanding the ordering of electrons in atomic orbitals without going into the details of wave functions or the ionization process.\nAn example is presented in the figure to the right. The periodic abrupt decrease in ionization potential after rare gas atoms, for instance, indicates the emergence of a new shell in alkali metals. In addition, the local maximums in the ionization energy plot, moving from left to right in a row, are indicative of s, p, d, and f sub-shells.\nSemi-classical description of ionization.\nClassical physics and the Bohr model of the atom can qualitatively explain photoionization and collision-mediated ionization. In these cases, during the ionization process, the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. The classical description, however, cannot describe tunnel ionization since the process involves the passage of electron through a classically forbidden potential barrier.\nQuantum mechanical description of ionization.\nThe interaction of atoms and molecules with sufficiently strong laser pulses or with other charged particles leads to the ionization to singly or multiply charged ions. The ionization rate, i.e. the ionization probability in unit time, can be calculated using quantum mechanics. (There are classical methods available also, like the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo Method (CTMC), but it is not overall accepted and often criticized by the community.) There are two quantum mechanical methods exist, perturbative and non-perturbative methods like time-dependent coupled-channel or time independent close coupling methods where the wave function is expanded in a finite basis set. There are numerous options available e.g. B-splines, generalized Sturmians or Coulomb wave packets. Another non-perturbative method is to solve the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation fully numerically on a lattice.\nIn general, the analytic solutions are not available, and the approximations required for manageable numerical calculations do not provide accurate enough results. However, when the laser intensity is sufficiently high, the detailed structure of the atom or molecule can be ignored and analytic solution for the ionization rate is possible.\nTunnel ionization.\nTunnel ionization is ionization due to quantum tunneling. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and thus a greater chance to do so. In practice, tunnel ionization is observable when the atom or molecule is interacting with near-infrared strong laser pulses. This process can be understood as a process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. This picture is generally known as multiphoton ionization (MPI).\nKeldysh modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states. In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al. included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which we call the PPT model) was derived for short range potential and includes the effect of the long range Coulomb interaction through the first order correction in the quasi-classical action. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:Sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fit very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of the Keldysh parameter.\nThe rate of MPI on atom with an ionization potential formula_1 in a linearly polarized laser with frequency formula_2 is given by\nformula_3\nwhere \nThe coefficients formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are given by\nformula_11\nThe coefficient formula_12 is given by\n&lt;math&gt;\n A_m (\\omega, \\gamma) =\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first ionization energy is quantitatively expressed as\nX(g) + energy \u27f6 X+(g) + e\u2212\nwhere X is any atom or molecule, X+ is the resultant ion when the original atom was stripped of a single electron, and e\u2212 is the removed electron. Ionization energy is positive for neutral atoms, meaning that the ionization is an endothermic process. Roughly speaking, the closer the outermost electrons are to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom's ionization energy.\nIn physics, ionization energy (IE) is usually expressed in electronvolts (eV) or joules (J). In chemistry, it is expressed as the energy to ionize a mole of atoms or molecules, usually as kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol).\nComparison of ionization energies of atoms in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends which follow the rules of Coulombic attraction:\nThe latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively farther from the nucleus, with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column.\nThe \"n\"th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from the species having a positive charge of (\"n\" \u2212 1). For example, the first three ionization energies are defined as follows:\n1st ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X \u27f6 X+ + e\u2212\n2nd ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X+ \u27f6 X2+ + e\u2212\n3rd ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X2+ \u27f6 X3+ + e\u2212\nThe most notable influences that determine ionization energy include:\nMinor influences include:\nThe term \"ionization potential\" is an older and obsolete term for ionization energy, because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic potential.\nDetermination of ionization energies.\nThe ionization energy of atoms, denoted \"E\"i, is measured by finding the minimal energy of light quanta (photons) or electrons accelerated to a known energy that will kick out the least bound atomic electrons. The measurement is performed in the gas phase on single atoms. While only noble gases occur as monatomic gases, other gases can be split into single atoms. Also, many solid elements can be heated and vaporized into single atoms. Monatomic vapor is contained in a previously evacuated tube that has two parallel electrodes connected to a voltage source. The ionizing excitation is introduced through the walls of the tube or produced within.\nWhen ultraviolet light is used, the wavelength is swept down the ultraviolet range. At a certain wavelength (\u03bb) and frequency of light (\u03bd=c/\u03bb, where c is the speed of light), the light quanta, whose energy is proportional to the frequency, will have energy high enough to dislodge the least bound electrons. These electrons will be attracted to the positive electrode, and the positive ions remaining after the photoionization will get attracted to the negatively charged electrode. These electrons and ions will establish a current through the tube. The ionization energy will be the energy of photons \"h\u03bd\"i (\"h\" is the Planck constant) that caused a steep rise in the current: \"E\"i = \"h\u03bd\"i.\nWhen high-velocity electrons are used to ionize the atoms, they are produced by an electron gun inside a similar evacuated tube. The energy of the electron beam can be controlled by the acceleration voltages. The energy of these electrons that gives rise to a sharp onset of the current of ions and freed electrons through the tube will match the ionization energy of the atoms.\nAtoms: values and trends.\nGenerally, the (\"N\"+1)th ionization energy of a particular element is larger than the \"N\"th ionization energy (it may also be noted that the ionization energy of an anion is generally less than that of cations and neutral atom for the same element). When the next ionization energy involves removing an electron from the same electron shell, the increase in ionization energy is primarily due to the increased net charge of the ion from which the electron is being removed. Electrons removed from more highly charged ions experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires more energy. In addition, when the next ionization energy involves removing an electron from a lower electron shell, the greatly decreased distance between the nucleus and the electron also increases both the electrostatic force and the distance over which that force must be overcome to remove the electron. Both of these factors further increase the ionization energy.\nSome values for elements of the third period are given in the following table:\nLarge jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when passing noble gas configurations. For example, as can be seen in the table above, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s electrons from a magnesium atom) are much smaller than the third, which requires stripping off a 2p electron from the neon configuration of Mg2+. That 2p electron is much closer to the nucleus than the 3s electrons removed previously.\nIonization energy is also a periodic trend within the periodic table. Moving left to right within a period, or upward within a group, the first ionization energy generally increases, with exceptions such as aluminium and sulfur in the table above. As the nuclear charge of the nucleus increases across the period, the electrostatic attraction increases between electrons and protons, hence the atomic radius decreases, and the electron cloud comes closer to the nucleus because the electrons, especially the outermost one, are held more tightly by the higher effective nuclear charge.\nOn moving downward within a given group, the electrons are held in higher-energy shells with higher principal quantum number n, further from the nucleus and therefore are more loosely bound so that the ionization energy decreases. The effective nuclear charge increases only slowly so that its effect is outweighed by the increase in n.\nExceptions in ionization energies.\nThere are exceptions to the general trend of rising ionization energies within a period. For example, the value decreases from beryllium (Be: 9.3 eV) to boron (B: 8.3 eV), and from nitrogen (N: 14.5 eV) to oxygen (O: 13.6 eV). These dips can be explained in terms of electron configurations.\nBoron has its last electron in a 2p orbital, which has its electron density further away from the nucleus on average than the 2s electrons in the same shell. The 2s electrons then shield the 2p electron from the nucleus to some extent, and it is easier to remove the 2p electron from boron than to remove a 2s electron from beryllium, resulting in a lower ionization energy for B.\nIn oxygen, the last electron shares a doubly occupied p-orbital with an electron of opposing spin. The two electrons in the same orbital are closer together on average than two electrons in different orbitals, so that they shield each other from the nucleus more effectively and it is easier to remove one electron, resulting in a lower ionization energy.\nFurthermore, after every noble gas element, the ionization energy drastically drops. This occurs because the outer electron in the alkali metals requires a much lower amount of energy to be removed from the atom than the inner shells. This also gives rise to low electronegativity values for the alkali metals.\nThe trends and exceptions are summarized in the following subsections:\nIonization energy anomalies in groups.\nIonization energy values tend to decrease on going to heavier elements within a group as shielding is provided by more electrons and overall, the valence shells experience a weaker attraction from the nucleus, attributed to the larger covalent radius which increase on going down a group Nonetheless, this is not always the case. As one exception, in Group 10 palladium (Pd: 8.34 eV) has a higher ionization energy than nickel (Ni: 7.64 eV), contrary to the general decrease for the elements from technetium Tc to xenon Xe. Such anomalies are summarized below:\nBohr model for hydrogen atom.\nThe ionization energy of the hydrogen atom (&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;) can be evaluated in the Bohr model, which predicts that the atomic energy level formula_1 has energy\n formula_2\n&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; is the Rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom. For hydrogen in the ground state formula_3 and formula_4 so that the energy of the atom before ionization is simply &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;.\nAfter ionization, the energy is zero for a motionless electron infinitely far from the proton, so that the ionization energy is &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. This agrees with the experimental value for the hydrogen atom.\nQuantum-mechanical explanation.\nAccording to the more complete theory of quantum mechanics, the location of an electron is best described as a probability distribution within an electron cloud, i.e. atomic orbital. The energy can be calculated by integrating over this cloud. The cloud's underlying mathematical representation is the wavefunction, which is built from Slater determinants consisting of molecular spin orbitals. These are related by Pauli's exclusion principle to the antisymmetrized products of the atomic or molecular orbitals.\nThere are two main ways in which ionization energy is calculated. In general, the computation for the \"N\"th ionization energy requires calculating the energies of formula_5 and formula_6 electron systems. Calculating these energies exactly is not possible except for the simplest systems (i.e. hydrogen and hydrogen-like elements), primarily because of difficulties in integrating the electron correlation terms. Therefore, approximation methods are routinely employed, with different methods varying in complexity (computational time) and accuracy compared to empirical data. This has become a well-studied problem and is routinely done in computational chemistry. The second way of calculating ionization energies is mainly used at the lowest level of approximation, where the ionization energy is provided by Koopmans' theorem, which involves the highest occupied molecular orbital or \"HOMO\" and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or \"LUMO\", and states that the ionization energy of an atom or molecule is equal to the negative value of energy of the orbital from which the electron is ejected. This means that the ionization energy is equal to the negative of HOMO energy, which in a formal equation can be written as:\n formula_7\nMolecules: vertical and adiabatic ionization energy.\nIonization of molecules often leads to changes in molecular geometry, and two types of (first) ionization energy are defined \u2013 \"adiabatic\" and \"vertical\".\nAdiabatic ionization energy.\nThe adiabatic ionization energy of a molecule is the \"minimum\" amount of energy required to remove an electron from a neutral molecule, i.e. the difference between the energy of the vibrational ground state of the neutral species (v\" = 0 level) and that of the positive ion (v' = 0). The specific equilibrium geometry of each species does not affect this value.\nVertical ionization energy.\nDue to the possible changes in molecular geometry that may result from ionization, additional transitions may exist between the vibrational ground state of the neutral species and vibrational excited states of the positive ion. In other words, ionization is accompanied by vibrational excitation. The intensity of such transitions is explained by the Franck\u2013Condon principle, which predicts that the most probable and intense transition corresponds to the vibrationally excited state of the positive ion that has the same geometry as the neutral molecule. This transition is referred to as the \"vertical\" ionization energy since it is represented by a completely vertical line on a potential energy diagram (see Figure).\nFor a diatomic molecule, the geometry is defined by the length of a single bond. The removal of an electron from a bonding molecular orbital weakens the bond and increases the bond length. In Figure 1, the lower potential energy curve is for the neutral molecule and the upper surface is for the positive ion. Both curves plot the potential energy as a function of bond length. The horizontal lines correspond to vibrational levels with their associated vibrational wave functions. Since the ion has a weaker bond, it will have a longer bond length. This effect is represented by shifting the minimum of the potential energy curve to the right of the neutral species. The adiabatic ionization is the diagonal transition to the vibrational ground state of the ion. Vertical ionization may involve vibrational excitation of the ionic state and therefore requires greater energy.\nIn many circumstances, the adiabatic ionization energy is often a more interesting physical quantity since it describes the difference in energy between the two potential energy surfaces. However, due to experimental limitations, the adiabatic ionization energy is often difficult to determine, whereas the vertical detachment energy is easily identifiable and measurable.\nAnalogs of ionization energy to other systems.\nWhile the term ionization energy is largely used only for gas-phase atomic, cationic, or molecular species, there are a number of analogous quantities that consider the amount of energy required to remove an electron from other physical systems.\nElectron binding energy.\nElectron binding energy is a generic term for the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a particular electron shell for an atom or ion, due to these negatively charged electrons being held in place by the electrostatic pull of the positively charged nucleus. For example, the electron binding energy for removing a 3p3/2 electron from the chloride ion is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the chlorine atom when it has a charge of \u22121. In this particular example, the electron binding energy has the same magnitude as the electron affinity for the neutral chlorine atom. In another example, the electron binding energy refers to the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the dicarboxylate dianion \u2212O2C(CH2)8CO.\nThe graph to the right shows the binding energy for electrons in different shells in neutral atoms. The ionization energy is the lowest binding energy for a particular atom (although these are not all shown in the graph).\nSolid surfaces: work function.\nWork function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from a solid surface, where the work function \"W\" for a given surface is defined by the difference\nformula_8\nwhere \u2212\"e\" is the charge of an electron, \"\u03d5\" is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the surface, and \"E\"F is the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) inside the material.\nNote.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More precisely, electric potential is the amount of work needed to move a test charge from a reference point to a specific point in a static electric field, normalized to a unit of charge. The test charge used is small enough that disturbance to the field-producing charges is unnoticeable, and its motion across the field is supposed to proceed with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test charge acquiring kinetic energy or producing radiation. By definition, the electric potential at the reference point is zero units. Typically, the reference point is earth or a point at infinity, although any point can be used.\nIn classical electrostatics, the electrostatic field is a vector quantity expressed as the gradient of the electrostatic potential, which is a scalar quantity denoted by \"V\" or occasionally \"\u03c6\", equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in joules) divided by the charge of that particle (measured in coulombs). By dividing out the charge on the particle a quotient is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself. In short, an electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.\nThis value can be calculated in either a static (time-invariant) or a dynamic (time-varying) electric field at a specific time with the unit joules per coulomb (J\u22c5C\u22121) or volt (V). The electric potential at infinity is assumed to be zero.\nIn electrodynamics, when time-varying fields are present, the electric field cannot be expressed only as a scalar potential. Instead, the electric field can be expressed as both the scalar electric potential and the magnetic vector potential. The electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four-vector, so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under Lorentz transformations.\nPractically, the electric potential is a continuous function in all space, because a spatial derivative of a discontinuous electric potential yields an electric field of impossibly infinite magnitude. Notably, the electric potential due to an idealized point charge (proportional to 1 \u2044 \"r\", with \"r\" the distance from the point charge) is continuous in all space except at the location of the point charge. Though electric field is not continuous across an idealized surface charge, it is not infinite at any point. Therefore, the electric potential is continuous across an idealized surface charge. Additionally, an idealized line of charge has electric potential (proportional to ln(\"r\"), with \"r\" the radial distance from the line of charge) is continuous everywhere except on the line of charge.\nIntroduction.\nClassical mechanics explores concepts such as force, energy, and potential. Force and potential energy are directly related. A net force acting on any object will cause it to accelerate. As an object moves in the direction of a force acting on it, its potential energy decreases. For example, the gravitational potential energy of a cannonball at the top of a hill is greater than at the base of the hill. As it rolls downhill, its potential energy decreases and is being translated to motion \u2013 kinetic energy.\nIt is possible to define the potential of certain force fields so that the potential energy of an object in that field depends only on the position of the object with respect to the field. Two such force fields are a gravitational field and an electric field (in the absence of time-varying magnetic fields). Such fields affect objects because of the intrinsic properties (e.g., mass or charge) and positions of the objects.\nAn object may possess a property known as electric charge. Since an electric field exerts force on a charged object, if the object has a positive charge, the force will be in the direction of the electric field vector at the location of the charge; if the charge is negative, the force will be in the opposite direction. \nThe magnitude of force is given by the quantity of the charge multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field vector,\nformula_1\nElectrostatics.\nAn electric potential at a point r in a static electric field E is given by the line integral\nformula_2\nwhere C is an arbitrary path from some fixed reference point to r; it is uniquely determined up to a constant that is added or subtracted from the integral. In electrostatics, the Maxwell-Faraday equation reveals that the curl formula_3 is zero, making the electric field conservative. Thus, the line integral above does not depend on the specific path C chosen but only on its endpoints, making formula_4 well-defined everywhere. The gradient theorem then allows us to write:\nformula_5\nThis states that the electric field points \"downhill\" towards lower voltages. By Gauss's law, the potential can also be found to satisfy Poisson's equation:\nformula_6\nwhere \u03c1 is the total charge density and formula_7 denotes the divergence.\nThe concept of electric potential is closely linked with potential energy. A test charge, \"q\", has an electric potential energy, \"U\"E, given by\nformula_8\nThe potential energy and hence, also the electric potential, is only defined up to an additive constant: one must arbitrarily choose a position where the potential energy and the electric potential are zero.\nThese equations cannot be used if i.e., in the case of a \"non-conservative electric field\" (caused by a changing magnetic field; see Maxwell's equations). The generalization of electric potential to this case is described in the section .\nElectric potential due to a point charge.\nThe electric potential arising from a point charge, \"Q\", at a distance, \"r\", from the location of \"Q\" is observed to be\nformula_9\nwhere \"\u03b5\"0 is the permittivity of vacuum, \"V\"E is known as the Coulomb potential. Note that, in contrast to the magnitude of an electric field due to a point charge, the electric potential scales respective to the reciprocal of the radius, rather than the radius squared.\nThe electric potential at any location, r, in a system of point charges is equal to the sum of the individual electric potentials due to every point charge in the system. This fact simplifies calculations significantly, because addition of potential (scalar) fields is much easier than addition of the electric (vector) fields. Specifically, the potential of a set of discrete point charges qi at points r\"i\" becomes\nformula_10\nwhere\nAnd the potential of a continuous charge distribution \"\u03c1\"(r) becomes\nformula_11\nwhere\nThe equations given above for the electric potential (and all the equations used here) are in the forms required by SI units. In some other (less common) systems of units, such as CGS-Gaussian, many of these equations would be altered.\nGeneralization to electrodynamics.\nWhen time-varying magnetic fields are present (which is true whenever there are time-varying electric fields and vice versa), it is not possible to describe the electric field simply as a scalar potential \"V\" because the electric field is no longer conservative: formula_12 is path-dependent because formula_13 (due to the Maxwell-Faraday equation).\nInstead, one can still define a scalar potential by also including the magnetic vector potential A. In particular, A is defined to satisfy:\nformula_14\nwhere B is the magnetic field. By the fundamental theorem of vector calculus, such an A can always be found, since the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero due to the absence of magnetic monopoles. Now, the quantity\nformula_15\n\"is\" a conservative field, since the curl of formula_16 is canceled by the curl of formula_17 according to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation. One can therefore write\nformula_18\nwhere \"V\" is the scalar potential defined by the conservative field F.\nThe electrostatic potential is simply the special case of this definition where A is time-invariant. On the other hand, for time-varying fields,\nformula_19\nunlike electrostatics.\nGauge freedom.\nThe electrostatic potential could have any constant added to it without affecting the electric field. In electrodynamics, the electric potential has infinitely many degrees of freedom. For any (possibly time-varying or space-varying) scalar field, \ud835\udf13, we can perform the following gauge transformation to find a new set of potentials that produce exactly the same electric and magnetic fields:\nformula_20\nGiven different choices of gauge, the electric potential could have quite different properties. In the Coulomb gauge, the electric potential is given by Poisson's equation\nformula_21\njust like in electrostatics. However, in the Lorenz gauge, the electric potential is a retarded potential that propagates at the speed of light and is the solution to an inhomogeneous wave equation:\nformula_22\nUnits.\nThe SI derived unit of electric potential is the volt (in honor of Alessandro Volta), denoted as V, which is why the electric potential difference between two points in space is known as a voltage. Older units are rarely used today. Variants of the centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units included a number of different units for electric potential, including the abvolt and the statvolt.\nGalvani potential versus electrochemical potential.\nInside metals (and other solids and liquids), the energy of an electron is affected not only by the electric potential, but also by the specific atomic environment that it is in. When a voltmeter is connected between two different types of metal, it measures the potential difference corrected for the different atomic environments. The quantity measured by a voltmeter is called electrochemical potential or fermi level, while the pure unadjusted electric potential, \"V\", is sometimes called the Galvani potential, \u03d5. The terms \"voltage\" and \"electric potential\" are a bit ambiguous but one may refer to either of these in different contexts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Notable contributors to the theory include Justus Von Liebig and Louis Pasteur, the latter of whom developed a purely microbial basis for the fermentation process based on his experiments. Pasteur's work on fermentation later led to his development of the germ theory of disease, which put the concept of spontaneous generation to rest. Although the fermentation process had been used extensively throughout history prior to the origin of Pasteur's prevailing theories, the underlying biological and chemical processes were not fully understood. In the contemporary, fermentation is used in the production of various alcoholic beverages, foodstuffs, and medications.\nOverview of fermentation.\nFermentation is the anaerobic metabolic process that converts sugar into acids, gases, or alcohols in oxygen starved environments. Yeast and many other microbes commonly use fermentation to carry out anaerobic respiration necessary for survival. Even the human body carries out fermentation processes from time to time, such as during long-distance running; lactic acid will build up in muscles over the course of long-term exertion. Within the human body, lactic acid is the by-product of ATP-producing fermentation, which produces energy so the body can continue to exercise in situations where oxygen intake cannot be processed fast enough. Although fermentation yields less ATP than aerobic respiration, it can occur at a much higher rate. Fermentation has been used by humans consciously since around 5000 BCE, evidenced by jars recovered in the Iran Zagros Mountains area containing remnants of microbes similar those present in the wine-making process.\nHistory.\nPrior to Pasteur's research on fermentation, there existed some preliminary competing notions of it. One scientist who had a substantial degree of influence on the theory of fermentation was Justus von Liebig. Liebig believed that fermentation was largely a process of decomposition as a consequence of the exposure of yeast to air and water. This theory was corroborated by Liebig's observation that other decomposing matter, such as rotten plant and animal parts, interacted with sugar in a similar manner as yeast. That is, the decomposition of albuminous matter (i.e. water-soluble proteins) caused sugar to transform to alcohol. Liebig held this view until his death in 1873. A different theory was supported by Charles Cagniard de la Tour and cell theorist Theodor Schwann, who claimed that alcoholic fermentation depended on the biological processes carried out by brewer's yeast.\nLouis Pasteur's interest in fermentation began when he noticed some remarkable properties of amyl alcohol\u2014a by-product of lactic acid and alcohol fermentation\u2014during his biochemical studies. In particular, Pasteur noted its ability to \u201crotate the plane of polarized light\u201d, and its \u201cunsymmetric arrangement of atoms.\" These behaviors were characteristic of organic compounds Pasteur had previously examined, but also presented a hurdle to his own research about a \"law of hemihedral correlation\". Pasteur had previously been attempting to derive connections between substances' chemical structures and external shape, and the optically active amyl alcohol did not follow his expectations according to the proposed 'law'. Pasteur sought a reason for why there happened to be this exception, and why such a chemical compound was generated during the fermentation process in the first place. In a series of lectures later in 1860, Pasteur attempted to link optical activity and molecular asymmetry to organic origins of substances, asserting that no chemical processes were capable of converting symmetric substances (inorganic) into asymmetric ones (organic). Hence, the amyl alcohol observation provided some of the first motivations for a biological explanation of fermentation.\nIn 1856, Pasteur was able to observe the microbes responsible for alcoholic fermentation under a microscope, as a professor of science in the University of Lille. According to a legend originating in the 1900 biography of Pasteur, one of his chemistry students\u2014an owner of a beetroot alcohol factory in Lille\u2014sought aid from him after an unsuccessful year of brewing. Pasteur performed experiments at the factory in observation of the fermentation process, noticing that yeast globules became elongated after lactic acid was formed, but round and full when alcohol was fermenting correctly.\nIn a different observation, Pasteur inspected particles originating on grapevines under the microscope and revealed the presence of living cells. Leaving these cells immersed in grape juice resulted in active alcoholic fermentation. This observation provided evidence for ending the distinction between \u2018artificial\u2019 fermentation in wine and \u2018true\u2019 fermentation in yeast products. The previous incorrect distinction had stemmed in part from the fact that yeast had to be added to beer wort in order to provoke desired alcoholic fermentation, while the fermenting catalysts for wine occurred naturally on grapevines; the fermentation of wine had been viewed as 'artificial' since it did not require additional catalyst, but the natural catalyst had been present on the grapevine itself. These observations provided Pasteur with a working hypothesis for future experiments.\nOne of the chemical processes that Pasteur studied was the fermentation of sugar into lactic acid, as occurs in the souring of milk. In an 1857 experiment, Pasteur was able to isolate microorganisms present in lactic acid ferment after the chemical process had taken place. Pasteur then cultivated the microorganisms in a culture with his laboratory. He was then able to accelerate the lactic acid fermentation process in fresh milk by administering the cultivated sample to it. This was an important step in proving his hypothesis that lactic acid fermentation was catalyzed by microorganisms.\nPasteur also experimented with the mechanisms of brewer's yeast in the absence of organic nitrogen. By adding pure brewer's yeast to a solution of cane sugar, ammonium salt, and yeast ash, Pasteur was able to observe the alcoholic fermentation process with all of its usual byproducts: glycerin, succinic acid, and small amounts of cellulose and fatty matters. However, if any of the ingredients were removed from the solution, no fermentation would occur. To Pasteur, this was proof that yeast required the nitrogen, minerals, and carbon from the medium for its metabolic processes, releasing carbonic acid and ethyl alcohol as byproducts. This also disproved Liebig's theory, since there was no albuminous matter present in the medium; the decomposition of the yeast was not the driving force for the observed fermentation.\nPasteur on spontaneous generation.\nBefore the 1860s and 1870s\u2014when Pasteur published his work on this theory\u2014it was believed that microorganisms and even some small animals such as frogs would spontaneously generate. Spontaneous generation was historically explained in a variety of ways. Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, theorized that creatures appeared out of certain concoctions of earthly elements, such as clay or mud mixing with water and sunlight. Later on, Felix Pouchet argued for the existence of 'plastic forces' within plant and animal debris capable of spontaneously generating eggs, and new organisms were born from these eggs. On top of this, a common piece of evidence that seemed to corroborate the theory was the appearance of maggots on raw meat after it was left exposed to open air.\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, Pasteur's interest in spontaneous generation led him to criticize Pouchet's theories and conduct experiments of his own. In his first experiment, he took boiled sugared yeast-water and sealed it in an airtight contraption. Feeding hot, sterile air into the mixture left it unaltered, while introducing atmospheric dust resulted in microbes and mold appearing within the mixture. This result was also strengthened by the fact that Pasteur used asbestos, a form of totally inorganic matter, to carry the atmospheric dust. In a second experiment, Pasteur used the same flasks and sugar-yeast mixture, but left it idle in 'swan-neck' flasks instead of introducing any extraneous matter. Some flasks were kept open to the common air as the control group, and these exhibited mold and microbial growths within a day or two. When the swan-neck flasks failed to show these same microbial growths, Pasteur concluded that the structure of the necks blocked the passage of atmospheric dust into the solution. From the two experiments, Pasteur concluded that the atmospheric dust carried germs responsible for the 'spontaneous generation' in his broths. Thus, Pasteur's work provided proof that the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is caused by biogenesis rather than some form of spontaneous generation.\nApplications.\nToday, the process of fermentation is used for a multitude of everyday applications including medication, beverages and food. Currently, companies like Genencor International uses the production of enzymes involved in fermentation to build a revenue of over $400 million a year. Many medications such as antibiotics are produced by the fermentation process. An example is the important drug cortisone, which can be prepared by the fermentation of a plant steroid known as diosgenin. \nThe enzymes used in the reaction are provided by the mold Rhizopus nigricans. Just as it is commonly known, alcohol of all types and brands are also produced by way of fermentation and distillation. Moonshine is a classic example of how this is carried out. Finally, foods such as yogurt are made by fermentation processes as well. Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains the characteristic bacterial cultures \"Lactobacillus bulgaricus\" and \"Streptococcus thermopiles\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census. The town is less than across the River Brue from Street, a village which is now larger than Glastonbury.\nEvidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times. Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the Bronze Age. Centwine was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey, which dominated the town for the next 700 years. One of the most important abbeys in England, it was the site of Edmund Ironside's coronation as King of England in 1016. Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, including the Tribunal, George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn and the Somerset Rural Life Museum, which is based at the site of a 14th-century abbey manor barn, often referred to as a tithe barn, are associated with the abbey. The Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century.\nThe town became a centre for commerce, which led to the construction of the market cross, Glastonbury Canal and the Glastonbury and Street railway station, the largest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Railway. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust and nearby is the Ham Wall National Nature Reserve.\nGlastonbury has been described as having a New Age community, and possibly being where New Age beliefs originated at the turn of the twentieth century. It is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nDuring the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low-lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Sweet Track, west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in Belmarsh Prison. Tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806\u00a0BC. It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. The track was discovered in the course of peat digging in 1970, and is named after its discoverer, Ray Sweet. It extended across the marsh between what was then an island at Westhay, and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to . The track is one of a network of tracks that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Built in the 39th century BC, during the Neolithic period, the track consisted of crossed poles of ash, oak and lime (\"Tilia\") which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that mainly consisted of oak planks laid end-to-end. Since the discovery of the Sweet Track, it has been determined that it was built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, dating from 3838 BC, and so 30\u00a0years older.\nGlastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue, on the Somerset Levels near Godney, some north west of Glastonbury. It covers an area of north to south by east to west, and housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. The village was built in about 300\u00a0BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around AD\u00a0100) when it was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.\nSharpham Park is a historic park, west of Glastonbury, which dates back to the Bronze Age.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe name Glastonbury is derived from . When the settlement is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called \"Glestingaburg\". The \"burg\" element is Old English and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the \"Glestinga\" element is obscure, and may derive from a Celtic personal name or from Old English (either from a name or otherwise). It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.\nHugh Ross Williamson cites a tale about St. Collen, one of the earliest hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is \"made of glass\" so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.\nWilliam of Malmesbury in his \"De Antiquitate Glastonie Ecclesie\" gives the Old Welsh\"Ineswitrin\" (or \"Ynys Witrin\") as its earliest name, and asserts that the founder of the town was the eponymous Glast, a descendant of Cunedda.\nCentwine (676\u2013685) was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey. King Edmund Ironside was buried at the abbey. The Domesday Book of 1086 indicates that in the hundred of \"Glastingberiensis\", the Abbey was the Lord in 1066 prior to the arrival of William the Conqueror, then tenant-in chief with Godwin as Lord of \"Glastingberi\" in 1086.\nTo the southwest of the town centre is Beckery, which was once a village in its own right but is now part of the suburbs. Around the 7th and 8th centuries it was occupied by a small monastic community associated with a cemetery. Archaeological excavations in 2016 uncovered 50 to 60 skeletons thought to be those of monks from Beckery Chapel during the 5th or early 6th century.\nSharpham Park was granted by King Eadwig to the then abbot \u00c6thelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was gifted by the soon-to-be King John I to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Edward Dyer was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building. It was the birthplace of Sir Edward Dyer (died 1607) an Elizabethan poet and courtier, the writer Henry Fielding (1707\u201354), and the cleric William Gould.\nIn the 1070s St Margaret's Chapel was built on Magdelene Street, originally as a hospital and later as almshouses for the poor. The building dates from 1444. The roof of the hall is thought to have been removed after the Dissolution, and some of the building was demolished in the 1960s. It is Grade II* listed, and a scheduled monument. In 2010 plans were announced to restore the building.\nDuring the Middle Ages the town largely depended on the abbey but was also a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century. A Saxon-era canal connected the abbey to the River Brue. Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, was executed with two of his monks on 15 November 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nDuring the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 Perkin Warbeck surrendered when he heard that Giles, Lord Daubeney's troops, loyal to Henry VII, were camped at Glastonbury.\nEarly modern.\nIn 1693 Glastonbury, Connecticut was founded and named after the English town from which some of the settlers had emigrated. It is rumored to have originally been called \"Glistening Town\" until the mid-19th century, when the name was changed to match the spelling of Glastonbury, England, but in fact, residents of the Connecticut town believe this to be a myth, based on the Glastonbury Historical Society's records. A representation of the Glastonbury thorn is incorporated onto the town seal.\nThe Somerset town's charter of incorporation was received in 1705. Growth in the trade and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors. The opening of the Glastonbury Canal produced an upturn in trade, and encouraged local building. The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, until the 1730s when it became a borough in its own right.\nModern history.\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the Glastonbury Canal drainage problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.\nIn the Northover district industrial production of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed in conjunction with the growth of C&amp;J Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries tourism developed based on the rise of antiquarianism, the association with the abbey and mysticism of the town. This was aided by accessibility via the rail and road network, which has continued to support the town's economy and led to a steady rise in resident population since 1801.\nGlastonbury received national media coverage in 1999 when cannabis plants were found in the town's floral displays.\nMythology and legends.\nGlastonbury is notable for myths and legends concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur as recorded by ancient historians William of Malmesbury, Venerable Bede, Gerald of Wales and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Many long-standing and cherished legends were examined in a four-year study by archaeologists, led by Professor Roberta Gilchrist, at the University of Reading, who, amongst other findings, speculated that the connection with King Arthur and his Queen, Guinevere, was created deliberately by the monks in 1184 to meet a financial crisis caused by a devastating fire. Other myths examined include the visit by Jesus, the building of the oldest church in England, and the flowering of the walking stick. Roberta Gilchrist stated, \"We didn't claim to disprove the legendary associations, nor would we wish to\". The site of King Arthur's supposed grave contained material dating from between the 11th and 15th centuries. Gilchrist said, \"That doesn't dispel the Arthurian legend, it just means the pit [20th century archaeologist Ralegh Radford] excavated he rather over-claimed.\" The study made new archaeological finds; its leader found Glastonbury to be a remarkable archaeological site. The new results were reported on the Glastonbury Abbey Web site, and were to be incorporated into the Abbey's guidebook; however, the leader of the study, who became a trustee of Glastonbury, said \"We are not in the business of destroying people's beliefs ... A thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place\". Gilchrist went on to say, \"archaeology can help us to understand how legends evolve and what people in the past believed\". She noted that the project has actually uncovered the first definitive proof of occupation at the Glastonbury Abbey site during the fifth century\u2014when Arthur allegedly lived.\nThe legend that Joseph of Arimathea retrieved certain holy relics was introduced by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, thought to have been a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.\nDe Boron's account relates how Joseph captured Jesus's blood in a cup (the \"Holy Grail\") which was subsequently brought to Britain. The Vulgate Cycle reworked Boron's original tale. Joseph of Arimathea was no longer the chief character in the Grail origin: Joseph's son, Josephus, took over his role of the Grail keeper.\nThe earliest versions of the grail romance, however, do not call the grail \"holy\" or mention anything about blood, Joseph or Glastonbury.\nIn 1191, monks at the abbey claimed to have found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere to the south of the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of contemporary historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.\nAn early Welsh poem links Arthur to the Tor in an account of a confrontation between Arthur and Melwas, who had kidnapped Queen Guinevere.\nJoseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On disembarking he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (also called Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.\nThe original Holy Thorn was a centre of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages but was chopped down during the English Civil War. A replacement thorn was planted in the 20th century on Wearyall hill (originally in 1951 to mark the Festival of Britain, but the thorn had to be replanted the following year as the first attempt did not take). The Wearyall Hill Holy Thorn was vandalised in 2010 and all its branches were chopped off. It initially showed signs of recovery but by 2014 appeared to be dead and was cut down by the landowner in 2019. A new sapling has been planted nearby. Many other examples of the thorn grow throughout Glastonbury including those in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey, St Johns Church and Chalice Well.\nToday, Glastonbury Abbey presents itself as \"traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian church in the world,\" which according to the legend was built at Joseph's behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years after the death of Jesus. The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, \"Jerusalem\".\nGlastonbury zodiac.\nIn 1934 artist Katherine Maltwood suggested a landscape zodiac, a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury. She held that the \"temple\" was created by Sumerians about 2700\u00a0BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983. These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the \"temple\" in any form, from conventional archaeologists. Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several ley lines.\nGovernance and public services.\nThe town council is made up of 16 members, and is based at Glastonbury Town Hall, Magdalene Street. The town hall was built in 1814 and has a two-storey late Georgian ashlar front. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nFor local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, Glastonbury comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Glastonbury Municipal Borough.\nThe town's retained fire station is operated by Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. Police and ambulance services are provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. There are two doctors' surgeries in Glastonbury, and a National Health Service community hospital operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust which opened in 2005.\nThere are 4 electoral wards within \"Glastonbury\" having in total the same population as is mentioned above.\nGlastonbury falls within the 2024-created Glastonbury and Somerton constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The Member of Parliament is Liberal Democrat, Sarah Dyke.\nGlastonbury is twinned with the Greek island of Patmos, and Lalibela, Ethiopia.\nGeography.\nThe walk up the Tor to the distinctive tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, above sea level, it is easy to appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by \"droves\", i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor. The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000\u00a0years, following the end of the last ice age.\nThe low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana. This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian name \"Fata Morgana\" is derived from the name of Morgan le Fay, who was alternatively known as Morgane, Morgain, Morgana and other variants. Morgan le Fay was described as a powerful sorceress and antagonist of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere in the Arthurian legend.\nGlastonbury is less than across the River Brue from the village of Street. At the time of King Arthur the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.\nUntil the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was prevented by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Some time between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. The project commenced in January 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat, ensuring that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change, while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape-scale conservation projects in the UK.\nThe Ham Wall National Nature Reserve, west of Glastonbury, is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. This new wetland habitat has been established from out peat diggings and now consists of areas of reedbed, wet scrub, open water and peripheral grassland and woodland. Bird species living on the site include the bearded tit and the Eurasian bittern.\nThe Whitelake River rises between two low limestone ridges to the north of Glastonbury, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River is on Worthy Farm, the site of the Glastonbury Festival, between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle.\nClimate.\nAlong with the rest of South West England, Glastonbury has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600\u00a0hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.\nEconomy.\nGlastonbury has for centuries been a centre for pilgrimage and spirituality of many kinds. The town supports a wide variety of alternative shops.\nThe outskirts of Glastonbury contain a large, light industrial, former sheepskin and slipper factory site, as well as a DIY store. The larger site was once owned by Morlands, and is slowly being redeveloped. The site of the old Morlands factory was scheduled for demolition and redevelopment into a new light industrial park, although there have been some protests that the buildings should be reused rather than being demolished. As part of the redevelopment of the site a project has been established by the Glastonbury Community Development Trust to provide support for local unemployed people applying for employment, starting in self-employment and accessing work-related training.\nLandmarks.\nAccording to the Glastonbury Conservation Area Appraisal of July 2010, there are approximately 170 listed buildings or structures in the town's designated conservation area, of which eight are listed grade I, six are listed grade II* and the remainder are listed grade II.\nThe Tribunal was a medieval merchant's house, used as the Abbey courthouse and, during the Monmouth Rebellion trials, by Judge Jeffreys. It now serves as a museum containing possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned. The museum is run by the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. The building also houses the tourist information centre.\nThe octagonal Market Cross was built in 1846 by Benjamin Ferrey.\nThe George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn was built in the late 15th century to accommodate visitors to Glastonbury Abbey, which is open to visitors. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The front of the 3-storey building is divided into 3 tiers of panels with traceried heads. Above the right of centre entrance are 3 carved panels with arms of the Abbey and Edward IV.\nThe Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey's home farm of approximately . Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn, which was built from local shelly limestone with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a scheduled monument.\nThe Chalice Well is a holy well at the foot of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron decoration made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of per day and has never failed, even during drought. Iron oxide deposits give the water a reddish hue, as dissolved ferrous oxide becomes oxygenated at the surface and is precipitated, providing chalybeate waters. As with the hot springs in nearby Bath, the water is believed to possess healing qualities. The well is about deep, with two underground chambers at its bottom. It is often portrayed as a symbol of the female aspect of deity, with the male symbolised by Glastonbury Tor (however, some consider Glastonbury Tor to be a 'hugh bounteous female figure'). As such, it is a popular destination for pilgrims in search of the divine feminine, including modern Pagans. The well is however popular with all faiths and in 2001 became a World Peace Garden.\nJust a short distance from the Chalice Well site, across a road known as Well House Lane, can be found the \"White Spring\", where a temple has been created in the 21st century. Whilst the waters of the Chalice Well are touched red with iron, the water of the latter is white with calcite. Some people consider the red water of Chalice Well to have male properties, whilst the white water of White Spring has female qualities. Both springs rise from caverns underneath the Tor and it is claimed that both have healing in their flow.\nThe building now used as the White Spring Temple was originally a Victorian-built well house, erected by the local water board in 1872. Around that time, an outbreak of cholera in the area caused great concern and the natural caves were dug out, and a stone collection chamber was constructed to ensure the flow of a quality water supply. Study of the flow of water into the collection chamber has shown that the builders also tapped into other springs, besides the White Spring and judging from the high iron content of one of these springs, it appears that a small offshoot of Chalice Well finds its way under Well House Lane to emerge beside the White Spring. However, after building the reservoir, the water board soon discovered that the high calciferous content of the water caused pipes to block and by the end of the 19th century water was piped into Glastonbury from out of town. After lying derelict for many years, the water board sold off the well house, which is now maintained by a group of volunteers as a \"water temple\". On the outside of the building is a tap where visitors and locals can collect the water of the White Spring.\nTransport.\nThe Glastonbury Canal, opened 1834, ran just over through two locks from Glastonbury to Highbridge where it entered the Bristol Channel, but it became uneconomic with the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.\nGlastonbury and Street railway station was the biggest station on the original Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services and one for the branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a signal box. The site is now a timber yard for a local company. Replica level crossing gates have been placed at the entrance.\nThe nearest railway station is at Castle Cary but there is no direct bus route linking it to Glastonbury. There are convenient bus connections between Glastonbury and the railway stations at Bristol Temple Meads (over an hour travelling time) and at Taunton. It is also served by Berrys Coaches daily 'Superfast' service to and from London.\nThe main road in the town is the A39 which passes through Glastonbury from Wells connecting the town with Street and the M5 motorway. The other roads around the town are small and run across the levels generally following the drainage ditches. Local bus services are provided by Buses of Somerset (part of First), First West of England, Frome Bus &amp; Libra Travel. The main routes are to Bristol via Wells, to Bridgwater, to Yeovil via Street and to Taunton. There is also a coach service to London Victoria provided by Berrys.\nLocal media.\nTelevision programmes and local news is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country from the Mendip TV transmitter.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 102.4 FM, Worthy FM on 87.7 FM which broadcast during The Glastonbury Festival and GWS Radio on 107.1 FM, a community radio station.\nThe town's local newspapers are the Mid Somerset Series, Western Daily Press, Somerset County Gazette and Somerset Live.\nEducation.\nThere are several infant and primary schools in Glastonbury and the surrounding villages. Secondary education is provided by St Dunstan's School. In 2017, the school had 327 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years. It is named after St. Dunstan, an abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, who went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury in 960 AD. The school was built in 1958 with major building work, at a cost of \u00a31.2\u00a0million, in 1998, adding the science block and the sports hall. It was designated as a specialist Arts College in 2004, and the \u00a3800,000 spent at this time paid for the Performing Arts studio and facilities to support students with special educational needs. Tor School is a pupil referral unit based on Beckery New Road, which caters for 14-16-year-old students who have been excluded from mainstream education, or who have been referred for medical reasons.\nStrode College in Street provides academic and vocational courses for those aged 16\u201318 and adult education. A tertiary institution and further education college, most of the courses it offers are A-levels or Business and Technology Education Councils (BTECs). The college also provides some university-level courses, and is part of The University of Plymouth Colleges network.\nReligious sites and faith groups.\nGlastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in pre-Christian times. The abbey was founded by Britons, and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron's version of the Holy Grail story and to Glastonbury's connection to King Arthur, which dates at least to the early 12th century. William of Malmesbury called this structure \"the oldest church in England,\" and thenceforth it was known simply as the Old Church, inasmuch as it had existed for many years prior to the 7th century as a Celtic religious centre. In his \"History of the English Church and People,\" written in the early eighth century, the Venerable Bede provides details regarding its construction to early missionaries. Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint Dunstan, the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.\nThe abbey had a violent end during the Dissolution and the buildings were progressively destroyed as their stones were removed for use in local building work. The remains of the Abbot's Kitchen (a grade I listed building.) and the Lady Chapel are particularly well-preserved set in of parkland. It is approached by the Abbey Gatehouse which was built in the mid-14th century and completely restored in 1810.\nThere is also a strong Irish connection to Glastonbury as it is said to be along a route of pilgrimage from Ireland to Rome. It is supposed that St. Patrick and St. Brigid both came to the area and both Saints are documented by William of Malmesbury as having done so. There are Chapels named after them too - St. Patrick's Chapel, Glastonbury is within the Abbey grounds and St. Brigid's Chapel is at Beckery (Little Ireland).\nThe Church of St Benedict was rebuilt by Abbot Richard Beere in about 1520. This is now an Anglican church and is linked with the parishes of St John's Church in Glastonbury and St Mary's &amp; All Saints Church in the village of Meare as a joint benefice.\nDescribed as \"one of the most ambitious parish churches in Somerset\", the current Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The church is laid out in a cruciform plan with an aisled nave and a clerestory of seven bays. The west tower has elaborate buttressing, panelling and battlements and at 134\u00bd feet (about 41 metres), is the second tallest parish church tower in Somerset. Recent excavations in the nave have revealed the foundations of a large central tower, possibly of Saxon origin, and a later Norman nave arcade on the same plan as the existing one. A central tower survived until the 15th century, but is believed to have collapsed, at which time the church was rebuilt. The interior of the church includes four 15th-century tomb-chests, some 15th-century stained glass in the chancel, medieval vestments, and a domestic cupboard of about 1500 which was once at Witham Charterhouse.\nIn the centuries that followed the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched by the fact that several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.\nThe United Reformed Church on the High Street was built in 1814 and altered in 1898. It stands on the site of the Ship Inn where meetings were held during the 18th century. It is Grade II listed.\nGlastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street was built in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. Close by the front of the church is an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir. This is mentioned in property deeds of 1821, and is still accessible, containing approximately 31,500 gallons of water.\nThe Methodist Church on Lambrook street was originally the Glastonbury Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built on Northload Street in 1844, with an adjoining house added for a minister in 1869. This chapel was closed in 1968, since which time it has had a number of different uses, being described in 2007 as the Maitreya Monastery, prior to which it had been the Archangel Michael Soul Therapy Centre.\nThe Bove Town Gospel Hall has been a place of worship in the town since at least 1889, when it was listed as a mission of the Plymouth Brethren. Jehovah's Witnesses originally occupied a Kingdom Hall on Archer's Way from 1942. This transferred to Church Lane in 1964, and subsequently to its present site on Old Wells Road. The Gospel Hall was registered for the solemnizing of marriages in 1964\nThe Catholic Church of Our Lady St Mary of Glastonbury was built, on land near to the Abbey, in 1939. A statue based on a 14th-century metal seal was blessed in 1955 and crowned in 1965 restoring the Marian shrine that had been in the Abbey prior to the reformation. The Shrine is now the home of the https://, a Catholic Benedictine Monastery founded in August 2019.\nThe Glastonbury Order of Druids was formed on Mayday 1988.\nSufism has been long established in Glastonbury. Zikrs are held weekly in private homes, and on the first Sunday of every month a zikr is held at St Margaret's Chapel in Magdalene Street. A Sufi charity shop was established in Glastonbury in 1999, and supports missionary work in Africa. This shop was opened after Sheikh Nazim came to Glastonbury to visit the Abbey. Here he declared, \"This is the spiritual heart of England ... It is from here that the spiritual new age will begin and to here that Jesus will return\".\nThe pagan Glastonbury Goddess Temple was founded in 2002 and registered as a place of worship the following year. It is self-described as the first temple of its kind to exist in Europe in over a thousand years.\nIn April 2012, it was reported by \"The Guardian\" newspaper that, according to the Pilgrim Reception Centre in the town, Glastonbury had around seventy different faith groups. Some of these groups attended a special ceremony to celebrate this diversity, held in the Chalice Well Gardens on 21 April of that year.\nThe 22nd Jagannatha Ratha-yatra Krishna Festival took place in Glastonbury on Sunday 4 October 2015. Devotees of the Krishna Consciousness movement travelled to the town from London, Bath, Bristol and elsewhere to join with locals in a procession and Kirtan.\nGlastonbury also headquarters the British Orthodox Church which is independent Oriental Orthodox denomination since 2015\nGlastonbury has a particular significance for members of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in that Wellesley Tudor Pole, founder of the Chalice Well Trust, was one of the earliest and most prominent adherents of this faith in the United Kingdom.\nSports.\nThe local football team is Glastonbury F.C. They joined the Western Football League in 1919 and have won the Western Football League title three times in their history. The club are now playing in the Somerset County Football League.\nGlastonbury Cricket Club previously competed in the West of England Premier League, one of the ECB Premier Leagues, the highest level of recreational cricket in England and Wales. The club plays at the Tor Leisure Ground, which used to stage Somerset County Cricket Club first-class fixtures.\nThe town is on the route of the Samaritans Way South West.\nCulture.\nIn a 1904 novel by Charles Whistler entitled \"A Prince of Cornwall\" Glastonbury in the days of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel \"A Glastonbury Romance\" is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail. The historical mystery novel \"Grave Goods\" by Diana Norman (writing under the pen name Ariana Frankin) is set in Glastonbury just after the abbey fire and concerns the supposed graves of Arthur and Guinevere, as well as featuring other landmarks such as the Tor.\nThe Children's World charity grew out of the festival and is based in the town. It is known internationally (as \"Children's World International\"). It was set up by Arabella Churchill in 1981 to provide drama participation and creative play and to work creatively in educational settings, providing social and emotional benefits for all children, particularly those with special needs. Children's World International is the sister charity of Children's World and was started in 1999 to work with children in the Balkans, in conjunction with Balkan Sunflowers and Save the Children. They also run the Glastonbury Children's Festival each August.\nGlastonbury Assembly Rooms is a small venue for music and the arts, which was built in 1864\u00a0near the Glastonbury Abbey Wall. The Assembly Rooms was the centre of the original Glastonbury Musical Festival which ran from 1914 to 1925 and was a forerunner of the present day Glastonbury Festival. For years, the building continued to be a centre of local culture but fell into disuse after World War Two and would almost have been demolished. However, thanks to renewed public interest in the 1970s the Assembly Rooms became again a centre of the arts.\nThe local Brass Band is Glastonbury Brass. The band was founded in 2017 when the old Yeovil Town Band relocated after running into financial difficulty following a \"notice to quit\" on its rehearsal facility in September 2016. The band is featured twice on the Haiku Salut album \"There Is No Elsewhere\" (2018) and can be heard on the tracks \"Cold To Crack The Stones\" and \"The More And Moreness.\" In February 2020, the band was involved in the launch of Johnny Mars's \"Dare to Dream\" project aimed at raising awareness of the effects mankind is having on the world.\nGlastonbury is the final venue for the annual November West Country Carnival.\nHippie culture.\nGlastonbury has been described as a New Age community where communities have grown up to include people with New Age beliefs.\nGlastonbury Festival.\nThe first Glastonbury Festivals were a series of cultural events held in summer, from 1914 to 1926. The festivals were founded by English socialist composer Rutland Boughton and his librettist Lawrence Buckley. Apart from the founding of a national theatre, they envisaged a summer school and music festival based on utopian principles. With strong Arthurian connections and historic and prehistoric associations, Glastonbury was chosen to host the festivals.\nThe more recent Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, founded in 1970, is now the largest open-air music and performing arts festival in the world. Although it is named after Glastonbury, it is actually held at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle, east of the town of Glastonbury. The festival is best known for its contemporary music, but also features dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and many other arts. For 2005, the enclosed area of the festival was over , had over 385 live performances and was attended by around 150,000 people. In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the capacity expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. The festival has spawned a range of other work including the 1972 film \"Glastonbury Fayre\" and album, 1996 film \"Glastonbury the Movie\" and the 2005 DVD \"Glastonbury Anthems\".\nGlastonbury Extravaganza.\nThis is an annual music event that has been held in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey since 1996. The event is held as a thank you to local people from Glastonbury Festival organiser Michael Eavis.\nNotable people.\nGlastonbury has been the birthplace or home to many notable people. Peter King, 1st Baron King was the recorder of Glastonbury in 1705. Thomas Bramwell Welch the discoverer of the pasteurisation process to prevent the fermentation of grape juice was born in Glastonbury in 1825. The judge John Creighton represented Lunenburg County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1770 to 1775. The fossil collector Thomas Hawkins lived in the town during the 19th century.\nThe religious connections and mythology of the town have also attracted notable authors. The occultist and writer Dion Fortune (Violet Mary Firth) lived and is buried in Glastonbury. Her old house was home to the writer and historian Geoffrey Ashe, who was known for his works on local legends. Frederick Bligh Bond, archaeologist and writer. Eckhart Tolle, a German-born writer, public speaker, and spiritual teacher lived in Glastonbury during the 1980s. Eileen Caddy was at a sanctuary in Glastonbury when she first claimed to have heard the \"voice of God\" while meditating. Her subsequent instructions from the \"voice\" directed her to take on Sheena Govan as her spiritual teacher, and became a spiritual teacher and new age author, best known as one of the founders of the Findhorn Foundation community.\nPopular entertainment and literature is also represented amongst the population. English composer Rutland Boughton moved from Birmingham to Glastonbury in 1911 and established the country's first national annual summer school of music. Gary Stringer, lead singer of rock band Reef, was a local along with other members of the band. The juggler Haggis McLeod and his late wife, Arabella Churchill, one of the founders of the Glastonbury Festival, lived in the town. The conductor Charles Hazlewood lives locally and hosts the \"Play the Field\" music festival on his farm nearby. Bill Bunbury moved on from Glastonbury to become a writer, radio broadcaster, and producer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nAthletes and sports players from Glastonbury include cricketers Cyril Baily in 1880, George Burrough in 1907, and Eustace Bisgood in 1878. The footballer Peter Spiring was born in Glastonbury in 1950. Formula 1 driver Lando Norris grew up in Glastonbury.\nTwin towns.\nGlastonbury is twinned with:\nFreedom of the Town.\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Town of Glastonbury.\nThe Key of Avalon.\nThis award was created in 2022 by the Glastonbury Town Council. The first recipient was Prem Rawat, international peace advocate and author, who spoke at the Glastonbury Festival in 1971.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59618", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59618", "title": "Bagworm moth", "text": "Family of moths known as Psychidae\nThe Psychidae (bagworm moths, also simply bagworms or bagmoths) are a family of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). The bagworm family is fairly small, with about 1,350 species described. Bagworm species are found globally, with some, such as the snailcase bagworm (\"Apterona helicoidella\"), in modern times settling continents where they are not native.\nAnother common name for the Psychidae is \"case moths\", but this is just as well used for the case-bearers (Coleophoridae). The names refer to the habits of caterpillars of these two families, which build small protective cases in which they can hide. The bagworms belong to the superfamily Tineoidea, which is a basal lineage of the Ditrysia (as is Gelechioidea, which includes case-bearers). This means that the bagworms and case-bearers are only as closely related to each other as either is to butterflies (Rhopalocera).\nMost bagworms are inoffensive to humans and inconspicuous; some are occasional nuisance pests. However, a few species can become more serious pests, and have caused significant damage e.g. to wattle (\"Acacia mearnsii\") in South Africa and orange (\"Citrus \u00d7 sinensis\") in Florida. If detected early, picking the cases from the trees while in their pupa stage is an effective way to check an infestation; otherwise, insecticides are used. One bagworm species, the fangalabola (\"Deborrea malgassa\") of Madagascar, is in some places encouraged to breed on wattle trees, because its pupae are collected as a protein-rich food.\nDescription.\nThe caterpillar larvae of Psychidae construct cases out of silk and environmental materials such as sand, soil, lichen, or plant materials. These cases are attached to rocks, trees or fences while resting or during their pupa stage, but are otherwise mobile. The larvae of some species eat lichen, while others prefer green leaves. In many species, the adult females lack wings and are therefore difficult to identify accurately. Case-bearer cases are usually much smaller, flimsier, and consist mainly of silk, while bagworm \"bags\" resemble caddisfly cases in their outward appearance \u2013 a mass of (mainly) plant detritus spun together with silk on the inside.\nBagworm cases range in size from less than 1\u00a0cm to 15\u00a0cm among some tropical species. Each species makes a case particular to its species, making the case more useful to identify the species than the creature itself. Cases among the more primitive species are flat. More specialized species exhibit a greater variety of case size, shape, and composition, usually narrowing on both ends. The attachment substance used to affix the bag to a host plant or structure has a higher tensile strength than that of other moth species, requiring greater force to initiate breakage. Body markings are rare. Adult females of many bagworm species are larviform, with only vestigial wings, legs, and mouthparts. In some species, parthenogenesis is known. The adult males of most species are strong fliers with well-developed wings and feathery antennae but survive only long enough to reproduce due to underdeveloped mouthparts that prevent them from feeding. Most male bagworm wings have few of the scales characteristic of most moths, instead having a thin covering of hairs.\nEcology.\nIn the larval stage, bagworms extend their head and thorax from their mobile case to devour the leaves of host plants, often leading to the death of their hosts. Trees infested with bagworms exhibit increasingly damaged foliage as the infestation increases until the leaves are stripped bare. Some bagworms are specialized in their host plants (monophagous), while others can feed on a variety of plant species (polyphagous). A few species also consume small arthropods (such as the camphor scale \"Pseudaonidia duplex\", a scale insect). One bagworm species was found to eat an orb-web of \"Plebs sachalinensis\" (Araneae, Araneidae) entirely.\nSince bagworm cases are composed of silk and the materials from their habitat, they are naturally camouflaged from predators. Predators include birds and other insects. Birds often eat the egg-laden bodies of female bagworms after they have died. Since the eggs are very hard-shelled, they can pass through the bird's digestive system unharmed, promoting the spread of the species over wide areas.\nA bagworm begins to build its case as soon as it hatches. Once the case is built, only adult males ever leave the case, never to return, when they take flight to find a mate. Bagworms add material to the front of the case as they grow, excreting waste materials through the opening in the back of the case. When satiated with leaves, a bagworm caterpillar secures its case and pupates. The adult female, which is wingless, either emerges from the case long enough for breeding or remains in the case while the male extends his abdomen into the female's case to breed. Females lay their eggs in their case and die. The female evergreen bagworm (\"Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis\") dies without laying eggs, and the larval bagworm offspring emerge from the parent's body. Some bagworm species are parthenogenetic, meaning their eggs develop without male fertilization. Each bagworm generation lives just long enough as adults to mate and reproduce in their annual cycle.\nSystematics.\nTen subfamilies and about 240 genera are recognized among the bagworms.\nThe subfamilies of Psychidae, with some notable genera and species also listed, are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nApplications.\nThe silk of bagworm moth larvae is reportedly \"more durable than spider silk\". Japanese pharmaceutical company Kowa and the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization announced a new textile, Minolon, in 2024, that combined carbon fibers with sheets of bagworm silk. The resulting material was claimed to be environmentally friendly, with Kowa planning to sell it to aircraft, automobile, and sporting good manufacturers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This ring is called the endomorphism ring of \"X\", denoted by End(\"X\"); the set of all homomorphisms of \"X\" into itself. Addition of endomorphisms arises naturally in a pointwise manner and multiplication via endomorphism composition. Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map formula_1 as additive identity and the identity map formula_2 as multiplicative identity.\nThe functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the category of the object under consideration. The endomorphism ring consequently encodes several internal properties of the object. As the endomorphism ring is often an algebra over some ring \"R,\" this may also be called the endomorphism algebra.\nAn abelian group is the same thing as a module over the ring of integers, which is the initial object in the category of rings. In a similar fashion, if \"R\" is any commutative ring, the endomorphisms of an \"R\"-module form an algebra over \"R\" by the same axioms and derivation. In particular, if \"R\" is a field, its modules \"M\" are vector spaces and the endomorphism ring of each is an algebra over the field \"R\".\nDescription.\nLet (\"A\", +) be an abelian group and we consider the group homomorphisms from \"A\" into \"A\". Then addition of two such homomorphisms may be defined pointwise to produce another group homomorphism. Explicitly, given two such homomorphisms \"f\" and \"g\", the sum of \"f\" and \"g\" is the homomorphism \"f\" + \"g\" : \"x\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"x\") + \"g\"(\"x\"). Under this operation End(\"A\") is an abelian group. With the additional operation of composition of homomorphisms, End(\"A\") is a ring with multiplicative identity. This composition is explicitly \"fg\" : \"x\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")). The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism on \"A\". The additive inverses are the pointwise inverses. \nIf the set \"A\" does not form an \"abelian\" group, then the above construction is not necessarily well-defined, as then the sum of two homomorphisms need not be a homomorphism. However, the closure of the set of endomorphisms under the above operations is a canonical example of a near-ring that is not a ring.\n One can use this isomorphism to construct many non-commutative endomorphism rings. For example: formula_8, since formula_9. \n Also, when formula_10 is a field, there is a canonical isomorphism formula_11, so formula_12, that is, the endomorphism ring of a formula_13-vector space is identified with the ring of \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrices with entries in formula_13. More generally, the endomorphism algebra of the free module formula_15 is naturally formula_16-by-formula_16 matrices with entries in the ring formula_18.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The perpetrators, twelfth-grade students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 13 students and one teacher; ten were killed in the school library, where Harris and Klebold subsequently died by suicide. Twenty additional people were injured by gunshots, and gunfire was exchanged several times with law enforcement with neither side being struck. Another three people were injured trying to escape. The Columbine massacre was the deadliest mass shooting at a K\u201312 school in U.S. history until December 2012. It is still considered one of the most infamous massacres in the United States, and it is known for inspiring many other school shootings and bombings; the word \"Columbine\" has since become a byword for modern school shootings. As of 2025[ [update]], Columbine remains the deadliest mass shooting and school shooting in Colorado, the deadliest high school shooting to happen west of the Mississippi River, and one of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States.\nHarris and Klebold, who planned for roughly a year, intended the attack to be primarily a bombing and only secondarily a shooting. The pair launched a shooting attack after the homemade bombs they planted in the school failed to detonate. Their motive remains uncertain. The police were slow to enter the school and were heavily criticized for not intervening during the shooting. The incident resulted in the introduction of the immediate action rapid deployment (IARD) tactic, which is used in active-shooter situations, and an increased emphasis on school security with zero-tolerance policies. The violence sparked debates over American gun culture and gun control laws, high school cliques, subcultures (e.g. goths), outcasts, and school bullying, as well as teenage use of pharmaceutical antidepressants, the Internet, and violence in video games and film.\nMany makeshift memorials were created after the massacre, including ones using victim Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck. Fifteen crosses for the victims and the shooters were erected on top of a hill in Clement Park. The crosses for Harris and Klebold were later removed after controversy. The planning for a permanent memorial began in June 1999, and the resulting Columbine Memorial opened to the public in September 2007.\nAs of June 2025, the shooting has inspired more than 70 copycat attacks, and its impact has been dubbed the Columbine effect.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPerpetrators.\nEric Harris.\nEric David Harris (April 9, 1981\u2013 April 20, 1999) was born in Wichita, Kansas. The Harris family relocated often, as Harris's father was a US Air Force transport pilot. The family moved from Plattsburgh, New York, to Littleton, Colorado, in July 1993, when his father retired from military service.\nHarris attended Ken Caryl Middle School, where he met Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased a house south of Columbine High School (CHS). Harris's older brother attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nDylan Klebold.\nDylan Bennet Klebold ( ; September 11, 1981\u2013 April 20, 1999) was born in Lakewood, Colorado. His parents were pacifists and attended a Lutheran church with their children. Both Dylan and his older brother attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition. Klebold was named after poet Dylan Thomas.\nKlebold attended Normandy Elementary for first and second grade before transferring to Governor's Ranch Elementary, and became part of the CHIPS (\"Challenging High Intellectual Potential Students\") program.\nBackground.\nCriminal history.\nIn 1996, 15-year-old Harris created a private website on America Online (AOL), initially to host video game levels (known as WADs) that he created for the first-person shooter games \"Doom\", \"Doom II\", and \"Quake\". On the site, Harris began a blog, which included details of mischief and vandalism, such as lighting fireworks with Klebold and others. Harris referred to these acts as \"rebel missions\" and the blog posts as \"mission logs\". In early 1997, the blog posts showed signs of Harris's anger against society. By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to make explosives. In August 1997, Harris wrote on the blog \"All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you as I can, especially a few people. Like Brooks Brown.\" Brown was a friend and classmate of his. After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on August 7, 1997. An investigator drafted affidavit requesting a search warrant for the Harris household, but it was never submitted to a judge.\nOn January 30, 1998, Harris and Klebold were arrested for breaking into a white van parked near Littleton and stealing tools and computer equipment. In a joint court hearing they pled guilty to felony theft. The judge sentenced them to a 12-month juvenile diversion program. As a result, they both attended mandatory classes such as anger management and met with diversion officers. They were both released from the program a month early.\nWritings.\nShortly after the court hearing for the van break-in, Harris reverted his website back to just hosting user-created levels of \"Doom\" and began keeping a journal. Klebold had already been keeping a personal journal since March 1997. In both their journals, Harris and Klebold later plotted the attack. Harris's plan for an attack included possibly escaping to a foreign country or hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into a building in New York City.\nKlebold and Harris both made entries in their journals on topics related to sexuality. Klebold expressed shame for his sexual interests, which included bondage and foot fetishism, stating that, \"My humanity has a foot fetish, &amp; bondage exteme [\"sic\"] liking. I try to thwart it...\" Harris described his desire for raping and torturing women in his bedroom. Harris also expressed interest in cannibalism, stating that he would like to dismember a woman with whom he could have \"animalistic sex\" and eat her flesh.\nHarris and Klebold's schoolwork displayed themes of violence. In December 1997, Harris wrote a paper on school shootings titled \"Guns in School\", and a poem from the perspective of a bullet. Klebold wrote a short story about a man killing students which worried his teacher so much that she alerted his parents, when Klebold was confronted about it, he said it was \"just a story\". For one project, Harris wrote a paper on Nazi Germany and Klebold wrote a paper on Charles Manson. In a psychology class, Harris wrote that he dreamed of going on a shooting spree with Klebold. Harris's journals described several experimental bomb detonations.\nNearly a year before the massacre, Klebold wrote a message in Harris's 1998 yearbook: \"killing enemies, blowing up stuff, killing cops!! My wrath for January's incident will be godlike. Not to mention our revenge in the commons\"; \"the commons\" was slang for the school cafeteria.\nTapes.\nBasement tapes.\nHarris and Klebold were both enrolled in video-production classes and kept five video tapes that were recorded with school video equipment. Only two of these, \"Hitmen for Hire\" and \"Rampart Range\", and part of a third known as \"Radioactive Clothing\", have been released. The remaining three tapes detailed their plans and reasons for the massacre, including the ways they hid their weapons and deceived their parents. Most were shot in the Harris family basement, and are thus known as the basement tapes. Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families.\nIn December 1999, before anyone besides investigators had seen them, \"Time\" magazine published an article on these tapes. The victims' family members threatened to sue Jefferson County. As a result, select victim families and journalists were allowed to view them, though the tapes were then withheld from the public and, in 2011, destroyed for fear of inspiring future massacres. Transcripts of some of the dialogue and a short clip recorded surreptitiously by a victim's father still exist, with the transcripts being online via various resources. The pair claimed they were going to make copies of the tapes to send to news stations but never did so.\nWhen an economics class had Harris make an ad for a business, he and Klebold made a video called \"Hitmen for Hire\" on December 8, 1998, which was released in February 2004. It depicts them as part of the Trench Coat Mafia, a clique in the school who wore black trench coats and opposed jocks, extorting money for protecting preps from bullies. Klebold and Harris themselves were apparently not a part of the Trench Coat Mafia but were friends with some of its members. They wore black trench coats on the day of the massacre, and the \"Hitmen for Hire\" video seemed a kind of dress rehearsal, showing them walking the halls of the school, and shooting bullies outside with fake guns.\nOn October 21, 2003, a video was released showing the pair doing target practice on March 6, 1999, in nearby foothills known as Rampart Range, with the weapons they would use in the massacre.\nNixon tape.\nBefore the massacre, Harris left a micro cassette labeled \"Nixon\" on the kitchen table. On it, Harris said \"It is less than nine hours now,\" placing the recording at some time around 2:30\u00a0a.m. He went on to say \"People will die because of me,\" and \"It will be a day that will be remembered forever.\"\nWeaponry.\nGuns.\nIn the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns. Harris had a Hi-Point 995 carbine with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H pump shotgun. Klebold used a 9mm Intratec TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a Stevens 311D double-barreled shotgun. Harris' shotgun was sawed-off to around and Klebold shortened his shotgun's length to , a felony under the National Firearms Act.\nOn November 22, 1998, their friend Robyn Anderson purchased a carbine rifle and the two shotguns for the pair at the Tanner Gun Show, as they were too young to legally purchase the guns themselves. After the attack, she told investigators that she had believed the pair wanted the weapons for target shooting and denied that she had prior knowledge of their plans. Anderson was not charged.\nHarris and Klebold both held part-time jobs at a local Blackjack Pizza. Through Philip Duran, one of their coworkers, Klebold bought a TEC-9 handgun from Mark Manes for $500 at another gun show on January 23. Manes, Manes' girlfriend, and Duran are all in the Rampart Range video. After the massacre, Manes and Duran were both prosecuted. Each was charged with supplying a handgun to a minor and possession of a sawed-off shotgun. After both pled guilty, Manes and Duran were sentenced to a total of six years and four-and-a-half years, respectively, in prison.\nExplosives.\nIn addition to the firearms, the complex and highly planned attack involved several improvised explosive devices. Harris and Klebold constructed a total of 99 bombs. These included 27 pipe bombs, 48 carbon-dioxide cartridges filled with gunpowder (called \"crickets\"), 7 Molotov cocktails, and 15 propane tanks converted to bombs (five of which were 20-pounds or more). Two propane bombs were used in the cafeteria, two in the shooters' cars, and in another location intended as a diversion. For ignition, they used storm matches, cannon fuses, and model rocket igniters as well as timing devices built from mechanical alarm clocks for the propane bombs. During the massacre, they carried match strikers taped to their forearms for easy ignition of the pipe bombs and CO2 bombs.\nHarris also experimented with napalm, and envisioned a kind of backpack and flamethrower. They both attempted to get another friend and coworker, Chris Morris, who was a part of the Trench Coat Mafia, to keep the napalm at his house, but he refused. Harris also tried to recruit him to be a third shooter but played it off as a joke when rebuked.\nPipe bombs.\nHarris's website contained instructions on making pipe bombs and Molotovs, and the extensive use of shrapnel. Harris's father once discovered one of his pipe bombs. Harris's journal logged the creation of 25 pipe bombs.\nKlebold scared his coworkers by once bringing a pipe bomb into work. They would give various nicknames to their pipe bombs. After the massacre, two pipe bombs had been left in Klebold's bedroom, one named \"Vengeance\" and another \"Atlanta\", presumably after the Olympic Park bombing.\nCafeteria bombs.\nThey had in their possession eight propane tanks all converted into bombs. The weekend before the shooting, Harris and Klebold bought two propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store. They bought six propane tanks on the morning of the attack. Harris was caught on a Texaco gas station security camera at 9:12\u00a0a.m. buying a Blue Rhino propane tank. Both cafeteria bombs included a single 20-pound tank, attached pipe bombs, and supporting gasoline canisters alongside.\nCar bombs.\nBoth car bombs were made from two 20-pound propane tanks, pipe bombs, and various containers filled with gasoline were spread throughout the vehicles. Eight pipe bombs were placed in Klebold's car, and one in Harris'.\nKnives.\nHarris and Klebold were both equipped with two knives each, but investigators have concluded that they were not used during the massacre. Harris had a boot knife on his belt and a \"Khyber-pass\" machete bowie knife taped to the back of his ankle. Both had an \"R\", referencing Harris's alias \"REB\", etched into the handle, and the machete had a swastika on the sheath. Klebold had a \"Cobra\" knife mounted to his belt on the left side as well as a switchblade in his right pocket.\nThe massacre.\nAccording to the shooters' respective journals and video tapes, it is believed by investigators that the pair intended to detonate their propane bombs in the cafeteria at the busiest lunch hour, killing hundreds of students. After this, they would shoot and stab survivors, as well as lob bombs. Bombs set in their cars in the parking lot would also eventually detonate, killing more students as well as any police officers, paramedics, firemen or reporters who had arrived at the school. However, the bombs in the cafeteria and cars failed to detonate.\nSeveral official sources claim they planned to shoot the fleeing survivors from the parking lot, but when the bombs failed, they moved to the staircase on the hill at the west side. Other sources claim the top of the staircase where the massacre began was their preferred spot to wait for the bombs to go off all along.\nA total of 188 rounds of ammunition were fired by the perpetrators during the massacre. Firing nearly twice as much as Klebold, Harris fired his carbine rifle a total of 96 times: 47 shots outside, 36 shots inside, and 13 shots in the library. Harris also discharged his shotgun 25 times: 21 times in the library and four times inside. He did not fire his shotgun outside the school. Klebold fired the TEC-9 handgun 55 times: three shots outside, 31 shots inside, and 21 shots in the library. Klebold also fired 12 rounds from his double-barreled shotgun: twice outside, four times inside, and six times in the library. Law enforcement officers fired 141 rounds during exchanges of gunfire with the shooters.\nPlanting the bombs.\nOn Tuesday morning, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags in the cafeteria. Each bag contained propane bombs, set to detonate during the \"A\" lunch shift, which began at 11:15\u00a0a.m.\nNo witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks that were already in the cafeteria. The security staff at CHS did not observe the bags being placed in the cafeteria; a custodian was replacing the school security videotape at around 11:14\u00a0a.m. Shortly after the massacre, police speculated the bombs were placed during this \"tape change\". They also investigated whether the bombs were placed during the \"after-prom\" party held the prior weekend. Some Internet sleuths claim the bomb placement can be seen on the surveillance video at around 10:58\u00a0a.m.\nJefferson County Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner was assigned to the high school as a full-time school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 he was eating lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park, a meadow adjacent to the school.\nTwo backpacks filled with pipe bombs, aerosol canisters, and small propane bombs were also placed in a field about south of CHS, and south of the fire station. The bombs were intended as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school. Only the pipe bombs and one of the aerosol canisters detonated, causing a small fire, which was quickly extinguished by the fire department. It went off after first having been moved. Bomb technicians immediately examined the bombs and relayed to police at the school the possibility of devices with motion activators.\nHarris and Klebold changed clothes and returned separately to CHS. Harris parked his vehicle in the junior student parking lot, and Klebold parked in the adjoining senior student parking lot. The school cafeteria was their primary bomb target; the cafeteria had a long outside window-wall, ground-level doors, and was just north of the senior parking lot. The library was located above the cafeteria in the second-story of the window-wall. Each car contained bombs.\nAs Harris pulled into the parking lot, he encountered classmate Brooks Brown, with whom he had recently patched up a longstanding series of disputes. According to Brown, who was smoking a cigarette, he was surprised to see Harris, whom he earlier noted had been absent from a class test. Harris, a good student, was unlikely to miss school days with important academic obligation. Brown berated Harris for missing the test. Harris, acting unconcerned, replied \"It doesn't matter anymore.\" Harris went on: \"Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home.\" Brown, feeling uneasy and already prepared to skip his next class, walked away down South Pierce Street.\nMeanwhile, Harris and Klebold armed themselves, using straps and webbing to conceal weapons beneath their trench coats. They lugged bags containing bombs and ammunition. Harris had concealed his shotgun in one of the bags. Beneath the trench coats, Harris wore a military bandolier and a white T-shirt with the inscription \"Natural Selection\" in black letters, a mantra he had adopted; Klebold wore a black T-shirt with \"Wrath\" in red letters.\nThe cafeteria bombs failed to detonate. Had these explosives detonated as intended, they would have killed or severely wounded the 488 students in the cafeteria and damaged the school's structure, collapsing the library into the cafeteria and possibly killing more students and staff.\n11:19\u00a0a.m.: Shooting begins.\nAt 11:19\u00a0a.m., 17-year-old Rachel Scott and her friend Richard Castaldo were having lunch and sitting on the grass next to the west entrance of the school. Klebold threw a pipe bomb towards the parking lot; the bomb only partially detonated, causing it to give off smoke. Castaldo thought it was no more than a crude senior prank. Likewise, several students during the incident first thought that they were watching a prank.\nThe two allegedly returned to where Rachel Scott and Richard Castaldo lay on the ground injured. Scott was killed instantly when she was hit four times with rounds fired from Harris's carbine; one shot was to the left temple. Castaldo was shot eight times in the chest, arm, and abdomen by both Harris and Klebold; he fell unconscious to the ground and was left paralyzed below the chest.\nAfter firing twice, Klebold's TEC-9 jammed, and he was forced to temporarily cease shooting to fix it, which he did by reloading a new magazine into his pistol. Meanwhile, Harris took off his trenchcoat and aimed his carbine down the west staircase in the direction of three students: Daniel Rohrbough, Sean Graves, and Lance Kirklin. The students presumed they were paintball guns, and were about to walk up the staircase directly below the shooters. Harris fired ten times, killing Rohrbough and injuring Graves and Kirklin. William David Sanders, a teacher and coach at the school, was in the cafeteria when he heard the gunfire and began warning students.\nHarris turned west and fired seven shots in the direction of five students sitting on the grassy hillside adjacent to the steps and opposite the west entrance of the school: Michael Johnson was hit in the face, leg, and arm but ran and escaped; Mark Taylor was shot in the chest, arms, and leg and fell to the ground, where he faked death; the other three escaped uninjured.\nKlebold fired down the stairs with his shotgun, injuring Nicholas \"Nick\" Foss with a graze wound, then walked down the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Lance Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, \"Sure. I'll help you,\" then shot Kirklin in the jaw with his shotgun. Although near-fatally injured, Kirklin would survive. Graves\u2014paralyzed beneath the waist\u2014had crawled into the doorway of the cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. He rubbed his blood on his face and played dead. After shooting Kirklin, Klebold walked towards the cafeteria door. He then stepped over the injured Graves to enter the cafeteria. Graves remembers Klebold saying, \"Sorry, dude.\"\nKlebold then only briefly entered the cafeteria and did not shoot at the several people still inside. Officials speculated that Klebold went to check on the propane bombs. Harris was still on top of the stairs shooting, and severely wounded and partially paralyzed 17-year-old Anne Marie Hochhalter as she attempted to flee.\nKlebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris. They each shot at students standing close to a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs in several directions, including onto the roof; only a few of these pipe bombs detonated. Witnesses heard one of them say, \"This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome!\"\nMeanwhile, art teacher Patti Nielson was inside the school; she had noticed the commotion and walked toward the west entrance with student Brian Anderson. Nielson had intended to walk outside to tell the two students, \"Knock it off\", thinking they were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened the first set of double doors, the gunmen shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass; Nielson was hit in the shoulder with shrapnel. Anderson and Nielson ran back down the hall into the library, and Nielson alerted the students inside to the danger, telling them to get under desks and keep silent. She dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson fell to the floor, bleeding from his injuries, then hid inside the magazine room adjacent to the library.\n11:22\u00a0a.m.: Police response and West Entrance shootouts.\nAt 11:22\u00a0a.m., a custodian called Deputy Neil Gardner, the assigned resource officer to Columbine, requested assistance in the senior parking lot on the school radio. The only paved route took him around the school to the east and south on Pierce Street, where at 11:23\u00a0a.m., he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car. While exiting his patrol car in the senior lot at 11:24, he heard another call on the school radio, \"Neil, there's a shooter in the school.\"\nHarris, at the west entrance, immediately turned and fired ten shots from his carbine at Gardner, who was away. As Harris reloaded his carbine, Gardner leaned over the top of his car and fired four rounds at Harris from his service pistol. Harris ducked back behind the building, and Gardner momentarily believed that he had hit him. Harris then reemerged and fired at least four more rounds at Gardner (which missed and struck two parked cars), before retreating into the building. No one was hit during the exchange of gunfire. Gardner reported on his police radio, \"Shots in the building. I need someone in the south lot with me.\" By this point, Harris had shot 47 times, and Klebold 5. The shooters then entered the school through the west entrance, moving along the main north hallway, throwing pipe bombs and shooting at anyone they encountered. Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle, but she was able to walk out of the school. The pair then shot out the windows to the east entrance of the school. After proceeding through the hall several times and shooting toward\u2014and missing\u2014any students they saw, they went toward the west entrance and turned into the library hallway.\nDeputies Paul Smoker and Paul Magor, motorcycle patrolmen for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, were writing a traffic ticket north of the school when the \"female down\" call came in at 11:23\u00a0a.m. Taking the shortest route, they drove their motorcycles over grass between the athletic fields and headed toward the west entrance. When they saw Deputies Scott Taborsky, Rick Searle, and Kevin Walker following them in their patrol car, they abandoned their motorcycles for the safety of the car. The six deputies had begun to rescue two wounded students near the ball fields when another gunfight broke out at 11:26, as Harris returned to the double doors and again began shooting at Deputy Gardner, who returned fire. From the hilltop, Deputy Smoker fired three rounds from his pistol at Harris, who again retreated into the building. As before, no one was hit.\nInside the school cafeteria, Dave Sanders and two custodians, Jon Curtis and Jay Gallatine, initially told students to get under the tables, then evacuated students up the staircase leading to the second floor of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the library hallway in the main south hallway. Sanders then tried to secure as much of the school as he could. Sanders and another student were at the end of the hallway, where he gestured for students in the library to stay, before encountering Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the north hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the back and neck, hitting his teeth on exit, but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, and tossed a pipe bomb, then returned to Harris up the library hallway.\nSanders struggled toward the science area, and teacher Rich Long took him into a classroom where 30 students were located. Due to his knowledge of first aid, student Aaron Hancey was brought to the classroom from another by teacher Kent Friesen despite the unfolding commotion. With the assistance of fellow student Kevin Starkey and teacher Theresa Miller, Hancey administered first aid to Sanders for three hours, attempting to stem the blood loss using shirts from students in the room, and showing him pictures from his wallet to keep him talking. Using a phone in the room, Miller and several students maintained contact with police outside the school.\nAs the shooting unfolded, pipe bombs were tossed in the hallways and down into the cafeteria. Patti Nielson in the library called 9-1-1, telling her story and urging students in the library to take cover beneath desks. According to transcripts, her call was received by a 9\u20131\u20131 operator at 11:25:18\u00a0a.m.\n11:29\u201311:36\u00a0a.m.: Library massacre.\nAt 11:29\u00a0a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library. Fifty-two students, two teachers and two librarians were inside.\nHarris fired his shotgun twice at a desk. Student Evan Todd had been standing near a pillar when the shooters entered the library and had just taken cover behind a photocopier. Todd was hit by wood splinters in the eye and lower back but was not seriously injured. He then hid behind the administrative counter.\nThe gunmen walked into the library, towards the two rows of computers. Sitting at the north row was disabled student Kyle Velasquez. Klebold fired his shotgun, fatally hitting him in the head and back. They put down their ammunition-filled duffel bags at the south\u2014or lower\u2014row of computers and reloaded their weapons. They then walked between the computer rows, toward the windows facing the outside staircase.\nThroughout the massacre in the library, they ordered everybody to get up, said how long they had been waiting for this, and seemed to be enjoying themselves, shouting things like \"Woo!\" after shooting. While ordering the jocks to stand up, one of the two said, \"Anybody with a white hat or a sports emblem on it is dead.\" Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members. Nobody stood up, and several students tried to hide their white hats.\nWindows were shot out in the direction of the recently arrived police. Officers returned fire, and the gunmen retreated from the windows; no one was injured. Klebold removed his trench coat. He then fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall.\nHarris walked toward the lower row of computer desks with his shotgun and fired a single shot under the first desk while down on one knee. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. He then moved to the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris said, \"Quit your bitching.\"\nHarris then walked to a table south of the lower computer table, with two students underneath: Cassie Bernall and Emily Wyant. Harris slapped the surface of the table twice as he knelt, and said \"Peek-a-boo\" before shooting Bernall once in the head with the shotgun, killing her. Harris at this point held the gun with one hand, and the weapon hit his face in recoil, injuring his nose. He told Klebold he had done so, and Klebold responded \"Why'd you do that?\"\nAfter fatally shooting Bernall, Harris turned toward the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris's nose was bleeding; witnesses later reported that he had blood around his mouth. Harris asked Pasquale if she wanted to die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Harris laughed and responded \"Everyone's gonna die.\" When Klebold said \"shoot her,\" Harris responded \"No, we're gonna blow up the school anyway.\"\nKlebold noticed Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table. Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious but survived. Klebold then walked toward another table, where he discovered 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter, and 16-year-old Craig Scott (Rachel's younger brother), hiding underneath. Klebold called out to Harris that he found a \"nigger\" and tried to pull Shoels out from under the table.\nHarris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, they taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. The gunmen both fired under the table; Harris shot Shoels once in the chest, killing him, and Klebold shot and killed Kechter. Though Shoels was not shot in the head, Klebold said: \"I didn't know black brains could fly that far.\" Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured, lying in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris then yelled, \"Who's ready to die next?!\"\nHe turned and threw a \"cricket\" at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were. It landed on Steepleton's thigh; Hall quickly noticed it and tossed it behind them, and it exploded in mid-air. Harris walked toward the bookcases between the west and center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, apparently attempting to topple it, then shot at the books which had fallen.\nKlebold walked to the east area of the library. Harris walked from the bookcase, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz, Lauren Townsend, and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired several shots with the TEC-9, killing Townsend.\nAt this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\" In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold asked \"Why?\" and commented \"God is gay.\" Klebold reloaded but walked away from the table.\nHarris approached another table where two girls were hiding. He bent down to look at them and dismissed them as \"pathetic\". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. Tomlin moved out from under the table. Klebold shot him repeatedly, killing him.\nHarris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, 16-year-old Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend, who was already dead; Kreutz again; and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. The shooters moved to the center of the library, where they reloaded their weapons at a table. Harris then pointed his carbine under a table, but the student he was aiming at moved out of the way. Harris turned his gun back on the student and told him to identify himself. It was John Savage, an acquaintance of Klebold's. He asked Klebold what they were doing, to which he shrugged and answered, \"Oh, just killing people.\" Savage asked if they were going to kill him. Because of the background noise, Klebold said, \"What?\" Savage asked again whether they were going to kill him. Klebold said no, and told him to run. Savage fled, escaping through the library's main entrance and through the cafeteria.\nAfter Savage left, Harris turned and fired his carbine at the table directly north of where he had been, hitting the ear and hand of 15-year-old Daniel Mauser. Mauser retaliated by either shoving a chair at Harris or grabbing at his leg; Harris fired again and hit Mauser in the center of the face at close range, killing him. Harris then moved south and fired three shots under another table, critically injuring two 17-year-olds, Jennifer Doyle and Austin Eubanks. Klebold then shot once, fatally wounding 17-year-old Corey DePooter, at 11:35. There were no further victims. They had killed 10 people in the library and wounded 12.\nKlebold was quoted as saying they might start knifing people, but they never did. They headed towards the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. They converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Klebold pulled the chair out from the desk, then he pointed his TEC-9 at Todd, who was wearing a white hat. Klebold asked if he was a jock, and when Todd said no, Klebold responded \"Well, that's good. We don't like jocks.\" Klebold then demanded to see his face; Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: \"I don't want trouble.\" Klebold responded back angrily \"Trouble? You don't even know what fucking trouble is!\" Todd tried to correct himself: \"That's not what I meant! I mean, I don't have a problem with you guys. I never will and I never did.\" Klebold then told Harris he was going to let Todd live, but that Harris could kill him if he wanted.\nHarris appeared to pay no attention and stated that he and Klebold should head to the cafeteria. Klebold fired into an open library staff break room, hitting a small television. While Harris was walking away, Klebold said, \"One more thing!\", then picked up the chair beside the library counter under which Patti Nielson was hiding, and slammed the chair down on top of the computer terminal and library counter. Klebold joined Harris at the library entrance. The two walked out of the library at 11:36. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 10 injured and 29 uninjured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north emergency exit door, which led to the sidewalk next to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson crawled into the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots, and hid in a cupboard.\n12:08\u00a0p.m.: Suicides.\nAfter leaving the library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they caused a fire in an empty storage closet. It was extinguished by a teacher who had hidden in an adjacent room. The gunmen then proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At 11:44\u00a0a.m., they were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris crouching against the rail on the staircase and firing toward the propane bombs left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate them. As Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it, Harris took a drink from one of the cups left behind. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. About a minute later, the gallon of fuel attached to the bomb ignited, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers a few minutes later. They left the cafeteria at 11:46.\nAfter leaving the cafeteria, they returned to the main north and south hallways of the school and fired several shots into walls and ceilings as students and teachers hid in rooms. They walked through the south hallway into the main office before returning to the north hallway. At 11:56, they returned to the cafeteria, and briefly entered the school kitchen. They returned up the staircase and into the south hallway at 12:00\u00a0p.m.\nThey re-entered the library, which was empty of survivors except for the unconscious Ireland and the injured Kreutz. Once inside, at 12:02\u00a0p.m., police were shot at again through the library windows and returned fire. Nobody was injured in the exchange. By 12:05, all gunfire from the school had ceased. By 12:08\u00a0p.m., both gunmen had killed themselves. Harris sat down with his back to a bookshelf and fired his shotgun through the roof of his mouth; Klebold went down on his knees and shot himself in the left temple with his TEC-9. An article by \"The Rocky Mountain News\" stated that Patti Nielson overheard them shout \"One! Two! Three!\" in unison, just before a loud boom. Nielson later said that she had never spoken with either of the writers of the article.\nIn 2002, the \"National Enquirer\" published two post-mortem photos of Harris and Klebold in the library. Klebold's gun was underneath his body and so unseen in the photo, leading to speculation that Harris shot Klebold before killing himself. However, some of Klebold's blood was on Harris's legs, suggesting that he had fallen onto Harris after Harris had already killed himself. Also, just before shooting himself, Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail on a nearby table, underneath which Patrick Ireland was lying, which caused the tabletop to momentarily catch fire. Underneath the scorched film of material was a piece of Harris's brain matter, suggesting Harris had shot himself by this point.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFatalities\nCrisis ends.\nSWAT response.\nBy 12:00\u00a0p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals. A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty. They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added. They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms.\nLeawood Elementary.\nMeanwhile, families of students and staff were asked to gather at nearby Leawood Elementary School to await information. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. In his book \"Walking in Daniel's Shoes\", Tom Mauser, father of victim Daniel Mauser, recounts how several families who'd still been waiting on word of the status of their children were informed by law enforcement that another bus from the school was on its way. However, this bus never arrived, and whether the comments from police stemmed from miscommunication or were an attempt to give distraught parents hope is unknown.\nThe boy in the window.\nPatrick Ireland had regained and lost consciousness several times after being shot by Klebold. Paralyzed on his right side, he crawled to the library windows where, on live television, at 2:38\u00a0p.m., he stretched out the window, intending to fall into the arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood. He became known as \"the boy in the window.\" The team members, Donn Kraemer and John Ramoniec, were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall.\n\"1 bleeding to death\".\nAt 2:15\u00a0p.m., students placed a sign in the window: \"1 bleeding to death\", in order to alert police and medical personnel of Dave Sanders's location in the science room. Police initially feared it was a ruse by the shooters. A shirt was also tied to the doorknob. At 2:30, this was spotted, and by 2:40, SWAT officers evacuated the room of students and called for a paramedic. Hancey and Starkey were reluctant to leave Sanders behind. By 3:00, the SWAT officers had moved Sanders to a storage room, which was more easily accessible. As they did so, a paramedic arrived and found Sanders had no pulse. He had died of his injuries in the storage room before he could receive medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.\nSuicide mission; estimated 25 dead.\nLisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, was evacuated at 3:22\u00a0p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson, and the three library staff who had hidden in the rooms adjacent to the library. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30.\nBy 4:00, Sheriff John P. Stone made an initial estimate of 25 dead students and teachers, 50 wounded, and referred to the massacre as a \"suicide mission\". President Bill Clinton later issued a statement.\nBomb squad response.\nStone said that police officers were searching the bodies of the gunmen. They feared they had used their pipe bombs to booby-trap corpses, including their own. At 4:30\u00a0p.m., the school was declared safe. At 5:30, additional officers were called in, as more explosives were found in the parking lot and on the roof. By 6:15, officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot, set to detonate the gas tank. Stone then marked the entire school as a crime scene.\nAt 10:40\u00a0p.m., a member of the bomb squad, who was attempting to dispose of an un-detonated pipe bomb, accidentally lit a striking match attached to the bomb by brushing it against the wall of the ordnance disposal trailer. The bomb detonated inside the trailer but no one was injured.\nThe bomb squad disarmed the car bomb. Klebold's car was repaired and, in 2006, put up for auction.\nImmediate aftermath.\nOn the morning of April 21, bomb squads combed the high school. By 8:30\u00a0a.m., the official death toll of 15 was released. The earlier estimate was ten over the true death toll count, but close to the total count of wounded students. The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings. Three more victims were injured indirectly as they tried to escape the school. One of the survivors later died from her injuries, bringing the number of fatalities to fourteen.\nAt 10:00\u00a0a.m., the bomb squad declared the building safe for officials to enter. By 11:30\u00a0a.m., a spokesman of the sheriff declared the investigation underway. Thirteen of the bodies were still inside and around the high school as investigators photographed the building.\nAt 2:30\u00a0p.m., a press conference was held by Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas and Sheriff John Stone, at which they said that they suspected others had helped plan the shooting. Formal identification of the dead had not yet taken place, but families of the children thought to have been killed had been notified.\nThroughout the late afternoon and early evening, the bodies were gradually removed from the school and taken to the Jefferson County Coroner's Office to be identified and autopsied. By 5:00\u00a0p.m., the names of many of the dead were known. An official statement was released, naming the 15 confirmed deaths and 27 injuries related to the massacre.\nOn April 22, the cafeteria bombs were discovered.\nIn the days following the shootings, Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck became memorials, and impromptu memorials were held in Clement Park. On April 30, carpenter Greg Zanis erected fifteen 6-foot-tall wooden crosses to honor those who had died at the school. Daniel Rohrbough's father cut down the two meant for the gunmen. There were also fifteen trees planted, and he cut down two of those as well.\nIn November 2021, a report was leaked to NPR about that year's National Rifle Association convention in Denver. In a series of audio tapes, Wayne LaPierre and other top officials suggested raising one million dollars for the victims' families, and the cancellation of the convention was considered by some within the organization.\nSearch warrant press conference.\nAlso on April 30, high-ranking officials of Jefferson County and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office met to decide if they should reveal that Michael Guerra had drafted an affidavit for a search warrant of Harris's residence more than a year before the shootings, based on his previous investigation of Harris's website and activities. Since the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause, they decided not to disclose this information at a press conference held on April 30, nor did they mention it in any other way.\nOver the next two years, Guerra's original draft and investigative file documents were lost. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. Their loss was termed \"troubling\" by a grand jury convened after the file's existence was reported in April 2001. It was concealed by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show \"60 Minutes\". The documents were reconstructed and released to the public, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.\nChristian martyrdom.\nIn the wake of the shooting, victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall came to be regarded as Christian martyrs by Evangelical Christians.\nThe closest living witness to Scott's death, Richard Castaldo, has stated Harris asked Scott if she believed in God, and murdered her after she answered \"You know I do\", but this has been questioned, and Castaldo later stated he was not sure.\nConsiderable media attention focused upon Bernall, who had been killed by Harris in the library and who Harris was reported to have asked, \"Do you believe in God?\" immediately prior to her murder. Bernall was reported to have responded \"Yes\" to this question before her murder. Emily Wyant, the closest living witness to Bernall's death, denied that Bernall and Harris had such an exchange. Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but he was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to survivor Valeen Schnurr during the shootings. Likewise, another witness, Craig Scott, claimed the discussion was with Bernall. However, when asked to indicate where the conversation had been coming from, he pointed to where Schnurr was shot. Schnurr herself claims that she was the one questioned as to her belief in God.\nWe are Columbine.\nClasses at Columbine were held at nearby Chatfield Senior High for the remaining three weeks of the 1999 school year. In August 1999, students returned to the school, and principal Frank DeAngelis led a rally of students clad in \"We are Columbine\" shirts.\nSecondary casualties.\nIn the years following the shooting, numerous individuals connected to the event experienced long-term physical and psychological effects. Survivors, including students and teachers, reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSix months after the shootings, Anne Marie Hochhalter's mother died by suicide. Hochhalter herself died on February 16, 2025, at the age of 43. According to Hochhalter's dad, she died due to medical complications from the paralysis and injuries sustained during the shooting. On March 13, 2025, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office released her autopsy report, officially ruling her cause of death as homicide. The ruling brought the total number of deceased victims resulting from the attack to 14.\nGreg Barnes, a 17-year-old student at Columbine who had also witnessed Sanders's shooting, and also a close friend of Kechter, died by suicide on May 4, 2000.\nSurvivor Austin Eubanks, who was injured during the shooting, became heavily medicated, developing an opioid addiction. He eventually overcame and later spoke publicly about the addiction, but died from an accidental overdose in 2019 at the age of 37.\nConspiracy theories and misinformation.\nIn the immediate aftermath, conspiracy theories and unfounded claims were made by several anti-government movements and extremist religious and political movements, such as the Westboro Baptist Church and televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr.\nWestboro's founder and then-leader, Fred Phelps, unfoundedly claimed that both Harris and Klebold were gay, saying: \"Two filthy fags slaughtered 13 people at Columbine High.\" Falwell also claimed that Harris and Klebold were gay, though he retracted afterward.\nConspiracy theories also arose from anti-gun control activists and extremists, claiming that the massacre had either been staged or that both Harris and Klebold had been government agents, aiming at promoting tougher gun control legislation. Other conspiracy theories point to a mysterious third shooter that has never been identified.\nOther antisemitic conspiracy theories pointed to the massacre being a Jewish conspiracy, due to Klebold's mother being Jewish.\nPolitical commentator and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones once implied that the US government had \"perpetrated\" Columbine, and has claimed that \"the Columbine school shootings were 100 percent false flag\".\nMotive.\nThe shooting was planned as a terrorist attack that would cause \"the most deaths in US history\", but the motive has never been ascertained with any degree of certainty. In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A. Dunaway wrote they \"cannot answer the most fundamental question\u2014why?\" In the days following the event, media speculation regarding the killers' motive was rife. Media reports were disseminated suggesting various motives of the killers, although all theories were largely unsubstantiated and turned out to be myths. These reports included blaming bullying, goth culture, video games, Marilyn Manson, and targeting jocks and minorities. Other rumors were spread in the local area but not largely disseminated by the media, such as the false claim spread by some students that the killers were bullied because they were homosexual.\nMental disorder.\nThe FBI's theory.\nThe FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: \"I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well.\"\nIn April 1998, a year prior to the shooting, as part of his diversion program, Harris wrote a letter of apology to the owner of the van he and Klebold broke into earlier that year. Around the same time, he derided the owner of the van in his journal, stating that he believed he had the right to steal something if he wanted to. By far the most prevalent theme in Klebold's journals is his wish for suicide and private despair at his lack of success with women, which he refers to as an \"infinite sadness\". Klebold had repeatedly documented his desires to kill himself, and his final remark in the Basement Tapes, shortly before the attack, is a resigned statement made as he glances away from the camera: \"Just know I'm going to a better place. I didn't like life too much.\"\nThe FBI's theory was used by Dave Cullen for his 2009 book \"Columbine\". Harris was depicted as the mastermind, having a messianic-level superiority complex and hoping to demonstrate his superiority to the world. Klebold was a follower who primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life.\nThis theory has been met with criticism. Critics cite the fact that Klebold, not Harris, was the first to mention a killing spree in his journal. They also cite evidence that Harris was depressed as well, such as his prescription for antidepressants mentioned below.\nMedication.\nOpponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claim that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.\nHarris had complained of depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts, for which he was prescribed antidepressants.\u00a0Toxicology reports confirmed that Harris had fluvoxamine, sold under the brand name Luvox, in his bloodstream at the time of the shootings, whereas Klebold had no medications in his system.\nHarris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before the massacre.\nOther theories.\nThere have been other attempts to diagnose Harris and Klebold with mental illness. Peter Langman believes Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was schizotypal. Professor Aubrey Immelman published a personality profile of Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication, and believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a \"malignant narcissism...pathological narcissistic personality disorder with borderline and antisocial features, along with some paranoid traits, and unconstrained aggression.\"\nMedia speculation.\nBullying.\nEarly stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive. The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since.\nAccounts from various parents and school staffers reported bullying in the school. Reportedly, Harris and Klebold were regularly called \"faggots\". Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, \"You've been giving us shit for years;\" however, they also stated several times on the tapes and in the journals that no one else was to blame, nor could have prevented the attack. Dylan when talking to his father about the jocks had stated, \"They sure give Eric hell.\" but he also said that the jocks tended to leave him [Dylan] alone. Brown also noted Harris was born with mild chest indent. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him. Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, who knew Harris, noted they were picked on. Vanderau recalled that a \"cup of fecal matter\" was thrown at them.\nIt has been alleged that Harris and Klebold were once both confronted by a group of students at CHS who sprayed them with ketchup while referring to them as \"faggots\" and \"queers\". Klebold told his mother it had been the worst day of his life. According to Brown, \"That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it.\" According to classmate Chad Laughlin, it involved seniors pelting Klebold with \"ketchup-covered tampons\" in the commons. Laughlin also stated, \"A lot of the tension in the school came from the class above us...There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups certainly got preferential treatment across the board.\"\nA similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre, \"No Easy Answers\"; he noted that teachers commonly ignored bullying and that when Harris and Klebold were bullied by the jocks at CHS, they would make statements such as: \"Don't worry, man. It happens all the time!\"\nCullen, as well as psychologists dispute the theory of \"revenge for bullying\" as a motivation. While acknowledging the pervasiveness of bullying in high schools including CHS, Cullen claimed they were not victims of bullying. He noted Harris was more often the perpetrator than victim of bullying. In an entry by Eric Harris in his journal, he stated that even if he were complimented and respected more by his peers, the attack would have still, in all likelihood, occurred. In another entry by Eric in his journal he says not to blame the school's administration for the attack as the staff were doing a good job running the school. In a fact check published on April 19, 2019, on the eve of the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the massacre, Gillian Brockell in \"The Washington Post\" underscored that, contrary to the popular view, their attack was not revenge for being bullied. Author Jeff Kass who has also published a book on the attack believes that bullying was not the cause. Peter Langman also argues against bullying being the cause of the attack. Other researchers have also argued against the bullying hypothesis.\nIsolation.\nRejection was also highlighted as a cause. Social cliques within high schools such as the Trench Coat Mafia were widely discussed. One perception formed was that Harris and Klebold were both outcasts who had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and depression, as well as a strong need for power and attention. Harris's last journal entry reads, \"I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things\", while Klebold wrote \"The lonely man strikes with absolute rage.\" In an interview, Brown described them as the school's worst outcasts, \"the losers of the losers\".\nThis concept too has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group. Cullen and Brockell both also say they were not in the Trench Coat Mafia and were not isolated outcasts or loners. Other close friends of the pair such as Chad Laughlin and Nathan Dykeman state the duo were not outcasts. Peter Langman also concurs by also arguing against the pair being loners and outcasts.\nPolitical terrorism.\nSome peers, such as Robyn Anderson, stated that the pair were not interested in Nazism, and they did not worship or admire Hitler in any way. However, in retrospect, Anderson also stated that there were many things the pair did not tell friends. Harris at least did revere the Nazis, often praising them in his journal.\nWhile some sources claim that there is a connection to Hitler's birthday (20 April 1889), the theory is dismissed by others since the date of the attack had been delayed due to a munitions problem.\nSociologist Ralph Larkin has theorized that the massacre was to trigger a revolution of outcast students and the dispossessed: \"[A]s an overtly political act in the name of oppressed students victimized by their peers. [...] The Columbine shootings redefined such acts not merely as revenge but as a means of protest of bullying, intimidation, social isolation, and public rituals of humiliation.\"\nIn contrast with the theory that the attack was political, one author argues Columbine was only increasingly linked to terrorism after the September 11 attacks.\nMarilyn Manson.\nIn the late 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his band established themselves as a household name, and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history. Their two album releases prior to the massacre were both critical and commercial successes, and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth.\nImmediately after the massacre, a significant portion of blame was directed at the band and, specifically, at its outspoken frontman. In the weeks following the shootings, media reports about Harris and Klebold portrayed them and the Trench Coat Mafia as part of a gothic cult. Early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, news outlets continued to run sensationalist stories with headlines such as \"Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson\" and \"Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill\". Speculation in national media and among the public led many to believe that Manson's music and imagery were the shooter's sole motivation, despite reports that revealed that the two were not big fans.\nDespite this, Marilyn Manson were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures. Under mounting pressure in the days after Columbine, the group postponed their last five North American tour dates out of respect for the victims and their families. Manson published his response to these accusations in an op-ed piece for \"Rolling Stone\", titled \"Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?\", in which he castigated America's gun culture, the political influence of the National Rifle Association, and the media's irresponsible coverage, which he said facilitated the placing of blame on a scapegoat.\nAfter concluding the European and Japanese legs of their tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view to work on their next album, 2000's \"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)\" as an artistic rebuttal to the allegations leveled against them.\nVideo games.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n They are able to hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily violent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenaline level to go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die themselves. It is a very intense experience. They are able to get into Internet chat rooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same mentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country. They are able to rent from the video store\u2014not just go down and see \"Natural Born Killers\" or \"The Basketball Diaries\"\u2014but they are able to bring it home and watch it repeatedly. In this case, even maybe make their own violent film. Many have said this murder was very much akin to \"The Basketball Diaries\", in which a student goes in and shoots others in the classroom. I have seen a video of that, and many others may have.\n \u2014Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Youth Violence, Senator Jeff Sessions, testifying before the Senate on the Columbine tragedy, 1999.\nViolent video games were also blamed. Parents of some of the victims filed several unsuccessful lawsuits against video game manufacturers. Jerald Block believes their immersion in a virtual world best explains the massacre. While Brooks Brown disagrees that video games caused the massacre, he agrees elements of their plan came from video games.\nHarris and Klebold were both fans of shooter video games such as \"Doom\", \"Quake\", \"Duke Nukem 3D\" and \"Postal\". A file on Harris's computer read the massacre will \"be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, \"Duke\" and \"Doom\" all mixed together.\" In his last journal entry, Harris wished to \"Get a few extra frags on the scoreboard.\" After the massacre, it was alleged Harris created \"Doom\" and \"Duke Nukem 3D\" levels resembling CHS, but these were never found.\n\"Doom\".\nThey were avid fans of \"Doom\" especially. Harris said of the massacre, \"It's going to be like...\"Doom\".\" He also wrote \"I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy...so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from \"Doom\".\" In Harris's yearbook, Klebold wrote \"I find a similarity between people and \"Doom\" zombies.\" Harris named his shotgun Arlene after a character in the \"Doom\" novels. The TEC-9 Klebold used resembled an AB-10, a weapon from the \"Doom\" novels that Harris referenced several times.\nHarris spent a great deal of time creating a large WAD, named Tier (German for 'animal', and a song by Rammstein), calling it his \"life's work\". The WAD was uploaded to the Columbine school computer and to AOL shortly before the attack, but appears to have been lost.\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\".\nThe other game mentioned specifically by Harris for what the massacre would be like was \"Duke Nukem 3D\". The game has pipe bombs and one of the enemies is the \"pig cop\". Brooks Brown wrote that pipe bombs were set in the halls of the school with the intention of causing a chain reaction, because that's what happens in \"Duke Nukem 3D\". Brown also wrote they shot wildly because it works in \"Duke Nukem 3D\".\nNotoriety.\nIn 2004, Dave Cullen argued that according to the FBI, Harris and Klebold committed the massacre in order to be infamous. Some scientists also reached the same conclusion.\nAdam Lankford, a researcher for the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, who identified 24 fame-seeking mass shooters between 1966 and 2015, included both Harris and Klebold in the group, partially blaming the \"American idolization of fame\" as a root cause.\nLegacy.\nFollowing the Columbine shooting, schools across the United States instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks, metal detectors, school uniforms, and security guards. Some schools implemented the numbering of school doors in order to improve public safety response. Several schools throughout the country resorted to requiring students to wear computer-generated IDs.\nSchools also adopted a zero tolerance approach to possession of weapons and threatening behavior by students.\nDespite the effort, several social science experts feel the zero tolerance approach adopted in schools has been implemented too harshly, with unintended consequences creating other problems. Despite the safety measures that were implemented in the wake of the tragedy at Columbine, school shootings continued to take place in the United States, including at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook Elementary School, Stoneman Douglas High School, and Robb Elementary School.\nSome schools renewed existing anti-bullying policies. Rachel's Challenge was started by Rachel Scott's parents, and lectures schools about bullying and suicide.\nIn 2000, Sanders was posthumously given the Arthur Ashe Courage Award for his actions.\nPolice tactics.\nPolice departments reassessed their tactics and now train for Columbine-like situations after criticism over the slow response and progress of the SWAT teams during the shooting.\nPolice followed a traditional tactic at Columbine: surround the building, set up a perimeter, and contain the damage. That approach has been replaced by a tactic known as the Immediate Action Rapid Deployment tactic. This tactic calls for a four-person team to advance into the site of any ongoing shooting, optimally a diamond-shaped wedge, but even with just a single officer if more are not available. Police officers using this tactic are trained to move toward the sound of gunfire and neutralize the shooter as quickly as possible. Their goal is to stop the shooter at all costs; they are to walk past wounded victims, as the aim is to prevent the shooter from killing or wounding more. Dave Cullen has stated: \"The active protocol has proved successful at numerous shootings... At Virginia Tech alone, it probably saved dozens of lives.\"\nLawsuits.\nAfter the massacre, many survivors and relatives of those killed filed lawsuits. Under Colorado state law at the time, the maximum a family could receive in a lawsuit against a government agency was $600,000 (). Most cases against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and school district were dismissed by the federal court on the grounds of government immunity. The case against the sheriff's office regarding the death of Dave Sanders was not dismissed due to the police preventing paramedics from going to his aid for hours after they knew the gunmen were dead. The case was settled out of court in August 2002 for $1,500,000.\nIn April 2001, the families of more than 30 victims received a $2,538,000 settlement in their case against the families of Harris, Klebold, Manes, and Duran. Under the terms of the settlement, the Harrises and the Klebolds contributed $1,568,000 through their homeowners' policies, with another $32,000 set aside for future claims; the Manes contributed $720,000, with another $80,000 set aside for future claims; and the Durans contributed $250,000, with an additional $50,000 available for future claims. The family of victim Shoels rejected this settlement, but in June 2003 were ordered by a judge to accept a $366,000 settlement in their $250-million lawsuit against the shooters' families. In August 2003, the families of victims Fleming, Kechter, Rohrbough, Townsend, and Velasquez received undisclosed settlements in a wrongful death suit against the Harrises and Klebolds.\nParents of some of the victims filed several unsuccessful lawsuits against film companies, over films such as \"The Basketball Diaries\", which includes a dream sequence with a student shooting his classmates in a trench coat. In the Basement Tapes, they debate on whether or not Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino are appropriate choices to direct films about the massacre. Their home videos also show inspiration taken from \"Pulp Fiction\". Both were fans of the film \"Lost Highway\". \"Apocalypse Now\" was found in Harris's VCR.\nMemorials.\nMany impromptu memorials were created after the massacre, including victims Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck.\nIn 2000, youth advocate Melissa Helmbrecht organized a remembrance event in Denver featuring two surviving students, called \"A Call to Hope\". The library where most of the massacre took place was removed and replaced with an atrium. In 2001, a new library, the HOPE memorial library, was built next to the west entrance.\nOn February 26, 2004, thousands of pieces of evidence from the massacre were put on display at the Jefferson County fairgrounds in Golden.\nA permanent memorial \"to honor and remember the victims of the April 20, 1999, shootings at Columbine High School\" began planning in June 1999, and was dedicated on September 21, 2007, in Clement Park. The memorial fund raised $1.5\u00a0million in donations over eight years of planning. Designing took three and a half years and included feedback from victims' families, survivors, the high school's students and staff, and the community.\nSoon after the massacre, music students at CU Boulder raised money to commission a piece of music to honor Columbine. The university band turned to Frank Ticheli, who responded by composing the wind ensemble work \"An American Elegy\". The following year, the Columbine band premiered the piece at CU Boulder's concert hall. As of 2019[ [update]], Ticheli's sheet music publisher estimates \"An American Elegy\" has been performed 10,000 times.\nGun control.\nThe shooting resulted in calls for more gun control measures. The gun show loophole and background checks became a focus of a national debate. It was the deadliest mass shooting during the era of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Victim Daniel Mauser's father Tom Mauser has become a gun control advocate.\nIn 2000, federal and state legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made it a crime to buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at gun shows. There was concern in the gun lobby over restrictions on Second Amendment rights in the United States. Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.\nMichael Moore's 2002 documentary \"Bowling for Columbine\" focused heavily on the American obsession with handguns, its grip on Jefferson County, and its role in the shooting.\nIn 2019, the MyLastShot Project was launched as a student-led gun violence prevention resource. The campaign was created by students from Columbine High School, and involves students placing stickers on their driver's licenses, student IDs, or phones that states their wishes to have the graphic photos of their bodies publicized if they die in a shooting.\nPopular culture.\nSince the advent of social media, a fandom for Harris and Klebold has had a documented presence on social media sites, especially Tumblr and TikTok. Fans of Harris and Klebold refer to themselves as \"Columbiners\". A qualitative study published in 2015 on the fan cultures surrounding Harris and Klebold found that \"Columbiners\" function similar to other fandoms, engaging in fan art, fan fiction, and cosplay.\nBooks and movies have also been inspired by the massacre . The games \"Super Columbine Massacre RPG!\" and \"Pico's School\" was also inspired by the massacre.\nThe massacre is referenced in the Eminem song, 'I'm Back', in which he references the perpetrators in a lyric, \"I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line. Add an AK-47, a revolver, a .9, A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine, And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time.\" The line was partially censored in the studio album.\nCopycats.\nThe Columbine shootings influenced subsequent school shootings, with several such plots mentioning it. Fear of copycats has sometimes led to the closing of entire school districts. Since Columbine, over 74 copycat cases have been reported, 21 of which resulted in attacks, while the rest were thwarted by law enforcement. In many of them, the perpetrators cited Harris and Klebold as heroes or martyrs.\nAnalysis.\nHarris and Klebold have become what the \"Napa Valley Register\" have called \"cultural icons\" for troubled youth. According to psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its \"allure to disaffected youth\".\nSociologist Ralph Larkin examined twelve major school shootings in the US in the following eight years and found that in eight of those, \"the shooters made explicit reference to Harris and Klebold\". Larkin wrote that the Columbine massacre established a \"script\" for shootings. \"Numerous post-Columbine rampage shooters referred directly to Columbine as their inspiration; others attempted to supersede the Columbine shootings in body count.\"\nA 2015 investigation by CNN identified \"more than 40 people...charged with Columbine-style plots\". A 2014 investigation by ABC News identified \"at least 17 attacks and another 36 alleged plots or serious threats against schools since the assault on Columbine High School that can be tied to the 1999 massacre.\" Ties identified by ABC News included online research by the perpetrators into the Columbine shooting, clipping news coverage and images of Columbine, explicit statements of admiration of Harris and Klebold, such as writings in journals and on social media, in video posts, and in police interviews, timing planned to an anniversary of Columbine, plans to exceed the Columbine victim counts, and other ties.\nIn 2015, Canadian journalist Malcolm Gladwell writing in \"The New Yorker\" magazine proposed a threshold model of school shootings in which Harris and Klebold were the triggering actors in \"a slow-motion, ever-evolving riot, in which each new participant's action makes sense in reaction to and in combination with those who came before.\"\nIn February 2016, after Klebold's mother, Sue Klebold, spoke out on mental health and suicide prevention in an interview with Diane Sawyer, then-Attorney General of Colorado, Cynthia Coffman, tweeted that Klebold's interview had been \"irresponsible and inflammatory, that Klebold had been \"selfish\", and that her interview could have \"very negative consequences\". Ted Zocco-Hochhalter, whose daughter Anne-Marie Hochhalter was a Columbine student paralyzed in the attack, countered that Klebold, as a remorseful mother, was productively sparking awareness on mental issues. Mental health organizations echoed Zocco-Hochhalter's remarks. The day before the interview, Anne-Marie Hochhalter had addressed a social media post to Sue Klebold, saying: \"I have forgiven you\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nCited works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "59628", "revid": "40214537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59628", "title": "School shooting", "text": "Armed attack at an educational institution\nA school shooting is an armed attack at an educational institution, involving the use of a firearm. Many school shootings are also categorized as mass shootings due to multiple casualties. The phenomenon is mostly widespread in the United States, which has the highest number of school-related shootings, outnumbering the six other G7 nations combined by a factor of 57 (2009\u201318). Especially in the United States, school shootings have sparked a political debate over gun violence, zero tolerance policies, gun rights and gun control.\nAccording to studies, factors behind school shooting include easy access to firearms, family dysfunction, lack of family supervision, and mental illness among many other psychological issues. Among the topmost motives of attackers were: bullying/persecution/threatened (75%) and revenge (61%), while 54% reported having multiple reasons. The remaining motives included an attempt to solve a problem (34%), suicide or depression (27%), and seeking attention or recognition (24%).\nProfiling.\nThe United States Secret Service published the results from a study regarding 37 school shooting incidents, involving 41 individuals in the United States from December 1974 through May 2000. In a previous report of 18 school shootings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), they released a profile that described shooters as middle-class, lonely/alienated, awkward, Caucasian males who had access to guns.\nThe most recent report cautioned against the assumption that a perpetrator can be identified by a certain 'type' or profile. The results from the study indicated that perpetrators came from differing backgrounds, making a singular profile difficult when identifying a possible assailant. For example, some perpetrators were children of divorce, lived in foster homes, or came from intact nuclear families. The majority of individuals had rarely or never gotten into trouble at school and had a healthy social life. Some, such as Alan Lipman, have warned about the lack of empirical validity of profiling methods.\nAge.\nAccording to Raine (2002), immaturity is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of violence and outbursts of aggression. This fact is supported by findings on brain development occurring as individuals age from birth.\nAccording to the Australian-based Raising children network and Centre for Adolescent Health (and other sources): the main change occurring in the developing brain during adolescence is the (so-called) \"pruning\" of unused connections in thinking and processing. While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the nervous system in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, axons, neurons, and synapses, to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. \"pruning\" (or apoptosis, otherwise known as \"cell death\"). These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the pre-frontal cortex, the brain location where decision-making occurs, is the concluding area for development.\nWhile the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on a part of the brain known as the amygdala; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including aggression and impulsiveness. As a result, individuals can be more inclined to make riskier decisions more often.\nParental supervision.\n\"Studies have found that within offenders' families, there is frequently a lack of supervision, low emotional closeness, and intimacy\". In a 2018 publication, Dr. George S. Everly Jr, of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health outlined an accumulation of seven, recurring themes that warrant consideration regarding school shooters. One factor is that school shooters tended to isolate themselves, and \"exhibited an obsessive quality that often led to detailed planning, but ironically they seemed to lack an understanding of the consequences of their behavior and thus may have a history of adverse encounters with law enforcement.\" A criticism in the media of past shooters was questioning how so much planning could commence without alerting the parents or guardians to their efforts. However, this has proven to be as difficult of a question to answer as anticipating any of the past school shootings.\nData from the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, covering decades of US school shootings, reveals that 68% of shooters obtained weapons from their home or the home of a relative. Since 1999, out of 145 US school shootings committed by children/adolescents, 80% of the guns used were taken from their homes or relative's home. The availability of firearms has direct effect on the probability of initiating a school shooting. This has led many to question whether parents should be held criminally negligent for their children's gun-related crimes. By 2018, a total of four parents were convicted of failing to lock up the guns that were used to shoot up US schools by their children. Such incidents may also lead to nationwide discussion on gun laws.\nThe FBI offers a guide for helping to identify potential school shooters, \"The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective\".\nDaniel Schechter, Clinical Psychiatrist, wrote that for a baby to develop into a troubled adolescent who then turns lethally violent, a convergence of multiple interacting factors must occur, that is \"every bit as complicated...as it is for a tornado to form on a beautiful spring day in Kansas\". Thus, reinforcing the issue that school shooters do not necessarily come from \"bad\" parents, no more than they could come from attentive, educated, negligent, single, married, abusive, or loving parents.\nSchool bullying.\nDorothy Espelage of the University of Florida observed that 8% of bullying victims become \"angry, and aggressively so.\" She added, \"They become very angry, they may act out aggressively online. They may not hit back, but they definitely ruminate.\"\n\"Bullying is common in schools and seemed to play a role in the lives of many of the school shooters\". A typical bullying interaction consists of three parts, the offender/bully, a victim, and one or more bystanders. This formula of three enables the bully to easily create public humiliation for their victim. Students who are bullied tend to develop behavioral problems, depression, less self-control and poorer social skills, and to do worse in school. Once humiliated, victims never want to be a victim again and try to regain their image by joining groups. Often, they are rejected by their peers and follow through by restoring justice in what they see as an unjust situation. Their plan for restoration many times results in violence as shown by the school shooters. 75% of school shooters had been bullied or left behind evidence of having been victims of bullying. Other academics however are critical of a bullying-school shootings connection.\nThe Uvalde shooter who killed 21 people was frequently bullied in 4th grade at Robb Elementary school.\nMental illness.\nThe degree to which mental illness contributes to school shootings has been debated.\nAlthough the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are non-violent, some evidence has suggested that mental illness or mental health symptoms are nearly universal among school shooters. A 2002 report by the US Secret Service and US Department of Education found evidence that a majority of school shooters displayed evidence of mental health symptoms, often undiagnosed or untreated. Criminologists Fox and DeLateur note that mental illness is only part of the issue, however, and mass shooters tend to externalize their problems, blaming others and are unlikely to seek psychiatric help, even if available.\nAccording to an article written on gun violence and mental illness, the existence of violence as an outlet for the mentally ill is quite prominent in some instances (Swanson et al., 2015). The article lists from a study that 12% of people with serious mental illness had committed minor or serious violence within the last year, compared to 2% of people without illness committing those same acts.\nOther scholars have concluded that mass murderers display a common constellation of chronic mental health symptoms, chronic anger or antisocial traits, and a tendency to blame others for problems. However, they note that attempting to \"profile\" school shooters with such a constellation of traits will likely result in many false positives as many individuals with such a profile do not engage in violent behaviors.\nMcGinty and colleagues conducted a study to find out if people tended to associate the violence of school shootings with mental illness, at the expense of other factors such as the availability of high-capacity magazines. Nearly 2,000 participants read a news piece on a shooting in which the shooter is diagnosed as having a mental illness and who used high capacity magazines. One group read an article that presented only the facts of the case. A different group read an article about the same shooting, but in it the author advocated for gun restrictions for people with mental illness. Another group read about the shooting in an article that suggested the proposal to ban large-capacity magazines, which acted to advocate that shootings could stem from a societal problem rather than an individual problem. The control group did not read anything. Participants were then all asked to fill in a questionnaire asking about their views on gun control and whether they thought there should be restrictions on high-capacity magazines.\nThe results of the study showed that 71% of the control group thought that gun restrictions should be applied to people with mental illness, and nearly 80% of participants who read the articles agreed. Despite the fact that the article exposed the readers to both the mental illness of the shooter, and the fact that the shooter used high-capacity magazines, participants advocated more for gun restrictions on people with mental illness rather than bans on high-capacity magazines.\nThis suggests that people believe mental illness is the culprit for school shootings in lieu of the accessibility of guns or other environmental factors. The authors expressed concern that proposals to target gun control laws at people with mental illness do not take into account the complex nature of the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, much of which is due to additional factors such as substance abuse. However, the link is unclear since research has shown that violence in mentally ill people occurs more in interpersonal environments.\nIt is also mentionable that school size can play a role on the presence of shooter mental health concerns. In a presented study from researchers Baird, Roellke &amp; Zeifman from the Social Science Journal, it is presented that school size and level of attention given to students can precede violent actions, as students who commit mass shootings in larger schools are likely to have transitioned from smaller schools. This adds important nuance to the idea that larger schools are more prone to mass violence by showing that the stress associated with losing the personal support given in a smaller community is a weight on students.\nA 2016 opinion piece published by U.S. News &amp; World Report concluded that 22% of mass murders are committed by people who suffer from a serious mental illness, and 78% do not. This study also concluded that many people with mental illnesses do not engage in violence against others and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness.\nInjustice collectors.\nIn a 2015 \"New Republic\" essay, \"Columbine\" author Dave Cullen describes a subset of school shooters (and other mass murderers) known as \"injustice collectors\", or people who \"never forget, never forgive, [and] never let go\" before they strike out. The essay describes and expands on the work of retired FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole, who has published a peer-reviewed journal article on the subject. It also quotes Gary Noesner, who helped create and lead the FBI's hostage negotiation unit, and served as Chief Negotiator for ten years.\nViolent media theory.\nVideo games.\nIt has long been debated whether there exists a correlation between school shooting perpetrators and the type of media they consume. A popular profile for school shooters is someone who has been exposed to or enjoys playing violent video games. However, this profile is considered by many researchers to be misguided or erroneous. Ferguson (2009) has argued that a third variable of gender explains the illusory correlation between video game use and the type of people who conduct school shootings. Ferguson explains that the majority of school shooters are young males, who are considerably more aggressive than the rest of the population. A majority of gamers are also young males. Thus, it appears likely that the view that school shooters are often people who play violent video games is more simply explained by the third variable of gender.\nThe idea of profiling school shooters by the video games they play comes from the belief that playing violent video games increases a person's aggression level, which in turn, can cause people to perpetrate extreme acts of violence, such as a school shooting. There is little to no data supporting this hypothesis but it has become a vivid profile used by the media since the Columbine Massacre in 1999.\nA summation of past research on video game violence finds that video games have little to no effect on aggression. (Anderson, 2004; Ferguson, 2007 &amp; Spencer, 2009) Again, this supports the idea that although it is a popular opinion to link school shooters to being violent video gamers; this misconception is often attributable to third variables and has not been supported by research on the connection between aggression and gaming.\nLiterature.\nThe 1977 novel \"Rage\" by Stephen King (written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), was linked to five school shootings and hostage situations that took place between 1988 and 1997; the most recent of these, the 1997 Heath High School shooting, was ultimately influential in King's decision to pull the book out of print permanently.\nNotoriety.\nShooting massacres in English-speaking countries often occur close together in time. In the summer of 1966, two major stories broke: Richard Speck murdered eight women on a single night in Chicago, and Charles Whitman shot and killed 15 people from a clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin. Despite neither of them seeking fame, but with the new television news climate, they received it anyway. Seeing this, 18-year-old Robert Benjamin Smith bought a gun, and on November 12, 1966, he killed four women and a toddler inside the Rose-Mar College of Beauty in Mesa, Arizona. \"I wanted to get known, just wanted to get myself a name,\" explained Smith. He had hoped to kill nearly ten times as many people, but had arrived at the beauty college campus too early. Upon his arrest, he was without remorse, saying simply, \"I wanted people to know who I was.\" Towers, et al. (2015), found a small, but significant temporary increase in the probability of a second school shooting within 2 weeks after a known school shooting, which was only slightly smaller than the probability of repeats after mass killings involving firearms. \nHowever, much more work is needed with greater scope on investigations, to understand whether this is a real phenomenon or not. Some attribute this to copycat behavior, which can be correlated with the level of media exposure. In these copycat shootings, oftentimes the perpetrators see a past school shooter as an idol, so they want to carry out an even more destructive, murderous shooting in hopes of gaining recognition or respect. Some mass murderers study media reports of previous killers.\nRecent premeditative writings were presented according to court documents and showed Joshua O'Connor wrote that he wanted the \"death count to be as high as possible so that the shooting would be infamous\". O'Connor was arrested before he was able to carry out his plan. Infamy and notoriety, \"a desire to be remembered\" has been reported as the leading reason for planned shootings by most perpetrators who were taken alive either pre or post shooting.\nBy region.\nUnited States.\nSchool shootings are an \"overwhelmingly American\" phenomenon due to the availability of firearms in the United States. Children at U.S. schools have active shooter drills. According to \"USA Today\", in 2019 \"about 95% of public schools now have students and teachers practice huddling in silence, hiding from an imaginary gunman.\"\nBetween the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, there were 31 school shootings in the United States and 14 in the rest of the world combined. Between 2000 and 2010, counting incidents from 37 countries in which someone was injured or killed on school grounds, with two or more victims, and not counting \"single homicides, off-campus homicides, killings caused by government actions, militaries, terrorists or militants\", the number of such incidents in the United States was one less than in the other 36 countries combined; in the vast majority of the United States incidents, perpetrators used guns.\nTracking school shootings in the United States was made more difficult by the passage by United States Congress of the Dickey Amendment in 1996, which mandated that no Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funds \"may be used to advocate or promote gun control\", although this does not mean the CDC has stopped researching gun violence. Instead, Congress relies on independent research done by non-partisan organizations for getting data on gun violence in the United States.\nBetween the Columbine massacre and the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas, shooting of some form happened at 216 schools, and at least 141 children, educators and other people were killed and another 284 were injured. 38% of the students who experienced school shootings were African American although African American students were 16.6% of the school population. Schools in at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have experienced a shooting.\nMany school shootings in the United States result in one non-fatal injury. The type of firearm most commonly used in school shootings in the United States is the handgun. Three school shootings (the Columbine massacre, the Sandy Hook massacre, and the 2018 Parkland High School shooting in Florida), accounted for 43% of the fatalities; the type of firearm used in the most lethal school shootings was the rifle. High-capacity magazines, which allow the perpetrator to fire dozens of rounds without having to reload, were used in the Columbine and Sandy Hook shootings.\n70% of the perpetrators of school shootings were under the age of 18, with the median age of 16. More than 85% of the perpetrators of school shootings obtained their firearms from their own homes or from friends or relatives. Targeted school shootings, those occurring for example in the context of a feud, were about three times as common as those that appeared indiscriminate. Most perpetrators of school shootings exhibited no signs of debilitating mental disorder, such as psychosis or schizophrenia, although most mass killers typically have or exhibit signs of depression. On the other hand, Eric Harris was almost certainly a psychopath as noted by the FBI. Between the Columbine massacre and 2015, \"more than 40 people\" were \"charged with Columbine-style plots;\" almost all were white male teenagers and almost all had studied the Columbine attack or cited the Columbine perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold as inspiration.\nAt least 68 schools that experienced a school shooting employed a police officer or security guard; in all but a few, the shooting ended before any intercession. Security guards or resource officers were present during four of the five school shooting incidents with the highest number of dead or injured: Columbine, the 2001 Santana High School shooting in California, the 2018 Marshall County High School shooting in Kentucky, and Stoneman Douglas.\nThere were 11 firearm-related events that occurred at a school or campus in the first 23 days of 2018. As of May 2018, more people, including students and teachers, were killed in 2018 in schools in the United States than were killed in military service for the United States, including both combat and non-combat military service, according to an analysis by \"The Washington Post\". In terms of the year-to-date number of individual deadly school shootings incidents in the United States, early 2018 was much higher than 2017, with 16 in 2018 and four in 2017, through May; the year-to-day through May number of incidents was the highest since 1999. As of May 2018, thirteen school shootings took place on K\u201312 school property in 2018 that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths, including 32 killed and 65 injured, according to \"Education Week\". 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed occurred in the United States in the first 20 weeks of 2018, according to CNN.\nList of school shootings in the United States.\nAs of May 22, 2023, the ten deadliest school shootings in the United States since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in which 14 were killed were the:\nOther school shootings occurring in the United States include the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting in Austin in which 16 were killed; the 2024 Apalachee High School shooting in Winder, Georgia, in which four were killed; the 2001 Santana High School shooting in Santee, California, in which two were killed; the 2018 Marshall County High School shooting in Benton, Kentucky, in which two were killed; and the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in Oxford Township, Michigan, in which four were killed.\nStudies of United States school shootings.\nDuring 1996, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) together with the US Department of Education and the United States Department of Justice, published a review of deaths related to schools occurring as a result of violence, including explicitly \"unintentional firearm-related death\", for the academic years 1992\u20131993 and 1993\u20131994. A second study (Anderson; Kaufman; Simon 2001), a continuation from the 1996 study, was published December 5, and covered the period 1994\u20131999.\nA United States Secret Service study concluded that schools were placing false hope in physical security, when they should be paying more attention to the pre-attack behaviors of students. Zero-tolerance policies and metal detectors \"are unlikely to be helpful,\" the Secret Service researchers found. The researchers focused on questions concerning the reliance on SWAT teams when most attacks are over before police arrive, profiling of students who show warning signs in the absence of a definitive profile, expulsion of students for minor infractions when expulsion is the spark that push some to return to school with a gun, buying software not based on school shooting studies to evaluate threats although killers rarely make direct threats, and reliance on metal detectors and police officers in schools when shooters often make no effort to conceal their weapons.\nIn May 2002, the Secret Service published a report that examined 37 US school shootings. They found:\nFilm.\nThere have been many representations of American school shootings in films and TV shows produced by both United States and international production companies. While films \"Elephant\", \"We Need to Talk about Kevin\", \"Beautiful Boy\", and \"Mass\" are solely focused on the either the act or the aftermath, many of the shows such as \"Criminal Minds\", \"\", \"Law and Order\", and \"One Tree Hill\" investigate the crime for an episode or use it as a plot point for about half a season.\nMusic.\nOne of the more provocative songs to come out of the Parkland, Florida high school shooting was \"thoughts &amp; prayers\" from alternative artist/rapper grandson (born Jordan Benjamin). The song is a critique of politicians sending out their \"thoughts and prayers\" to the victims of the Parkland high school shooting and other mass shootings, accompanied by what he perceives as a consistent resistance to gun control laws.\n\"I Don't Like Mondays\" by Irish new wave band The Boomtown Rats was directly inspired by the 1979 Cleveland Elementary School shooting.\nPolitical impact.\nSchool shootings and other mass killings have had a major political impact. Governments have discussed gun-control laws, to increase time for background checks. Also, bulletproof school supplies have been created, including backpacks, desks, bullet-resistant door panels, and classroom whiteboards (or bulletin boards) which reinforce walls or slide across doors to deflect bullets. The National Rifle Association of America has proposed allowing teachers to carry weapons on school grounds as a means of protecting themselves and others as a possible solution. In 2018, 14 states had at least one school district in which teachers were armed, with another 16 states permitting districts to arm teachers subject to local policy. Most states also require the gun carriers to receive advance permission from the districts' superintendents or trustees. \"In New York State, written permission from the school is required in order to carry a firearm on school grounds.\"\nDue to the political impact, this has spurred some to press for more stringent gun control laws. In the United States, the National Rifle Association is opposed to such laws, and some groups have called for fewer gun control laws, citing cases of armed students ending shootings and halting further loss of life, and claiming that the prohibitions against carrying a gun in schools do not deter the gunmen. One such example is the Mercaz HaRav Massacre, where the attacker was stopped by a student, Yitzhak Dadon, who shot him with his personal firearm which he lawfully carried concealed. At a Virginia law school, there is a disputed claim that three students retrieved pistols from their cars and stopped the attacker without firing a shot. Also, at a Mississippi high school, the vice principal retrieved a firearm from his vehicle and then eventually stopped the attacker as he was driving away from the school. In other cases, such as shootings at Columbine and Red Lake High Schools, the presence of an armed police officer did little to nothing to prevent the killings.\nThe Gun-Free Schools Act was passed in 1994 in response to gun related violence in schools, so many school systems started adopting the Zero-Tolerance Law. The Gun-Free Schools Act required students who bring firearms or bombs to school to be expelled for a year. By 1997, the Zero-Tolerance for any type of weapon was implemented by more than 90 percent of U.S. public schools.\nDonald Trump has repeatedly supported the idea of arming school teachers, particularly those with military backgrounds, arguing that armed educators could respond quickly to attacks and prevent mass casualties. He first proposed this idea after the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and reiterated it following the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The proposal has faced widespread opposition from parents of victims, educators, and gun control advocates.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, school shootings and similar attacks, usually involving melee weapons or improvised explosives, have been on the rise since 2022. Multiple potential explanations exist, including the glorification of American mass murderers leading to a copycat \"globalization\" of such incidents, with the perpetrators often seeking to replicate American attacks. For example, Wellington Menezes de Oliveira, the perpetrator of the Rio de Janeiro school shooting, cited Seung-Hui Cho, the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech shooting, as a \"brother\" and thanked him for his \"bravery\" and \"leading the way\"; The perpetrators of the Suzano school shooting were heavily inspired by the Columbine High School massacre. Other theories include the spread of conspiracy theories, hate speech and extremist propaganda.\nRussia.\nSchool shootings have been on the rise in Russia since the events of the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly attributed to increasing social isolation, school bullying, and a strong military culture, similar to the United States' \"gun culture\". Online groups also praise individuals who commit such attacks, leading to a copycat crime effect. In February 2022, with immediate effect, the Supreme Court of Russia declared such groups as a terrorist movement to combat constant copycat attacks.\nPolice response and countermeasures.\nAnalysis of the Columbine school shooting and other incidents where first responders waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what bystanders and first responders should do. An analysis of 84 mass shooting cases in the US from 2000 to 2010 found that the average response time by police was 3 minutes. In most instances that exceeds the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if people involved in the situation remain passive, or a police response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended by the US Department of Homeland Security that civilians involved in the incident take active steps to evacuate, hide, or counter the shooter and that individual law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter.\nSchool countermeasures.\nArmed classrooms.\nThere has been considerable policy discussion about how to help prevent school and other types of mass shootings. One suggestion that has come up is the idea to allow firearms in the classroom. \"Since the issue of arming teachers is a relatively new topic, it has received little empirical study. Therefore, most of the literature does not come from peer-reviewed sources but rather published news reports. In addition, most of these reports are not objective and clearly appear to support a specific side of the debate.\" So far, data has been inconclusive as to whether or not arming teachers would have any sort of benefit for schools. For years, some areas in the US have allowed \"armed classrooms\" to deter (or truncate) future attacks by changing helpless victims into armed defenders. Advocates of arming teachers claim that it will reduce fatalities in school shootings, but many others disagree.\nMany teachers have had their concerns with the idea of armed classrooms. \"One teacher stated that although she is pro-gun, she does not feel as though she could maintain gun safety on school grounds (Reuters, 2012). Teachers expressed the fear that bigger students could overpower them, take the weapon, and then use it against the teacher or other students.\" Some members of the armed forces have also had concerns with armed classrooms. Police forces in Texas brought up the potential for teachers to leave a gun where a student could retrieve and use it. \"They are further concerned that if every teacher had a gun, there would be an unnecessarily large number of guns in schools (even including elementary schools). This large number of guns could lead to accidental shootings, especially those involving younger children who do not understand what guns do.\"\nTo diminish school shootings there are many preventive measures that can be taken such as:\nIn a 2013 research report published by the Center for Homicide Research, they find that many also reject the idea of having armed classrooms due to what is termed the \"weapons effect\", which is the phenomenon in which simply being in the presence of a weapon can increase feelings of aggression. \"In Berkowitz &amp; LaPage's (1967) examination of this effect, students who were in the presence of a gun reported higher levels of aggressive feelings towards other students and gave more violent evaluations of other students' performance on a simple task in the form of electric shocks. This finding points to possible negative outcomes for students exposed to guns in the classroom (Simons &amp; Turner, 1974; Turner &amp; Simons, 1976).\"\nIn 2008, Harrold Independent School District in Texas became the first public school district in the U.S. to allow teachers with state-issued firearm-carry permits to carry their arms in the classroom; special additional training and ricochet-resistant ammunition were required for participating teachers. Students at the University of Utah have been allowed to carry concealed pistols (so long as they possess the appropriate state license) since a State Supreme Court decision in 2006. In addition to Utah, Wisconsin and Mississippi each have legislation that allow students, faculty and employees with the proper permit, to carry concealed weapons on their public university's campuses. Colorado and Oregon state courts have ruled in favor of Campus Carry laws by denying their universities' proposals to ban guns on campus, ruling that the UC Board of Regents and the Oregon University System did not have the authority to ban weapons on campus. A selective ban was then re-instated, wherein Oregon state universities enacted a ban on guns in school building and sporting events or by anyone contracted with the university in question.\nA commentary in the conservative \"National Review Online\" argues that the armed school approach for preventing school attacks, while new in the US, has been used successfully for many years in Israel and Thailand. Teachers and school officials in Israel are allowed and encouraged to carry firearms if they have former military experience in the IDF, which almost all do. Statistics on what percentage of teachers are actually armed are unavailable and in Israel, for example, the intent is to counter politically motivated terrorist attacks on high value, soft targets, not personal defense against, or protection from, unbalanced individual students.\nThe National Rifle Association has explicitly called for placing armed guards in all American schools. However, Steven Strauss, a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, offered a preliminary calculation that placing armed guards in every American school might cost as much as $15 billion/year, and perhaps only save 10 lives per year (at a cost of $1.5 billion/life saved).\nGun storage and mental health treatment.\nTwo main reasons given for abandoning their plans by students who planned a shooting but didn't carry it out, were that they couldn't access a gun and that someone helped them find hope during a personal crisis.\nOne common way for students to access guns (especially for those too young to purchase them legally) is to take a firearm otherwise legally possessed by a household member. For example, a shooting in Sparks, Nevada on October 21, 2013, left a teacher and the shooter, a twelve-year-old student, dead with two seriously injured. The handgun used in the shooting had been taken from the shooter's home. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Red Lake High School in Red Lake, Minnesota in 2005, and Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 also involved legal guns taken from the home.\nIncreasing the security of firearm storage is thus proposed as a preventative measure for school shootings. A 2000 study of firearm storage in the United States found that \"from the homes with children and firearms, 55% reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place\". 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock and in an unlocked place. A 2005 study on adult firearm storage practices in the United States found that over 1.69 million youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Also, 73% of children under age 10 living in homes with guns reported knowing the location of their parents' firearms.\nMost states have laws designed to prevent children from accessing firearms, varying in severity. The toughest laws enforce criminal liability when a minor achieves access to a carelessly stored firearm. The weakest forbid people from directly providing a firearm to a minor. In between the two extremes is a law that enforces criminal liability for carelessly stored firearms, but only where the minor uses the firearm and causes death or serious injury. Another intermediate law enforces liability only in the event of reckless, knowing or deliberate behavior by the adult.\nIn 2019, the United States Secret Service released an analysis of targeted school violence, concluding the best practice for prevention was forming a \"multidisciplinary threat assessment team, in conjunction with the appropriate policies, tools, and training\". An earlier report published in 2018 concluded there was no single profile of a student attacker, and emphasized the importance of the threat assessment process instead. The threat assessment process described includes gathering information about student behaviors, negative or stressful events, and what resources are available for the student to overcome those challenges.\nCountermeasures.\nIn 2015, Southwestern High School in Shelbyville, Indiana, was portrayed as possibly the \"safest school in America\". The school has been used as a \"Safe School Flagship\" of possible countermeasures to an active shooter.\nOther countermeasures include tools like doorjambs, rapidly-deployable tourniquets, and ballistic protection systems like the CoverMe-Seat.\nIn 2019, Fruitport High School in Michigan became the first school in the U.S. to be rebuilt with concrete barriers in hallways for students to hide from bullets. The BBC also reports the \"hallways are curved to prevent a shooter from having a clear line of sight during any potential attack.\" Classrooms have been redesigned so students can hide more easily. Costing $48 million to rebuild, Bob Szymoniak, Fruitport High School's superintendent, believes these alterations will become part of the structure of all U.S. schools. \"These are design elements that are naturally part of buildings going into the future.\"\nThe STOP School Violence Act is pending legislation to provide funding grants to schools to be used for implementing security measures.\nAftermath.\nAfter experiencing the threat of a school shooting, as well as the changes in the school via countermeasures, students continue to experience trauma. Mass shootings can bring on the onset of PTSD and continued depression. In the cities that are home to these kind of events, the town can experience continued paranoia and a hightened sense of fear.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It remains the deadliest mass shooting in British history.\nFollowing the killings, public debate centred on gun control laws, including public petitions for a ban on private ownership of handguns and an official inquiry, which produced the 1996 Cullen Report. \nThe incident led to a public campaign, known as the Snowdrop Petition, which helped bring about legislation, specifically two new Firearms Acts, which prohibited the private ownership of most handguns in Great Britain. The UK Government instituted a buyback programme which provided compensation to licensed owners.\nShooting.\nAt about 8:15\u00a0a.m. on 13 March 1996, Thomas Hamilton, aged 43, was seen scraping ice off his van outside his home at Kent Road in Stirling. He left soon afterwards and drove about north to Dunblane. Hamilton arrived on the grounds of Dunblane Primary School at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. and parked his van near a telegraph pole in the car park of the school. He cut the telephone cables at the bottom of the telegraph pole which served nearby houses, before making his way across the car park towards the school buildings.\nHamilton headed towards the north-west side of the school to a door near the toilets and the school gymnasium. After entering, he made his way to the gymnasium armed with four legally-held handguns\u2014two 9mm Browning HP pistols and two Smith &amp; Wesson M19 .357 Magnum revolvers. Hamilton was also carrying 743 ammunition cartridges, consisting of 501 9\u00a0mm cartridges and 242 .357 Magnum cartridges. In the gym was a class of 28 Primary 1 pupils preparing for a P.E. lesson in the presence of three adult members of staff.\nBefore entering the gymnasium, it is believed Hamilton fired two shots into the stage of the assembly hall and the girls' toilet.\nHamilton started shooting rapidly and randomly. He shot P.E. teacher Eileen Harrild who was injured in her arms and chest as she attempted to protect herself and continued shooting into the gym. Harrild stumbled into the open-plan store cupboard at the side of the gym along with several injured children. Gwen Mayor, the teacher of the Primary 1 class, was shot and killed instantly. The other adult present, Mary Blake, a supervisory assistant, was shot in the head and both legs but also managed to make her way to the store cupboard with several of the children in front of her.\nFrom entering the gymnasium and walking a few steps, Hamilton fired 29 shots with one of the pistols, killed one child, and injured several others. Four injured children had taken shelter in the store cupboard along with the injured Harrild and Blake. Hamilton then moved up the east side of the gym, firing six shots as he walked, and then fired eight shots towards the opposite end of the gym. He then went towards the centre of the gym, firing 16 shots at point-blank range at a group of children who had been incapacitated by his earlier shots.\nA Primary 7 pupil who was walking along the west side of the gymnasium exterior at the time heard loud bangs and screams and looked inside. Hamilton shot in his direction and the pupil was injured by flying glass before running away. From this position, Hamilton fired 24 shots in various directions. He fired shots towards a window next to the fire exit at the southeast end of the gym, possibly at an adult who was walking across the playground, and then fired four more shots in the same direction after opening the fire exit door. Hamilton then exited the gym briefly through the fire exit, firing another four shots towards the cloakroom of the library, striking and injuring Grace Tweddle, another member of staff at the school.\nIn the mobile classroom closest to the fire exit where Hamilton was standing, Catherine Gordon saw him firing shots and instructed her Primary 7 class to get down onto the floor before Hamilton fired nine bullets into the classroom, striking books and equipment. One bullet passed through a chair where a child had been sitting seconds before. Hamilton then re-entered the gym, dropped the pistol he was using, and took out one of the two revolvers.\nHe put the barrel of the gun in his mouth, pointed it upwards, and pulled the trigger, killing himself. A total of 32 people sustained gunshot wounds inflicted by Hamilton over a 3\u20134 minute period, 16 of whom were fatally wounded in the gymnasium, including Gwen Mayor and 15 of her pupils. One other child died en route to hospital.\nThe first call to the police was made at 9:41\u00a0a.m. by the headmaster of the school Ronald Taylor, who had been alerted by assistant headmistress Agnes Awlson to the possibility of a gunman on the school premises. Awlson had told Taylor that she had heard screaming inside the gymnasium and had seen what she thought to be cartridges on the ground, and Taylor had been aware of loud noises which he assumed to have been from builders on site that he had not been informed of. As he was on his way to the gym, the shooting ended and when he saw what had happened he ran back to his office and told deputy headmistress Fiona Eadington to call for ambulances, a call which was made at 9:43\u00a0a.m.\nThe first ambulance arrived on the scene at 9:57\u00a0a.m. in response to the call made at 9:43\u00a0a.m. Another medical team from Dunblane Health Centre arrived at 10:04\u00a0a.m. which included doctors and a nurse, who were involved in the initial resuscitation of the injured. Medical teams from the health centres in Doune and Callander arrived shortly after. The accident and emergency department at Stirling Royal Infirmary had also been informed of a major incident involving multiple casualties at 9:48\u00a0a.m. and the first of several medical teams from the hospital arrived at 10:15\u00a0a.m. Another medical team from the Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary arrived at 10:35\u00a0a.m.\nBy about 11:10\u00a0a.m., all of the injured had been taken to Stirling Royal Infirmary for medical treatment. Upon examination, several of the patients were transferred to the District Royal Infirmary in Falkirk and some to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.\nThe shooter fired 106 shots in total during the massacre, including the suicide shot. 105 were fired by one of his Browning pistols, and the final shot was fired with one of his Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers. Out of the twenty-five 20-round 9mm magazines that the shooter brought to the school, four were empty and three were partially empty.\nPerpetrator.\nThomas Watt Hamilton was born as Thomas Watt Jr. on 10 May 1952 in Glasgow, the son of Thomas Watt Sr., a bus driver, and Agnes Graham Hamilton, a hotel chambermaid. When Hamilton was 18 months old, his father abandoned the family for another woman, after which his parents divorced and his father had no contact with him thereafter. Thomas' maternal grandparents, James and Catherine Hamilton, raised Thomas as their son, legally adopting him and changing his name to Thomas Watt Hamilton. The family relocated to Stirling when Hamilton was a young boy. He was made to believe that his maternal grandparents were his actual parents, and that his mother was his older sister. Hamilton's grandparents told Thomas the truth when he was around 22 years old, which reportedly had a lasting psychological impact on him. He began working in youth organisations. As the head of several youth clubs, Hamilton had been the subject of several complaints to police regarding inappropriate behaviour towards young boys, including claims that he had taken photographs of semi-naked boys without parental consent. He had briefly been a Scout leader \u2013 in July 1973 at age 21, he had been appointed assistant leader with the 4th/6th Stirling troop of the Scout Association. Later that year, he was seconded as leader to the 24th Stirlingshire troop, which was being revived. Several complaints were made about Hamilton's leadership, including complaints about Scouts being forced to sleep in close proximity to him inside his van during hill-walking expeditions. Within months, on 13 May 1974, Hamilton's Scout Warrant was withdrawn, with the County Commissioner stating that he was \"suspicious of his moral intentions towards boys\". He was blacklisted by the Association and thwarted in a later attempt he made to become a Scout leader in Clackmannanshire.\nHamilton claimed in letters that local rumours regarding his behaviour towards young boys had led to the failure of his business in 1993, and that, in the last months of his life, he had complained that his attempts to organise a boys' club were subjected to persecution by local police and the Scout movement. Among those he complained to were Queen Elizabeth II and his local Member of Parliament (MP), Michael Forsyth (Conservative). In the 1980s, another MP, George Robertson (Labour), who lived in Dunblane, had complained to Forsyth about Hamilton's local boys' club, which his son had attended. On the day after the massacre, Robertson spoke of having previously argued with Hamilton \"in my own home\".\nOn 19 March 1996, six days after the massacre, Hamilton's body was cremated. According to a police spokesman, this service was conducted \"far away from\" Dunblane.\nSubsequent legislation.\nThe Cullen Reports, the result of the inquiry into the Dunblane massacre, recommended that the Government of the United Kingdom introduce tighter controls on handgun ownership and consider whether an outright ban on private ownership would be in the public interest in the alternative (though club ownership would be maintained). The report also recommended changes in school security and vetting of people working with children under 18. The Home Affairs Select Committee agreed with the need for restrictions on gun ownership but stated that a handgun ban was not appropriate.\nAn advocacy group, the six-member Gun Control Network, was founded in the aftermath of the massacre and was supported by some parents of the victims of the Dunblane and Hungerford massacres shootings. Bereaved families and others also campaigned for a ban on private gun ownership.\nIn response to public debate, the Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned all cartridge ammunition handguns with the exception of .22 calibre rimfire in England, Scotland, and Wales. Following the 1997 United Kingdom general election, the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, banning the remaining .22 cartridge handguns as well. This left only muzzle-loading and historic handguns legal as well as certain sporting handguns (e.g. \"Long-Arms\") and long-barrelled handguns that fall outside the minimum barrel and overall length dimensions in the Firearms Act 1968, as amended.\nThis handgun ban did not apply to Northern Ireland, where it remains legal for citizens to own handguns for target shooting (if they hold a firearms licence) and, for self-defence, if the owner holds a personal protection weapon permit, almost 3000 of which were on issue as of 2012. \nEvidence of previous police interaction with Hamilton was presented to the Cullen Inquiry but was later sealed under a closure order to prevent publication for 100 years. The official reason for sealing the documents was to protect the identities of children, but this led to accusations of a coverup intended to protect the reputations of officials. Following a review of the closure order by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, edited versions of some of the documents were released to the public in October 2005. Four files containing post-mortems, medical records and profiles on the victims, as well as Hamilton's post-mortem, remained sealed under the 100-year order to avoid distressing the relatives and survivors.\nThe released documents revealed that in 1991 complaints against Hamilton were made to the Central Scotland Police and were investigated by the Child Protection Unit. He was reported to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of ten charges, including assault, obstructing police and contravention of the Children and Young Persons Act 1937. Reports from serving police officers stated that he was unsuitable to own firearms; no action was taken.\nMedia coverage.\nTwo books \u2013 \"Dunblane: Our Year of Tears\" by Peter Samson and Alan Crow and \"Dunblane: Never Forget\" by Mick North \u2013 both give accounts of the massacre from the perspective of those most directly affected. In 2009, the \"Sunday Express\" was criticised for an inappropriate article about the survivors of the massacre, thirteen years after the event.\nOn the Sunday following the shootings the morning service from Dunblane Cathedral, conducted by Colin MacIntosh, was broadcast live by the BBC. The BBC also transmitted the 9 October 1996 memorial service live from Dunblane Cathedral. A documentary series, \"Crimes That Shook Britain\", discussed the massacre. The documentary \"Dunblane: Remembering our Children\", which featured many of the parents of the children who had been killed, was broadcast by STV and ITV at the time of the first anniversary. \"In Cold Blood\", a 1997 documentary exploring the psychology behind mass killings, examined the men behind the mass shootings in Dunblane, Aramoana, New Zealand and Port Arthur, Tasmania \u2014 and found common traits in the three murderers. At the time of the tenth anniversary in March 2006 two documentaries were broadcast: Channel 5 screened \"Dunblane\u00a0\u2014 A Decade On\" and BBC Scotland showed \"Remembering Dunblane\". On 9 March 2016 relatives of the victims spoke in a BBC Scotland documentary entitled \"Dunblane: Our Story\" to mark the twentieth anniversary. A 2018 Netflix documentary, \"\", directed by Kim A. Snyder, drew comparison with the Sandy Hook massacre in the US by exploring the grief and friendship between the two priests serving the affected communities at the times of the respective shootings. On 11 March 2021, ITV aired a special documentary to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary: \"Return to Dunblane with Lorraine Kelly\" in which the presenter revisited the town, speaking with the victims' families and emergency aid workers.\nFuture tennis players Andy Murray and his brother Jamie, who both attended Dunblane Primary School at the time, were at the school during the massacre; Andy took cover in a classroom. In 2019, Andy said he had been too young to understand what was happening and is generally reluctant to talk about it in interviews.\nMemorials and tributes.\nTwo days after the shooting, a vigil and prayer session was held at Dunblane Cathedral which was attended by people of all faiths. On Mothering Sunday, on 17 March, Queen Elizabeth II and her daughter Anne, Princess Royal, attended a memorial service at Dunblane Cathedral.\nSeven months after the massacre, in October 1996, the families of the victims organised their own memorial service at Dunblane Cathedral, which more than 600 people attended, including Prince Charles. The service was broadcast live on BBC1 and conducted by James Whyte, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Television presenter Lorraine Kelly, who had befriended some of the victims' families whilst reporting on the massacre for \"GMTV\", was a guest speaker at the service.\nIn August 1997, two varieties of rose were unveiled and planted as the centrepiece for a roundabout in Dunblane. The two roses were developed by Cockers Roses of Aberdeen; the 'Gwen Mayor' rose and 'Innocence' rose, in memory of the children killed. A snowdrop cultivar, originally found in a Dunblane garden in the 1970s, was renamed 'Sophie North' in memory of one of the victims of the massacre.\nThe gymnasium at the school was demolished on 11 April 1996 and replaced by a memorial garden. Two years after the massacre, on 14 March 1998, a memorial garden was opened at Dunblane Cemetery, where Mayor and twelve of the children who were killed are buried. The garden features a fountain with a plaque of the names of those killed. Stained glass windows in memory of the victims were placed in three local churches, St Blane's and the Church of the Holy Family in Dunblane and the nearby Lecropt Kirk as well as at the Dunblane Youth and Community Centre.\nNewton Primary School awards The Gwen Mayor Rosebowl to a pupil every year. A charity, the Gwen Mayor Trust, was set up by the Educational Institute of Scotland to provide funding for projects in Scottish primary schools.\nThe National Association of Primary Education commissioned a sculpture, \"Flame for Dunblane\", created by Walter Bailey from a single yew tree, which was placed in the National Forest, near Moira, Leicestershire.\nThe nave of Dunblane Cathedral has a standing stone by the monumental sculptor Richard Kindersley. It was commissioned by the Kirk Session as the cathedral's commemoration and dedicated at a service on 12 March 2001. It is a Clashach stone two metres high on a Caithness flagstone base. The quotations on the stone are by E. V. Rieu (\"He called a little child to him...\"), Richard Henry Stoddard (\"...the spirit of a little child\"), Bayard Taylor (\"But still I dream that somewhere there must be The spirit of a child that waits for me\") and W. H. Auden (\"We are linked as children in a circle dancing\").\nWith the consent of Bob Dylan, the musician Ted Christopher wrote a new verse for \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" in memory of the Dunblane school children and their teacher. The recording of the revised version of the song, which included brothers and sisters of the victims singing the chorus and Mark Knopfler on guitar, was released on 9 December 1996 in the UK, and reached number 1. The proceeds went to charities for children.\nPipe Major Robert Mathieson of the Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band composed a pipe tune in tribute, \"The Bells of Dunblane\".\nScottish composer James MacMillan created a choral work, \"A Child's Prayer\", as a tribute to the dead at Dunblane.\nEnglish punk rock band U.K. Subs released a song called \"Dunblane\" on their 1997 album \"Quintessentials\", with the chorus \"After Dunblane how can you hold a gun and say you're innocent?\"\nGwen Mayor was honoured with the award of the Elizabeth Emblem in 2025. The emblem is awarded by the monarch to the next of kin of public servants killed while performing their duties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not currently a part of the Constitution, though its ratification status has long been debated. It was written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman and first introduced in Congress in December 1923. With the rise of the women's movement in the United States during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by Representative Martha Griffiths in 1971, it was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives that year, and by the U.S. Senate in 1972, thus submitting the ERA to the state legislatures for ratification, as provided by Article Five of the United States Constitution. A seven-year, 1979, deadline was included with the legislation by Congress. A simple majority of Congress later extended the deadline to 1982. Both deadlines passed with the ERA three short of the necessary 38\u00a0states for ratification. Even so, there are ongoing efforts to ratify the amendment.\nThe purpose of the ERA is to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex. In the early history of the Equal Rights Amendment, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, arguing that women should hold more domestic responsibility than men and that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. Proponents asserted it would end legal distinctions between men and women in matters including divorce, property, and employment. Opponents have argued that it would remove protections from women and open women to be drafted into the military.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nResolution text.\nThe resolution, \"Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women\", reads, in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled\" (\"two-thirds of each House concurring therein\"), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\"ARTICLE \u2014\n\"Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n\"Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\"Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.\"\nHistory.\nEarly history (1920s\u20131940s).\nOn September 25, 1921, the National Woman's Party announced its plans to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to guarantee women equal rights with men. The text of the proposed amendment read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlice Paul, the head of the National Women's Party, believed that the Nineteenth Amendment would not be enough to ensure that men and women were treated equally regardless of sex. In 1923, at Seneca Falls, New York, she revised the proposed amendment to read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPaul named this version the Lucretia Mott Amendment, after a female abolitionist who fought for women's rights and attended the First Women's Rights Convention. The proposal was seconded by Dr. Frances Dickinson, a cousin of Susan B. Anthony.\nFollowing its introduction in 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was reintroduced in each subsequent Congress, but made little progress.\nIn 1943, Alice Paul further revised the amendment to reflect the wording of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. This text would later become Section 1 of the version passed by Congress in 1972.\nAs a result of this revision, ERA opponents proposed an alternative in the 1940s. This alternative provided that \"no distinctions on the basis of sex shall be made except such as are reasonably justified by differences in physical structure, biological differences, or social function.\" It was quickly rejected by both pro- and anti-ERA coalitions.\nWhen the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted in 1868, the Equal Protection Clause, which guarantees equal protection of the laws, did not apply to women. It was not until 1972 that the United States Supreme Court extended equal protection to sex-based discrimination. However, women have never been entitled to full equal protection as the Court subsequently ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to an intermediate standard of judicial review, a less stringent standard than that applied to other forms of discrimination.\nSplit among feminists.\nSince the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among feminists about the meaning of women's equality. Alice Paul and her National Woman's Party asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting. Opponents of the amendment, such as the Women's Joint Congressional Committee, believed that the loss of these benefits to women would not be worth the supposed gain to them in equality. In 1924, \"The Forum\" hosted a debate between Doris Stevens and Alice Hamilton concerning the two perspectives on the proposed amendment. Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches toward gender equality. One approach emphasized the common humanity of women and men, while the other stressed women's unique experiences and how they were different from men, seeking recognition for specific needs. The opposition to the ERA was led by Mary Anderson and the Women's Bureau beginning in 1923. These feminists argued that legislation including mandated minimum wages, safety regulations, restricted daily and weekly hours, lunch breaks, and maternity provisions would be more beneficial to the majority of women who were forced to work out of economic necessity, not personal fulfillment. The debate also drew from struggles between working class and professional women. Alice Hamilton, in her speech \"Protection for Women Workers\", said that the ERA would strip working women of the small protections they had achieved, leaving them powerless to further improve their condition in the future, or to attain necessary protections in the present.\nThe National Woman's Party already had tested its approach in Wisconsin, where it won passage of the Wisconsin Equal Rights Law in 1921. The party then took the ERA to Congress, where U.S. senator Charles Curtis, a future vice president of the United States, introduced it for the first time in October 1921. Although the ERA was introduced in every congressional session between 1921 and 1972, it almost never reached the floor of either the Senate or the House for a vote. Instead, it was usually blocked in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35\u2014not receiving the required two-thirds supermajority.\nPost-World War II developments (1940s\u20131960s).\nWorld War II was correlated with a rise supporters of the ERA. Due to the war, many women had to take on untraditional roles at home and in the workforce. Protectionists were against the ERA because they believed women need to be treated differently than men, because they are biologically different. Women entered the workforce and proved they could handle working the same jobs as men, including joining the U.S. Armed Forces. Women were supporting their country, despite not being compensated or respected fairly. With the increased patriotism in the country people began to see the value of women being involved in their country. As the war continued, more opportunities for women to work opened up due to fewer men being available. The support for equality grew with this as women continued to prove their ability and willingness to work.\nInitial support from the Republican Party and the Hayden rider.\nThe Republican Party included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in 1940, renewing the plank every four years until 1980. The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women, while some Southern Democrats also supported it.\nIn 1950 and 1953, the ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as \"the Hayden rider\", introduced by Arizona senator Carl Hayden. The Hayden rider added a sentence to the ERA to keep special protections for women: \"The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex.\" By allowing women to keep their existing and future special protections, it was expected that the ERA would be more appealing to its opponents. Though opponents were marginally more in favor of the ERA with the Hayden rider, supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment's original purpose\u2014causing the amendment not to be passed in the House.\nERA supporters were hopeful that the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower would advance their agenda. Eisenhower had publicly promised to \"assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights,\" and in 1958, Eisenhower asked a joint session of Congress to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first president to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, the National Woman's Party found the amendment to be unacceptable and asked it to be withdrawn whenever the Hayden rider was added to the ERA.\nInitial opposition from the New Deal Democrats.\nEleanor Roosevelt and most New Dealers opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle-class women, but that working-class women needed government protection. They also feared that the ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the New Deal coalition. Most Northern Democrats, who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.\nThe ERA was also opposed by the American Federation of Labor and other labor unions, which feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. The League of Women Voters, formerly the National American Woman Suffrage Association, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.\nAt the 1944 Democratic National Convention, the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but this was a hotly contested change not reflected in later party platforms. At the Democratic National Convention in 1960, a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it was opposed by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the AFL-CIO, labor unions such as the American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the American Nurses Association, the Women's Division of the Methodist Church, and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.\nBetween 1948 and 1970, chairman Emanuel Celler of the House Judiciary Committee refused to consider the ERA in the House of Representatives.\nSupport from the Democratic Party under Kennedy.\nPresidential candidate John F. Kennedy announced his support of the ERA in an October 21, 1960, letter to the chairman of the National Woman's Party. Ultimately however, as president, Kennedy's ties to labor unions meant that he and his administration did not support the ERA.\nKennedy did appoint a blue-ribbon commission on women, the President's Commission on the Status of Women, to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The commission was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it publicly. In the early 1960s, Eleanor Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that, as far as she was concerned, they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However, she never went so far as to endorse the ERA. The commission that she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed, believing that the Supreme Court could give sex the same \"suspect\" test as race and national origin, through interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The Supreme Court did not provide the \"suspect\" class test for sex, however, resulting in a continuing lack of equal rights. The commission did, though, help win passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which banned sex discrimination in wages in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions that it initially excluded) and secured an executive order from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the civil service. The commission, composed largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed.\nThe national commission spurred the establishment of state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of Alice Paul and Coretta Scott King and the political influence of Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan.\nImpact of second-wave feminism.\nA new women's movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: Betty Friedan's bestseller \"The Feminine Mystique\"; the network of women's rights commissions formed by Kennedy's national commission; the frustration over women's social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in Washington, D.C., Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the National Organization for Women (NOW) to act as an \"NAACP for women\", demanding full equality for American women and men. In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment. The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the Women's Equity Action League (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership. By the late 1960s, NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly elected representative Shirley Chisholm of New York gave her famous speech \"Equal Rights for Women\" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nViews.\nIn support.\nSupporters of the ERA point to the lack of a specific guarantee in the Constitution for equal rights protections on the basis of sex. In 1973, future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg summarized a supporting argument for the ERA in the \"American Bar Association Journal\":The equal rights amendment, in sum, would dedicate the nation to a new view of the rights and responsibilities of men and women. It firmly rejects sharp legislative lines between the sexes as constitutionally tolerable. Instead, it looks toward a legal system in which each person will be judged on the basis of individual merit and not on the basis of an unalterable trait of birth that bears no necessary relationship to need or ability.\nLater, Ginsburg voiced her opinion that the best course of action on the Equal Rights Amendment is to start over, due to being past its expiration date. While at a discussion at Georgetown University in February 2020, Ginsburg noted the challenge that \"if you count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard states that said 'we've changed our minds?'\"\nIn the early 1940s, both the Democratic and Republican parties added support for the ERA to their platforms.\nThe National Organization for Women (NOW) and ERAmerica, a coalition of almost 80 organizations, led the pro-ERA efforts. Between 1972 and 1982, ERA supporters held rallies, petitioned, picketed, went on hunger strikes, and performed acts of civil disobedience. On July 9, 1978, NOW and other organizations hosted a national march in Washington, D.C., which garnered over 100,000 supporters, and was followed by a Lobby Day on July 10. On June 6, 1982, NOW sponsored marches in states that had not passed the ERA including Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. Key feminists of the time, such as Gloria Steinem, spoke out in favor of the ERA, arguing that ERA opposition was based on gender myths that overemphasized difference and ignored evidence of unequal treatment between men and women. A more militant feminist group, Grassroots Group of Second Class Citizens, organized a series of non-violent direct action tactics in support of the ERA in Illinois in 1982.\nIt has been noted that many African-American women have supported the ERA. One prominent female supporter was New York representative Shirley Chisholm. On August 10, 1970, she gave a speech on the ERA called \"For the Equal Rights Amendment\" in Washington, D.C. In her address, she claimed that sex discrimination had become widespread and that the ERA would remedy it. She also claimed that laws to protect women in the workforce from unsafe working conditions would be needed by men, too, and thus the ERA would help all people. By 1976, 60% of African-American women and 63% of African-American men were in favor of the ERA, and the legislation was supported by organizations such as the NAACP, National Council of Negro Women, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, National Association of Negro Business, and the National Black Feminist Organization.\nThe ERA has been supported by several Republican women including Florence Dwyer, Jill Ruckelshaus, Mary Dent Crisp, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, First Lady Betty Ford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith. Support from Republican men has included President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Richard Nixon, Senator Richard Lugar and Senator Strom Thurmond.\nIn opposition.\nMany opponents of the ERA focus on the importance of traditional gender roles. They argued that the amendment would guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to conscription and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional gender roles proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative Republican activist from Missouri, used traditional symbols of the American housewife. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, \"Preserve us from a Congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham\" and \"I am for Mom and apple pie.\" They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases. It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed. Women who supported traditional gender roles started to oppose the ERA. Schlafly said passage of the amendment would threaten Social Security benefits for housewives. Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that women's colleges would have to admit men. Schlafly's argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.\nAt the 1980 Republican National Convention, the Republican Party platform was amended to end its support for the ERA. The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Schlafly. Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often attempt to incite feminists by opening her speeches with lines such as, \"I'd like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight\u2014I always like to say that, because it makes the libs so mad.\" When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%. Public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as its opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.\nPhyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat. Political scientist Jane Mansbridge in her history of the ERA argues that the draft issue was the single most powerful argument used by Schlafly and the other opponents to defeat ERA. Mansbridge concluded, \"Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed\u2014rightly in my view\u2014that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly's early and effective effort to organize potential opponents.\" Legal scholar Joan C. Williams maintained, \"ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles.\" Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo asserted:\nAs moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA's defeat seriously damaged the women's movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change... Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.\nThe John Birch Society and its members organized opposition to the ERA in multiple states. According to Professor Edward H. Miller, the group played a key role in addition to Schlafly in preventing the amendment's ratification.\nMany ERA supporters blamed their defeat on special interest forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting that they had funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority. Such supporters argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, labor feminists and (until 1973) the AFL\u2013CIO. Steinem blamed the insurance industry and said Schlafly \"did not change one vote.\" Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry. Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong backing among Southern whites, Evangelical Christians, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, including both men and women.\nThe ERA has long been opposed by anti-abortion groups who believe it would be interpreted to allow legal abortion without limits and taxpayer funding for abortion.\nPublic opinion.\nPublic viewpoints on the amendment varied considerably by region, with a poll from April 1975 finding 62 percent support in the East, and only 41 percent in the South. The poll, conducted by Harris, also found that men favored the amendment 8% more than women did.\nCongressional passage (1970\u20131972).\nIn February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide Women's Strike for Equality protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality. Said Betty Friedan of the strike, \"All kinds of women's groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the Equal Rights Amendment.\" Despite being centered in New York City\u2014which was regarded as one of the biggest strongholds for NOW and other groups sympathetic to the women's liberation movement such as Redstockings\u2014and having a small number of participants in contrast to the large-scale anti-war and civil rights protests that had occurred in the recent time prior to the event, the strike was credited as one of the biggest turning points in the rise of second-wave feminism.\nIn Washington, D.C., protesters presented a sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment at the U.S. Capitol. Influential news sources such as \"Time\" also supported the cause of the protestors. Soon after the strike took place, activists distributed literature across the country as well. In 1970, congressional hearings began on the ERA.\nOn August 10, 1970, Michigan Democrat Martha Griffiths successfully brought the Equal Rights Amendment to the House floor, after 15 years of the joint resolution having languished in the House Judiciary Committee. The joint resolution passed in the House and continued on to the Senate, which voted for the ERA with an added clause that women would be exempt from the military. The 91st Congress, however, ended before the joint resolution could progress any further.\nGriffiths reintroduced the ERA, and achieved success on Capitol Hill with her , which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas (For), 24 nays (Against) and 51 not voting. Griffiths's joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate\u2014without change\u2014on March 22, 1972, by a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting. The Senate version, drafted by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, passed after the defeat of an amendment proposed by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina that would have exempted women from the draft. President Richard Nixon immediately endorsed the ERA's approval upon its passage by the 92nd Congress.\nRatification in the state legislatures.\nRatifications.\nOn March 22, 1972, the ERA was placed before the state legislatures, with a seven-year deadline to acquire ratification by three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures. A majority of states ratified the proposed constitutional amendment within a year. Hawaii became the first state to ratify the ERA, which it did on the same day the amendment was approved by Congress: The U.S. Senate's vote on took place in the mid-to-late afternoon in Washington, D.C., when it was still midday in Hawaii. The Hawaii Senate and House of Representatives voted their approval shortly after noon Hawaii Standard Time.\nDuring 1972, a total of 22 state legislatures ratified the amendment and eight more joined in early 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the approaching March 22, 1979, deadline.\nThe ERA was ratified by the following states prior to the initial March 22, 1979, deadline:\nThe ERA has been ratified by the following states since the March 22, 1979, deadline:\nRatification resolutions have also been defeated in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\nRescinding ratification.\nSix state legislatures (noted above) have rescinded their earlier ratification of the ERA. Article V of the Constitution is silent as to whether a state may rescind, or otherwise revoke, a previous ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment while it is pending before the states. The rescinding of a ratification of a constitutional amendment has occurred previously. In the 1860s, a few states voted to rescind their ratifications for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. On both occasions however, these actions were rejected and the original ratification was counted when the federal government tallied the total states that had ratified the amendment.\nIn February 2024, the American Bar Association (ABA) passed resolution 601, supporting implementation of the ERA. The ABA urges implementation stating that a deadline for ratification of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is not consistent with Article V of the Constitution and that under Article V, states are not permitted to rescind prior ratifications.\nResearchers at Columbia Law School's Center for Gender and Sexuality Law have written that \"[t]he Constitution says nothing about whether a state can rescind or revoke its ratification of a Constitutional Amendment, either before the ratification process has been completed or after.\" Advocates and scholars dispute whether ratification is a one-time event, once done it cannot be undone as the Constitution only provides for ratification, not unratification.\nSunsetting ratifications.\nSouth Dakota (pre-1979 deadline).\nAmong those rejecting Congress's claim to even hold authority to extend a previously established ratification deadline, the South Dakota Legislature adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979. The joint resolution stipulated that South Dakota's 1973 ERA ratification would be \"sunsetted\" as of the original deadline, March 22, 1979. South Dakota's 1979 sunset joint resolution declared: \"the Ninety-fifth Congress ex post facto has sought unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions in such a way as to materially affect the congressionally established time period for ratification\" (designated as \"POM-93\" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the \"Congressional Record\" of March 13, 1979, at pages 4861 and 4862).\nThe action on the part of South Dakota lawmakers\u2014occurring 21 days prior to originally agreed-upon deadline of March 22, 1979\u2014could be viewed as slightly different from a rescission. notes that \"[f]our states had rescinded their ratifications [of the ERA] and a fifth had declared that its ratification would be void unless the amendment was ratified within the original time limit\", with a footnote identifying South Dakota as that \"fifth\" state.\nNorth Dakota (post-1979 deadline).\nOn March 19, 2021, North Dakota state lawmakers adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4010 to retroactively clarify that North Dakota's 1975 ratification of the ERA was valid only through \"11:59 p.m. on March 22, 1979\" and went on to proclaim that North Dakota \"should not be counted by Congress, the Archivist of the United States, lawmakers in any other state, any court of law, or any other person, as still having on record a live ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as was offered by House Joint Resolution No. 208 of the 92nd Congress on March 22, 1972\". The resolution was formally received by the U.S. Senate on April 20, 2021, was designated as \"POM-10\", was referred to the Senate's Judiciary Committee, and its full and complete verbatim text was published at page S2066 of the \"Congressional Record\".\nRatification deadline and extension.\nCongressional action.\nThe original joint resolution (), by which the 92nd Congress proposed the amendment to the states, was prefaced by the following resolving clause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States \"within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress\": [emphasis added]\nAs the joint resolution was passed on March 22, 1972, this effectively set March 22, 1979, as the deadline for the amendment to be ratified by the requisite number of states. However, the 92nd Congress did not incorporate any time limit into the body of the actual text of the proposed amendment, as had been done with a number of other proposed amendments.\nIn 1978, as the original 1979 deadline approached, the 95th Congress adopted , by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of New York (House: August; Senate: October 6; signing of the President: October 20), which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. H.J.Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a simple majority, not a supermajority) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H.J.Res. 638 be transmitted to then-President Jimmy Carter for signature as a safety precaution. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Hollingsworth v. Virginia\" (1798) that the President of the United States has no formal role in the passing of constitutional amendments. Carter signed the joint resolution, although he noted, on strictly procedural grounds, the irregularity of his doing so given the Supreme Court's decision in 1798. During this disputed extension of slightly more than three years, no additional states ratified or rescinded.\nThe purported extension of ERA's ratification deadline was vigorously contested in 1978 as scholars were divided as to whether Congress actually has authority to revise a previously agreed-to deadline for the states to act upon a constitutional amendment. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102\u201371 in favor, but Illinois' internal parliamentary rules required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters, known as the Grassroots Group of Second Class Citizens, went on a fast known as Women Hunger for Justice and seventeen chained themselves to the entrance of the Illinois Senate chamber. Sonia Johnson, Zoe Nicholson and Sister Maureen Feidler all participated in the fast. The closest that the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979, and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the Florida House of Representatives on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the Florida Senate by a vote of 16 to 22. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38. Many ERA supporters mourned the failure of the amendment. For example, a jazz funeral for the ERA was held in New Orleans in July 1982.\nAccording to research by Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 of them explicitly referred to the original 1979 deadline.\nLawsuit regarding deadline extension.\nOn December 23, 1981, a federal district court, in the case of \"Idaho v. Freeman\", ruled that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline to June 30, 1982, was not valid, and that the ERA had actually expired from state legislative consideration more than two years earlier on the original expiration date of March 22, 1979. On January 25, 1982, however, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the lower court's decision.\nAfter the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of \"NOW v. Idaho\", 459 U.S. 809 (1982), vacated the federal district court decision in \"Idaho v. Freeman\", which, in addition to declaring March 22, 1979, as ERA's expiration date, had upheld the validity of state rescissions. The Supreme Court declared these controversies moot based on the memorandum of the appellant Gerald P. Carmen, the then-Administrator of General Services, that the ERA had not received the required number of ratifications (38) and so \"the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here\".\nIn the 1939 case of \"Coleman v. Miller\", the Supreme Court ruled that if there was not a deadline by which the proposed amendment had to be acted upon by the requisite three-fourths of state legislatures or state ratifying conventions, then the proposed amendment remains. The court also ruled that it is in the discretion of Congress to arbitrate whether at least three-fourths of the states have ratified that amendment.\nLawsuits regarding ratification.\nAlabama lawsuit opposing ratification.\nOn December 16, 2019, the states of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota sued to prevent further ratifying of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall stated, \"The people had seven years to consider the ERA, and they rejected it. To sneak it into the Constitution through this illegal process would undermine the very basis for our constitutional order.\"\nSouth Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg stated in a press release:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The South Dakota Legislature ratified the ERA in 1973, but in 1979 passed Senate Joint Resolution 2 which required the ERA be ratified in the original time limit set by Congress or be rescinded. Because thirty-eight states failed to ratify the amendment by March 31, 1979 the South Dakota Legislature rescinded its ratification of the ERA. It is the duty of the Attorney General to defend and support our Legislature. It would be a disservice to the citizens of South Dakota to ignore this obligation of my office.\nThis is an issue of following the rule of law, the rules that our founding fathers put into place to protect us from government making decisions without the consent or support of \"we the people\". If Congress wants to pass an updated version of the ERA, taking into consideration all the changes in the law since 1972, I have no doubt the South Dakota Legislature would debate the merits in a new ratification process. An amendment to the Constitution should not be done by procedural nuances decades after the deadline prescribed by Congress, but through an open and transparent process where each State knows the ramifications of its actions.\nOn January 6, 2020, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel official Steven Engel issued an opinion in response to the lawsuit by Alabama, Louisiana, and South Dakota, stating that \"We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the States.\" The OLC argued in part that Congress had the authority to impose a deadline for the ERA and that it did not have the authority to retroactively extend the deadline once it had expired.\nOn February 27, 2020, the States of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota entered into a joint stipulation and voluntary dismissal with the Archivist of the United States. The joint stipulation incorporated the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion; stated that the Archivist would not certify the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment and stated that if the Department of Justice ever concludes that the 1972 ERA Resolution is still pending and that the Archivist therefore has authority to certify the ERA's adoption ... the Archivist will make no certification concerning ratification of the ERA until at least 45 days following the announcement of the Department of Justice's conclusion, absent a court order compelling him to do so sooner.\" On March 2, 2020, Federal District Court Judge L. Scott Coogler entered an order regarding the Joint Stipulation and Plaintiff's Voluntary Dismissal, granting the dismissal without prejudice.\nMassachusetts lawsuit supporting ratification.\nOn January 7, 2020, a complaint was filed by Equal Means Equal, The Yellow Roses and Katherine Weitbrecht in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Archivist of the United States, seeking to have him count the three most recently ratifying states and certify the ERA as having become part of the United States Constitution. On August 6, 2020, Judge Denise Casper granted the Archivist's motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue to compel the Archivist to certify and so she could not rule on the merits of the case. On August 21, 2020, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and on September 2, 2020, the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear this case. Subsequently, the Supreme Court denied the request to intervene before the First Circuit gives its decision. On June 29, 2021, the First Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision that \"the plaintiffs have not met their burden at the pleading stage with respect to those federal constitutional requirements; we affirm the order dismissing their suit for lack of standing.\" An \"en banc\" rehearing request was denied on January 4, 2022.\n2020\u20132023 lawsuit in the District of Columbia supporting ratification.\nOn January 30, 2020, the attorneys general of Virginia, Illinois and Nevada filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to require the Archivist of the United States to \"carry out his statutory duty of recognizing the complete and final adoption\" of the ERA as the Twenty-eighth Amendment to the Constitution.\nOn February 19, 2020, the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee moved to intervene in the case. On March 10, 2020, the Plaintiff States (Virginia, Illinois and Nevada) filed a memorandum in opposition to the five states seeking to intervene. On May 7, 2020, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss, claiming the states do not have standing to bring the case to trial as they have to show any \"concrete injury\", nor that the case was ripe for review.\nOn June 12, 2020, the District Court granted the Intervening states (Alabama, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee) motion to intervene in the case. On March 5, 2021, federal judge Rudolph Contreras of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the ratification period for the ERA \"expired long ago\" and that three states' recent ratifications had come too late to be counted in the amendment's favor.\nOn May 3, 2021, the plaintiff states appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Virginia withdrew from the lawsuit in February 2022. Oral arguments were held on September 28, 2022, before a panel composed by judges Wilkins, Rao and Childs. On February 28, 2023, the panel ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the ERA deadline invalid.\n2023\u20132025 California lawsuit supporting ratification.\nOn June 23, 2023, Vikram Valame filed a complaint against the Selective Service System for harms caused by the Military Selective Service Act. The plaintiff argued that he was \"subject to criminal prosecution, fines and imprisonment\" under \"unconstitutional registration and reporting requirements\" and denied \"valuable educational and job opportunities\" due to failure to register. Valame argued that the ERA had been validly ratified as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution, contending that Congress's deadline for ratification was unconstitutional under Article V and that states had no ability to revoke their ratifications.\nOn January 20, 2024, Judge Nathanael M. Cousins granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that \"no 28th Amendment appears in the Constitution\" and that the plaintiff \"cannot state a claim for relief under a constitutional amendment that does not exist.\" Valame filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On July 17, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Valame's complaint, saying, \"We reject as meritless Valame\u2019s contention that the Equal Rights Amendment was ratified as the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\nPost-deadline history.\nPost-deadline ratifications and the \"three-state strategy\".\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, ERA supporters began an effort to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982. These proponents state that Congress can remove the ERA's ratification deadline despite the deadline having expired, allowing the states again to ratify it. They also state that the ratifications ERA previously received remain in force and that rescissions of prior ratifications are not valid. Those who espouse the \"three-state strategy\" (now complete if the Nevada, Illinois and Virginia belated ERA approvals are deemed legitimate) were spurred, at least in part, by the unconventional 202-year-long ratification of the Constitution's Twenty-seventh Amendment (sometimes referred to as the \"Madison Amendment\") which became part of the Constitution in 1992 after pending before the state legislatures since 1789. However, the \"Madison Amendment\" was not associated with a ratification deadline, whereas the proposing clause of the ERA did include a deadline.\nOn June 21, 2009, the National Organization for Women decided to support both efforts to obtain additional state ratifications for the 1972 ERA and any strategy to submit a fresh-start ERA to the states for ratification.\nIn 2013, the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Service issued a report saying that ratification deadlines are a political question:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in \"Coleman v. Miller\" gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process. The report goes on to say:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of \"Coleman v. Miller\", which, they argue, may have been be [\"sic\"] a politically influenced decision.\nHowever, most recently, ERA Action has both led and brought renewed vigor to the movement by instituting what has become known as the \"three-state strategy\". In 2013, ERA Action began to gain traction with this strategy through their coordination with U.S. Senators and Representatives not only to introduce legislation in both houses of Congress to remove the ratification deadline, but also in gaining legislative sponsors. The Congressional Research Service then issued a report on the \"three state strategy\" on April 8, 2013, entitled \"The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues\", stating that the approach was viable.\nIn 2014, under the auspices of ERA Action and their coalition partners, both the Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify the ERA. That year, votes were blocked in both states' House chambers. In the meantime, the ERA ratification movement continued with the resolution being introduced in 10 state legislatures.\nIn the 2010s, due in part to fourth-wave feminism and the #MeToo movement, observers noted a renewed interest in adoption of the ERA.\nOn March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature became the first state in 40 years to ratify the ERA.\nIllinois lawmakers and citizens took another look at the ERA, with hearings, testimony, and research including work by the law firm Winston &amp; Strawn to address common legal questions about the ERA.\nIllinois state lawmakers ratified the ERA on May 30, 2018, with a 72\u201345 vote in the Illinois House following a 43\u201312 vote in the Illinois Senate in April 2018.\nVirginia became the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in January of 2020. Prior, an effort to ratify the ERA in the Virginia General Assembly in 2018 failed to reach the floor of either the House of Delegates or Senate. In 2019, a Senate committee voted to advance the ERA to the floor. On January 15, the Senate voted 26\u201314 to approve the amendment and forward it to the House of Delegates, but it was defeated there in a 50\u201350 tied vote; at the time, the Republican Party held one-seat majorities in both houses. After the 2019 elections in Virginia gave the Democratic Party majority control of both houses of the Virginia legislature, the incoming leaders expressed their intent to hold another vote on ratification early in the 2020 legislative session. They did so, with ERA ratification resolutions HJ1 and SJ1 being passed in their respective chambers on January 15, 2020, and being passed by each other on January 27. Experts and advocates have acknowledged the legal uncertainty of the Virginian ratification, due to the expired deadlines and five revocations.\nOn December 15, 2024, a group of over 120 Democrats in the House of Representatives, led by Representatives Cori Bush (D-Missouri) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts), sent a letter to outgoing President Joe Biden, arguing that both the deadlines and the revocations were illegitimate, meaning the ERA had been successfully ratified by 38 states, and urging Biden to direct the Archivist of the United States to certify the amendment as part of the Constitution immediately.\nReintroduction of the amendment in Congress.\nThe amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) championed it in the Senate from the 99th Congress through the 110th Congress. Senator Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey) introduced the amendment at the end of the 111th Congress and supported it in the 112th Congress. In the House of Representatives, Carolyn Maloney (D-New York) has sponsored it since the 105th Congress, most recently in August 2013.\nIn 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor. That was the last time that the ERA received a floor vote in either house of Congress.\nAt the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with representatives Maloney, Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) and Gwen Moore (D-Wisconsin), held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment's adoption. On March 5, 2013, the ERA was reintroduced by Senator Menendez as S.J. Res. 10.\nThe \"New ERA\" introduced in 2013, sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, adds an additional sentence to the original text: \"Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\"\nIn 2023, the Congressional Caucus for the Equal Rights Amendment was founded by House Democrats.\nProposed removal of ratification deadline.\nOn March 8, 2011, the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, Representative Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) introduced legislation (H.J. Res. 47) to remove the congressionally imposed deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The resolution had 56 cosponsors. The resolution was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution by the House Committee on the Judiciary. The Subcommittee failed to vote on the resolution, and as such, the resolution died in subcommittee when the 112th Congress ended in January 2013. On March 22, 2012, the 40th anniversary of the ERA's congressional approval, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Maryland) introduced (S.J. Res. 39)\u2014which is worded with slight differences from Representative Baldwin's (H.J. Res. 47). Senator Cardin was joined by seventeen other senators who cosponsored the Senate Joint Resolution. The resolution was referred to Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where a vote on it was never brought. The resolution, therefore, died in committee when the 112th Congress ended in January 2013.\nOn February 24, 2013, the New Mexico House of Representatives adopted House Memorial No. 7 asking that the congressionally imposed deadline for ERA ratification be removed. House Memorial No. 7 was officially received by the U.S. Senate on January 6, 2014, was designated as \"POM-175\" and was referred to the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary.\nOn January 30, 2019, Representative Jackie Speier (D-California) introduced legislation () in a renewed attempt to remove the deadline to ratify the amendment. As of April 30, 2019, the resolution had 188 co-sponsors, including Republicans Tom Reed of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. It was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties by the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day. The subcommittee heard testimony on the amendment and extension of the deadline on April 30, 2019.\nOn November 8, 2019, Representative Jackie Speier (D-California) re-introduced the bill as to attempt to remove the deadline to ratify the amendment with 214 co-sponsors (later 224). The House passed H.J. Res. 79 on February 13, 2020, by a vote of 232\u2013183, which was mostly along party lines though five Republicans joined in support. The bill expired without Senate action.\nAt the beginning of the 117th Congress, a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 17) to remove the deadline for ratification was again introduced in both chambers, with bipartisan support. The House passed the resolution by a 222\u2013204 vote on March 17, 2021. The companion bill, S.J.Res. 1, introduced by Senator Ben Cardin, was co-sponsored by all 50 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus and Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. The measure failed as the Senate took no action on it.\nMinnesota legislature resolution.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Minnesota Legislature adopted a resolution memorializing Congress to declare the ERA fully ratified by the states, and now the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Governor Tim Walz signed the legislation on May 26, and it was then sent to Congress and to President Joe Biden.\nBiden declaration.\nOn January 17, 2025, three days before leaving office, President Biden declared that, in his opinion, the Equal Rights Amendment was the law of the land, stating: \"It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people. In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.\" The declaration has no formal effect, however, and the National Archives has said they do not intend to certify the amendment as part of the Constitution, citing \"established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions\" supporting the integrity of the original ratification deadline in the absence of any subsequent extension or deadline removal by Congress or the court system. Biden's statement led to widespread criticism, with the \"Washington Post\"'s analysis concluding \"it's also remarkable that a president would try to declare something that isn't clearly the law to be not just the law, but part of the most significant legal document our country has. That at the very least skips over a whole lot of very valid legal issues that have never been settled.\"\nState equal rights amendments.\nTwenty-five states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The 1879 Constitution of California contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to \"entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment\". Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to ensure political and civil equality between women and men. Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states, or afterward.\nSome equal rights amendments and original constitutional equal rights provisions are:\nInternational comparison.\nIn 2020, Southern Legal Council found clauses officially declaring equal rights / non-discrimination on the basis of sex in the constitutions of 168 countries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many are cultivated for their flowers, appearing in autumn, winter, or spring. The flowers close at night and in overcast weather conditions.\nThe crocus has been known throughout recorded history, mainly as the source of saffron. Saffron is obtained from the dried stigma of \"Crocus sativus\", an autumn-blooming species. It is valued as a spice and dyestuff, and is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Iran is the center of saffron production.\nCrocuses are native to woodland, scrub, and meadows from sea level to alpine tundra from the Mediterranean, through North Africa, central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across Central Asia to Xinjiang in western China. Crocuses may be propagated from seed or from daughter cormels formed on the corm, that eventually produce mature plants. They arrived in Europe from Turkey in the 16th century and became valued as an ornamental flowering plant.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDescription.\nGeneral.\n\"Crocus\" display the general characteristics of family Iridaceae, which include basal cauline (arising from the aerial stem) leaves that sheath the stem base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, the perianth petaloid with two whorls of three tepals each and septal nectaries. The flowers have three stamens and a gynoecium of three united carpels and an inferior ovary, three locules and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule.\n\"Crocus\" is an acaulescent (lacking a visible lower stem above ground) diminutive seasonal cormous (growing from corms) herbaceous perennial geophytic genus. The corms are symmetrical and globose or oblate (round in shape with flatted tops and bottoms), and are covered with tunic leaves that are fibrous, membranous or coriaceous (leathery). The corms produce fibrous roots, and contractile roots which adjust the corms depth in the soil, which may be pulled as deep as into the soil. The roots appear randomly from the lower part of the corm, but in a few species, from a basal ridge.\nLeaves.\nPlants produce several basal linear bifacial green leaves that arise from the corms. These are adaxially (upper surface facing axis) flat or channelled with pale median stripes, while the opposite (abaxial) surface is strongly keeled, with two grooves on either side. The leaves have a distinctive shape in cross-section, being boat-shaped with two lateral arms with margins recurved inwardly towards the central ridged keel, forming the sides of the \"boat\". The keel may be square or rectangular, but is lacking in \"C. carpetanus\". The pale central stripe is caused by parenchymatous cells which lack chloroplasts and may contain air spaces. The leaves are from wide and long. The leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent. The leaf bases are surrounded by up to 5 membranous sheaths called cataphylls, a specialised leaf. The bases of the cataphylls form the corm tunic, and their number varies from 3 to 6, and enclose the true leaves (euphylls), bracts, bracteoles and flowering stalk.\nFlowers.\nThe number of peduncles (flower stems) vary from one to several and remain underground, emerging only at the fruiting stage, bearing flowers that are solitary or several, so that a true scape is absent. The flowers are pedicellate (attached to the peduncle by a short subterranean pedicel stalk). The pedicel is sometimes subtended (below pedicel) by a membranous, sheathing prophyll (leaf-like structure).\nThe showy, salver to cup-shaped, single or clustered actinomorphic flowers taper off into a narrow tube; the flowers emerge from the ground, and can be white, yellow, lilac to dark purple, or variegated in cultivars. The flower tube is long, cylindrical and slender, expanding apically. The floral tube is long and narrow with 6 lobes in 2 whorls. The perianth is 3+3 (3 sepals+3 petals) and gamophyllous (with fused segments). The tepal whorls are similar, equal or subequal with a smaller inner whorl, and cupped to outspread. The bracts are membranous, but the inner ones are sometimes lacking.\nThe 3 stamens are erect and linear and inserted in the throat of the perianth tube, with anthers shorter than the filaments. Pollen grains are inaperturate (apertures absent) but sometimes spiraperturate (spiral shaped). Each flower has a single style which is exserted (projecting beyond the corolla tube) and slender distally with three to many branches. The branches are highly variable, being short or long, and simple, bifurcate (dividing in two) or multifid and sometimes distally flattened. The inferior ovary has 3 carpels with axile placentation. It remains underground, and as the seeds ripen, the pedicel (stem of the flower) grows longer so the fruit is above the soil surface.\nFruit and seed.\nThe fruit is a small membranous capsule, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid in shape and the many seeds are globose to ellipsoid. The seed surface is highly variable, including papillate (covered in small protuberances), digitiform (finger-like) and other epidermal cell types. In some species the seeds are arillate, with fleshy appendages. Crocus seeds have both inner and outer integuments and in some species the outer epidermis may display long papillae. Embryo-sac development is Polygonum type. Dehiscence (splitting of the capsule to release the seed) is of the loculicidal type in which it splits through the wall of the locules leaving the septa that separate them intact.\nKaryology.\n\"Crocus\" has extensive aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), with some uncertainty as to the base number of chromosomes. The chromosome numbers shows extreme variability, ranging from 2n=6 to 2n=70 even within a single species.\nPhytochemistry.\nThe Iridaceae contain a wide range of phenolic compounds. However, 6-Hydroxyflavones are found only in \"Crocus\", which is also characterised by the presence of crocins, water-soluble yellow carotenoids, in the floral tissues. Crocin is a diester of crocetin, responsible for the colour of the styles and stigma of \"C. sativus\", and hence saffron. A few species contain mangiferin, a glucosylxanthone.\nWhile the flowers may vary dramatically between species, there is little variation in the leaves, but sufficient variability in corm tunics that they may be used as an aid in differentiating taxa.\nTaxonomy.\nHistory.\nThe crocus was well known to the ancients, being described at least as early as Theophrastus (c. 371\u00a0\u2013 c. 287 BC), and was introduced into Britain by the Romans, where the saffron crocus was used as a dyestuff. It was reintroduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders. The crocus is mentioned in mediaeval and later herbals, one of the earliest being the 14th century \"Tractatus de Herbis.\" William Turner (1548) states that the crocus is referred to as saffron in English, implying that only \"C. sativus\" was known at that time. However, by 1597 John Gerard writes of \"sundry sorts\" and uses the term saffron and crocus as interchangeable. He included both spring and autumn flowering crocus, but distinguished Wild Saffron (\"Crocus\") from Meadow Saffron (\"Colchicum\"). He described eleven forms. Some of his specimens were obtained from Clusius. In the following century, John Parkinson in a more detailed account was more careful to include separate chapters for \"Colchicum\", with the common name of meadow saffron, from \"Crocus\" or saffron. Parkinson (1656) states that there are \"divers sorts of saffrons\" describing 27 spring flowering plants and 4 autumn flowering ones, pointing out that only one of those was the true saffron crocus, which he called \"Crocus verus sativus autumnalis\". Similar accounts are found in continental European herbals, including those of l'Obel in Flanders (1576) and Besler's \"Hortus Eystettensis\" in Bavaria (1613).\nThe genus \"Crocus\" was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with three taxa, and two species, \"C. sativus\" (type species), var. \"officinalis\" (now treated as a synonym of \"C. sativus\") and var. \"vernus\" (now \"C. vernus\") and \"C. bulbocodium\" (now \"Romulea bulbocodium\"). Thus Linnaeus recognised two taxa that are accepted as separate species in modern classifications, one vernal and one autumnal crocus, but incorrectly assumed they were only varieties of a single species, while his second species was actually from a closely related genus that was only recognised later (1772). However, a subsequent re-examination of Linnaeus's specimens suggested the presence of several different species that he did not recognise as being separate. Linnaeus' system, based on sexual characteristics, \"Crocus\" was classified as Triandra Monogynia (Three stamens, Single pistil). Linnaeus's system was supplanted by the \"natural\" system which used a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks based on weighting of the importance of structural characteristics of the plant. Jussieu (1789) placed the genus Crocus in his \"Ordo\" (family) Irides or \"Les iris\", as a member of the class \"Stamina epigyna\" (stamens inserted above the ovary) as part of the monocotyledons, the first level of the division of the flowering plants. \nOne of the first monographs of the genus appeared in 1809, by Haworth, followed in 1829 by that of Sabine, and Herbert in 1847. In 1853, Lindley continued the placement of \"Crocus\" as one of 53 genera in Iridaceae, which he included in a higher order of monocotyledons, the Narcissales. Baker published a monograph on the genus in 1874, adopting a very different schema to that of Herbert. In 1883, Bentham and Hooker described the Irideae (Iridaceae) as having more than 700 species, and divided it into 3 tribes and further into subtribes. Tribe Sysyrinchieae as having 2 subtribes, including Ixieae. The latter was circumscribed with four genera, \"Crocus\", \"Syringodea\", \"Galaxia\" (\"Moraea\") and \"Romulea\". This circumscription has remained stable since, with the exception of \"Moraea\" which properly belongs in a separate tribe. The most influential monograph of the nineteenth century was that of Maw (1886), which forms the basis of modern understanding of the genus. Maw built on the work of Herbert, rejecting Baker's classification. The availability of molecular phylogenetic methods in the late twentieth century has shown that the Iridaceae properly belong within the order Asparagales.\nBotanical illustration.\nThe scientific study of the genus in the late eighteenth century was accompanied by detailed descriptions with Botanical illustrations, such as those of William Curtis (1787) and Sims (1803), that appeared in \"Curtis's Botanical Magazine\", with illustrations by Sydenham Edwards. Other illustrations are found in monographs such as those of Haworth (1809) and Sabine (1830), illustrated by Charles John Robertson. The largest collection is found in the most comprehensive monograph, that of Maw (1886). Other sources include the portfolios of plates, such as the survey of the plants of France by Masclef (1891). At that time only \"C. sativus\" and \"C. vernus\" were included in the Flora of France. \nPhylogeny.\nThe genus \"Crocus\" belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae (iris family), specifically the large subfamily Crocoideae. Within that subfamily, crocus is placed on the tribe, Ixieae (synonym Croceae), one of five. The Ixieae are then subdivided into subtribes, with the genera \"Crocus\", \"Romulea\" and \"Syringodea\" forming subtribe Romuleinae. The Romuleinae have been characterised within the Ixieae by progressively reduced aerial stems. solitary flowers on the stem branches and woody tunics on the corms. They also often have divided style branches. However, \"Crocus\" corm tunics are fibrous and membranous rather than woody as in \"Syringodea.\" Also, \"Crocus\" has a ridged and often keeled abaxial leaf surface, while that of \"Syringodea\" is rounded, and the midline adaxial translucency of \"Crocus\" is lacking in \"Syringodea\". \"Romulea\" is principally distinguished from the other two genera by generally having aerial stems or at least an ovary at ground level, compared with the other acaulescent genera, other differences include unifacial rather than bifacial leaves and the pollen structure.\nWithin the Romuleinae, \"Crocus\" is a sister group to \"Syringodea\", the two genera forming a sister group to \"Romulea\".\nSubdivision.\nThe genus Crocus consists of about 200 accepted species, which continue to increase, and has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications. The genus has often been divided into sections, beginning with that of Haworth (1809) who described two sections based on the presence or absence of hairs in the throat of the flower, while Sabine was the first to realise the importance of the presence or absence of a basal spathe (prophyll) in dividing the genus into two sections, a practice followed by Herbert. However, Sabine's practice of using trinomials for varieties such as \"C. sulphureus concolor\" is no longer accepted, although Herbert somewhat similarly used varieties and subvarieties, e.g. \"C. vernus\" var.1 \"Communis\" subvar. 1. \"Obovatus\". Herbert also used geographical distribution as a basis of classification. By the late 19th century Maw (1886), following Herbert, subdivided the genus into two divisions, the \"Involucrati\" and the \"Nudiflori\", and then further divided it into six sections and lastly by flowering times (spring or autumn). Although rejecting the concept of subvarieties, he placed even more emphasis on geography.\nThe most widely accepted system, that proposed by Brian Mathew in 1982 was based on Maw's system, but with less emphasis on flowering times. This mainly depended on three character states: \nand included 81 species, however, one of these, \"Crocus medius\" was later recognized as a synonym of \"Crocus nudiflorus\".\nThe genus, as described by Mathew, consisted of two subgenera, \"Crocirus\" (monotypic for \"Crocus banaticus\") and \"Crocus\" including the remainder of the species, based on whether the anthers were introrse or extrorse (dehiscence directed towards or away from centre of flower) respectively. Subgenus \"Crocus\" was then divided into two sections, \"Crocus\" and \"Nudiscapus\", based on the presence or absence of the prophyll. Each section was then further divided into six series of \"Crocus\" and nine of \"Nudiscapus\". These series were defined by the division of the style, the corm tunic, flowering time, leaf structure, presence of a bracteole and anther colour. Mathew also introduced the concept of subspecies, including 50 in all, by giving similar but different forms subspecies status if geographically separated, resulting in about 140 distinct taxa. The seven species and ten subspecies discovered since then have been integrated into revisions of this classification, though new species continue to be described, leading to estimates of at least 200 species.\nSpeciation.\nCrocus populations have extremely high infra-specific variability with a very diverse spectrum of morphological and phenotypical varieties, while many individual specimens from different species may closely resemble each other. Based on such morphological differences between isolated populations many new species have been named, but without a definition of new species based on molecular and/or karyological information, species can not be confirmed, creating difficulties in determining speciation and hence the exact number of species. The situation is even more complex once hybridisation (combination of taxa) and introgression (transfer of genetic material) are considered.\nMolecular phylogeny.\nThe availability of molecular phylogeny methods revealed problems with the traditional systems based on morphology alone. The first analysis of the complete genus was carried out by Mathew and colleagues in 2008 using nucleotide sequences from plastid regions. In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating \"C. banaticus\" in its own subgenus \"Crociris\", though it is a unique species in the genus. Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section \"Crocus\", although its exact relationship to the rest of the subgenus remains unclear.\nOf the 15 series in the Mathew scheme, only seven were monophyletic, and in particular the largest series, \"Biflori\" and \"Reticulati\", which include a third of all species, were non-monophyletic. Another anomalous species, \"C. baytopiorum\", should now be placed in a series of its own, series \"Baytopi\". \"C. gargaricus\" subsp. \"herbertii\" has been raised to species status, as \"C. herbertii\". The autumn-flowering \"C. longiflorus\", the type species of series \"Longiflori\" (long regarded by Mathew as \"a disparate assemblage\"), appeared to lie within series \"Verni\". In addition, the position of \"C. malyi\" was currently unclear.\nDNA analysis and morphological studies suggest further that series \"Reticulati\", \"Biflori\" and \"Speciosi\" are \"probably inseparable\", \"C. adanensis\" and \"C. caspius\" should probably be removed from \"Biflori\", \"C. adanensis\" falls in a clade with \"C. paschei\" as a sister group to the species of series \"Flavi\" and \"C. caspius\" appears to be sister to the species of series \"Orientales\".\nThe study showed \"no support for a system of sections as currently defined\", although, despite the many inconsistencies between Mathew's 1982 classification and the current hypothesis, \"the main assignment of species to the sections and series of that system is actually supported\". The authors state, \"further studies are required before any firm decisions about a hierarchical system of classification can be considered\" and conclude \"future re-classification is likely to involve all infrageneric levels, subgenera, sections and series\". A further study, using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA), together with a chloroplast marker, broadly confirmed these findings.\n\"Crocus\" forms a monophyletic clade, with a basal polytomy of four subclades. The first clade (A) corresponding to section \"Crocus\", but including \"C. sieberi\" and several closely related species (originally included in section \"Nudiscapus\" series \"Reticulati\"). The remaining three clades (B-D) include all the remaining species of section \"Nudiscapus\". Of these, B and C are small, corresponding to series \"Orientales\" and \"Carpetani\" respectively, with all remaining series in the large D clade. The exception is \"C. caspius\", originally in series \"Biflori\", which segregates in clade B. Thus, although division of the genus into two sections is well supported, no single morphological character defines these two groups. The \"C. sieberi\" group are assumed to have lost their prophyll secondarily. Of the series, eight could be shown to be monophyletic; \"Crocus\", \"Kotschyani\" and \"Scardici\" (section \"Crocus\") and \"Aleppici\", \"Carpetani\", \"Laevigati\", \"Orientalis\" and \"Speciosi\" (section \"Nudiscapus\"). Flowering season did not correspond to molecular groupings and nor did any of the previously used morphological characteristics, indicating a high degree of homoplasy, in which traits are gained or lost independently in different lineages. The remainder of the series could not be supported as natural groupings. Mathew's concept of subspecies status within \"C. biflorus\" could not be supported, each being considered a separate species, resulting in the genus having at least 150 species.\nA more detailed molecular and morphological study of series \"Verni\" (section \"Crocus\") allowed it to be better characterised and circumscribed, as well as the closely related series \"Longiflori\". Series \"Verni\" \"sensu\" Mathew was found to consist of two groups, the first being \"C. vernus\" \"sensu\" Mathew and the other consisting of \"C. etruscus\", \"ilvensis\", \"kosaninii\" and \"longiflorus\". The taxonomic status of \"C. vernus\" had been uncertain for some time, given the observation that the name was more properly applied to \"C. albiflorus\", requiring a new designation of \"C. neapolitanus\" for those previously known as \"C. vernus\". Subsequently \"C. vernus\" was split into 5 separate species. The incorporation of \"C. longiflorus\" into series \"Verni\" resulted in making series \"Longiflori\" no longer a legitimate taxonomic unit.\nIn section \"Nudiscapus\", series \"Reticulati\" was polyphyletic with species intermingled with series \"Biflori\" and \"Speciosi\", requiring a recircumscription, confining \"Reticulati\" to 8 species, to obtain monophyly. Among the thereby displaced species, are a number of very closely related taxa, referred to as the \"Crocus sieberi\" aggregate, which has been proposed as a new series \"Sieberi\". Other new series, such as \"Isauri\" and \"Lyciotauri\", continue to be created out of the \"Biflori\" series.\nMathew's circumscription of \"Crocus\" introduced the rank of subspecies, of which the largest number (14) were those of \"Crocus biflorus\" , the type species of series \"Biflori\", a number which continued to grow. Molecular methods identified these as a polyphyletic assemblage rather than closely related subordinate infraspecific taxa. This necessitated a complete taxonomic revision of series \"Biflori\", elevating each subspecies to species status. A similar issue occurs with \"C. reticulatus\" \"sensu\" Mathew, who created two subspecies, resulting in 9 newly defined species.\nSections and species.\nThe classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009 divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series. The number of series, continues to evolve. \nSpecies with a basal prophyll. Type species \"C. sativus\" \n 6 series\nSpecies without a basal prophyll. Type species \"C. reticulatus\" \n 9 series\nSimilarly named species.\nSome crocus species, known as \"autumn crocus\", flower in late summer and autumn, during (autumnal) rains, after summer's heat and drought. The name autumn crocus is also often used as a common name for \"Colchicum\", which is not a true crocus but in its own family (Colchicaceae) in the lily order Liliales. The plants are toxic, but have medicinal uses. \"Colchicum\" are also known as meadow saffron, though true saffron is not toxic. \"Crocus\" species have three stamens while \"Colchicum\" species have six; crocus have one style, while \"Colchicum\" have three.\nSome Pulsatilla species are also called \"prairie crocus\" (previously \"Anemone patens)\" or \"wild crocus\", but they belong to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). Pulsatilla species, which are commonly called pasqueflowers, unlike crocuses have rhizomes, the foliage is covered with long soft hairs, and the flowers are produced on above-ground stems.\nEtymology.\n\"Crocus\", the name of the genus, is Late Middle English (late 14th century) and also denotes saffron. It is derived via Latin \"crocus \"from the Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (\"krokos\"), which is itself probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew \u05db\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05dd \"kark\u014dm\", Aramaic \u071f\u071f\u0718\u072a\u071f\u071f\u0721\u0721\u0710 \"kurkama\", and Arabic \"kurkum\", meaning saffron (\"Crocus sativus\"), \"saffron yellow\" or turmeric (see \"Curcuma\"), another yellow dye. The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit \"kunkumam\" () for \"saffron\". The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin \"safranum\", but Old English already had \"croh\" for saffron, introduced by the Romans.\nDistribution and habitat.\nCrocuses are distributed from the Mediterranean, from the Iberian peninsula and North Africa, through central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across central and southwest Asia to Xinjiang in western China, but most species are restricted to Turkey and Asia Minor and the Balkans, with the Balkan Peninsula having the largest number of species (at least 31), forming the centre of diversity, however they are widely introduced. The distribution of species is described over five contiguous areas from west to east (\"see map\"). \nHabitats range from sea level to as high as subalpine altitudes, and in a wide range of habitats from woodlands to meadows and deserts, often on stony mountain slopes with good drainage. The majority of species are native to areas with cold winters and hot summers with little rain, and active growth is typically from fall to mid-spring. The natural habitats of crocus species are threatened by human activities, including urbanization, industrialization, and other land disturbances and recreational uses. They are negatively impacted by uncontrolled gathering and heavy grazing by livestock.\nEcology.\nThe life cycle of \"Crocus\" species begins with the seed, germinating to a seedling, and a mature plant in 3\u20135 years, however seeds may remain dormant in the soil for several years. The germination stages were first described and illustrated by Maw in his 1886 monograph. In its first year, the crocus produces only a single leaf and creates a corm covered by a thin tunic, about 5\u20138\u00a0mm in size, dependent on the species. In the northern hemisphere, the autumnal crocuses flower between September and November. The vernal (spring) crocuses flowering time depends both on climate and habitat, but is usually mid-winter to spring. Leaves may be synanthous (produced during flowering) or hysteranthous (when the flowers wither away). In the summer, with hot and dry conditions the plant becomes dormant, with all the above ground parts dying back. Colder temperatures in winter then activate the corms. Propagation occurs sexually by seed and asexually by small corms, called cormels or cormlets, produced in the axils of the corms (between tunic scales and body of corm). As the fruit capsule ripens, it emerges from the soil at the base of the flowering stem before dehiscing (splitting open) and releasing the seeds. Seed dispersal may be enhanced by ants, at least in species with arillate seeds.\nAt night and in overcast weather, the perianth closes. The ovary produces nectar which attracts bees (particularly female bumblebees) and Lepidoptera.\nPests and diseases.\nCultivated plants may have their corms consumed by mice and other rodents, including voles, squirrels, and chipmunks. They are also attacked by mildew, gray mold, botrytis, and fusarium rot. Root rot may also occur, caused by \"Stromatinia gladioli\" and \"Pythium\" species. The nematode \"Pratylenchus penetrans\" may also cause root rot. Viruses that are known to infect \"Crocus\" spp include: Potyviruses, especially bean yellow mosaic virus and also tobacco rattle virus, tobaccos necrosis virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. The foliage may experience rot, rust, and scab diseases and be fed upon by aphids, mites, snails, and slugs. The foliage is eaten by hares, rabbits, and deer; the flowers are sometimes removed by birds, including crows, jackdaws, and magpies.\nCultivation.\nSaffron.\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single species, \"Crocus sativus\", now known only in cultivation. \"C. sativus\" is grown for the production of saffron, an orange-red derivative of its dried stigma, and among the most expensive spices in the world. The estimated worldwide production of \"C. sativus\" plants is 205 tons. About 180,000 stigmas from 60,000 flowers are required to produce saffron, which sells for about US$10,000 (2018). Modern saffron production is widely cultivated in Kashmir, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor. An important center is the eponymous town of Krokos, in the Kozani region of Greece. The saffron product, Krokos Kozanis is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin). Production is largely indigenous and Iran accounts for 65% of global production, covering 72,162\u00a0ha.\nSaffron is thought to have been used in embalming in Ancient Egypt. It is mentioned in the Old Testament, in the Song of Songs as a precious spice and has featured as a dye and fragrance throughout written history, with mention in the \"Iliad\".\nCultivation and harvesting of \"C. sativus\" for saffron was first documented in the Mediterranean, notably on the island of Crete. Frescos showing them are found there at the Bronze Age Minoan site of Knossos, as well as from the comparably aged Akrotiri site on the Aegean island of Santorini, and formed an important part of the Minoan economy and culture and had both a sacred role and use as a psychoactive drug and food additive. Women still gather crocuses in the Akrotiri region.\nHorticulture and floriculture.\nCrocuses were described in Turkish gardens in the early sixteenth century, gathered from the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire, where they were seen by visiting European botanists and explorers, among the first of whom was Pierre Belon who arrived in Constantinople in 1547. The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species were not native, were from corms brought to Vienna in 1562 from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq. A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden. These were almost certainly cultivated varieties rather than wild species. European visitors to Turkey continued to bring back specimens for gardens in their own country. Prominent among the latter were the gardens at Middelburg in the Netherlands. Jehan Somer, a Middelburg merchant, brought back crocuses among his other specimens in 1592, where they attracted the attention not only of Clusius but of the early Dutch flower painters, notably Ambrosius Bosschaert. By 1620, new garden varieties had been developed, and featured in contemporary illustrations, such as that of Crispijn van de Passe in his \"Hortus floridus\" of 1614. There are accounts of crocus gardens in the seventeenth century, such as the Saffron Garth of Walter Stonehouse at Darfield, Yorkshire.\nCrocuses are among the most important ornamental geophytes in the global flower industry, ranking sixth in terms of Dutch bulb production (2003\u20132008) with 463\u2013668\u00a0ha under cultivation. The crocus is one of the most popular flowers found in the garden in the late winter and early spring. About 30 of the species are cultivated, among the most popular being \"C. chrysanthus\", \"C. flavus\", \"C. sieberi\", \"C. tommasinianus\" and \"C. vernus\", together with hundreds of cultivars derived from them. Both fall and spring blooming crocuses are cultivated for their flowers. Among the first flowers to bloom in spring, their flowering time can vary from fall to the late winter blooming \"C. tommasinianus\"; the earliest fall blooming species, \"C. scharojanii\", may flower during the last weeks of July.\nThe varieties cultivated for decoration in gardens and pots mainly represent six species: \"C. vernus\", \"C. chrysanthus\", \"C. flavus\", \"C. sieberi\", \"C. speciosus\" and \"C.\u00a0tommasinianus\". During the horticulture production year 2009/2010, more than 70 cultivars were grown in Holland, covering an area of 366 hectares; the most common ones were 'Flower Record' and 'King of the Stripes' which accounted for 42 hectares, other species grown included \"C. chrysanthus\", \"C. tommasinianus\", and \"C. flavus\" - all are spring blooming plants. But the most commonly grown plants are the Dutch hybrids with large flowers in a rich palette of colors.\nBoth sexual and asexual means are used to increase the number of plants; seeds and multiplication of corms are the most common means of production, but tissue culture can be used, most commonly for saffron crocus. New corms are formed on top of the older corm which withers away, and cormels are produced from axillary buds. The production of new plants begins with harvested corms in late June to early July, after being graded by corm size the corms are stored around 22 Celsius until early October when they are moved to 17 Celsius until planted later in October and November; flowering occurs in March and the flowers are not removed. Crocuses are also forced to produce flowering plants out of season and the most common species used are \"C. vernus\" and \"C. flavus\", and most of the corms used for forcing come from the Netherlands.\nSpring flowering types are planted in fall, while fall-blooming types in late summer; typically, the corms are placed 3 to 4 inches deep in well-draining soil in areas with full sun exposure. They do not thrive in heavy clay soils or those that are damp, especially during their summer dormancy period. Commercial crops are produced on raised beds and slopes, to ensure adequate drainage, while horticulturalists often plant on sand beds for the same purpose. Spring flowering types also do well in areas with deciduous trees, where they flower and produce leaves before the trees completely leaf-out. Crocuses are grown in USDA winter zones 3\u20138. Not all species are hardy in the upper zones; \"C. sativus\" is winter hardy in USDA zones 6 through 8, and \"C. pulchellus\" is hardy in zones 5 through 8.\nSome are suitable for naturalizing in grass, but mowing off the foliage before it turns yellow produces short lived plants. Some crocuses, especially \"C. tommasinianus\" and its selected forms and hybrids (such as 'Whitewell Purple' and 'Ruby Giant'), seed prolifically and are ideal for naturalizing. They can, however, become weeds in rock gardens, where they will often appear in the middle of choice, mat-forming alpine plants, and can be difficult to remove. Crocus flowers and leaves are protected from frost by a waxy cuticle; in areas where snow and frost occasionally occur in the early spring, it is not uncommon to see early flowering crocuses blooming through a light late snowfall.\nAutumn crocus.\nAutumn-flowering species of crocus that are cultivated include:\n\"C. laevigatus\" has a long flowering period which starts in late autumn or early winter and may continue into February.\n\"Colchicum autumnale\" is commonly known as \"autumn crocus\", but is a member of the plant family Colchicaceae, and not a true crocus (of the family Iridaceae).\nUses.\nThe corms of crocuses have been used as foodstuffs in Syria. The carotenoids found in the styles of \"Crocus\" species, particularly \"C. sativus\" have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and have led to interest in potential pharmaceutical applications.\nCulture.\nThe crocus or krokos has been known since ancient times, and used in decorative arts, such as the Minoan wall paintings in Santorini from ca.\u00a01,600 BC. Representations of the saffron crocus appear frequently in Minoan art and pervade Aegean art from the Early Bronze Age to the Mycenaean period. Theophrastos (4th century BC) described the saffron crocus as being valued as a spice and dye, while Homer compares a sunrise to the flower colour. Saffron coloured robes were much admired by women in antiquity and gave the garment Crocota its name. The oil was also valued as a cosmetic. According to Greek legend Crocus or Krokus (), was a mortal youth the gods turned into a plant bearing his name, the crocus, after his death caused by his great desire and unfulfilled love for the shepherdess Smilax. Other versions state that as he died three tears fell into the flower becoming its three stigmata.\nCrocuses occur in many flower paintings, one of the earliest being that of Ambrosius Bosschaert's \"Composed Bouquet of Spring Flowers\" (1620). In this painting the cream-colored crocus feathered with bronze at the base of the bouquet reflected varieties on the market at that time. Bosschaert, working from a preparatory drawing to paint his composed piece spanning the whole of spring, exaggerated the crocus so that it passes for a tulip, but its narrow, grass-like leaves give it away. \nThe crocus is used in many contexts to symbolically denote spring and new beginnings. For instance, it was used as the emblem of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland to symbolise the emergence of new talent.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is associated with the medieval Christian institution of knighthood, with knights being members of various chivalric orders, and with knights' and gentlemen's behaviours which were governed by chivalrous social codes. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, informed by Geoffrey of Monmouth's , written in the 1130s, which popularized the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table. \nThe code of chivalry that developed in medieval Europe had its roots in earlier centuries. It arose in the Carolingian Empire from the idealisation of the cavalryman\u2014involving military bravery, individual training, and service to others\u2014especially in Francia, among horse soldiers in Charlemagne's cavalry.2 Over time, the meaning of chivalry in Europe has been refined to emphasize more general social and moral virtues. The code of chivalry, as it stood by the Late Middle Ages, was a moral system which combined a warrior ethos, knightly piety, and courtly manners, all combining to establish a notion of honour and nobility.\nTerminology and definitions.\nThe term \"chivalry\" derives from the Old French term , which can be translated as \"horse soldiery\". Originally, the term referred only to horse-mounted men, from the French word for horse, , but later it became associated with knightly ideals. The French word originally meant \"a man of aristocratic standing, and probably of noble ancestry, who is capable, if called upon, of equipping himself with a war horse and the arms of heavy cavalryman and who has been through certain rituals that make him what he is.\" Therefore, during the Middle Ages, the plural (transformed in English into the word \"chivalry\") originally denoted the body of heavy cavalry upon formation in the field. In English, the term appears from 1292 (note that \"cavalry\" is from the Italian form of the same word).\nThe meaning of the term evolved over time into a broader sense, because in the Middle Ages the meaning of changed from the original concrete military meaning \"status or fee associated with a military follower owning a war horse\" or \"a group of mounted knights\" to the ideal of the Christian warrior ethos propagated in the romance genre, which was becoming popular during the 12th century, and the ideal of courtly love propagated in the contemporary Minnesang and related genres.\nThe ideas of chivalry are summarized in three medieval works: the anonymous poem \"Ordene de chevalerie\", which tells the story of how Hugh II of Tiberias was captured and released upon his agreement to show Saladin (1138\u20131193) the ritual of Christian knighthood; the \"Libre del ordre de cavayleria\", written by Ramon Llull (1232\u20131315), from Mallorca, whose subject is knighthood; and the Livre de Chevalerie of Geoffroi de Charny (1300\u20131356), which examines the qualities of knighthood, emphasizing \"prowess\". None of the authors of these three texts knew the other two texts, and the three combine to depict a general concept of chivalry which is not precisely in harmony with any of them. To different degrees and with different details, they speak of chivalry as a way of life in which the military, the nobility, and religion combine.\nThe \"code of chivalry\" is thus a product of the Late Middle Ages, evolving after the end of the crusades partly from an idealization of the historical knights fighting in the Holy Land and from ideals of courtly love.\nTen Commandments of Chivalry.\nPioneering French literary historian L\u00e9on Gautier compiled what he called the medieval Ten Commandments of chivalry in his book \"La Chevalerie\" (1884):\nIn fact, there is no such medieval list. Gautier's effort was a series of moral bullet points he abstracted from his broad reading of 12th and 13th century romances.\nLiterary chivalry and historical reality.\nSupporters of chivalry have assumed since the late medieval period that there was a time in the past when chivalry was a living institution, when men acted chivalrously, the imitation of which period would much improve the present.\nHowever, with the birth of modern historical and literary research, scholars have found that however far back in time \"The Age of Chivalry\" is searched for, it is always further in the past, even back to the Roman Empire. From Jean Charles L\u00e9onard de Sismondi:\nWe must not confound chivalry with the feudal system. The feudal system may be called the real life of the period of which we are treating, possessing its advantages and inconveniences, its virtues and its vices. Chivalry, on the contrary, is the ideal world, such as it existed in the imaginations of the romance writers. Its essential character is devotion to woman and to honour.\nSismondi alludes to the fictitious Arthurian romances about the imaginary Court of King Arthur when taken as factual presentations of a historical age of chivalry. He continues:\nThe more closely we look into history, the more clearly shall we perceive that the system of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries in which it is said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty... we are forced to confess that it is necessary to antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.\nHistory.\nEurope before 1170: Courtliness and the noble \"habitus\".\nPrior to codified chivalry, there was the uncodified code of noble conduct that focused on the , which can be translated as a wise, honest, and sensible man. This uncodified code\u2014referred to as the noble \u2014is a term for the environment of behavioural and material expectations generated by all societies and classes. As a modern idea, it was pioneered by the French philosopher/sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, even though a precedent exists for the concept as far back as the works of Aristotle. Crouch in 2019 argued that the on which \"the superstructure of chivalry\" was built and the was a part, were recognised by contemporaries as components of \"courtoisie\" (from Latin \"curialitas\") which was defined as superior conduct appropriate to the aristocratic hall (\"court\" or \"curia\"). He saw it as being taught within the confines of the hall by its senior figures to youths confided to the lord and his household for their social upbringing. Crouch suggested courtliness had existed long before 1100 and preceded the codified medieval noble conduct we call chivalry, which he sees as beginning between 1170 and 1220.\nThe pre-chivalric noble as discovered by Mills and Gautier and elaborated by Stephen Jaeger and David Crouch are as follows:\nFrom the 12th century onward, chivalry came to be understood as a moral, religious, and social code of knightly conduct. The particulars of the code varied, but codes would emphasise the virtues of courage, honour, and service. Chivalry also came to refer to an idealisation of the life and manners of the knight at home in his castle and with his court. The code of chivalry, as it was known during the late medieval age, developed between 1170 and 1220.\nThe Crisis of Courtliness and Rise of Chivalry.\nCourtliness remained a recognised form of superior conduct in medieval European society throughout the middle ages. Courtly behaviour was expected of all aristocrats and its norms were integrated into chivalric literature. But as Crouch demonstrated courtliness (unlike chivalry) was not confined to noble society. There are examples of servants, merchants, clergy and free peasants being commended for their 'courtly' behaviour in medieval literature. His explanation for the appearance of chivalry as a recognisable and prescriptive code of behaviour is tied into the more exclusive definition of nobility that appears in the late 12th century. This had a particular impact on the professional horse warrior, the knight. Retained knights were a prominent feature of the households of barons, counts and princes, and were thought to be proper associates of their lords. As such knights adopted the fashions and behaviours of their lords. In many cases knights were often drawn from the younger sons of noble families so they would regard themselves as being noble too, if less noble than their lords. Crouch locates the tipping point of the nobilising of the knight as in the households of the sons of King Henry II of England, and in particular his eldest son, the Henry the Young King (died 1183). Young Henry lived a lavish lifestyle of unprecedented expense focussed on the great northern French tourneying society of the 1170s and 1180s. Since Young Henry had no domains to rule, his father was willing to fund the itinerant playboy lifestyle of his son to distract him from meddling in his realms, and also to stake a claim to the cultural high ground over the other European princes of the day. Young Henry was nonetheless heavily criticised for his wasteful and hedonistic life, and Crouch finds it significant that the first known work which used the knight as a moral exemplar and as a definitive nobleman, the \"De Re Militari\" of Ralph Niger (c. 1187) was written by the young man's former chaplain, in part as a moral defence of the knightly lifestyle.\nCrouch suggests another reason why chivalry coalesced as a noble code in the late 12th century in his analysis of conduct literature. He suggests that the courtly habitus underwent a crisis as its moral failure became obvious to writers, particularly in the materialism that motivated courtly society. Crouch sees the \"Roman des Eles\" of the poet-knight Raoul de Houdenc, as a critique of courtliness and its failures. Raoul's solution is to focus moral eminence on the figure of the knight, who is to be the avatar of a new moral nobility, set above all other males. A knight was to eschew materialism (\"envie\") and to embrace noble generosity (\"largesce\").\nThemes of chivalric literature.\nIn medieval literature, chivalry can be classified into three overlapping areas:\nDifferent weight given to different areas produced different strands of chivalry:\nOrigins in military ethos.\nEmerging with the knight's character and the chivalric ethos were novel elements: revised social status, innovative military tactics, and fresh literary themes. Chivalric codes encompassed regulations such as pledging loyalty to the overlord and upholding warfare rules. These rules dictated refraining from attacking a defenseless opponent and prioritizing the capture of fellow nobles for later ransom instead of immediate harm, akin to adhering to a perceived codified law. The chivalric ideals are based on those of the early medieval warrior class, and martial exercise and military virtue remain integral parts of chivalry until the end of the medieval period, as the reality on the battlefield changed with the development of Early Modern warfare, and increasingly restricted it to the tournament ground and duelling culture. The joust remained the primary example of knightly display of martial skill throughout the Renaissance (the last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in 1602).\nThe martial skills of the knight carried over to the practice of the hunt, and hunting expertise became an important aspect of courtly life in the later medieval period (see terms of venery). Related to chivalry was the practice of heraldry and its elaborate rules of displaying coats of arms as it emerged in the High Middle Ages.\nChivalry and Christianity.\nChristianity had a modifying influence on the classical concept of heroism and virtue, nowadays identified with the virtues of chivalry. The Peace and Truce of God in the 10th century was one such example, which placed limits on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and also help the church maintain peace. At the same time the church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the just war; and liturgies were introduced which blessed a knight's sword, . In the Grail romances and \"Chevalier au Cygne\", it was the ethos of the Christian knighthood that its way of life was to please God, and chivalry was an order of God. Chivalry as a Christian vocation combined Teutonic heroic values with the militant tradition of Old Testament.\nThe first noted support for chivalric vocation, or the establishment of a knightly class to ensure the sanctity and legitimacy of Christianity, was written in 930 by Odo, abbot of Cluny, in the \"Vita of St. Gerald of Aurillac\", which argued that the sanctity of Christ and Christian doctrine can be demonstrated through the legitimate unsheathing of the \"sword against the enemy\". In the 11th century, the concept of a \"knight of Christ\" () gained currency in France, Spain, and Italy. These concepts of \"religious chivalry\" were further elaborated in the era of the Crusades, with the Crusades themselves often seen as a chivalrous enterprise. The military orders of the crusades which developed in this period came to be seen as the earliest flowering of chivalry, and some of their opponents like Saladin were likewise depicted as chivalrous adversaries. It remains unclear to what extent the notable military figures of this period\u2014such as Saladin, Godfrey of Bouillon, William Marshal, or Bertrand du Guesclin\u2014actually did set new standards of knightly behaviour, or to what extent they merely behaved according to existing models of conduct which came in retrospect to be interpreted along the lines of the \"chivalry\" ideal of the Late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, chivalry and crusades were not the same thing. While the crusading ideology had largely influenced the ethic of chivalry during its formative times, chivalry itself was related to a whole range of martial activities and aristocratic values which had no necessary linkage with crusading.\nThe Virgin Mary was venerated by multiple chivalric orders, including the Teutonic Knights, who honored her as their patroness. The medieval development of chivalry, with the concept of the honour of a lady and the ensuing knightly devotion to it, not only derived from the thinking about Mary, but also contributed to it. Although women were at times viewed as the source of evil, it was Mary who as mediator to God was a source of refuge for man. The development of medieval Mariology and the changing attitudes towards women paralleled each other.\nInfluence of the Moors and Romans.\nThe works of Roman poets like Ovid and Cicero bore some similarities to the typical depiction of romance in chivalric literature during the Middle Ages. In Ovid's works, lovers \"became sleepless, grew pale, and lost their appetite,\" while Cicero's works celebrated the \"ennobling power of love\". Some scholars also point to the romantic poetry of the Arabs as antecedents to the depiction of courtly love in medieval European literature. In the works of the Cordoban author Ibn Hazm, for example, \"lovers develop passions for slave boys as well as girls, interchangeably, and the slave is recognized as now the master of his beloved.\" Ibn Hazm's \"The Ring of the Dove\" is a noteworthy depiction of a lover's extreme submissiveness.\nMedieval courtly literature glorifies the valour, tactics, and ideals of both Moors and ancient Romans. For example, the ancient handbook of warfare written by Vegetius called \"De re militari\" was translated into French in the 13th century as \"L'Art de chevalerie\" by Jean de Meun. Later writers also drew from Vegetius, such as Honor\u00e9 Bonet, who wrote the 14th century \"L'Arbes des batailles\", which discussed the morals and laws of war. In the 15th century, Christine de Pizan combined themes from Vegetius, Bonet, and Frontinus in \"Livre des faits d'armes et de chevalerie\".\nLate Middle Ages.\nIn the 14th century, Jean Froissart wrote his \"Chronicles\" which captured much of the Hundred Years' War, including the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and later the Battle of Poitiers both of which saw the defeat of the French nobility by armies made up largely of common men using longbows. The chivalric tactic employed by the French armoured nobility, namely bravely charging the opposition in the face of a hail of arrows, failed repeatedly. Froissart noted the subsequent attacks by common English and Welsh archers upon the fallen French knights.\n\"Chronicles\" also captured a series of uprisings by common people against the nobility, such as the Jacquerie and The Peasant's Revolt and the rise of the common man to leadership ranks within armies. Many of these men were promoted during the Hundred Years' War but were later left in France when the English nobles returned home, and became mercenaries in the Free Companies, for example John Hawkwood, the mercenary leader of White Company. The rise of effective, paid soldiery replaced noble soldiery during this period, leading to a new class of military leader without any adherence to the chivalric code.\nChivalry underwent a revival and elaboration of chivalric ceremonial and rules of etiquette in the 14th century that was examined by Johan Huizinga in \"The Waning of the Middle Ages\", which dedicates a chapter to \"The idea of chivalry\". In contrasting the literary standards of chivalry with the actual warfare of the age, the historian finds the imitation of an ideal past illusory; in an aristocratic culture such as Burgundy and France at the close of the Middle Ages, \"to be representative of true culture means to produce by conduct, by customs, by manners, by costume, by deportment, the illusion of a heroic being, full of dignity and honour, of wisdom, and, at all events, of courtesy... The dream of past perfection ennobles life and its forms, fills them with beauty and fashions them anew as forms of art\".\nIn the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes. The sons of the bourgeoisie were educated at aristocratic courts, where they were trained in the manners of the knightly class. This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the courtesy book, which were guides to the behaviour of \"gentlemen\". Thus, the post-medieval gentlemanly code of the value of a man's honour, respect for women, and a concern for those less fortunate, is directly derived from earlier ideals of chivalry and historical forces that created it.\nJapan was the only country that banned the use of firearms completely to maintain ideals of chivalry and acceptable form of combat. In 1543, Japan established a government monopoly on firearms. The Japanese government destroyed firearms and enforced a preference for traditional Japanese weapons.\nCriticism.\nMedieval historian Richard W. Kaeuper saw chivalry as a central focus in the study of the European Middle Ages that was too often presented as a civilizing and stabilizing influence in the turbulent Middle Ages. On the contrary, Kaueper argues \"that in the problem of public order the knights themselves played an ambivalent, problematic role and that the guides to their conduct that chivalry provided were in themselves complex and problematic.\" Many of the codes and ideals of chivalry were contradictory: when knights did live up to them, they did not lead to a more \"ordered and peaceful society\". The tripartite conception of medieval European society (those who pray, those who fight, and those who work) along with other linked subcategories of monarchy and aristocracy, worked in congruence with knighthood to reform the institution in an effort \"to secure public order in a society just coming into its mature formation.\"4\nKaeuper says that knighthood and the worldview of \"those who fight\" was pre-Christian in many ways and outside the purview of the church, at least initially. The church saw it as a duty to reform and guide knights in a way that weathered the disorderly, martial, and chauvinistic elements of chivalry. Royalty also clashed with knighthood over the conduct of warfare and personal disputes between knights and other knights (and even between knights and aristocracy). While the worldview of \"those who work\" (the burgeoning merchant class and bourgeoisie) was still in incubation, Kaeuper states that the social and economic class that would end up defining modernity was fundamentally at odds with knights, and those with chivalrous valor saw the values of commerce as beneath them. Those who engaged in commerce and derived their value system from it could be confronted with violence by knights.\nAccording to British historian David Crouch, many early writers on medieval chivalry cannot be trusted as accurate sources, because they sometimes have \"polemical purpose which colours their prose\". As for Kenelm Henry Digby and L\u00e9on Gautier, chivalry was a means to transform their corrupt and secular worlds. Gautier also emphasized that chivalry originated from the Teutonic forests and was brought up into civilization by the Catholic Church. Charles Mills used chivalry \"to demonstrate that the Regency gentleman was the ethical heir of a great moral estate, and to provide an inventory of its treasure\". Mills also stated that chivalry was a social, not a military phenomenon, with its key features: generosity, fidelity, liberality, and courtesy.\nModern times.\nEnd of chivalry.\nChivalry was dynamic; it adjusted in response to local situations, and this probably led to its demise. There were many chivalric groups in England as imagined by Sir Thomas Malory when he wrote \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" in the late 15th century; perhaps each group created its own chivalric ideology. Malory's perspective reflects the condition of 15th-century chivalry. When \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" was printed, William Caxton urged knights to read the romance with an expectation that reading about chivalry could unite a community of knights already divided by the Wars of the Roses.\nDuring the early Tudor rule in England, some knights still fought according to that ethos. Fewer knights were engaged in active warfare because battlefields during this century were generally the arena of professional infantrymen, with less opportunity for knights to show chivalry. It was the beginning of the demise of the knight. The rank of knight never faded, but Queen Elizabeth I ended the tradition that any knight could create another, making this exclusively the preserve of the monarch. Christopher Wilkins contends that Sir Edward Woodville, who rode from battle to battle across Europe and died in 1488 in Brittany, was the last knight errant who witnessed the fall of the Age of Chivalry and the rise of modern European warfare. By the time the Middle Ages came to an end, the code of chivalry was gone.\nModern manifestations and revivals.\nChivalry!\u2014why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection\u2014the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant\u2014Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.\u2014Walter Scott, \"Ivanhoe\" (1820)\nThe chivalric ideal persisted into the early modern and modern period. The custom of founding chivalric orders by Europe's monarchs and high nobility peaked in the late medieval period, but it persisted during the Renaissance and well into the Baroque and early modern period, with e.g. the Tuscan Order of Saint Stephen (1561), the French Order of Saint Louis (1693) or the Anglo-Irish Order of St. Patrick (1783), and numerous dynastic orders of knighthood remain active in countries that retain a tradition of monarchy.\nAt the same time, with the change of courtly ideas during the Baroque period, the ideals of chivalry began to be seen as dated, or \"medieval\". \"Don Quixote\", published in 1605\u201315, burlesqued the medieval chivalric novel or \"romance\" by ridiculing the stubborn adherence to the chivalric code in the face of the modern world as anachronistic, giving rise to the term Quixotism. Conversely, elements of Romanticism sought to revive such \"medieval\" ideals or aesthetics in the late 18th and early 19th century.\nThe behavioural code of military officers down to the Napoleonic era, the American Civil War (especially as idealised in the \"Lost Cause\" mythology), and to some extent even to World War I, was still strongly modelled on the historical ideals, resulting in a pronounced duelling culture, which in some parts of Europe also held sway over the civilian life of the upper classes. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, however, the military threat from the \"infidel\" disappeared. The European wars of religion spanned much of the early modern period and consisted of infighting between factions of various Christian denominations. This process of confessionalization ultimately gave rise to a new military ethos based on nationalism rather than \"defending the faith against the infidel\".\nSocial commentators of the Victorian era advocated for a revival of chivalry in order to remedy the ill effects of the Industrial Revolution. Thomas Carlyle's \"Captains of Industry\" were to lead a \"Chivalry of Labour\", a beneficent form of governance that is hierarchical yet fraternal in nature, rather than materialistic. John Ruskin's \"Ideal Commonwealth\" took chivalry as one of its basic characteristics.\nFrom the early modern period, the term \"gallantry\" (from \"galant\", the Baroque ideal of refined elegance) rather than \"chivalry\" became used for the proper behaviour of upper-class men towards upper-class women. In the 19th century, there were attempts to revive chivalry for the purposes of the gentleman of that time. Kenelm Henry Digby wrote his \"The Broad-Stone of Honour\" for this purpose, offering the definition: \"Chivalry is only a name for that general spirit or state of mind which disposes men to heroic actions, and keeps them conversant with all that is beautiful and sublime in the intellectual and moral world.\"\nThe pronouncedly masculine virtues of chivalry came under attack on the parts of the masculist and upper-class suffragettes campaigning for gender equality in the early 20th century, and with the decline of the military ideals of duelling culture and of European aristocracies in general following the catastrophe of World War I, the ideals of chivalry became widely seen as outmoded by the mid-20th century. As a material reflection of this process, the dress sword lost its position as an indispensable part of a gentleman's wardrobe, a development described as an \"archaeological terminus\" by Ewart Oakeshott, as it concluded the long period during which the sword had been a visible attribute of the free man, beginning as early as three millennia ago with the Bronze Age sword.\nDuring the 20th century, the chivalrous ideal of protecting women came to be seen as a trope of melodrama (\"damsel in distress\"). The term \"chivalry\" retains a certain currency in sociology, in reference to the general tendency of men, and of society in general, to lend more attention offering protection from harm to women than to men, or in noting gender gaps in life expectancy, health, etc., also expressed in media bias giving significantly more attention to female than to male victims.\nAccording to William Manchester, General Douglas MacArthur was a chivalric warrior who fought a war with the intention to conquer the enemy, eliminating their ability to strike back, then treated them with the understanding and kindness due their honour and courage. One prominent model of his chivalrous conduct was in World War II and his treatment of the Japanese at the end of the war. On May 12, 1962, MacArthur gave a famous speech in front of the cadets of United States Military Academy at West Point by referring to a great moral code, the code of conduct and chivalry, when emphasizing duty, honour, and country.\nMasculism.\nWith the rise of masculism, chivalry was criticized in terms of men's rights. Ernest Bax described chivalry as \"the deprivation, the robbery from men of the most elementary personal rights in order to endow women with privileges at the expense of men\" in \"The fraud of feminism\" (1913), and criticized the Ladies First that took place in the Titanic sinking.\nCriticism of chivalry.\nMiguel de Cervantes, in Part I of \"Don Quixote\" (1605), attacks chivalric literature as historically inaccurate and therefore harmful, though he was in agreement with many so-called chivalric principles and guides to behavior. He toyed with but never intended to write a chivalric romance that was historically truthful.\nPeter Wright criticizes the tendency to produce singular descriptions of chivalry, claiming there are many variations or \"chivalries\". Among the different chivalries, Wright includes \"military chivalry\" complete with its code of conduct and proper contexts, and woman-directed \"romantic chivalry\" complete with its code of conduct and proper contexts, among others.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCross-cultural comparisons.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Inspired by the rebellions in the 1820s and 1830s against the outcome of the Congress of Vienna, the unification process was precipitated by the Revolutions of 1848, and reached completion in 1870 after the capture of Rome and its designation as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy.\nIndividuals who played a major part in the struggle for unification and liberation from foreign domination included King Victor Emmanuel II; politician, economist and statesman Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour; general Giuseppe Garibaldi; and journalist and politician Giuseppe Mazzini. Borrowing from the old Latin title \"Pater Patriae\" of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of \"Father of the Fatherland\" (). Even after 1870, many ethnic Italian-speakers (Italians in Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot Italians, Ni\u00e7ard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian Italians, and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy, planting the seeds of Italian irredentism.\nItaly celebrates the anniversary of the unification on 17 March (the date of proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy). Some of the states that had been envisaged as part of the unification process (\"terre irredente\") did not join the Kingdom until after Italy defeated Austria-Hungary in World War I, culminating in the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at Altare della Patria in Rome.\nBackground.\nFrom ancient times to early modern era.\nItaly was unified by the Roman Republic in the latter part of the third century BCE. For 700 years, it was a \"de facto\" territorial extension of the capital of the Roman Republic and Empire, and for a long time experienced a privileged status but was not converted into a province. Under Augustus, the previous differences in municipal and political rights were abolished and Roman Italy was subdivided into administrative regions ruled directly by the Roman Senate.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy remained united under the Ostrogothic Kingdom and after 568 was disputed between the Kingdom of the Lombards and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, losing its unity for centuries. Following conquest by the Frankish Empire, the title of King of Italy merged with the office of Holy Roman Emperor; however, the emperor was an absentee German-speaking foreigner who had little interest in governing Italy and indeed never controlled the entire peninsula. As a result, Italy gradually developed into a system of city-states. Southern Italy was governed by the long-lasting Kingdom of Sicily or Kingdom of Naples, which had been established by the Normans. Central Italy was governed by the pope as a temporal kingdom known as the Papal States.\nThis situation persisted through the Renaissance but began to deteriorate with the rise of modern nation-states in the early modern period. Italy, including the Papal States, then became the site of proxy wars between the major powers, notably the Holy Roman Empire (including Austria), Spain, and France. Harbingers of national unity appeared in the treaty of the Italic League, in 1454, and the 15th century foreign policy of Cosimo de' Medici and Lorenzo de' Medici. Leading Renaissance Italian writers Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli and Guicciardini expressed opposition to foreign domination. Petrarch stated that the \"ancient valour in Italian hearts is not yet dead\" in \"Italia Mia\". Machiavelli later quoted four verses from \"Italia Mia\" in \"The Prince\", which looked forward to a political leader who would unite Italy \"to free her from the barbarians\".\nThe Italian Wars saw 65 years of French attacks on some of the Italian states, starting with Charles VIII's invasion of Naples in 1494. However, the Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559) saw parts of Italy fall under the direct or indirect control of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. However, the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg, which ruled the Spanish Empire, continued to rule southern Italy and the Duchy of Milan until the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314). Following this war the Austrian Habsburgs struggled for dominance with the Spanish Bourbons until the end of the War of the Austrian Succession.\nA sense of Italian national identity was reflected in Gian Rinaldo Carli's \"Della Patria degli Italiani\", written in 1764. It told how a stranger entered a caf\u00e9 in Milan and puzzled its occupants by saying that he was neither a foreigner nor a Milanese. \"'Then what are you?' they asked. 'I am an Italian', he explained.\"\nFrench Revolution and Napoleonic era.\nThe Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792\u201397 when a series of client republics were set up. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last Roman-German Emperor, Francis II, after its defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. French rule destroyed the old structures of feudalism in Italy and introduced modern ideas and efficient legal authority; it provided much of the intellectual force and social capital that fueled unification movements for decades after the First French Empire collapsed in 1814.\nThe French Republic spread republican principles, and the institutions of republican governments promoted citizenship over the rule of the Bourbons and Habsburgs and other dynasties. The reaction against any outside control challenged Napoleon Bonaparte's choice of rulers. As Napoleon's reign began to fail, the rulers he had installed tried to keep their thrones (among them Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, Viceroy of Italy, and Joachim Murat, King of Naples) further feeding nationalistic sentiments. Beauharnais tried to get Austrian approval for his succession to Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, and on 30 March 1815, Murat issued the Rimini Proclamation, which called on Italians to revolt against their Austrian occupiers.\nDuring the Napoleonic era, in 1797, the first official adoption of the Italian tricolour as a national flag by a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic, a Napoleonic sister republic of Revolutionary France, took place, on the basis of the events following the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) which, among its ideals, advocated the national self-determination. This event is celebrated by the Tricolour Day. The Italian national colours appeared for the first time on a tricolour cockade in 1789, anticipating by seven years the first green, white and red Italian military war flag, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion in 1796.\nReaction (1815\u20131848).\nAfter Napoleon fell (1814), the Congress of Vienna (1814\u201315) restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments. Italy was again controlled largely by the Austrian Empire, as they directly controlled the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia and indirectly the duchies of Parma, Modena and Tuscany.\nWith the fall of Napoleon and the restoration of the absolutist monarchical regimes, the Italian tricolour went underground, becoming the symbol of the patriotic ferments that began to spread in Italy and the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence. The Italian tricolour waved for the first time in the history of the Risorgimento on 11 March 1821 in the Cittadella of Alessandria, during the revolutions of 1820s, after the oblivion caused by the restoration of the absolutist monarchical regimes.\nAn important figure of this period was Francesco Melzi d'Eril, serving as vice-president of the Napoleonic Italian Republic (1802\u20131805) and consistent supporter of the Italian unification ideals that would lead to the Italian Risorgimento shortly after his death.\nMeanwhile, artistic and literary sentiment also turned towards nationalism; Vittorio Alfieri, Francesco Lomonaco and Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo are generally considered three great literary precursors of Italian nationalism, but the most famous proto-nationalist work was Alessandro Manzoni's \"I promessi sposi\" (\"The Betrothed\"), widely read as thinly veiled allegorical criticism of Austrian rule. Published in 1827 and extensively revised in the following years, the 1840 version of \"I Promessi Sposi\" used a standardized version of the Tuscan dialect, a conscious effort by the author to provide a language and force people to learn it.\nThree ideals of unification appeared. Vincenzo Gioberti, a Piedmontese priest, had suggested a confederation of Italian states under the leadership of the pope in his 1842 book \"Of the Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians\". Pope Pius IX at first appeared interested but he turned reactionary and led the battle against liberalism and nationalism.\nGiuseppe Mazzini and Carlo Cattaneo wanted the unification of Italy under a federal republic, which proved too extreme for most nationalists. The middle position was proposed by Cesare Balbo (1789\u20131853) as a confederation of separate Italian states led by Piedmont.\nCarbonari.\nOne of the most influential revolutionary groups was the Carbonari, a secret political discussion group formed in southern Italy early in the 19th century. After 1815, Freemasonry in Italy was repressed and discredited due to its French connections. A void was left that the Carbonari filled with a movement that closely resembled Freemasonry but with a commitment to Italian nationalism and no association with Napoleon and his government. The response came from middle-class professionals and businessmen and some intellectuals. The Carbonari disowned Napoleon but nevertheless were inspired by the principles of the French Revolution regarding liberty, equality and fraternity. They developed their own rituals and were strongly anticlerical. The Carbonari movement spread across Italy.\nConservative governments feared the Carbonari, imposing stiff penalties on men discovered to be members. Nevertheless, the movement survived and continued to be a source of political turmoil in Italy from 1820 until after unification. The Carbonari condemned Napoleon III (who, as a young man, had fought on their side) to death for failing to unite Italy, and the group almost succeeded in assassinating him in 1858, when Felice Orsini, Giovanni Andrea Pieri, Carlo Di Rudio and Andrea Gomez threw three bombs at him. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time or other members of this organization. The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and to establish constitutional government. Although contributing some service to the cause of Italian unity, historians such as Cornelia Shiver doubt that their achievements were proportional to their pretensions.\nGiuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi.\nMany leading Carbonari revolutionaries wanted a republic, two of the most prominent being Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi. Mazzini's activity in revolutionary movements caused him to be imprisoned soon after he joined. While in prison, he concluded that Italy could\u00a0\u2212 and therefore should\u00a0\u2212 be unified, and he formulated a program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with Rome as its capital. Following his release in 1831, he went to Marseille in France, where he organized a new political society called \"La Giovine Italia\" (Young Italy), whose mottos were \"\"Dio e Popolo\" ('God and People') and \"Unione, Forza e Libert\u00e0\"\" ('Union, Strength and Freedom\"), which sought the unification of Italy.\nGaribaldi, a native of Nice (then part of Piedmont), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834 and was sentenced to death. He escaped to South America, spending fourteen years in exile, taking part in several wars, and learning the art of guerrilla warfare before his return to Italy in 1848.\nEarly revolutionary activity.\nExiles and European and masculine ideals.\nMany of the key intellectual and political leaders operated from exile; most Risorgimento patriots lived and published their work abroad after successive failed revolutions. Exile became a central theme of the foundational legacy of the Risorgimento as the narrative of the Italian nation fighting for independence. The exiles were deeply immersed in European ideas, and often hammered away at what Europeans saw as Italian vices, especially effeminacy and indolence. These negative stereotypes emerged from Enlightenment notions of national character that stressed the influence of the environment and history on a people's moral predisposition. Italian exiles both challenged and embraced the stereotypes and typically presented gendered interpretations of Italy's political \"degeneration\". They called for a masculine response to feminine weaknesses as the basis of national regeneration and fashioned their image of the future Italian nation firmly in the standards of European nationalism.\nTwo Sicilies insurrection.\nIn 1820, liberal Spaniards successfully revolted, demanding a Constitution, which influenced the development of a similar movement in Italy. Inspired by the Spaniards, a regiment in the army of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, commanded by Guglielmo Pepe, a Carbonaro (member of the secret republican organization), mutinied, conquering the peninsular part of Two Sicilies. The king, Ferdinand I, agreed to enact a new constitution. The revolutionaries, although, failed to court popular support and fell to Austrian troops of the Holy Alliance. Ferdinand abolished the constitution and began systematically persecuting known revolutionaries. Many supporters of revolution in Sicily, including the scholar Michele Amari, were forced into exile during the decades that followed.\nPiedmont insurrection.\nThe leader of the 1821 revolutionary movement in Piedmont was Santorre di Santarosa, who wanted to remove the Austrians and unify Italy under the House of Savoy. The Piedmont revolt started in Alessandria, where troops adopted the green, white, and red \"tricolore\" of the Cisalpine Republic. King Victor Emmanuel I abdicated in response, and the regent for the new king, Prince Charles Albert, approved a new constitution to appease the revolutionaries, but when King Charles Felix returned he disavowed the constitution and requested assistance from the Holy Alliance. Di Santarosa's troops were defeated, and the would-be Piedmontese revolutionary fled to Paris.\nIn Milan, Silvio Pellico and Pietro Maroncelli organized several attempts to weaken the hold of the Austrian despotism by indirect educational means. In October 1820, Pellico and Maroncelli were arrested on the charge of carbonarism and imprisoned.\n1830 insurrections.\nDenis Mack Smith argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Few people in 1830 believed that an Italian nation might exist. There were eight states in the peninsula, each with distinct laws and traditions. No one had had the desire or the resources to revive Napoleon's partial experiment in unification. The settlement of 1814\u201315 had merely restored regional divisions, with the added disadvantage that the decisive victory of Austria over France temporarily hindered Italians in playing off their former oppressors against each other. ... Italians who, like Ugo Foscolo and Gabriele Rossetti, harboured patriotic sentiments, were driven into exile. The largest Italian state, the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with its 8 million inhabitants, seemed aloof and indifferent: Sicily and Naples had once been ruled by Spain, and it had always been foreign to the rest of Italy. The common people in each region, and even the intellectual elite, spoke their mutually unintelligible dialects, and lacked the least vestiges of national consciousness. They wanted good government, not self-government, and had welcomed Napoleon and the French as more equitable and efficient than their native dynasties, many of which had died out in the 18th century.\nAfter 1830, revolutionary sentiment in favour of a unified Italy began to experience a resurgence, and a series of insurrections laid the groundwork for the creation of one nation along the Italian peninsula.\nThe Duke of Modena, Francis IV, was an ambitious man, and he hoped to become king of northern Italy by increasing his territory. In 1826, Francis made it clear that he would not act against those who subverted opposition toward the unification of Italy. Encouraged by the declaration, revolutionaries in the region began to organize.\nDuring the July Revolution of 1830 in France, revolutionaries forced King Charles X to abdicate and created the July Monarchy with encouragement from the new French king, Louis-Philippe I. Louis-Philippe had promised revolutionaries such as Ciro Menotti that he would intervene if Austria tried to interfere in Italy with troops. Fearing he would lose his throne, Louis-Philippe did not, however, intervene in Menotti's planned uprising. The Duke of Modena abandoned his Carbonari supporters, arrested Menotti and other conspirators in 1831, and once again conquered his duchy with help from the Austrian troops. Menotti was executed, and the idea of a revolution centred in Modena faded.\nAt the same time, other insurrections arose in the Papal Legations of Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Forl\u00ec, Ancona and Perugia. These successful revolutions, which adopted the \"tricolore\" in place of the Papal flag, quickly spread to cover all the Papal Legations, and their newly installed local governments proclaimed the creation of a united Italian nation. The revolts in Modena and the Papal Legations inspired similar activity in the Duchy of Parma, where the \"tricolore\" flag was adopted. The Parmese duchess Marie Louise left the city during the political upheaval.\nInsurrection provinces planned to unite as the Italian United Provinces, which prompted Pope Gregory XVI to ask for Austrian help against the rebels. Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich warned Louis-Philippe that Austria had no intention of letting Italian matters be and that French intervention would not be tolerated. Louis-Philippe sent a naval expedition to Ancona, which restored Papal authority there and even arrested Italian patriots living in France. In early 1831, the Austrian army began its march across the Italian peninsula, slowly crushing resistance in each province that had revolted. This military action suppressed much of the fledgling revolutionary movement.\nRevolutions of 1848\u20131849 and First Italian War of Independence.\nIn 1844, two brothers from Venice, Attilio and Emilio Bandiera, members of Young Italy, planned to make a raid on the Calabrian coast against the Kingdom of Two Sicilies in support of Italian unification. They assembled a band of about twenty men ready to sacrifice their lives and set sail on their venture on 12 June 1844. Four days later they landed near Crotone, intending to go to Cosenza, liberate the political prisoners, and issue their proclamations. Tragically for the Bandiera brothers, they did not find the insurgent band they were told awaited them, so they moved towards La Sila. They were ultimately betrayed by one of their party, the Corsican Pietro Boccheciampe, and by some peasants who believed them to be Turkish pirates. A detachment of gendarmes and volunteers were sent against them, and after a short fight, the whole band was taken prisoner and escorted to Cosenza, where a number of Calabrians who had taken part in a previous rising were also under arrest. The Bandiera brothers and their nine companions were executed by firing squad; some accounts state they cried \"Viva l'Italia!\" ('Long live Italy!') as they fell. The moral effect was enormous throughout Italy, the action of the authorities was universally condemned, and the martyrdom of the Bandiera brothers bore fruit in the subsequent revolutions.\nIn this context, in 1847, the first public performance of the song \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", the Italian national anthem since 1946, took place. \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", written by Goffredo Mameli set to music by Michele Novaro, is also known as the \"Inno di Mameli\", after the author of the lyrics, or \"Fratelli d'Italia\", from its opening line.\nOn 5 January 1848, the revolutionary disturbances began with a civil disobedience strike in Lombardy, as citizens stopped smoking cigars and playing the lottery, which denied Austria the associated tax revenue. Shortly after this, revolts began on the island of Sicily and in Naples. In Sicily the revolt resulted in the proclamation of the Kingdom of Sicily with Ruggero Settimo as chairman of the independent state until 1849, when the Bourbon army took back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force.\nIn February 1848, there were revolts in Tuscany that were relatively nonviolent, after which Grand Duke Leopold II granted the Tuscans a constitution. A breakaway republican provisional government formed in Tuscany during February shortly after this concession. On 21 February, Pope Pius IX granted a constitution to the Papal States, which was both unexpected and surprising considering the historical recalcitrance of the Papacy. On 23 February 1848, King Louis Philippe of France was forced to flee Paris, and the Second French Republic was proclaimed. By the time the revolution in Paris occurred, three states of Italy had constitutions\u2014four if one considers Sicily to be a separate state.\nMeanwhile, in Lombardy, tensions increased until the Milanese and Venetians rose in revolt on 18 March 1848. The insurrection in Milan succeeded in expelling the Austrian garrison after five days of street fights\u201418\u201322 March (Cinque giornate di Milano). An Austrian army under Marshal Josef Radetzky besieged Milan, but due to the defection of many of his troops and the support of the Milanese for the revolt, they were forced to retreat to the Quadrilatero fortresses.\nSoon, Charles Albert, the King of Sardinia (who ruled Piedmont and Savoy), urged by the Venetians and Milanese to aid their cause, decided this was the moment to unify Italy and declared war on Austria (First Italian Independence War). After initial successes at Goito and Peschiera, he was decisively defeated by Radetzky at the Battle of Custoza on 24 July. An armistice was agreed to, and Radetzky regained control of all of Lombardy\u2013Venetia save Venice itself, where the Republic of San Marco was proclaimed under Daniele Manin.\nWhile Radetzky consolidated control of Lombardy\u2013Venetia and Charles Albert licked his wounds, matters took a more serious turn in other parts of Italy. The monarchs who had reluctantly agreed to constitutions in March came into conflict with their constitutional ministers. At first, the republics had the upper hand, forcing the monarchs to flee their capitals, including Pope Pius IX.\nInitially, Pius IX had been something of a reformer, but conflicts with the revolutionaries soured him on the idea of constitutional government. In November 1848, following the assassination of his Minister Pellegrino Rossi, Pius IX fled just before Giuseppe Garibaldi and other patriots arrived in Rome. In early 1849, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly, which proclaimed a Roman Republic on 9 February. On 2 February 1849, at a political rally held in the Tor di Nona, a young Roman priest, the Abb\u00e9 Carlo Arduini, had made a speech in which he had declared that the Temporal power of the Holy See was a \"historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality\". In early March 1849, Giuseppe Mazzini arrived in Rome and was appointed Chief Minister. In the Constitution of the Roman Republic, religious freedom was guaranteed by article 7, the independence of the pope as head of the Catholic Church was guaranteed by article 8 of the \"Principi fondamentali\", while the death penalty was abolished by article 5, and free public education was provided by article 8 of the \"Titolo I\".\nBefore the powers could respond to the founding of the Roman Republic, Charles Albert, whose army had been trained by the exiled Polish general Albert Chrzanowski, renewed the war with Austria. He was quickly defeated by Radetzky at Novara on 23 March 1849. Charles Albert abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel II, and Piedmontese ambitions to unite Italy or conquer Lombardy were, for the moment, brought to an end. The war ended with a treaty signed on 9 August. A popular revolt broke out in Brescia on the same day as the defeat at Novara, but was suppressed by the Austrians ten days later.\nThere remained the Roman and Venetian Republics. In April, a French force under Charles Oudinot was sent to Rome. Apparently, the French first wished to mediate between the pope and his subjects, but soon the French were determined to restore the pope. After a two-month siege, Rome capitulated on 29 June 1849 and the pope was restored. Garibaldi and Mazzini once again fled into exile\u2014in 1850 Garibaldi went to New York City. Meanwhile, the Austrians besieged Venice, which was defended by a volunteer army led by Daniele Manin and Guglielmo Pepe, who were forced to surrender on 24 August. Pro-independence fighters were hanged en masse in Belfiore, while the Austrians moved to restore order in central Italy, restoring the princes who had been expelled and re-establishing Papal control over the Legations. The revolutions were thus completely crushed.\nCavour and prospects for unification.\nMorale was of course badly weakened, but the dream of Risorgimento did not die. Instead, the Italian patriots learned some lessons that made them much more effective at the next opportunity in 1860. Military weakness was glaring, as the small Italian states were completely outmatched by France and Austria.\nFrance was a potential ally, and the patriots realized they had to focus all their attention on expelling Austria first, with a willingness to give the French whatever they wanted in return for essential military intervention. As a result of this France received Nice and Savoy in 1860. Secondly, the patriots realized that the pope was an enemy, and could never be the leader of a united Italy. Thirdly, they realized that republicanism was too weak a force. Unification had to be based on a strong monarchy, and in practice that meant reliance on Piedmont (the Kingdom of Sardinia) under King Victor Emmanuel II (1820\u20131878) of the House of Savoy.\nCamillo Benso, Count of Cavour (1810\u20131861) provided critical leadership. He was a modernizer interested in agrarian improvements, banks, railways and free trade. He opened a newspaper as soon as censorship allowed it: \"Il Risorgimento\" called for the independence of Italy, a league of Italian princes, and moderate reforms. He had the ear of the king and in 1852 became prime minister. He ran an efficient active government, promoting rapid economic modernization while upgrading the administration of the army and the financial and legal systems. He sought out support from patriots across Italy.\nIn 1855, the kingdom became an ally of Britain and France in the Crimean War, which gave Cavour's diplomacy legitimacy in the eyes of the great powers.\nTowards the Kingdom of Italy.\nPisacane fiasco.\nIn 1857, Carlo Pisacane, an aristocrat from Naples who had embraced Mazzini's ideas, decided to provoke a rising in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His small force landed on the island of Ponza. It overpowered guards and liberated hundreds of prisoners. In sharp contrast to his hypothetical expectations, there was no local uprising and the invaders were quickly overpowered. Pisacane was killed by angry locals who suspected he was leading a Romani band trying to steal their food.\nSecond Italian Independence War of 1859 and aftermath.\nThe Second War of Italian Independence began in April 1859 when the Sardinian Prime Minister Count Cavour found an ally in Napoleon III. Napoleon III signed a secret alliance and Cavour provoked Austria with military maneuvers and eventually led to the war in April 1859. Cavour called for volunteers to enlist in the Italian liberation. The Austrians planned to use their army to beat the Sardinians before the French could come to their aid. Austria had an army of 140,000 men, while the Sardinians had a mere 70,000 men by comparison. However, the Austrians' numerical strength was outweighed by an ineffectual leadership appointed by the Emperor on the basis of noble lineage, rather than military competency. Their army was slow to enter Piedmont, taking almost ten days to travel the to Turin. By this time, the French had reinforced the Sardinians, so the Austrians retreated.\nThe Austrians were defeated at the Battle of Magenta on 4 June and pushed back to Lombardy. Napoleon III's plans worked and at the Battle of Solferino, France and Sardinia defeated Austria and forced negotiations; at the same time, in the northern part of Lombardy, the Italian volunteers known as the Hunters of the Alps, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, defeated the Austrians at Varese and Como. On 12 July, the Armistice of Villafranca was signed. The settlement, by which Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia, left Austria in control of the Veneto and Mantua. The final arrangement was ironed out by \"back-room\" deals. This was because neither France, Austria, nor Sardinia wanted to risk another battle and could not handle further fighting. All of the sides were eventually unhappy with the outcome of the Second War of Italian Unification and expected another conflict in the future. In fact, Napoleon III and Cavour were mutually indebted: the first because he had withdrawn from the Second Italian War of Independence before the expected conquest of Venice, the second because he had allowed the uprisings to spread to the territories of central-northern Italy, thus going beyond what was agreed with the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement.\nSardinia annexed Lombardy from Austria; it later occupied and annexed the United Provinces of Central Italy, consisting of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Parma, the Duchy of Modena and Reggio and the Papal Legations on 22 March 1860. Sardinia handed Savoy and Nice over to France at the Treaty of Turin, a decision that was the consequence of the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement, on 24 March 1860, an event that caused the Ni\u00e7ard exodus, which was the emigration of a quarter of the Ni\u00e7ard Italians to Italy.\nGiuseppe Garibaldi was elected in 1871 in Nice at the National Assembly where he tried to promote the annexation of his hometown to the newborn Italian unitary state, but he was prevented from speaking. Because of this denial, between 1871 and 1872 there were riots in Nice, promoted by the Garibaldini and called \"Ni\u00e7ard Vespers\", which demanded the annexation of the city and its area to Italy. Fifteen Nice people who participated in the rebellion were tried and sentenced.\nExpedition of the Thousand.\nThus, by early 1860, only five states remained in Italy\u2014the Austrians in Venetia, the Papal States (now minus the Legations), the new expanded Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and San Marino.\nFrancis II of the Two Sicilies, the son and successor of Ferdinand II (the infamous \"King Bomba\"), had a well-organized army of 150,000 men. But his father's tyranny had inspired many secret societies, and the kingdom's Swiss mercenaries were unexpectedly recalled home under the terms of a new Swiss law that forbade Swiss citizens to serve as mercenaries. This left Francis with only his mostly unreliable native troops. It was a critical opportunity for the unification movement. In April 1860, separate insurrections began in Messina and Palermo in Sicily, both of which had demonstrated a history of opposing Neapolitan rule. These rebellions were easily suppressed by loyal troops.\nIn the meantime, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a native of Nice, was deeply resentful of the French annexation of his home city. He hoped to use his supporters to regain the territory. Cavour, terrified of Garibaldi provoking a war with France, persuaded Garibaldi to instead use his forces in the Sicilian rebellions. On 6 May 1860, Garibaldi and his cadre of about a thousand Italian volunteers (called \"I Mille\"), steamed from Quarto near Genoa, and, after a stop in Talamone on 11 May, landed near Marsala on the west coast of Sicily.\nNear Salemi, Garibaldi's army attracted scattered bands of rebels, and the combined forces defeated the Army of the Two Sicilies at the Battle of Calatafimi on 13 May. Within three days, the invading force had swelled to 4,000 men. On 14 May Garibaldi proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily, in the name of Victor Emmanuel. After waging various successful but hard-fought battles, Garibaldi advanced upon the Sicilian capital of Palermo, announcing his arrival by beacon-fires kindled at night. On 27 May the force began the Siege of Palermo, while a mass uprising of street and barricade fighting broke out within the city.\nWith Palermo deemed insurgent, Neapolitan general Ferdinando Lanza, arriving in Sicily with some 25,000 troops, furiously bombarded Palermo nearly to ruins. With the intervention of a British admiral, an armistice was declared, leading to the Neapolitan troops' departure and surrender of the town to Garibaldi and his much smaller army.\nThis resounding success demonstrated the weakness of the Neapolitan government. Garibaldi's fame spread and many Italians began to consider him a national hero. Doubt, confusion, and dismay overtook the Neapolitan court\u2014the king hastily summoned his ministry and offered to restore an earlier constitution, but these efforts failed to rebuild the people's trust in Bourbon governance.\nSix weeks after the surrender of Palermo, Garibaldi attacked Messina. Within a week, its citadel surrendered. Having conquered Sicily, Garibaldi proceeded to the mainland, crossing the Strait of Messina with the Neapolitan fleet at hand. The garrison at Reggio Calabria promptly surrendered. As he marched northward, the populace everywhere hailed him, and military resistance faded: on 18 and 21 August, the people of Basilicata and Apulia, two regions of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, independently declared their annexation to the Kingdom of Italy. At the end of August, Garibaldi was at Cosenza, and, on 5 September, at Eboli, near Salerno. Meanwhile, Naples had declared a state of siege, and on 6 September the king gathered the 4,000 troops still faithful to him and retreated over the River Volturno. The next day, Garibaldi, with a few followers, entered by train into Naples, where the people openly welcomed him.\nDefeat of the Kingdom of Naples.\nAlthough Garibaldi had easily taken the capital, the Neapolitan army had not joined the rebellion \"en masse\", holding firm along the River Volturno. Garibaldi's irregular bands of about 25,000 men could not drive away the king or take the fortresses of Capua and Gaeta without the help of the Royal Sardinian Army. The Sardinian army, however, could only arrive by traversing the Papal States, which extended across the entire center of the peninsula. Ignoring the political will of the Holy See, Garibaldi announced his intent to proclaim a \"Kingdom of Italy\" from Rome, the capital city of Pope Pius IX. Seeing this as a threat to the domain of the Catholic Church, Pius threatened excommunication for those who supported such an effort. Afraid that Garibaldi would attack Rome, Catholics worldwide sent money and volunteers for the Papal Army, which was commanded by General Louis Lamorici\u00e8re, a French exile.\nThe settling of the peninsular standoff now rested with Napoleon III. If he let Garibaldi have his way, Garibaldi would probably end the temporal sovereignty of the pope and make Rome the capital of Italy. Napoleon, however, may have arranged with Cavour to let the King of Sardinia free to take possession of Naples, Umbria and the other provinces, provided that Rome and the \"Patrimony of Saint Peter\" were left intact.\nIt was in this situation that a Sardinian force of two army corps, under generals Manfredo Fanti and Enrico Cialdini, marched to the frontier of the Papal States, its objective being not Rome but Naples. The Papal troops under Lamorici\u00e8re advanced against Cialdini, but were quickly defeated at the Battle of Castelfidardo and besieged in the fortress of Ancona, finally surrendering on 29 September. On 9 October, Victor Emmanuel arrived and took command. There was no longer a Papal army to oppose him, and the march southward proceeded unopposed.\nGaribaldi distrusted the pragmatic Cavour since Cavour was the man ultimately responsible for orchestrating the French annexation of the city of Nice, which was his birthplace. Nevertheless, he accepted the command of Victor Emmanuel. When the king entered Sessa Aurunca at the head of his army, Garibaldi willingly handed over his dictatorial power. After greeting Victor Emmanuel in Teano with the title of King of Italy, Garibaldi entered Naples riding beside the king. Garibaldi then retired to the island of Caprera, while the remaining work of unifying the peninsula was left to Victor Emmanuel.\nThe progress of the Sardinian army compelled Francis II to give up his line along the river, and he eventually took refuge with his best troops in the fortress of Gaeta. His courage boosted by his resolute young wife, Queen Marie Sophie, Francis mounted a stubborn defence that lasted three months. But European allies refused to provide him with aid, food and munitions became scarce, and disease set in, so the garrison was forced to surrender. Nonetheless, ragtag groups of Neapolitans loyal to Francis fought on against the Italian government for years to come.\nThe fall of Gaeta brought the unification movement to the brink of fruition\u2014only Lazio and Venetia remained to be added. On 18 February 1861, Victor Emmanuel assembled the deputies of the first Italian Parliament in Turin. On 17 March 1861, the Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel King of Italy, and on 27 March 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy, although it was not yet in the new kingdom.\nBorrowing from the old Latin title \"Pater Patriae\" of the Roman emperors, the Italians gave to King Victor Emmanuel II the epithet of \"Father of the Fatherland\" (). Three months later Cavour died, having seen his life's work nearly completed. When he was given the last rites, Cavour purportedly said: \"Italy is made. All is safe.\"\nThe repercussions on diplomatic relations.\nThe disapproval of the various European states culminated in the direct participation of the Sardinian army in the Expedition of the Thousand. In reaction, Spain and the Russian Empire interrupted diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Sardinia, while the Austrian Empire, which had not maintained relations with this country since 1859, after the Second Italian War of Independence, sent its troops to the Mincio border. France made no hostile statements, but recalled its ambassador. Queen Victoria and her prime minister John Russell convinced the Kingdom of Prussia not to hinder the ongoing process of Italian unification. On 26 October 1860, the same day as the meeting in Teano between the king and Garibaldi, Austria organized a congress in Warsaw to apply measures against the Kingdom of Sardinia, without success; held back by this crisis, Cavour was unable to be present at Teano.\nAfter the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, the United Kingdom and the Swiss Confederation were the first to recognize the new state (30 March 1861), followed by the United States on 13 April. France negotiated the presence of French troops in Rome and recognized the Kingdom of Italy on 15 June, shortly after Cavour's death. It was then Portugal's turn on 27 June, followed by Greece, the Ottoman Empire and the Scandinavian countries. The recognition of the Netherlands and Belgium occurred in two phases: they recognized the new title of Victor Emmanuel II in July, then the kingdom in November, after a long clash between conservatives and liberals in the Belgian parliament over the latter.\nRoman Question.\nMazzini was discontented with the perpetuation of monarchical government and continued to agitate for a republic. With the motto \"Free from the Alps to the Adriatic\", the unification movement set its gaze on Rome and Venice. There were obstacles, however. A challenge against the pope's temporal dominion was viewed with profound distrust by Catholics around the world, and there were French troops stationed in Rome. Victor Emmanuel was wary of the international repercussions of attacking the Papal States, and discouraged his subjects from participating in revolutionary ventures with such intentions.\nNonetheless, Garibaldi believed that the government would support him if he attacked Rome. Frustrated at inaction by the king, and bristling over perceived snubs, he came out of retirement to organize a new venture. In June 1862, he sailed from Genoa and landed again at Palermo, where he gathered volunteers for the campaign, under the slogan \"o Roma o Morte\" ('either Rome or Death'). The garrison of Messina, loyal to the king's instructions, barred their passage to the mainland. Garibaldi's force, now numbering two thousand, turned south and set sail from Catania. Garibaldi declared that he would enter Rome as a victor or perish beneath its walls. He landed at Melito on 14 August and marched at once into the Calabrian mountains.\nFar from supporting this endeavour, the Italian government was quite disapproving. General Cialdini dispatched a division of the regular army, under Colonel Pallavicino, against the volunteer bands. On 28 August the two forces met at Aspromonte. One of the regulars fired a chance shot, and several volleys followed, but Garibaldi forbade his men to return fire on fellow subjects of the Kingdom of Italy. The volunteers suffered several casualties, and Garibaldi himself was wounded; many were taken prisoner. Garibaldi was taken by steamer to Varignano, where he was honorably imprisoned for a time, but finally released.\nMeanwhile, Victor Emmanuel sought a safer means to the acquisition of the remaining Papal territory. He negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon for the removal of the French troops from Rome through a treaty. They agreed to the September Convention in September 1864, by which Napoleon agreed to withdraw the troops within two years. The pope was to expand his own army during that time so as to be self-sufficient. In December 1866, the last of the French troops departed from Rome, in spite of the efforts of the pope to retain them. By their withdrawal, Italy (excluding Venetia and Savoy) was freed from the presence of foreign soldiers.\nThe seat of government was moved in 1865 from Turin, the old Sardinian capital, to Florence. This arrangement created such disturbances in Turin that the king was forced to leave that city hastily for his new capital.\nThird War of Independence (1866).\nIn the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Austria contested with Prussia the position of leadership among the German states. The Kingdom of Italy seized the opportunity to capture Venetia from Austrian rule and allied itself with Prussia. Austria tried to persuade the Italian government to accept Venetia in exchange for non-intervention. However, on 8 April, Italy and Prussia signed an agreement that supported Italy's acquisition of Venetia, and on 20 June Italy issued a declaration of war on Austria. Within the context of Italian unification, the Austro-Prussian war is called the \"Third Independence War\", after the \"First\" (1848) and the \"Second\" (1859).\nVictor Emmanuel hastened to lead an army across the Mincio to the invasion of Venetia, while Garibaldi was to invade the Tyrol with his Hunters of the Alps. The Italian army encountered the Austrians at Custoza on 24 June and suffered a defeat. On 20 July the Regia Marina was defeated in the Battle of Lissa. The following day, Garibaldi's volunteers defeated an Austrian force in the Battle of Bezzecca, and moved toward Trento.\nMeanwhile, Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck saw that his own ends in the war had been achieved, and signed an armistice with Austria on 27 July. Italy followed, officially laying down its arms on 12 August. Garibaldi was recalled from his successful march and resigned with a brief telegram reading only \"Obbedisco\" ('I obey').\nPrussia's success on the northern front obliged Austria to cede Venetia (present-day Veneto and parts of Friuli) and the city of Mantua (the last remnant of the \"Quadrilatero\"). Under the terms of a peace treaty signed in Vienna on 12 October, Emperor Franz Joseph had already agreed to cede Venetia to Napoleon III in exchange for non-intervention in the Austro-Prussian War, and thus Napoleon ceded Venetia to Italy on 19 October, in exchange for the earlier Italian acquiescence to the French annexation of Savoy and Nice.\nIn the Treaty of Vienna, it was written that the annexation of Venetia would have become effective only after a referendum\u2014taken on 21 and 22 October\u2014to let the Venetian people express their will about being annexed or not to the Kingdom of Italy. Historians suggest that the referendum in Venetia was held under military pressure, as a mere 0.01% of voters (69 out of more than 642,000 ballots) voted against the annexation.\nAustrian forces put up some opposition to the invading Italians, to little effect. Victor Emmanuel entered Venice and Venetian land, and performed an act of homage in the Piazza San Marco.\nRome.\nMentana and Villa Glori.\nThe national party, with Garibaldi at its head, still aimed at the possession of Rome, as the historic capital of the peninsula. In 1867 Garibaldi made a second attempt to capture Rome, but the Papal army, strengthened with a new French auxiliary force, defeated his poorly armed volunteers at Mentana. Subsequently, a French garrison remained in Civitavecchia until August 1870, when it was recalled following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.\nBefore the defeat at Mentana on 3 November 1867, Enrico Cairoli, his brother Giovanni, and 70 companions had made a daring attempt to take Rome. The group had embarked in Terni and floated down the Tiber. Their arrival in Rome was to coincide with an uprising inside the city. On 22 October 1867, the revolutionaries inside Rome seized control of the Capitoline Hill and of Piazza Colonna. Unfortunately for the Cairoli and their companions, by the time they arrived at Villa Glori, on the northern outskirts of Rome, the uprising had already been suppressed. During the night of 22 October 1867, the group was surrounded by Papal Zouaves, and Giovanni was severely wounded. Enrico was mortally wounded and bled to death in Giovanni's arms.\nWith Cairoli dead, command was assumed by Giovanni Tabacchi who had retreated with the remaining volunteers into the villa, where they continued to fire at the papal soldiers. These also retreated in the evening to Rome. The survivors retreated to the positions of those led by Garibaldi on the Italian border.\nMemorial.\nAt the summit of Villa Glori, near the spot where Enrico died, there is a plain white column dedicated to the Cairoli brothers and their 70 companions. About 200 metres to the right from the Terrazza del Pincio, there is a bronze monument of Giovanni holding the dying Enrico in his arm. A plaque lists the names of their companions. Giovanni never recovered from his wounds and from the tragic events of 1867. According to an eyewitness, when Giovanni died on 11 September 1869:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the last moments, he had a vision of Garibaldi and seemed to greet him with enthusiasm. I heard (so says a friend who was present) him say three times: \"The union of the French to the papal political supporters was the terrible fact!\", he was thinking about Mentana. He called Enrico many times, that he might help him, then he said: \"but we will certainly win; we will go to Rome!\"\nCapture of Rome.\nIn July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began. In early August, the French Emperor Napoleon III recalled his garrison from Rome, thus no longer providing protection to the Papal State. Widespread public demonstrations illustrated the demand that the Italian government take Rome. The Italian government took no direct action until the collapse of the Second French Empire at the Battle of Sedan. King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count Gustavo Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. The Papacy, however, exhibited something less than enthusiasm for the plan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The pope's reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King's letter upon the table he exclaimed, \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. After, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\". San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.\nThe Royal Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the Papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although now convinced of his unavoidable defeat, Pius IX remained intransigent to the bitter end and forced his troops to put up a token resistance. On 20 September, after a cannonade of three hours had breached the Aurelian Walls at Porta Pia, the Bersaglieri entered Rome and marched down \"Via Pia\", which was subsequently renamed \"Via XX Settembre\". Forty-nine Italian soldiers and four officers, and nineteen papal troops, died. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite held on 2 October. The results of this plebiscite were accepted by decree of 9 October.\nInitially the Italian government had offered to let the pope keep the Leonine City under the Law of Guarantees, but the pope rejected the offer because acceptance would have been an implied endorsement of the legitimacy of the Italian kingdom's rule over his former domain. Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican, although he was not actually restrained from coming and going. Rather, being deposed and stripped of much of his former power also removed a measure of personal protection\u2014if he had walked the streets of Rome, he might have been in danger from political opponents who had formerly kept their views private. Officially, the capital was not moved from Florence to Rome until July 1871.\nHistorian Raffaele de Cesare made the following observations about Italian unification:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet\u00a0\u2013 that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made Emperor, and was supported by the votes of the Conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the Pontiff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations\u2026. Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.\nProblems.\nUnification was achieved entirely in terms of Piedmont's interests. Martin Clark says, \"It was Piedmontization all around.\" Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures. The first king was Victor Emmanuel II, who kept his old title.\nNational and regional officials were all appointed by Piedmont. A few regional leaders succeeded to high positions in the new national government, but the top bureaucratic and military officials were mostly Piedmontese. The national capital was briefly moved to Florence and finally to Rome, one of the cases of Piedmont losing out.\nHowever, Piedmontese tax rates and regulations, diplomats and officials were imposed on all of Italy. The constitution was Piedmont's old constitution. The document was generally liberal and was welcomed by liberal elements. However, its anticlerical provisions were resented in the pro-clerical regions in places such as around Venice, Rome, and Naples\u2014as well as the island of Sicily. Cavour had promised there would be regional and municipal, local governments, but all the promises were broken in 1861.\nThe first decade of the kingdom saw savage insurrections in Sicily and in the Naples region. Hearder claimed that failed efforts to protest unification involved \"a mixture of spontaneous peasant movement and a Bourbon-clerical reaction directed by the old authorities\".\nThe pope lost Rome in 1870 and ordered the Catholic Church not to co-operate with the new government, a decision fully reversed only in 1929. Most people for Risorgimento had wanted strong provinces, but they got a strong central state instead. The inevitable long-run results were a severe weakness of national unity and a politicized system based on mutually hostile regional violence. Such factors remain in the 21st century.\nRuling and representing southern Italy.\nFrom the spring of 1860 to the summer of 1861, a major challenge that the Piedmontese parliament faced on national unification was how they should govern and control the southern regions of the country that were frequently represented and described by northern Italian correspondents as \"corrupt\", \"barbaric\", and \"uncivilized\". In response to the depictions of southern Italy, the Piedmontese parliament had to decide whether it should investigate the southern regions to better understand the social and political situations there or it should establish jurisdiction and order by using mostly force.\nThe dominance of letters sent from the northern Italian correspondents that deemed southern Italy to be \"so far from the ideas of progress and civilization\" ultimately induced the Piedmontese parliament to choose the latter course of action, which effectively illustrated the intimate connection between representation and rule. In essence, the northern Italians' \"representation of the south as a land of barbarism (variously qualified as indecent, lacking in 'public conscience', ignorant, superstitious, etc.)\" provided the Piedmontese with the justification to rule the southern regions on the pretext of implementing a superior, more civilized, \"Piedmontese morality\".\nHistoriography.\nItalian unification is still a topic of debate. According to Massimo d'Azeglio, centuries of foreign domination created remarkable differences in Italian society, and the role of the newly formed government was to face these differences and to create a unified Italian society. Still today the most famous quote of Massimo d'Azeglio is, \"L'Italia \u00e8 fatta. Restano da fare gli italiani\" ('Italy has been made. Now it remains to make Italians').\nThe economist and politician Francesco Saverio Nitti criticized the newly created state for not considering the substantial economic differences between northern Italy, a free-market economy, and southern Italy, a state protectionist economy, when integrating the two. When the Kingdom of Italy extended the free-market economy to the rest of the country, the south's economy collapsed under the weight of the north's. Nitti contended that this change should have been much more gradual in order to allow the birth of an adequate entrepreneurial class able to make strong investments and initiatives in the south. These mistakes, he felt, were the cause of the economic and social problems which came to be known as the southern question (\"Questione Meridionale\").\nThe politician, historian, and writer Gaetano Salvemini commented that although Italian unification had been a strong opportunity for both a moral and economic rebirth of Italy's \"Mezzogiorno\" (southern Italy), because of a lack of understanding and action on the part of politicians, corruption and organized crime flourished in the south. The Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci criticized Italian unification for the limited presence of the masses in politics, as well as the lack of modern land reform in Italy.\nRevisionism of Risorgimento produced a clear radicalization of Italy in the mid-20th century, following the fall of the Savoy monarchy and fascism during World War II. Reviews of the historical facts concerning Italian unification's successes and failures continue to be undertaken by domestic and foreign academic authors, including Denis Mack Smith, Christopher Duggan, and Lucy Riall. Recent work emphasizes the central importance of nationalism.\nRisorgimento and Italian irredentism.\nOrigins of Italian irredentism.\nIt can be argued that Italian unification was never truly completed in the 19th century. Even after the Capture of Rome (1871), the final event of the unification of Italy, many ethnic Italian speakers (Trentino-Alto Adigan Italians, Savoyard Italians, Corfiot Italians, Ni\u00e7ard Italians, Swiss Italians, Corsican Italians, Maltese Italians, Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) remained outside the borders of the Kingdom of Italy and this situation created the Italian irredentism.\nThe Corsican revolutionary Pasquale Paoli was called \"the precursor of Italian irredentism\" by Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo because he was the first to promote the Italian language and socio-culture (the main characteristics of Italian irredentism) in his island; Paoli wanted the Italian language to be the official language of the newly founded Corsican Republic.\nThe term \"Risorgimento\" refers to the domestic reorganization of the stratified Italian identity into a unified, national front. The word literally means 'rising again' and was an ideological movement which strove to spark national pride, leading to political oppositionalism to foreign rule and influence. There is contention on its actual impact in Italy, some Scholars arguing it was a liberalizing time for 19th century Italian culture, while others speculate that although it was a patriotic revolution, it only tangibly aided the upper-class and bourgeois publics without actively benefitting the lower classes.\n\"Italia irredenta\" was an Italian nationalist opinion movement that emerged after Italian unification. It advocated irredentism among the Italian people as well as other nationalities who were willing to become Italian and as a movement; it is also known as \"Italian irredentism\". Not a formal organization, it was just an opinion movement that claimed that Italy had to reach its \"natural borders\", meaning that the country would need to incorporate all areas predominantly consisting of ethnic Italians within the near vicinity outside its borders. Similar patriotic and nationalistic ideas were common in Europe in the 19th century.\nAt the beginning, Italian irredentism promoted the annexation to Italy of territories where Italians formed the absolute majority of the population, but retained by the Austrian Empire after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. During World War One the main \"irredent lands\" (\"terre irredente\") were considered to be the provinces of Trento and Trieste and, in a narrow sense, irredentists referred to the Italian patriots living in these two areas.\nThe term was later expanded to also include multilingual and multiethnic areas, where Italians were a relative majority or a substantial minority, within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with German, Italian, Slovene, Croatian, Ladin and Istro-Romanian population, such as South Tyrol, Istria, Gorizia and Gradisca and part of Dalmatia. The claims were further extended also to the city of Fiume (see \"Impresa di Fiume\"), Corsica, the island of Malta, the County of Nice and Italian Switzerland.\nMany Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians looked with sympathy towards the Risorgimento movement that fought for the unification of Italy. However, after the Third Italian War of Independence (1866), when the Veneto and Friuli regions were ceded by the Austrians to the newly formed Kingdom Italy, Istria and Dalmatia remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, together with other Italian-speaking areas on the eastern Adriatic. This triggered the gradual rise of Italian irredentism among many Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia, who demanded the unification of the Julian March, Kvarner and Dalmatia with Italy. The Italians in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia supported the Italian Risorgimento: as a consequence, the Austrians saw the Italians as enemies and favored the Slav communities of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia. During the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 12 November 1866, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria outlined a wide-ranging project aimed at the Germanization or Slavization of the areas of the empire with an Italian presence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His Majesty expressed the precise order that action be taken decisively against the influence of the Italian elements still present in some regions of the Crown and, appropriately occupying the posts of public, judicial, masters employees as well as with the influence of the press, work in South Tyrol, Dalmatia and Littoral for the Germanization and Slavization of these territories according to the circumstances, with energy and without any regard. His Majesty calls the central offices to the strong duty to proceed in this way to what has been established.\u2014\u200a\nIstrian Italians made up about a third of the population in 1900. Dalmatia, especially its maritime cities, once had a substantial local ethnic Italian population (Dalmatian Italians). According to Austrian census, the Dalmatian Italians formed 12.5% of the population in 1865. In the 1910 Austro-Hungarian census, Istria had a population of 57.8% Slavic-speakers (Croat and Slovene), and 38.1% Italian speakers. For the Austrian Kingdom of Dalmatia, (i.e. Dalmatia), the 1910 numbers were 96.2% Slavic speakers and 2.8% Italian speakers.\nThe Italian population in Dalmatia was concentrated in the major coastal cities. In the city of Split in 1890 there were 1,971 Dalmatian Italians (9% of the population), in Zadar 7,672 (27%), in \u0160ibenik 1,090 (5%), in Kotor 646 (12%) and in Dubrovnik 356 (3%). In other Dalmatian localities, according to Austrian censuses, Dalmatian Italians experienced a sudden decrease: in the twenty years 1890-1910, in Rab they went from 225 to 151, in Vis from 352 to 92, in Pag from 787 to 23, completely disappearing in almost all the inland locations. In 1909 the Italian language lost its status as the official language of Dalmatia in favor of Croatian only (previously both languages were recognized): thus Italian could no longer be used in the public and administrative sphere.\nIrredentism and the World Wars.\nItaly entered into the First World War in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity: for this reason, the Italian intervention in the First World War is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence, in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.\nDuring the post-unification era, some Italians were dissatisfied with the current state of the Italian Kingdom since they wanted the kingdom to include Trieste, Istria, and other adjacent territories as well. This Italian irredentism succeeded in World War I with the annexation of Trieste and Trento, with the respective territories of Julian March and Trentino-Alto Adige.\nThe Kingdom of Italy had declared neutrality at the beginning of the war, officially because the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary was a defensive one, requiring its members to come under attack first. Many Italians were still hostile to Austria's continuing occupation of ethnically Italian areas, and Italy chose not to enter. Austria-Hungary requested Italian neutrality, while the Triple Entente (which included Great Britain, France and Russia) requested its intervention. With the Treaty of London, signed in April 1915, Italy agreed to declare war against the Central Powers in exchange for the \"irredent\" territories of Friuli, Trentino, and Dalmatia (see \"Italia irredenta\").\nItalian irredentism obtained an important result after the First World War, when Italy gained Trieste, Gorizia, Istria, and the cities of Zara and Pola after the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. Some historians see the Risorgimento as continuing to that time, which is the view presented at the Central Museum of the Risorgimento at Altare della Patria in Rome. But Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, such Dalmatia, so this outcome was denounced as a \"mutilated victory\". The rhetoric of \"mutilated victory\" was adopted by Benito Mussolini and led to the rise of Italian Fascism, becoming a key point in the propaganda of Fascist Italy. Historians regard \"mutilated victory\" as a \"political myth\", used by fascists to fuel Italian imperialism and obscure the successes of liberal Italy in the aftermath of World War I.\nDuring the Second World War, after the Axis attack on Yugoslavia, Italy created the Governatorate of Dalmatia (from 1941 to September 1943), so the Kingdom of Italy annexed temporarily Split (Italian \"Spalato\"), Kotor (\"Cattaro\"), and most of coastal Dalmatia. From 1942 to 1943, Corsica and Nice (Italian \"Nizza\") were temporarily annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, nearly fulfilling in those years the ambitions of Italian irredentism.\nFor its avowed purpose, the movement had the \"emancipation\" of all Italian lands still subject to foreign rule after Italian unification. The Irredentists took language as the test of the alleged Italian nationality of the countries they proposed to emancipate, which were Trentino, Trieste, Dalmatia, Istria, Gorizia, Ticino, Nice (Nizza), Corsica, and Malta. Austria-Hungary promoted Croatian interests in Dalmatia and Istria to weaken Italian claims in the western Balkans before the First World War.\nEnd of Italian irredentism.\nUnder the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy, Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara was annexed by Yugoslavia, giving the people on both sides of the border the right of option of nationality; the ensuing Istrian-Dalmatian exodus led to the emigration of between 230,000 and 350,000 of local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians), the others being ethnic Slovenians, ethnic Croatians, and ethnic Istro-Romanians, choosing to maintain Italian citizenship.\nThe Istrian-Dalmatian exodus started in 1943 and ended completely only in 1960. According to the census organized in Croatia in 2001 and that organized in Slovenia in 2002, the Italians who remained in the former Yugoslavia amounted to 21,894 people (2,258 in Slovenia and 19,636 in Croatia).\nAfter World War II, Italian irredentism disappeared along with the defeated Fascists and the Monarchy of the House of Savoy. After the Treaty of Paris (1947) and the Treaty of Osimo (1975), all territorial claims were abandoned by the Italian Republic (see Foreign relations of Italy). The Italian irredentist movement thus vanished from Italian politics. The 1947 Constitution of Italy established five autonomous regions (Sardinia, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sicily, Aosta Valley, and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol), in recognition of their cultural and linguistic distinctiveness.\nAnniversary of the unification of Italy.\nItaly celebrates the anniversary of the unification every fifty years, on 17 March (the date of proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy). The anniversary occurred in 1911 (50th), 1961 (100th), 2011 (150th) and 2021 (160th) with several celebrations throughout the country. While remaining a working day, 17 March is considered a \"day promoting the values linked to national identity\".\nThe National Unity and Armed Forces Day, celebrated on 4 November, commemorates the end of World War I with the Armistice of Villa Giusti, a war event considered to complete the process of unification of Italy.\nCulture and Risorgimento.\nArt.\nIn art, this period was characterised by the Neoclassicism that draws inspiration from the \"classical\" art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The main Italian sculptor was Antonio Canova who became famous for his marble sculptures that delicately rendered nude flesh. The mourning Italia turrita on the tomb to Vittorio Alfieri is one of the main works of Risorgimento by Canova. By this time, in sculpture, a veiled woman in the style of the Veiled Rebecca of Benzoni had become an allegory for Italian unification.\nFrancesco Hayez was another remarkable artist of this period whose works often contain allegories about Italian unification. His most known painting \"The Kiss\" aims to portray the spirit of the Risorgimento: the man wears red, white and green, representing the Italian patriots fighting for independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire while the girl's pale blue dress signifies France, which in 1859 (the year of the painting's creation) made an alliance with the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia enabling the latter to unify the many states of the Italian peninsula into the new kingdom of Italy. Hayez's three paintings on the \"Sicilian Vespers\" are an implicit protest against the foreign domination of Italy.\nAndrea Appiani, Domenico Induno, and Gerolamo Induno are also known for their patriotic canvases. The Risorgimento was also represented by works not necessarily linked to Neoclassicism\u2014as in the case of Giovanni Fattori who was one of the leaders of the group known as the Macchiaioli and who soon became a leading Italian plein-airist, painting landscapes, rural scenes, and military life during the Italian unification.\nLiterature.\nThe most well known writer of Risorgimento is Alessandro Manzoni, whose works are a symbol of the Italian unification, both for its patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language. He is famous for the novel \"The Betrothed\" (orig. Italian: \"I promessi sposi\", 1827), generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature.\nVittorio Alfieri, was the founder of a new school in the Italian drama, expressed in several occasions his suffering about the foreign domination's tyranny.\nUgo Foscolo describes in his works the passion and love for the fatherland and the glorious history of the Italian people; these two concepts are respectively well expressed in two masterpieces, \"The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis\" and \"Dei Sepolcri\".\nVincenzo Monti, known for the Italian translation of the \"Iliad\", described in his works both enthusiasms and disappointments of Risorgimento until his death.\nGiovanni Berchet wrote a poetry characterized by a high moral, popular and social content; he also contributed to \"Il Conciliatore\", a progressive bi-weekly scientific and literary journal, influential in the early Risorgimento that was published in Milan from September 1818 until October 1819 when it was closed by the Austrian censors; its writers included also Ludovico di Breme, Giuseppe Nicolini, and Silvio Pellico.\nGiacomo Leopardi was one of the most important poets of Risorgimento thanks to works such as \"Canzone all'Italia\" and \"Risorgimento\".\nNiccol\u00f2 Tommaseo, the editor of the \"Italian Language Dictionary\" in eight volumes, was a precursor of the Italian irredentism and his works are a rare examples of a metropolitan culture above nationalism; he supported the liberal revolution headed by Daniele Manin against the Austrian Empire and he will always support the unification of Italy.\nFrancesco de Sanctis was one of the most important scholars of Italian language and literature in the 19th century; he supported the Revolution of 1848 in Naples and for this reason he was imprisoned for three years; his reputation as a lecturer on Dante in Turin brought him the appointment of professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1856; he returned to Naples as Minister of Public Education after the unification of Italy.\nThe writer and patriot Luigi Settembrini published anonymously the \"Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies\", a scathing indictment of the Bourbon government and was imprisoned and exiled several times by the Bourbons because of his support to Risorgimento; after the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, he was appointed professor of Italian literature at the University of Naples.\nIppolito Nievo is another main representative of Risorgimento with his novel \"Confessioni d'un italiano\"; he fought with Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand.\nThe Risorgimento was also depicted in famous novels: \"The Leopard\" written by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, \"Heart\" by Edmondo De Amicis, and \"The Little World of the Past\" by Antonio Fogazzaro.\nMusic.\nRisorgimento won the support of many leading Italian opera composers. Their librettos often saw a delicate balance between European romantic narratives and dramatic themes evoking nationalistic sentiments. Ideas expressed in operas stimulated the political mobilisation in Italy and among the cultured classes of Europe who appreciated Italian opera. Furthermore, Mazzini and many other nationalists found inspiration in musical discourses.\nIn his \"L'italiana in Algeri\" ('The Italian Girl in Algiers'), Gioachino Rossini expressed his support to the unification of Italy; the patriotic line \"Pensa alla patria, e intrepido il tuo dover adempi: vedi per tutta Italia rinascere gli esempi d\u2019ardir e di valor\" ('Think about the fatherland and intrepid do your duty: see for all Italy the birth of the examples of courage and value') was censored in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.\nVincenzo Bellini was a secret member of the Carbonari and in his masterpiece \"I puritani (The Puritans)\", the last part of Act 2 is an allegory to Italian unification. Another Bellini opera, \"Norma\", was at the center of an unexpected standing ovation during its performance in Milan in 1859: while the chorus was performing \"Guerra, guerra! Le galliche selve\" ('War, war! The Gallic forests') in Act 2, the Italians began to greet the chorus with loud applause and to yell the word \"War!\" several times towards the Austrian officers at the opera house.\nThe relationship between Gaetano Donizetti and the Risorgimento is still controversial. Although Giuseppe Mazzini tried to use some of Donizetti's works for promoting the Italian cause, Donizetti had always preferred not to get involved in politics.\nHistorians vigorously debate how political were the operas of Giuseppe Verdi (1813\u20131901). In particular, the chorus of the Hebrew slaves (known as \"Va, pensiero\") from the third act of the opera \"Nabucco\" was intended to be an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus's theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as \"O mia patria, si bella e perduta\u2014'O my country, so lovely and so lost'\u2014were thought to have resonated with many Italians). Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan \"Viva VERDI\" was used as an acronym for Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re D'Italia\" ('Viva Victor Emmanuel King of Italy'), referring to Victor Emmanuel II.\nFranco Della Peruta argues in favour of close links between the operas and the Risorgimento, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento. Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of Cavour and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors. Verdi's main works of 1842\u201349 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including \"Nabucco\" (1842), \"I Lombardi alla prima crociata\" (1843), \"Ernani\" (1844), \"Attila\" (1846), \"Macbeth\" (1847), and \"La battaglia di Legnano\" (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship of the absolutist regimes in power.\nVerdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861. Likewise Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815 music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo says Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles. On the other side of the debate, Mary Ann Smart argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes. Likewise Roger Parker argues that the political dimension of Verdi's operas was exaggerated by nationalistic historians looking for a hero in the late 19th century.\nGiuseppe Verdi's \"Nabucco\" and the Risorgimento are the subject of a 2011 opera, \"Risorgimento!\" by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero, written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Italian unification.\nFilms.\n\"The Leopard\" is a film from 1963, based on the novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, and directed by Luchino Visconti. It features Burt Lancaster as the eponymous character, the Prince of Salina. The film depicts his reaction to the Risorgimento, and his vain attempts to retain his social standing.\nThere are other movies set in this period:\nMuseums.\nCentral Museum of the Risorgimento of Rome.\nInside the Altare della Patria in Rome are some museums dedicated to the history of Italy, especially the Unification of Italy: the Central Museum of the Risorgimento () with an adjoining study institute, the Flag of Italy Memorial () and an area that hosts temporary exhibitions of artistic interest, historical, sociological and cultural called \"ala Brasini\".\nSince 2020, together with Palazzo Venezia, it has been managed by the VIVE Institute, one of the eleven institutes of significant general interest of the Italian Ministry of Culture.\nAccess to the Central Museum of the Risorgimento is on the left side of the monument, at the back of the Santa Maria in Ara Coeli along via di San Pietro in Carcere. The period of Italian history between the end of the 18th century and the First World War is displayed by memorabilia, paintings, sculptures, documents (letters, diaries and manuscripts), drawings, engravings, weapons and prints.\nOn the entrance stairway of the Central Museum of the Risorgimento are visible engravings related to some significant episodes for the birth of the Risorgimento movement, from the seed thrown by the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, to better frame and remember the national history included between the reform of the ancient Italian states and the end of the First World War. Along the walls, other marble engravings show some pieces of texts enunciated by prominent personalities, which better testify and describe this part of Italian history.\nThe Central Museum of the Risorgimento also includes the Shrine of the Flags, a museum where the war flags of dissolved military units and decommissioned ships from the Italian Army, Italian Air Force, Italian Navy, Carabinieri, \"Polizia di Stato\", Penitentiary Police and \"Guardia di Finanza\" are collected and temporarily stored. In case a unit is reformed, the flags are retrieved by the unit. Access to the shrine is along Via dei Fori Imperiali, where memorabilia, relating mainly to the Risorgimento wars, in which the Italian Armed Forces took part, are also kept.\nThe \"ala Brasini\", reserved for temporary exhibitions, is dedicated to Armando Brasini, the main promoter of the Central Museum. The wing has three exhibition rooms: the \"large exhibition hall\", with a surface area of , generally hosts art exhibitions, and those that require more space, the \"central hall\" of and the \"jubilee hall\" of , are used.\nNational Museum of the Risorgimento of Turin.\nThe National Museum of the Italian Risorgimento of Turin is the first, the biggest and the most important among the 23 museums in Italy dedicated to the Risorgimento; and the only one which can be considered \"national\" according to a 1901 law, and due to its rich and great collections. It is housed in the Palazzo Carignano in Turin.\nThe museum was established in 1878, shortly after Italian unification, even though it only had its first permanent exhibition in 1908. Originally located in the Mole Antonelliana, in 1938 it was moved to its current site (which had previously housed the Subalpine Chamber of Deputies, from 1848 to 1860, and then the first Italian Chamber of Deputies, from 1861 to 1865).\nIts exhibits include weapons, flags, uniforms, printed and written documents (including the original manuscript of the song \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", dated 10 November 1847 by Goffredo Mameli, now Italian national anthem since 1946), and artworks. The new exhibition, which opened on 18 March 2011, occupies about 3500 square metres across 30 rooms, and covers the real Risorgimento period, stretching from the late 18th century revolutions to the beginning of the First World War. It includes a specialized library, a print cabinet and a documentary archive.\nMuseum of the Risorgimento of Milan.\nThe Museum of the Risorgimento of Milan, located in the 18th-century Milanese Palazzo Moriggia, houses a collection of objects and artworks which illustrate the history of Italian unification from Napoleon's Italian campaign of 1796 to the annexation of Rome in 1870. The city of Milan played a key role in the process, most notably on the occasion of the 1848 uprising against the Austrians known as the Five Days of Milan.\nThe museum was founded on a collection of documents on the Risorgimento, gathered for the Exhibition of Turin in 1884 and then moved to the showroom at Milan\u2019s Public Gardens. The exhibition was later transferred to the Rocchetta rooms at the Sforza Castle, where it was officially inaugurated on 24 June 1896. In 1943, due to the war-time bombardment of the castle, the museum was temporarily moved to the estate of Casa Manzoni (home of the famed Italian poet and novelist Alessandro Manzoni). Finally in 1951 it was housed inside the Moriggia Palace, where it remains today.\nThe museum is part of the Civic Historical Collections. Its collections include Baldassare Verazzi's \"Episode from the Five Days\" and Francesco Hayez's 1840 \" of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria\". The permanent exhibition is displayed to follow the chronological order of events of the Risorgimento, leading the visitor through fifteen rooms, to which the new Weapons Room has been recently added. The latest refurbishment in 1998 included the redesign of the permanent exhibitions, to accentuate the highlights of the collections, particularly the relics.\nThe museum boasts the green-and-silver velvet cloak and the valuable regal insignia of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s coronation, the banner of the Legione Lombarda Cacciatori a Cavallo (Lombard Legion on Horseback) and the first Italian flag. The last renovation saw the redesign of the lighting and information systems, as well as improvements to the \u2018Romantic Garden\u2019 behind the building.\nMuseum of the Risorgimento of Bologna.\nThe Civic Museum of the Risorgimento pf Bologna is located in the ground floor of the Casa Carducci, located in Piazza Carducci 5, in central Bologna.\nPrior to being a Museum, part of the site had housed the church of the Madonna della Piet\u00e0, known commonly as the Madonna del Piombo (Virgin Mary of the Lead). It was so named because it contained a relief of the Madonna etched on a lead plate, attributed to Sperandio Savelli, that had gained veneration. There is also a legend that in the first years of the 16th century the icon had been discovered by youths playing here, near the city walls, and this led to the first chapel, then church.\nThis church burned down in 1712, but was soon replaced by a frescoed oratory completed in 1752. This oratory whose facade is represented by the three round arches with double central pilasters. After the Napoleonic occupation, the members of the company who owned the oratory had the structure deconsecrated and the contents sold off to antiquarians.\nThe oratory had been decorated by the artists Antonio Rossi, Ercole Graziani the Younger, Gaetano Ferratini, Giuseppe Orsoni, Antonio Gionima, and Lorenzo Garbieri.\nA Bolognese Museum of the Risorgimento was first inaugurated on June 12, 1893. The museum has exhibits that chronicle the history from the Napoleonic invasions to the end of the First World War. The main exhibits are divided into 5 eras:\nThe Museum houses a library of documents and an archive of diverse items from the period. It houses the a project towards maintenance of the city's monumental cemetery at the Certosa di Bologna.\nThe museum has varied in scope and themes across the decades. The initial founding of the museum focused on the patriotic events leading to Italian sovereignty and union. During and after the First World War, this conflict was defined as the Fourth War of Independence. Fascism added to the focus, the ideals of a greater Italy, the aggressive colonial wars that led to the formation of Italian East Africa, the Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and the Second World War. The museum first closed in 1943, and did not reopen until 1954. Fascist wars and goals were now removed as a focus, and the Resistance to Fascism was viewed as the Second Risorgimento. The museum closed again from 1962 to 1975, and now focuses on the history prior to the Italy's entry into World War II.\nThe museum was located in the present Casa Carducci premises only in 1990, and includes the premises of the oratory. The Casa Carducci was the last home of the poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1906.\nTricolour Flag Museum.\nThe Tricolour Flag Museum is located in Reggio nell'Emilia, the city that saw the birth of the Italian flag in 1797, inside the town hall of the city, adjacent to the Sala del Tricolore, whose collection is made up of relics related to the Italian flag.\nThe museum reconstructs the history of the Italian flag, which was adopted in Reggio Emilia for the first time, right in the nearby Sala del Tricolore. On 7 January 1797 it was in fact chosen as the national flag of the Cispadane Republic: for the first time the tricolour became the national flag of a sovereign Italian state. In fact, previously, the tricolour was used as a war flag and as a civic symbol of local authorities. It was inspired by the French flag, which at the time was a symbol of freedom against the states of the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\".\nInaugurated on 7 January 2004, it preserves documents, relics and Italian flags ranging from the arrival of Napoleon Bonaparte in Reggio Emilia (1796) to its fall (1814), and others from the subsequent Italian unification period. The part of the museum that houses the latter was inaugurated on 7 January 2006. The dating of the relics preserved goes back to 1897, the year of the first centenary of the Italian flag. There are also a large number of tricolor flags of the Italian pre-unification States.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A valid digital signature on a message gives a recipient confidence that the message came from a sender known to the recipient.\nDigital signatures are a type of public-key cryptography, and are commonly used for software distribution,\nfinancial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.\nA digital signature on a message or document is similar to a handwritten signature on paper, but it is not restricted to a physical medium like paper\u2014any bitstring can be digitally signed\u2014and while a handwritten signature on paper could be copied onto other paper in a forgery, a digital signature on a message is mathematically bound to the \"content\" of the message so that it is infeasible for anyone to forge a valid digital signature on any other message.\nDigital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which include any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures.\nDefinition.\nA digital signature scheme consists of three algorithms:\nTwo main properties are required:\nFormally, a digital signature scheme is a triple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms, (\"G\", \"S\", \"V\"), satisfying:\nHere 1\"n\" refers to a unary number in the formalism of computational complexity theory.\nFor \"correctness\", \"S\" and \"V\" must satisfy\n Pr [(\"pk\", \"sk\") \u2190 \"G\"(1\"n\"), \"V\"(\"pk\", \"x\", \"S\"(\"sk\", \"x\")) = \"accepted\"] = 1.\nA digital signature scheme is \"secure\" if for every non-uniform probabilistic polynomial time adversary \"A\",\n Pr [(\"pk\", \"sk\") \u2190 \"G\"(1\"n\"), (\"x\", \"t\") \u2190 \"A\"\"S\"(\"sk\", \u00b7 )(\"pk\", 1\"n\"), \"x\" \u2209 \"Q\", \"V\"(\"pk\", \"x\", \"t\") = \"accepted\"] &lt; negl(\"n\"),\nwhere \"A\"\"S\"(\"sk\", \u00b7 ) denotes that \"A\" has access to the oracle, \"S\"(\"sk\", \u00b7 ), \"Q\" denotes the set of the queries on \"S\" made by \"A\", which knows the public key, \"pk\", and the security parameter, \"n\", and \"x\" \u2209 \"Q\" denotes that the adversary may not directly query the string, \"x\", on \"S\".\nHistory.\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first described the notion of a digital signature scheme, although they only conjectured that such schemes existed based on functions that are trapdoor one-way permutations. Soon afterwards, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman invented the RSA algorithm, which could be used to produce primitive digital signatures (although only as a proof-of-concept \u2013 \"plain\" RSA signatures are not secure). The first widely marketed software package to offer digital signature was Lotus Notes 1.0, released in 1989, which used the RSA algorithm.\nOther digital signature schemes were soon developed after RSA, the earliest being Lamport signatures, Merkle signatures (also known as \"Merkle trees\" or simply \"Hash trees\"), and Rabin signatures.\nIn 1988, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Ronald Rivest became the first to rigorously define the security requirements of digital signature schemes.\nThey described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes, and also presented the GMR signature scheme, the first that could be proved to prevent even an existential forgery against a chosen message attack, which is the currently accepted security definition for signature schemes. The first such scheme which is not built on trapdoor functions but rather on a family of function with a much weaker required property of one-way permutation was presented by Moni Naor and Moti Yung.\nMethod.\nOne digital signature scheme (of many) is based on RSA. To create signature keys, generate an RSA key pair containing a modulus, \"N\", that is the product of two random secret distinct large primes, along with integers, \"e\" and \"d\", such that \"e\"\u00a0\"d\"\u00a0\u2261\u00a01\u00a0(mod\u00a0\"\u03c6\"(\"N\")), where \"\u03c6\" is Euler's totient function. The signer's public key consists of \"N\" and \"e\", and the signer's secret key contains \"d\".\nUsed directly, this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to key-only existential forgery attack. To create a forgery, the attacker picks a random signature \u03c3 and uses the verification procedure to determine the message, \"m\", corresponding to that signature. In practice, however, this type of signature is not used directly, but rather, the message to be signed is first hashed to produce a short digest, that is then padded to larger width comparable to\u00a0\"N\", then signed with the reverse trapdoor function. This forgery attack, then, only produces the padded hash function output that corresponds to \u03c3, but not a message that leads to that value, which does not lead to an attack. In the random oracle model, hash-then-sign (an idealized version of that practice where hash and padding combined have close to \"N\" possible outputs), this form of signature is existentially unforgeable, even against a chosen-plaintext attack.\nThere are several reasons to sign such a hash (or message digest) instead of the whole document.\nApplications.\nAs organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps, digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance, identity, and status of an electronic document as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory. The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) publishes electronic versions of the budget, public and private laws, and congressional bills with digital signatures. Universities including Penn State, University of Chicago, and Stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures.\nBelow are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:\nAuthentication.\nA message may have letterhead or a handwritten signature identifying its sender, but letterheads and handwritten signatures can be copied and pasted onto forged messages.\nEven legitimate messages may be modified in transit.\nIf a bank's central office receives a letter claiming to be from a branch office with instructions to change the balance of an account, the central bankers need to be sure, before acting on the instructions, that they were actually sent by a branch banker, and not forged\u2014whether a forger fabricated the whole letter, or just modified an existing letter in transit by adding some digits.\nWith a digital signature scheme, the central office can arrange beforehand to have a public key on file whose private key is known only to the branch office.\nThe branch office can later sign a message and the central office can use the public key to verify the signed message was not a forgery before acting on it.\nA forger who \"doesn't\" know the sender's private key can't sign a different message, or even change a single digit in an existing message without making the recipient's signature verification fail.\nEncryption can hide the content of the message from an eavesdropper, but encryption on its own may not let recipient verify the message's authenticity, or even detect selective modifications like changing a digit\u2014if the bank's offices simply encrypted the messages they exchange, they could still be vulnerable to forgery.\nIn other applications, such as software updates, the messages are not secret\u2014when a software author publishes a patch for all existing installations of the software to apply, the patch itself is not secret, but computers running the software must verify the authenticity of the patch before applying it, lest they become victims to malware.\nLimitations.\nReplays.\nA digital signature scheme on its own does not prevent a valid signed message from being recorded and then maliciously reused in a replay attack.\nFor example, the branch office may legitimately request that bank transfer be issued once in a signed message.\nIf the bank doesn't use a system of transaction IDs in their messages to detect which transfers have already happened, someone could illegitimately reuse the same signed message many times to drain an account.\nUniqueness and malleability of signatures.\nA signature itself cannot be used to uniquely identify the message it signs\u2014in some signature schemes, every message has a large number of possible valid signatures from the same signer, and it may be easy, even without knowledge of the private key, to transform one valid signature into another.\nIf signatures are misused as transaction IDs in an attempt by a bank-like system such as a Bitcoin exchange to detect replays, this can be exploited to replay transactions.\nAuthenticating a public key.\nPrior knowledge of a \"public key\" can be used to verify authenticity of a \"signed message\", but not the other way around\u2014prior knowledge of a \"signed message\" cannot be used to verify authenticity of a \"public key\".\nIn some signature schemes, given a signed message, it is easy to construct a public key under which the signed message will pass verification, even without knowledge of the private key that was used to make the signed message in the first place.\nNon-repudiation.\nNon-repudiation, or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.\nNote that these authentication, non-repudiation etc. properties rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is a required ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an \"online\" check; e.g., checking a certificate revocation list or via the Online Certificate Status Protocol. Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first checking online with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen. Of course, with stolen key pairs, the theft is often discovered only after the secret key's use, e.g., to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose.\nNotions of security.\nIn their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:\nThey also describe a hierarchy of attack results:\nThe strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.\nAdditional security precautions.\nPutting the private key on a smart card.\nAll public key / private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret. A private key can be stored on a user's computer, and protected by a local password, but this has two disadvantages:\nA more secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card. Many smart cards are designed to be tamper-resistant (although some designs have been broken, notably by Ross Anderson and his students). In a typical digital signature implementation, the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU signs the hash using the stored private key of the user, and then returns the signed hash. Typically, a user must activate their smart card by entering a personal identification number or PIN code (thus providing two-factor authentication). It can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card, although this is not always implemented. If the smart card is stolen, the thief will still need the PIN code to generate a digital signature. This reduces the security of the scheme to that of the PIN system, although it still requires an attacker to possess the card. A mitigating factor is that private keys, if generated and stored on smart cards, are usually regarded as difficult to copy, and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy. Thus, the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked. Private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy, and such compromises are far more difficult to detect.\nUsing smart card readers with a separate keyboard.\nEntering a PIN code to activate the smart card commonly requires a numeric keypad. Some card readers have their own numeric keypad. This is safer than using a card reader integrated into a PC, and then entering the PIN using that computer's keyboard. Readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a keystroke logger, potentially compromising the PIN code. Specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often EAL3 certified.\nOther smart card designs.\nSmart card design is an active field, and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems, despite having few security proofs so far.\nUsing digital signatures only with trusted applications.\nOne of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not \"see\" what they sign. The user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key. An attacker who gains control of the user's PC can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute, in effect replacing the user's own communications with those of the attacker. This could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user's original on-screen, but presenting the attacker's own documents to the signing application.\nTo protect against this scenario, an authentication system can be set up between the user's application (word processor, email client, etc.) and the signing application. The general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each other's integrity. For example, the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries.\nUsing a network attached hardware security module.\nOne of the main differences between a cloud based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk. Many risk averse companies, including governments, financial and medical institutions, and payment processors require more secure standards, like FIPS 140-2 level 3 and FIPS 201 certification, to ensure the signature is validated and secure. \nWYSIWYS.\nTechnically speaking, a digital signature applies to a string of bits, whereas humans and applications \"believe\" that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits. In order to be semantically interpreted, the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications, and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system. The problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content. It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS (What You See Is What You Sign) means that the semantic interpretation of a signed message cannot be changed. In particular this also means that a message cannot contain hidden information that the signer is unaware of, and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. WYSIWYS is a requirement for the validity of digital signatures, but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems. The term WYSIWYS was coined by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for Pan-European projects.\nDigital signatures versus ink on paper signatures.\nAn ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally, but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill, and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult.\nDigital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document. Paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page, and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied. Digital signatures can be applied to an entire document, such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered, but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract.\nThe current state of use \u2013 legal and practical.\nMost digital signature schemes share the following goals regardless of cryptographic theory or legal provision:\nOnly if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message, and therefore of their assent to its contents. Legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities, though some such have not reflected this actuality.\nLegislatures, being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a PKI, or by the technological avant-garde advocating new solutions to old problems, have enacted statutes and/or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing, endorsing, encouraging, or permitting digital signatures and providing for (or limiting) their legal effect. The first appears to have been in Utah in the United States, followed closely by the states Massachusetts and California. Other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the UN has had an active model law project for some time. These enactments (or proposed enactments) vary from place to place, have typically embodied expectations at variance (optimistically or pessimistically) with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering, and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers, nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable.\nAdoption of technical standards for digital signatures have lagged behind much of the legislation, delaying a more or less unified engineering position on interoperability, algorithm choice, key lengths, and so on what the engineering is attempting to provide.\nIndustry standards.\nSome industries have established common interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures between members of the industry and with regulators. These include the Automotive Network Exchange for the automobile industry and the SAFE-BioPharma Association for the healthcare industry.\nUsing separate key pairs for signing and encryption.\nIn several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a traditional pen and paper signature, as in the\n1999 EU digital signature directive and 2014 EU follow-on legislation. Generally, these provisions mean that anything digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair, a person can engage in an encrypted conversation (e.g., regarding a real estate transaction), but the encryption does not legally sign every message he or she sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the encrypted link. If a signing key is lost or compromised, it can be revoked to mitigate any future transactions. If an encryption key is lost, a backup or key escrow should be utilized to continue viewing encrypted content. Signing keys should never be backed up or escrowed unless the backup destination is securely encrypted.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1893, Greek-American George Lycurgus leased the guest house of Allen Herbert and renamed it the \"Sans Souci\" (French for \"without worries\" or \u201ccarefree\u201d) creating one of the first beach resorts. Later that year Robert Louis Stevenson stayed at the resort; subsequently it became a popular destination for mainland tourists. The area at coordinates is still called \"Sans Souci Beach\".\n20th century.\nIn the early 1900s, Waik\u012bk\u012b was home to many wetlands, which were claimed to harbor disease-carrying mosquitoes. To get rid of the mosquitoes, developers created the Ala Wai canal. The canal, originally known as the Waik\u012bk\u012b Drainage Canal, was created by a Hawaiian dredging company run by Walter F. Dillingham. The project took about seven years, 1921\u20131928.\nDuke Kahanamoku became a well-known surfer in Waik\u012bk\u012b. Throughout his life and after competing in the Olympics, many people around the world wanted to learn to surf. Duke's influence made Waik\u012bk\u012b beach a surfing hotspot. \"Dukes\", a club in Waik\u012bk\u012b named for Kahanamoku, helped Don Ho produce music and hosted the longest-running show in Waik\u012bk\u012b.\nThe first high-rise hotels on Waik\u012bk\u012b were built in 1955, including the Waikiki Biltmore and Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel. Development boomed due to demand, and the area became filled with large resort hotels, such as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Halekulani, the Hyatt Regency Waikiki, Marriott Waikiki, Sheraton Waikiki. These complemented historic hotels dating back to the early 20th century such as the Moana Surfrider Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.\nChanges in the shoreline.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b developed erosion problems starting in the late 1800s, as hotels and homes were built too close to the natural shoreline, while seawalls and other structures blocked the natural ebb and flow of sand along the beach.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, sand was imported from Manhattan Beach, California, via ship and barge.\nBefore 1950, Waik\u012bk\u012b beaches were continuous. Then seawalls and groins began to appear. These helped build sand at one beach, but typically appropriated sand from others. They became separated into sections, some with sandy beach and others without. By 1950, more than 80 structures, including seawalls, groins, piers, and storm drains, occupied the Waik\u012bk\u012b shoreline.\nFollowing World War II, Waik\u012bk\u012b beach restoration efforts have occurred every few years. Sand was imported to this artificial beach from the 1920s to the 1970s, once by boat and barge from Southern California. of shoreline was replenished at a cost of $2.4\u00a0million following chronic erosion of more than a foot a year.\nImporting stopped in the 1970s. In March 1971, the Corps of Engineers Pacific Ocean Division, created a Draft Environmental Statement for the Kuhio Beach Sector of Waik\u012bk\u012b, which aimed to improve the overall quality and size of the fading and narrowing shoreline.\n21st century.\nFrom October 29 through November 4, 2000, the first FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships were held in the waters off Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach.\nA partial restoration was completed in the spring of 2012. The project imported sand from nearby shoals and widened the beach by about between the Royal Hawaiian Hotel concrete groin and the K\u016bhi\u014d Beach crib wall. The project temporarily restored the beach to its 1985 shoreline. Two aging sandbag groin structures were also removed that year.\nIn 2017, beach erosion worsened with high-energy king tides and elevated sea levels. Honolulu's mayor stated: \"I'm not a scientist, but I'll get a jackhammer in there and remove all the concrete that's there creating this backwash and sucking out more sand, plus it's just downright dangerous.\"\nThe beach hosts many events, including surf competitions, outdoor performances, hula dancing, and outrigger canoe races. The many amenities, shops, and hotels enable Waik\u012bk\u012b to generate approximately 42 percent of Hawai\u02bbi's visitor revenue.\nGeography.\nThe neighborhood extends from the Ala Wai Canal (a channel dug to drain wetlands) on the west and north, to Diamond Head (\"L\u0113\u02bbahi,\" tuna brow) on the east. Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach is noted for its views of the Diamond Head tuff cone, its usually warm and cloud-free climate, and its surf break. The Waik\u012bk\u012b skyline is filled with high-rises and resort hotels. \nBeaches.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b Beach.\nBefore 1950, the beach in the Waik\u012bk\u012b neighborhood was continuous and known as Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach. Seawalls and other developments have since separated the coast into eight distinct beaches. Since 1951, nearly of sand have been added to restore the beach in the region, but it is believed that little of the added sand remains. As of 2020 the family of beaches in the region are still referred to as \"Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach\", but most venues and addresses will use the name of a specific subsidiary beach.\nFrom Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach the sunset in the sea is visible from mid-September to late March. Half of the beach is marked off for surfers. For some distance into the ocean the water is quite shallow, with numerous rocks on the bottom. The waves can have some force, particularly on windy days. The surf is known for its long rolling break, making it ideal for long boarding, tandem surfing, and beginners. \nSubsidiary beaches.\nLargely as a result of shoreline development, Waik\u012bk\u012b has eight beaches. They are Ft. DeRussy Beach, Duke Kahanamoku Beach, Halekulani Beach, Royal Hawaiian Beach, K\u016bhi\u014d Beach, Kapi\u02bbolani Beach, Queens Beach, and Kaimana Beach. \nThoroughfares.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b's main thoroughfare is Kal\u0101kaua Avenue, named after King Kal\u0101kaua, which houses most of the high-end hotels (Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton, Hyatt, Marriott, Moana Surfrider Hotel), most of the luxury designer brand stores (Apple Store, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Burberry, Dior, Tiffany &amp; Co., Fendi, Harry Winston, Saint Laurent, Gucci, and Herm\u00e8s), department store (Macy's), and popular surf clothing brand stores (Quiksilver, Billabong, Volcom). Waik\u012bk\u012b's other main thoroughfare, K\u016bhi\u014d Avenue, named after Prince K\u016bhi\u014d, is better known for its restaurants, cafes and grocers, along with its clubs, nightlife and prostitution.\nPublic art.\nIn 1990, the bronze statue of Duke Kahanamoku by Gordon Fisher was installed at Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach, accompanied by a bronze replica of his surfboard, honorary spears, and commemorative bronze plaques. It serves as a culture and tourist locale with thousands of annual visitors and numerous cultural events. Seven years later, Billy Fields created The Stones of Life (in Hawaiian: \"N\u0101 P\u014dhaku Ola O Kapaemahu A Me Kapuni\"), a sculpture incorporating ancient basaltic stones, was installed nearby and is considered a local monument. A bronze sculpture in Kapi\u02bbolani Park of Mahatma Gandhi by Stephen Lowe entitled \"A Fistful of Salt\" was a gift in 1990 from the Gandhi Memorial International Foundation and the Jhamandas Watumull Fund.\nAt K\u016bhi\u014d Beach and Queens Beach, three public artworks were installed in the early 2000s. The bronze statue of Prince Jonah Kuhio by Sean Browne and the children's story sculpture https:// by Holly Young were installed in 2001. Robert Pashby's \"Surfer on a Wave\" was installed at Queens Beach in 2003.\nBeach issues.\nErosion.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b beach has had repeated problems with erosion, leading to the construction of groins and beach replenishment projects. Imported sand came from California, local beaches such as P\u0101p\u014dhaku Beach on Moloka\u2018i, and a sandbar from O\u02bbahu's Northern side near Kahuku. Officials look for ways to sustain the existing sand by eliminating loss due to tidal flow.\nErosion claims about of beach per year. Local sources are sought for sand to replenish the beach.\nWater quality.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b Beach had repeated contamination problems due to sewage spills in 2017.\nHomelessness.\nMany homeless people settle around the beach because of the public shower and sanitary facilities available there.\nThe Honolulu Police Department has increased patrolling in and around Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach with assistance from other city agencies and local businesses to prevent homeless people from making camp in this area.\nEducation.\nHawaii state Department of Education operates conventional public schools throughout Hawaii. Thomas Jefferson Elementary School is located in Waik\u012bk\u012b proper, while Waik\u012bk\u012b Elementary School is located nearby, at the \"makai\" (seaward) edge of the Kapahulu neighborhood.\nThe Hawaii State Public Library System operates the Waik\u012bk\u012b Public Library.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nWaik\u012bk\u012b is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59651", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59651", "title": "Erfurt school massacre", "text": "2002 mass shooting in Germany\nThe Erfurt school massacre was a mass shooting that occurred on 26 April 2002 at the Gutenberg-Gymnasium, a secondary school in Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany. 19-year-old expelled student Robert Steinh\u00e4user shot and killed 16 people, including a police officer before killing himself. One person was also wounded by a bullet fragment. According to students, he ignored them and aimed only for the teachers and administrators, although two students were unintentionally killed by shots fired through a locked door.\nBackground.\nRobert Steinh\u00e4user, a 19-year-old man born on 22 January 1983, was the perpetrator of the massacre. He was a student of the Gutenberg-Gymnasium until early October 2001 and had previously threatened a teacher. His academic performance declined in 1999, leading him to drop out of the year shortly before the final exam. He was allowed to repeat the 11th year at the request of his parents, approved by the principal. He joined a gun club in October 2000 or 2001 and acquired a gun license.\nAt the end of September 2001, he had spent a few days away from school, for which he presented a mandatory medical certificate which was quickly identified as a forgery. Because of this forgery, Steinh\u00e4user was expelled by the principal. Due to the regulations used in Thuringia at the time, Steinh\u00e4user, on expulsion, was without any qualifications and therefore had very limited job opportunities.\nSteinh\u00e4user did not tell his parents he had been expelled, and pretended he was still attending school. The day of the shooting he told his parents he was going to school to take a maths exam. The investigation revealed that Steinh\u00e4user had been using the Internet to research the Columbine High School massacre, and had related files saved on his computer.\nMassacre.\nOn the day of the shooting, before leaving his residence at his usual time, Steinh\u00e4user armed himself with a 9mm Glock 17C semi-automatic pistol, a Mossberg 590 Mariner 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, which was unusable due to an earlier handling error, and a diving knife. Steinh\u00e4user entered the school unmasked at approximately 10:45, carrying his weapons and ammunition concealed in either his sports bag or backpack. As Steinh\u00e4user was in the hallway, he encountered the building's caretaker, and briefly talked with him. He asked whether or not Ms. Alt, the principal of the school, was in the building. He went into the men's lavatory on the ground floor and changed some of his clothes, including a black face mask. He left his coat, wallet and identification.\nThe shooting started shortly before 10:58\u00a0am. From the lavatory, Steinh\u00e4user went to the school office. There he shot the deputy school principal and the secretary. In the next room was the headmistress, but Steinh\u00e4user did not enter the room despite the door being unlocked. When the headmistress went to check the noise, Steinh\u00e4user had already left the room. Upon discovering the bodies, she locked herself in her office and alerted the emergency services. Steinh\u00e4user moved from classroom to classroom between the second and third floor, pausing briefly each time in the doorway to shoot a teacher, then moving on to the next room, sometimes shooting at teachers he encountered in the halls or the stairways. There were two exceptions to this pattern: In Room 208, Steinh\u00e4user had either not seen the present teacher or mistaken her for a student. He thus did not open fire, but returned a few minutes later and shot at the now-barricaded door, fatally wounding two students. In the second instance, history and arts teacher Rainer Heise stated that he had seen Steinh\u00e4user on the school yard, just after he shot a teacher on the grounds, trying to fire at fleeing students before realising his gun was empty. At 11:05 am, a janitor called the police. At 11:12 am, the first police car arrived at the school. Steinh\u00e4user opened fire on the police, fatally shooting one of the policemen. A student told other officers around the same time that she had recognised the shooter as Steinh\u00e4user.\nIn front of the art material Room 111 on the first floor, Steinh\u00e4user met Heise. Steinh\u00e4user, who removed his mask either during or shortly before the encounter, was recognised by Heise as a former student of his history class. In interviews, Heise stated that he told Steinh\u00e4user \"You may shoot me now\" while looking him in the eyes, after which Steinh\u00e4user lowered his weapon and replied: \"Herr Heise, f\u00fcr heute reichts.\" [Mr Heise, that's enough for today.] According to Heise, he asked Steinh\u00e4user for a private talk in a nearby art material room. When Steinh\u00e4user entered and put his gun on a shelf, Heise pushed Steinh\u00e4user from behind and locked him inside. Steinh\u00e4user killed himself shortly after police entered the building minutes later.\nFrom the first shot to Steinh\u00e4user's suicide the spree lasted no more than 20 minutes. Shortly after 12:00 a.m., Steinh\u00e4user's body was found by a special police detachment (SEK) in Room 111. The gunman had killed 16 people: the school's assistant principal, secretary, ten teachers, one trainee-teacher, two students, and one police officer. In total one third of the school's faculty were killed, and two students, aged 14 and 15, were shot by rounds fired through a locked door. He fired around 71 shots in total and reloaded three times during the massacre.\nReactions.\nSteinh\u00e4user's family issued a statement to news sources saying that they \"will forever be sorry that our son and brother has brought such horrifying suffering to the victims and their relatives, the people of Erfurt and Thuringia, and all over Germany.\"\nIn 2004, after repeated public criticisms of the police response to the shooting, the state government of Thuringia tasked a committee to release a final report on the shooting. The state government of Thuringia reprimanded the principal of the school for the expulsion of Steinh\u00e4user, saying she had overstepped her legal powers and violated the rules of the procedure. There were no further legal consequences for the principal and she remains in charge of the school as of 2017.\nLikewise, the Thuringian education law was caught in the crossfire of criticism. Since Steinh\u00e4user was already an adult, the school administration was not required to inform his parents about their son's expulsion from school. In contrast to most other German states at this time, the state of Thuringia did not automatically award the middle school certificate at the end of the 10th grade. Students who did not pass the final exams therefore did not have a school certificate, which left them with limited job prospects. In response to the shooting, a law was enacted that would give high school students the option to take an exam at the end of the 10th grade at their own request. Since 2004, this exam has been mandatory for all Thuringian high school students.\nThe shooting also led to public discussions on the effect of violence in media and its effect on the youth, especially in relation to computer games of the first-person shooter genre, so-called killer games and dealing with fictional violence in other media. According to the report of the Gutenberg Commission, Steinh\u00e4user had some violent movies such as \"Fight Club\", \"Predator\" and \"Desperado\", as well as the video games \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\", \"\" and \"Half-Life\". Steinh\u00e4user was apparently not interested in the game \"Counter-Strike\", which was often mentioned in connection with the shooting by the media. The discussions contributed to a revision of the Protection of Young Persons Act and helped to strengthen the rules for these legal areas.\nIn addition to the reform of the Protection of Young Persons Act, gun laws were tightened. The legal minimum age for those who wanted to join a shooting club was raised from 18 to 21 years and anyone under 25 years wishing to handle firearms was now required to undergo a medical-psychological examination. Pump-action firearms were banned altogether. Furthermore, the retention requirements for firearms and ammunition were significantly tightened.\nLegacy.\nAfter the rampage, around 700 students were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, about one hundred of whom were still under treatment for one year after the shooting. 10 years after the killing spree, there were still six witnesses in psychological therapy, including four who had initially rejected a follow-up program. These adolescents had \"time-delayed disturbances such as memory gaps and extreme avoidance behavior\". The Thuringian Accident Insurance Fund as payers has so far taken over childcare costs for the victims in the amount of about 5.6 million Euros, including about 2.2 million Euros as pension payments, for example, for survivors' pensions.\nSteinh\u00e4user's last words \u2013 \"F\u00fcr heute reicht's\" (\"that's enough for today\") \u2013 was also the title of a controversial book about the massacre written by Ines Geipel, who alleged that there were several mistakes made by the police on the case. Geipel, and relatives of some of the victims, criticized police for the initial speed of their response. The police had initially believed there was a second gunman, leading them to retake the school one level at a time rather than storm the entire building. Police laws and police training were reformed in most federal states in response to the shooting. While police patrols were previously required to wait for a special task force, policemen all over Germany now get the necessary training and equipment to deal directly with mass shooters.\nHeise was hailed as a national hero for locking Steinh\u00e4user in a room, which ended the killing spree, but was later subject to backlash from some members of the public due to questions about his role. Erfurt Mayor Manfred Ruge said he fully believes Heise, but acknowledged the teacher's rather direct and animated style combined with the vast media coverage had caused resentment in the town.\nThe massacre led to the development of a code word that could be broadcast over the public address system to warn teachers of a shooting. \"Mrs. Koma is coming\", which is \"amok\" spelled backwards, was later used at the Winnenden school shooting to alert teachers to that attack.\nSteinh\u00e4user was mentioned in a video created by Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who killed eight people during the Jokela school shooting in Finland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was published by Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman in 1978. A polynomial time attack was published by Adi Shamir in 1984. As a result, the cryptosystem is now considered insecure. \nHistory.\nThe concept of public key cryptography was introduced by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. At that time they proposed the general concept of a \"trap-door one-way function\", a function whose inverse is computationally infeasible to calculate without some secret \"trap-door information\"; but they had not yet found a practical example of such a function. Several specific public-key cryptosystems were then proposed by other researchers over the next few years, such as RSA in 1977 and Merkle-Hellman in 1978.\nDescription.\nMerkle\u2013Hellman is a public key cryptosystem, meaning that two keys are used, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the subset sum problem (a special case of the knapsack problem). The problem is as follows: given a set of integers formula_1 and an integer formula_2, find a subset of formula_1 which sums to formula_2. In general, this problem is known to be NP-complete. However, if formula_1 is superincreasing, meaning that each element of the set is greater than the sum of all the numbers in the set lesser than it, the problem is \"easy\" and solvable in polynomial time with a simple greedy algorithm.\nIn Merkle\u2013Hellman, decrypting a message requires solving an apparently \"hard\" knapsack problem. The private key contains a superincreasing list of numbers formula_6, and the public key contains a non-superincreasing list of numbers formula_7, which is actually a \"disguised\" version of formula_6. The private key also contains some \"trapdoor\" information that can be used to transform a hard knapsack problem using formula_7 into an easy knapsack problem using formula_6.\nUnlike some other public key cryptosystems such as RSA, the two keys in Merkle-Hellman are not interchangeable; the private key cannot be used for encryption. Thus Merkle-Hellman is not directly usable for authentication by cryptographic signing, although Shamir published a variant that can be used for signing.\nKey generation.\n1. Choose a block size formula_11. Integers up to formula_11 bits in length can be encrypted with this key.\n2. Choose a random superincreasing sequence of formula_11 positive integers\nformula_14\nThe superincreasing requirement means that formula_15, for formula_16.\n3. Choose a random integer formula_17 such that\n formula_18\n4. Choose a random integer formula_19 such that formula_20 (that is, formula_19 and formula_17 are coprime).\n5. Calculate the sequence\nformula_23\nwhere formula_24.\nThe public key is formula_7 and the private key is formula_26.\nEncryption.\nLet formula_27 be an formula_11-bit message consisting of bits formula_29, with formula_30 the highest order bit. Select each formula_31 for which formula_32 is nonzero, and add them together. Equivalently, calculate\nformula_33.\nThe ciphertext is formula_2.\nDecryption.\nTo decrypt a ciphertext formula_2, we must find the subset of formula_7 which sums to formula_2. We do this by transforming the problem into one of finding a subset of formula_6. That problem can be solved in polynomial time since formula_6 is superincreasing.\n1. Calculate the modular inverse of formula_19 modulo formula_17 using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. The inverse will exist since formula_19 is coprime to formula_17.\nformula_44\nThe computation of formula_45 is independent of the message, and can be done just once when the private key is generated.\n2. Calculate\nformula_46\n3. Solve the subset sum problem for formula_47 using the superincreasing sequence formula_6, by the simple greedy algorithm described below. Let formula_49 be the resulting list of indexes of the elements of formula_6 which sum to formula_47. (That is, formula_52.)\n4. Construct the message formula_27 with a 1 in each formula_54 bit position and a 0 in all other bit positions:\nformula_55\nSolving the subset sum problem.\nThis simple greedy algorithm finds the subset of a superincreasing sequence formula_6 which sums to formula_47, in polynomial time:\n1. Initialize formula_58 to an empty list.\n2. Find the largest element in formula_6 which is less than or equal to formula_47, say formula_61.\n3. Subtract: formula_62.\n4. Append formula_63 to the list formula_58.\n5. Remove formula_61 from the superincreasing sequence formula_6\n6. If formula_47 is greater than zero, return to step 2.\nExample.\nKey generation.\nCreate a key to encrypt 8-bit numbers by creating a random superincreasing sequence of 8 values:\nformula_68\nThe sum of these is 706, so select a larger value for formula_17:\nformula_70.\nChoose formula_19 to be coprime to formula_17: \nformula_73.\nConstruct the public key formula_7 by multiplying each element in formula_6 by formula_19 modulo formula_17:\nformula_78\nHence formula_79.\nEncryption.\nLet the 8-bit message be formula_80. We multiply each bit by the corresponding number in formula_7 and add the results:\n 0 * 295\n + 1 * 592\n + 1 * 301\n + 0 * 14\n + 0 * 28\n + 0 * 353\n + 0 * 120\n + 1 * 236\n = 1129\nThe ciphertext formula_2 is 1129.\nDecryption.\nTo decrypt 1129, first use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of formula_19 mod formula_17:\nformula_85. \nCompute formula_86. \nUse the greedy algorithm to decompose 372 into a sum of formula_87 values:\nformula_88\nThus formula_89, and the list of indexes is formula_90. The message can now be computed as\nformula_91.\nCryptanalysis.\nIn 1984 Adi Shamir published an attack on the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem which can decrypt encrypted messages in polynomial time without using the private key. The attack analyzes the public key formula_92 and searches for a pair of numbers formula_93 and formula_27 such that formula_95 is a superincreasing sequence. The formula_96 pair found by the attack may not be equal to formula_97 in the private key, but like that pair it can be used to transform a hard knapsack problem using formula_7 into an easy problem using a superincreasing sequence. The attack operates solely on the public key; no access to encrypted messages is necessary.\nShamir's attack on the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem works in polynomial time even if the numbers in the public key are randomly shuffled, a step which is usually not included in the description of the cryptosystem, but can be helpful against some more primitive attacks."}

The FCO was itself created in 1968 by the merger of the Foreign Office (FO) and the Commonwealth Office. The department is responsible for representing and promoting British interests worldwide.\nThe head of the FCDO is the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs, commonly abbreviated to \"foreign secretary\". This is regarded as one of the four most prestigious positions in the Cabinet \u2013 the Great Offices of State \u2013 alongside those of Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary. Yvette Cooper was appointed Foreign Secretary on 5 September 2025 following the 2025 British cabinet reshuffle.\nThe FCDO is managed day-to-day by a civil servant, the permanent under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, who also acts as the Head of His Majesty's Diplomatic Service. Sir Oliver Robbins took office as permanent under-secretary on 8 January 2025.\nThe expenditure, administration and policy of the FCDO are scrutinised by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.\nResponsibilities.\nAccording to the FCDO website, the department's key responsibilities (as of 2020) are as follows:\nIn addition to those responsibilities, the FCDO is responsible for the British Overseas Territories, which had previously been administered from 1782 to 1801 by the Home Office, from 1801 to 1854 by the War and Colonial Office, from 1854 to 1966 by the Colonial Office, from 1966 to 1968 by the Commonwealth Office, and from 1968 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (this did not include \"protectorates\", which fell under the purview of the Foreign Office, or to British India, which had been administered by the East India Company until 1858, and thereafter by the India Office).\nThis arrangement has been subject to criticism in the UK and in the overseas territories. For example, the chief minister of Anguilla, Victor Banks, said: \"We are not foreign; neither are we members of the Commonwealth, so we should have a different interface with the UK that is based on mutual respect\". There have been numerous suggestions on ways to improve the relationship between the overseas territories and the UK. Suggestions have included setting up a dedicated department to handle relations with the overseas territories, similarly to the French Ministry of the Overseas, or alternatively the absorption of the Overseas Territories Directorate (OTD) in the Cabinet Office, thus affording the overseas territories with better connections to the centre of government.\nMinisters.\nThe FCDO ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:\nHistory.\nEighteenth century.\nThe Foreign Office was formed in March 1782 by combining the Southern and Northern Departments of the Secretary of State, each of which covered both foreign and domestic affairs in their parts of the Kingdom. The two departments' foreign affairs responsibilities became the Foreign Office, whilst their domestic affairs responsibilities were assigned to the Home Office. The Home Office is technically the senior.\nNineteenth century.\nDuring the 19th century, it was not infrequent for the Foreign Office to approach \"The Times\" newspaper and ask for continental intelligence, which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources. Examples of journalists who specialized in foreign affairs and were well connected to politicians included: Henry Southern, Valentine Chirol, Harold Nicolson, and Robert Bruce Lockhart.\nTwentieth century.\nDuring the First World War, the Arab Bureau was set up within the British Foreign Office as a section of the \"Cairo Intelligence Department\". During the early Cold War an important department was the Information Research Department (IRD) which was used to create propaganda against socialist and anti-colonial movements. In 1922 after the end of the First World War the recently created Government Code and Cypher School moved from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office.\nThe Foreign Office hired its first woman diplomat, Monica Milne, in 1946.\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1968\u20132020).\nThe FCO was formed on 17 October 1968, from the merger of the short-lived Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office. The Commonwealth Office had been created only in 1966, by the merger of the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office having been formed by the merger of the Dominions Office and the India Office in 1947\u2014with the Dominions Office having been split from the Colonial Office in 1925.\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office held responsibility for international development issues between 1970 and 1974, and again between 1979 and 1997.\nThe National Archives website contains a government timeline to show the departments responsible for foreign and commonwealth affairs from 1945.\nUnder New Labour (1997\u20132010).\nFrom 1997, international development became the responsibility of the separate Department for International Development.\nWhen David Miliband took over as Foreign Secretary in June 2007, he set in hand a review of the FCO's strategic priorities. One of the key messages of these discussions was the conclusion that the existing framework of ten international strategic priorities, dating from 2003, was no longer appropriate. Although the framework had been useful in helping the FCO plan its work and allocate its resources, there was agreement that it needed a new framework to drive its work forward.\nThe new strategic framework consists of three core elements:\nIn August 2005, a report by management consultant group Collinson Grant was made public by Andrew Mackinlay. The report severely criticised the FCO's management structure, noting:\nThe Foreign Office commissioned the report to highlight areas which would help it achieve its pledge to reduce spending by \u00a387 million over three years. In response to the report being made public, the Foreign Office stated it had already implemented the report's recommendations.\nIn 2009, Gordon Brown created the position of Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the FCO. The first science adviser was David Clary.\nOn 25 April 2010, the department apologised after \"The Sunday Telegraph\" obtained a \"foolish\" document calling for the upcoming September visit of Pope Benedict XVI to be marked by the launch of \"Benedict-branded\" condoms, the opening of an abortion clinic and the blessing of a same-sex marriage.\nCoalition and Conservatives (2010\u20132020).\nIn 2012, the Foreign Office was criticised by Gerald Steinberg of the Jerusalem-based research institute NGO Monitor, saying that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development provided more than \u00a3500,000 in funding to Palestinian NGOs which he said \"promote political attacks on Israel\". In response, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said \"we are very careful about who and what we fund. The objective of our funding is to support efforts to achieve a two-state solution. Funding a particular project for a limited period of time does not mean that we endorse every single action or public comment made by an NGO or by its employees.\"\nIn September 2012, the FCO and the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs signed a Memorandum of Understanding on diplomatic cooperation, which promotes the co-location of embassies, the joint provision of consular services, and common crisis response. The project has been criticised for further diminishing the UK's influence in Europe.\nIn 2011, the then Foreign Secretary, William Hague, announced the government's intention to open a number of new diplomatic posts in order to enhance the UK's overseas network. As such, eight new embassies and six new consulates were opened around the world.\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office (2020\u20132022).\nOn 16 June 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the merger of the FCO with the Department for International Development. This was following the decision in the February 2020 cabinet reshuffle to give cross-departmental briefs to all junior ministers in the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office. The merger, which created the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, took place in September 2020 with a stated aim of ensuring that aid is spent \"in line with the UK's priorities overseas\". The merger was criticised by three former prime ministers \u2013 Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and David Cameron \u2013 with Cameron saying that it would mean \"less respect for the UK overseas\". The chief executive of Save the Children, Kevin Watkins, called it \"reckless, irresponsible and a dereliction of UK leadership\" that \"threatens to reverse hard-won gains in child survival, nutrition and poverty\".\nIn November 2021, it was reported that an employment tribunal had ruled that the FCDO had racially discriminated against Sonia Warner, a black senior civil servant, by treating her unfairly in a disciplinary process.\nOn 21 February 2022, UK Minister for Africa Vicky Ford announced a new \u00a374 million financial package to support women entrepreneurs across Nigeria, who own businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\nIn 2022, Maria Bamieh settled an employment claim against the Foreign Office for more than \u00a3400,000 shortly before her claim was due to be heard by an employment tribunal. She said that the Foreign Office failed to support her when she attempted to expose corruption at the EU's rule of law mission (EULEX). The Foreign Office said: \"We have agreed to settle this long-running case without any admission of liability and continue to strongly refute these allegations.\"\nInternational Academy.\nFollowing a prior announcement by the then Foreign Secretary William Hague, the Diplomatic Academy was established in February 2015. The centre was established in order to create a cross-government centre of excellence for all civil servants working on international issues. The academy serves to broaden the department's network and engage in collaborative work with academic and diplomatic partners. The institution was renamed the International Academy as part of the 2020 creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\nProgramme Funds.\nThe FCDO, through its core departmental budget, funds projects which are in line with its policy priorities outlined in its Single Departmental Plan. This funding includes both Official Development Assistance (ODA), and non-ODA funds. The funds are used for a wide range of projects and serve to support traditional diplomatic activities.\nThe FCDO plays a key role in delivering two, major UK government funds which work to support the government's National Security Strategy and Aid Strategy.\nThe FCDO also supports a number of academic funds:\n2021 aid budget cuts.\nIn 2021, the UK government cut its overseas aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of Gross National Income despite UK legislation against such a move. These cuts, amounting to \u00a34 billion, reduced funding for humanitarian intervention by 44% in places like Yemen and Syria. It also cut funding for the fight against polio, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Funding for girls education worldwide was also reduced by 25%.\nInvestments.\nThe Global Innovation Fund (GIF) announced the first two investments made under its 'Innovating for Climate Resilience fund', which was launched at COP26 with support from the UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and in partnership with the Adaptation Research Alliance and the Global Resilience Partnership.\nUNRWA funding.\nAccording to the FCDO and Foreign Secretary, the UK committed over \u00a3100 million in aid to the OPTs (Occupied Palestinian territories) for the 2023/2024 period, of which \u00a335 million was specifically provided to UNRWA before it was suspended in January 2024. The funding was suspended after allegations surfaced that members of staff at UNRWA had been involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel in 2023; however, in July 2024, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced that the UK would resume funding to UNRWA.\nFCDO Services.\nIn April 2006, a new executive agency was established, FCO Services (now FCDO Services), to provide corporate service functions. It moved to Trading Fund status in April 2008, so that it had the ability to provide services similar to those it already offers to the FCDO to other government departments and even to outside businesses.\nAs of 2017, Sir Simon Gass is Non-Executive Director and Chair of the FCDO Services Board.\nFCDO Services operates globally in 250 destinations across 168 countries; with office regions covering Asia &amp; Pacific, Europe &amp; Central Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa and The Americas.\nThe services FCDO Services offer are \"Digital and Cloud\", \"Securing your Buildings and Spaces\", \"Logistics\", \"Translation and Interpreting\" and \"Technical Security from UK NACE\".\nIt is accountable to the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs, and provides secure support services to the FCDO, other government departments and foreign governments and bodies with which the UK has close links.\nSince 2011, FCDO Services has been developing the Government Secure Application Environment (GSAE) on a secure cloud computing platform to support UK government organisations. It also manages the UK National Authority for Counter Eavesdropping (UK NACE) which helps protect UK assets from physical, electronic and cyber attack.\nFCDO Services is a public sector organisation, it is not funded by the public and has to rely on the income it produces to meet its costs, by providing services on a commercial basis to customers both in the UK and throughout the world. Its accounting officer and chief executive is accountable to the secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs and to Parliament, for the organisation's performance and conduct.\nGlobal Response Office.\nThe FCDO Global Response Office operates 24/7, every day of the year. It takes calls from British Nationals overseas, usually in emergency situations such as lost passports, hospitalisations, deaths and arrests.\nLibrary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Records Department.\nThe historical records of the FCO was transferred to a permanent loan to King\u2019s College London in 2007, likely from the review to reduce due to cost reduction of non-core activities at the FCO. The collection consists of 90,000 artifacts from the early 16th century (mainly of Tudor England) to present.\nBuildings.\nAs well as embassies abroad, the FCDO has premises within the UK:\nThe FCO formerly also used the following building:\nMain Building.\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office occupies a building which originally provided premises for four separate government departments: the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Colonial Office, and the Home Office. Construction on the building began in 1861 and finished in 1868, on the plot of land bounded by Whitehall, King Charles Street, Horse Guards Road and Downing Street. The building was designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott. Its architecture is in the Italianate style; Scott had initially envisaged a Gothic design, but Lord Palmerston, then prime minister, insisted on a classical style. The English sculptors Henry Hugh Armstead and John Birnie Philip produced a number of allegorical figures (\"Art\", \"Law\", \"Commerce\", etc.) for the exterior.\nIn 1925 the Foreign Office played host to the signing of the Locarno Treaties, aimed at reducing tension in Europe. The ceremony took place in a suite of rooms that had been designed for banqueting, which subsequently became known as the Locarno Suite. During the Second World War, the Locarno Suite's fine furnishings were removed or covered up, and it became home to a Foreign Office code-breaking department.\nDue to increasing numbers of staff, the offices became increasingly cramped and much of the fine Victorian interior was covered over\u2014especially after the Second World War. In the 1960s, demolition was proposed, as part of major redevelopment plan for the area drawn up by the architect Leslie Martin. A subsequent public outcry prevented these proposals from ever being implemented. Instead, the Foreign Office became a Grade\u00a0I listed building in 1970. In 1978, the Home Office moved to a new building, easing overcrowding.\nWith a new sense of the building's historical value, it underwent a 17-year, \u00a3100 million restoration process, completed in 1997. The Locarno Suite, used as offices and storage since the Second World War, was fully restored for use in international conferences. The building is now open to the public each year over Open House Weekend.\nIn 2014 refurbishment to accommodate all Foreign and Commonwealth Office employees into one building was started by Mace.\nDevolution.\nInternational relations are handled centrally from Whitehall on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom and its dependencies. However, the devolved administrations also maintain an overseas presence in the European Union, the U.S. and China alongside British diplomatic missions. These offices aim to promote their own economies and ensure that devolved interests are taken into account in British foreign policy. Ministers from devolved administrations can attend international negotiations when agreed with the British Government, e.g. EU fisheries negotiations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is best known for her best-selling memoir \"The Happy Hooker: My Own Story\".\nEarly life.\nHollander was born Xaviera de Vries in Surabaya, Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, which later became part of present-day Indonesia, to a Dutch Jewish physician father and a mother of French and German descent. She spent the first years of her life in a Japanese-run internment camp. After the end of Japanese occupation the family returned to the Netherlands.\nIn her early twenties she left Amsterdam for Johannesburg, where her stepsister lived. There she met and became engaged to American economist John Weber. When the engagement was broken off, she left South Africa for New York City.\nCareer.\nIn 1968, she resigned from her job as a secretary in the Dutch consulate in New York City to become a call girl, making up to US$ a night (equivalent to $ in 2024). A year later, she opened her own brothel, the Vertical Whorehouse, and soon became New York City's leading madam. In 1971, she was arrested for prostitution by New York Police and forced to leave the United States.\nAuthor.\nIn 1971, Hollander published a memoir, \"The Happy Hooker: My Own Story.\" Robin Moore, who took Hollander's dictation of the book's contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy ghostwrote it. Hollander later wrote a number of other books and produced plays in Amsterdam. Her second book, \"Child No More\", is the story of losing her mother. For 35 years she wrote an advice column for \"Penthouse\" magazine, entitled \"Call Me Madam.\"\nOther ventures.\nIn the early 1970s, she recorded a primarily spoken-word album titled \"Xaviera!\" for the Canadian GRT Records label (GRT 9230-1033), on which she discussed her philosophy regarding sex and prostitution, sang a cover version of the Beatles' song \"Michelle\", and recorded several simulated sexual encounters, including an example of phone sex, a threesome, and a celebrity encounter with guest \"vocal\" by Ronnie Hawkins. \"Xaviera's Game\", an erotic board game, was released in 1974 by Reiss Games, Inc. In 1975, she starred in the semi-autobiographical film \"My Pleasure Is My Business\". Beginning in 2005, she operated Xaviera's Happy House, a bed-and-breakfast, in her Amsterdam home.\nPersonal life.\nFor several years in the 1970s, Hollander lived in Toronto, where she married Frank Applebaum, a Canadian antique dealer, and was a regular fixture on the downtown scene. She mentioned a lover named John Drummond, with whom she partnered for many years, co-authoring two books, including \"Let's Get Moving\" (1988) about their life together: \"I went there with, who for years had been the love of my life, John Drummond, a wild Scottish intellectual who, at times, liked his whisky, beer, and wines too much. We had great sex, often up to three times a day \u2014 all that and he was about 17 years older than me.\" During a 2018 interview, she revealed a darker side of the relationship with the man she called \"the love of my life!\": \"The love of my life, 25 years ago, John Drummond, a brilliant and boisterous Scotsman with a 'Thatcheresque' accent had, especially under the influence of a few scotches, beers, or wine, become quite destructive towards me. He is the only one who managed to deprive me of my self-esteem or identity, temporarily. He used to say that a British man\u2019s way of saying 'I love you' is to put his woman down.\" Drummond is listed as one of her husbands. Hollander claimed to have \"turned gay\" around 1997, establishing a long-term relationship with a Dutch poet called Dia. In January 2007, she married a Dutch man, Philip de Haan, in Amsterdam.\nOther works.\nHollander has been depicted in film five times:\nShe appears in at least two films:\nIn 1989, Hollander made an on British discussion programme \"After Dark\", alongside Mary Stott, Malcolm Bennett and Hans Eysenck, among others.\nA musical about her life was written and composed by Richard Hansom and Warren Wills.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The position of secretary of state for foreign affairs was created in the British governmental reorganisation of 1782, in which the Northern Department and Southern Department became the Foreign Office and Home Office respectively. The India Office was closed down in 1947. It had been a constituent predecessor department of the Foreign Office, like the Colonial Office and the Dominions Office.\nEventually, the position of secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs came into existence in 1968 with the merger of the functions of secretary of state for foreign affairs and the secretary of state for Commonwealth affairs into a single department of state. Margaret Beckett, appointed in 2006 by Tony Blair, was the first woman to hold the post.\nThe post of secretary of state for foreign, commonwealth and development affairs was created in 2020 when position holder Dominic Raab absorbed the responsibilities of the secretary of state for international development.\nList of foreign secretaries.\nSecretaries of state for foreign affairs (1782\u20131968).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^\u2020 Died in office.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecretaries of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs (1968\u20132020).\nPost created through the merger of the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office.\nSecretaries of state for foreign, commonwealth and development affairs (2020\u2013\"present\").\nPost created through the merger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59656", "revid": "39747830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59656", "title": "Rayleigh number", "text": "Dimensionless quantity associated with free convection of a fluid\nIn fluid mechanics, the Rayleigh number (Ra, after Lord Rayleigh) for a fluid is a dimensionless number associated with buoyancy-driven flow, also known as free (or natural) convection. It characterises the fluid's flow regime: a value in a certain lower range denotes laminar flow; a value in a higher range, turbulent flow. Below a certain critical value, there is no fluid motion and heat transfer is by conduction rather than convection. For most engineering purposes, the Rayleigh number is large, somewhere around 106 to 108.\nThe Rayleigh number is defined as the product of the Grashof number (Gr), which describes the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity within a fluid, and the Prandtl number (Pr), which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity: Ra = Gr \u00d7 Pr. Hence it may also be viewed as the ratio of buoyancy and viscosity forces multiplied by the ratio of momentum and thermal diffusivities: Ra = B/\"\u03bc\" \u00d7 \"\u03bd\"/\"\u03b1\". It is closely related to the Nusselt number (Nu).\nDerivation.\nThe Rayleigh number describes the behaviour of fluids (such as water or air) when the mass density of the fluid is non-uniform. The mass density differences are usually caused by temperature differences. Typically a fluid expands and becomes less dense as it is heated. Gravity causes denser parts of the fluid to sink, which is called convection. Lord Rayleigh studied the case of Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection. When the Rayleigh number, Ra, is below a critical value for a fluid, there is no flow and heat transfer is purely by conduction; when it exceeds that value, heat is transferred by natural convection.\nWhen the mass density difference is caused by temperature difference, Ra is, by definition, the ratio of the time scale for diffusive thermal transport to the time scale for convective thermal transport at speed formula_1:\nformula_2\nThis means the Rayleigh number is a type of P\u00e9clet number. For a volume of fluid of size formula_3 in all three dimensions and mass density difference formula_4, the force due to gravity is of the order formula_5, where formula_6 is acceleration due to gravity. From the Stokes equation, when the volume of fluid is sinking, viscous drag is of the order formula_7, where formula_8 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. When these two forces are equated, the speed formula_9. Thus the time scale for transport via flow is formula_10. The time scale for thermal diffusion across a distance formula_3 is formula_12, where formula_13 is the thermal diffusivity. Thus the Rayleigh number Ra is\nformula_14\nwhere we approximated the density difference formula_15 for a fluid of average mass density formula_16, thermal expansion coefficient formula_17 and a temperature difference formula_18 across distance formula_3.\nThe Rayleigh number can be written as the product of the Grashof number and the Prandtl number:\nformula_20\nClassical definition.\nFor free convection near a vertical wall, the Rayleigh number is defined as:\nformula_21\nwhere:\nIn the above, the fluid properties Pr, \"\u03bd\", \"\u03b1\" and \"\u03b2\" are evaluated at the film temperature, which is defined as:\nformula_23\nFor a uniform wall heating flux, the modified Rayleigh number is defined as:\nformula_24\nwhere:\nOther applications.\nSolidifying alloys.\nThe Rayleigh number can also be used as a criterion to predict convectional instabilities, such as A-segregates, in the mushy zone of a solidifying alloy. The mushy zone Rayleigh number is defined as:\nformula_25\nwhere:\nA-segregates are predicted to form when the Rayleigh number exceeds a certain critical value. This critical value is independent of the composition of the alloy, and this is the main advantage of the Rayleigh number criterion over other criteria for prediction of convectional instabilities, such as Suzuki criterion.\nTorabi Rad et al. showed that for steel alloys the critical Rayleigh number is 17. Pickering et al. explored Torabi Rad's criterion, and further verified its effectiveness. Critical Rayleigh numbers for lead\u2013tin and nickel-based super-alloys were also developed.\nPorous media.\nThe Rayleigh number above is for convection in a bulk fluid such as air or water, but convection can also occur when the fluid is inside and fills a porous medium, such as porous rock saturated with water. Then the Rayleigh number, sometimes called the Rayleigh-Darcy number, is different. In a bulk fluid, i.e., not in a porous medium, from the Stokes equation, the falling speed of a domain of size formula_3 of liquid formula_9. In porous medium, this expression is replaced by that from Darcy's law formula_28, with formula_29 the permeability of the porous medium. The Rayleigh or Rayleigh-Darcy number is then\nformula_30\nThis also applies to A-segregates, in the mushy zone of a solidifying alloy.\nGeophysical applications.\nIn geophysics, the Rayleigh number is of fundamental importance: it indicates the presence and strength of convection within a fluid body such as the Earth's mantle. The mantle is a solid that behaves as a fluid over geological time scales. The Rayleigh number for the Earth's mantle due to internal heating alone, Ra\"H\", is given by:\nformula_31\nwhere:\nA Rayleigh number for bottom heating of the mantle from the core, Ra\"T\", can also be defined as:\nformula_32\nwhere:\nHigh values for the Earth's mantle indicates that convection within the Earth is vigorous and time-varying, and that convection is responsible for almost all the heat transported from the deep interior to the surface.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He started his academic career as lecturer in the philosophy of science at the University of Bristol (1955\u20131958); afterward, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught for three decades (1958\u20131989). At various points in his life, he held joint appointments at the University College London (1967\u20131970), the London School of Economics (1967), the FU Berlin (1968), Yale University (1969), the University of Auckland (1972, 1975), the University of Sussex (1974), and the ETH Zurich (1980\u20131990). He gave lectures and lecture series at the University of Minnesota (1958\u20131962), Stanford University (1967), the University of Kassel (1977), and the University of Trento (1992).\nFeyerabend's most famous work is \"Against Method\" (1975), wherein he argues that there are no universally valid methodological rules for scientific inquiry. He also wrote on topics related to the politics of science in several essays and in his book \"Science in a Free Society\" (1978). Feyerabend's later works include \"Wissenschaft als Kunst\" (Science as Art) (1984), \"Farewell to Reason\" (1987), \"Three Dialogues on Knowledge\" (1991), and \"Conquest of Abundance\" (released posthumously in 1999), which collect essays from the 1970s until Feyerabend's death. The uncompleted draft of an earlier work was released posthumously in 2009 as \"Naturphilosophie\" and translated to English in 2016 as \"Philosophy of Nature\". This work contains Feyerabend's reconstruction of the history of natural philosophy from the Homeric period until the mid-20th century. In these works and others, Feyerabend wrote about numerous issues at the interface between history and philosophy of science and ethics, ancient philosophy, philosophy of art, political philosophy, medicine, and physics. His final work was an autobiography, \"Killing Time\", which he completed on his deathbed. Feyerabend's extensive correspondence and other materials from his \"Nachlass\" continue to be published.\nFeyerabend is recognized as one of the most important 20th-century philosophers of science. In a 2010 poll, he was ranked as the 8th-most significant philosopher of science. He is often mentioned alongside Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and N. R. Hanson as a crucial figure in the historical turn in philosophy of science, and his work on scientific pluralism has been markedly influential on the Stanford School and on much contemporary philosophy of science. Feyerabend was also a significant figure in the sociology of scientific knowledge. His lectures were extremely well-attended, attracting international attention. His multifaceted personality is eloquently summarized in his obituary by Ian Hacking: \"Humanists, in my old-fashioned sense, need to be part of both arts and sciences. Paul Feyerabend was a humanist. He was also fun.\"\nIn line with this humanistic interpretation and the concerns apparent in his later work, the http:// was founded in 2006 in his honor. The Foundation \"promotes the empowerment and wellbeing of disadvantaged human communities. By strengthening intra and inter-community solidarity, it strives to improve local capacities, promote the respect of human rights, and sustain cultural and biological diversity.\" In 1970, the Loyola University of Chicago awarded Feyerabend a Doctor of Humane Letters Degree \"honoris causa\". Asteroid (22356) Feyerabend is named after him.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nFeyerabend was born in 1924 in Vienna, Austria. His paternal grandfather was the illegitimate child of a housekeeper, Helena Feierabend, who introduced the 'y' into 'Feyerabend.' His father, originally from Carinthia, was an officer in the merchant marine in World War I in Istria and a civil servant in Vienna until he died due to complications from a stroke. His mother's family came from Stockerau. She was a seamstress and died on July 29, 1943 by suicide. The family lived in a working-class neighborhood (Wolfganggasse) where gypsy musicians, over-the-top relatives, illusionists, sudden accidents, and heated quarrels were part of everyday life. In his autobiography Feyerabend remembers a childhood in which magic and mysterious events were separated by dreary 'commonplace' only by a slight change of perspective \u2014 a theme later found in his work. \nRaised Catholic, Feyerabend attended the Realgymnasium, where he excelled as a (top student), especially in physics and mathematics. At 13 he built, with his father, his own telescope, which allowed him to become an observer for the Swiss Institute of Solar Research. He was inspired by his teacher Oswald Thomas and developed a reputation as knowing more than the teachers. A voracious reader, especially of mystery and adventure novels and plays, Feyerabend casually stumbled onto philosophy. Works by Plato, Descartes, and B\u00fcchner awoke his interest in the dramatic power of argument. He later encountered philosophy of science through the works of Mach, Eddington, and Dingler and was fascinated by Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" and his depiction of the \"lonely man.\" During high school, Feyerabend also began his lifelong interest in singing. He sang in a choir under and was later introduced to opera and inspired by performances from and Hans Hotter. He later trained formally under the tutelage of and others.\nNazi Occupation of Austria and World War II.\nFeyerabend's parents were both welcoming of the Anschluss. His mother was entranced by Hitler's voice and demeanor and his father was similarly impressed by Hitler's charisma and later joined the Nazi Party. Feyerabend himself was unmoved by the Anschluss or World War II, which he saw as an inconvenience that got in the way of reading and astronomy. Feyerabend was in the Hitler Youth as a part of compulsory policies and sometimes rebelled, praising the British or claiming he had to leave a meeting to attend Mass, and sometimes conformed, bringing in members who missed meetings. After the war, Feyerabend recounts that he \"did not accept the aims of Nazism\" and that he \"hardly knew what they were.\" Later, he wondered why he did not see the occupation and war as moral problems. They were just \"inconveniences\" and his reactions\u2014recalled with uncommon honesty\u2014were suggested by accidental moods and circumstances rather than by a \"well defined outlook\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201cLooking back, I notice a rather unstable combination of contrariness and a tendency to conform. A critical judgement or a feeling of unease could be silenced or turned into its opposite by an almost imperceptible counter-force. It was like a fragile cloud dispersed by heat. On other occasions I would not listen to reason or Nazi common sense and would cling to unpopular ideas. This ambivalence (which survived for many years and was weakened only recently) seems to have been connected with my ambivalence towards people: I wanted to be close to them, but I also wanted to be left alone.\u201d\u2014\u200a\nAfter graduating from high school, in April 1942 Feyerabend was drafted into the German Arbeitsdienst (working service), received basic training in Pirmasens, and was assigned to a unit in Quelerne en Bas, near Brest. He described the work he did during that period as monotonous: \"we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again.\" After a short leave he volunteered for officer school. In his autobiography he writes that he hoped the war would be over by the time he had finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the Eastern Front, was decorated with an Iron cross, and attained the rank of lieutenant. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing Red Army, Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One hit him in the spine which left him wheel-chaired for a year and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He later learned to walk with a crutch, but was left impotent and plagued by intermittent bouts of severe pain for the rest of his life.\nPost-WWII, PhD, and early career in England.\nAfter getting wounded in action, Feyerabend was hospitalized in and around Weimar where he spent more than a year recovering and where he witnessed the end of the war and Soviet occupation. The mayor of Apolda gave him a job in the education sector and he, then still on two crutches, worked in public entertainment including writing speeches, dialogues, and plays. Later, at the music academy in Weimar, he was granted a scholarship and food stamps and took lessons in Italian, harmony, singing, enunciation, and piano. He also joined the Cultural Association for the Democratic Reform of Germany, the only association he ever joined.\nAs Feyerabend moved back to Vienna, he was permitted to pursue a PhD at the University of Vienna. He originally intended to study physics, astronomy, and mathematics (while continuing to practice singing) but decided to study history and sociology to understand his wartime experiences. He became dissatisfied, however, and soon transferred to physics and studied astronomy, especially observational astronomy and perturbation theory, as well as differential equations, nuclear physics, algebra, and tensor analysis. He took classes with Hans Thirring, Hans Leo Przibram, and Felix Ehrenhaft. He also had a small role in a film directed by G.W. Pabst and joined the Austrian College where he frequented their speaker series in Alpbach. Here, in 1948, Feyerabend met Karl Popper who made a positive impression on him. He was also influenced by the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht, who invited him to be his assistant at the East Berlin State Opera, but Feyerabend turned down the offer. A possible reason was Feyerabend's instinctive aversion to group thinking, which, for instance, made him staunchly refuse joining any Marxist Leninist organizations despite having friends there and despite voting communist in the early Austrian election.\nIn Vienna, Feyerabend organized the Kraft Circle, where students and faculty discussed scientific theories (he recalled five meetings about non-Einsteinian interpretations of the Lorentz transformations) and often focused on the problem of the existence of the external world. There, he also met Elizabeth Anscombe who, in turn, led Feyerabend to meet Ludwig Wittgenstein. In the years between 1949 and 1952, Feyerabend traveled in Europe and exchanged with philosophers and scientists, including Niels Bohr. He also married his first wife (Jacqueline,\u2018to be able to travel together and share hotel rooms\u2019), divorced, and became involved in various romantic affairs, despite his physical impotence.\u00a0Cycles of amorous excitement, dependence, isolation, and renewed dependence characterized his relations with women for a good part of his life. He drew great pleasure from opera, which he could attend even five days a week, and from singing (he resumed his lessons even if his crutch excluded an operatic career).\u00a0Attending opera and singing (he had an excellent tenor voice) remained constant passions throughout his life. In 1951, he earned his doctorate with a thesis on basic statements () under Victor Kraft's supervision.\nIn 1952-53, thanks to a British Council scholarship, he continued his studies at the London School of Economics where he focused on Bohm's and von Neumann's work in quantum mechanics and on Wittgenstein's later works, including \"Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics\" and \"Philosophical Investigations\". He also attended Popper's lectures on logic and scientific method and became convinced that induction was irrational. During this time, he developed an early version of his theory of incommensurability, which he thought was a triviality, and was encouraged to develop it further by Popper, H.L.A. Hart, Peter Geach, and Georg Henrik von Wright. He met many others including J.O. Wisdom, A. I. Sabra, Joseph Agassi, and Martin Buber. After his return to Vienna, Feyerabend met often with Viktor Frankl and with Arthur Pap, who offered him a position as his research assistant at the University of Vienna. Thanks to Pap, he became acquainted with Herbert Feigl. During this time, Feyerabend worked on the German translation of Popper's \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" and often met with Herbert Feigl and Philipp Frank. Franck argued that Aristotle was a better empiricist than Copernicus, an argument that became influential on Feyerabend's primary case study in \"Against Method\".\nIn 1955, Feyerabend successfully applied for a lectureship at the University of Bristol with letters of reference from Karl Popper and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and started his academic career. In 1956, he met Mary O\u2019Neill, who became his second wife \u2013 another passionate love affair that soon ended in separation. After presenting a paper on the measurement problem at the 1957 symposium of the Colston Research Society in Bristol, Feyerabend was invited to the University of Minnesota by Michael Scriven. There, he exchanged with Herbert Feigl, Ernst Nagel, Wilfred Sellars, Hilary Putnam, and Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum. Soon afterwards, he met Gilbert Ryle who said of Feyerabend that he was \"clever and mischievous like a barrel of monkeys.\"\nBerkeley, Zurich and retirement.\nFeyerabend's primary academic appointment was at the University of California at Berkeley. While he was hired there in 1958, he spent part of his first years in the United States at the University of Minnesota, working closely with Herbert Feigl and Paul Meehl after rejecting a job offer from Cornell University. In California, he met and befriended Rudolf Carnap, whom he described as a \"wonderful person, gentle, understanding, not at all as dry as would appear from some (not all) of his writings\", and Alfred Tarski, among others. He also married for a third time. At Berkeley, Feyerabend mostly lectured on general philosophy and philosophy of science. During the student revolution, he also lectured on revolutionaries (Lenin, Mao, Mill, and Cohn-Bendit). He often invited students and outsiders, including Lenny Bruce and Malcolm X, to guest lecture on a variety of issues including gay rights, racism, and witchcraft. He supported the students but did not support student strikes. John Searle attempted to get Feyerabend fired from his position for hosting lectures off-campus. \nAs Feyerabend was highly marketable in academia and personally restless, he kept accepting and leaving university appointments while holding more 'stable' positions in Berkeley and London. For instance, starting in 1968, he spent two terms at Yale, which he describes as boring, feeling that most there did not have \"ideas of their own.\" There, however, he did meet Jeffrey Bub, and the two became friends. He remembered attempting to give everyone in graduate seminars 'As', which was strongly resisted by the students at Yale. He also asked students in his undergraduate classes to build something useful, like furniture or short films, rather than term papers or exams. In the same years, he accepted a new chair in philosophy of science in Berlin and a professorship in Auckland (New Zealand). In Berlin, he faced a 'problem' as he was assigned two secretaries, fourteen assistants and an impressive office with antique furniture and an anteroom, which \"gave him the willies\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201c...I wrote and mailed my own letters, including official ones ... never had a mailing list or any list of my publications, and I threw away most of the offprints that were sent to me... That took me out of the academic landscape, but it also simplified my life. ... [In Berlin] the secretaries were soon used by my less independent colleagues and by the assistants. \"Look,\" I said to them, \"I was given 80,000 marks for starting a new library; go and buy all the books you want and run as many seminars as you like. Don't ask me-- be independent!\". Most of the assistants were revolutionaries, and two of them were sought by the police.\u00a0Yet, they didn't buy Che Guevara or Mao, or Lenin; they bought books on logic! \"We have to learn how to think,\" they said, as if logic has anything to do with that.\u2014\u200a\nWhile teaching at the London School of Economics, Imre Lakatos often 'jumped in' during Feyerabend's lectures and started defending rationalist arguments. The two \"differed in outlook, character and ambitions\" but became very close friends. They often met at Lakatos' luxurious house in Turner Woods, which included an impressive library. Lakatos had bought the house for representation purposes and Feyerabend often made gentle fun of it, choosing to help Lakatos' wife to wash dishes after dinner rather than engaging in scholarly debates with 'important guests' in the library. \"Don't worry\" \u2013 Imre would say to his guests \u2013 \"Paul is an anarchist\". Lakatos and Feyerabend planned to write a dialogue volume in which Lakatos would defend a rationalist view of science and Feyerabend would attack it. This planned joint publication was put to an end by Lakatos's sudden death in 1974. Feyerabend was devastated by it. \nFeyerabend had become more and more aware of the limitation of theories \u2013 no matter how well conceived \u2013 compared with the detailed, idiosyncratic issues encountered in the course of scientific practice. The \"poverty of abstract philosophical reasoning\" became one of the \"feelings\" that motivated him to pull together the collage of observations and ideas that he had conceived for the project with Imre Lakatos, whose first edition was published in 1975 as Against Method. Feyerabend added to it some outrageous passages and terms, including about an 'anarchistic theory of knowledge', for the sake of provocation and in memory of Imre. He mostly wanted to encourage attention to scientific practice and common sense rather than to the empty 'clarifications' of logicians, but his views were not appreciated by the intellectuals who were then directing traffic in the philosophical community, who tended to isolate him. Against Method also suggested that \"approaches not tied to scientific institutions\" may have value, and that scientists should work under the control of the larger public-- views not appreciated by all scientists either. Some gave him the dubious fame of 'worst enemy of science'. Moreover, Feyerabend was aware that \"scientific jargon\" \u2013 read literally, world for word, could reveal not only \"nonsense\", as found out by John Austin, \"but also inhumanity. With the Dadaists Feyerabend realized that \"the language of philosophers, politicians, theologians\" had similarities with \"brute in-articulations\". He exposed that by \"avoiding scholarly ways of presenting a view\" and using \"common locutions and the language of show business and pulp instead\". \nIn his autobiography, Feyerabend describes how the community of 'intellectuals' seemed to \"...take a slight interest in me, lift me up to his own eye level, took a brief look at me, and drop me again. After making me appear more important than I ever thought I was, it enumerated my shortcomings and put me back on my place.\" This treatment left him all but indifferent. During the years following the publication of Against Method and the critical reviews that followed \u2013 some of which as scathing as superficial \u2013 he suffered from bouts of ill health and depression. While medical doctors could not do anything for him, some help came from alternative therapies (e.g., Chinese herbal medicines, acupuncture, diet, massage). He also kept moving among academic appointments (Auckland, Brighton, Kassel). \nTowards the end of the 1970s, Feyerabend was assigned a position as Professor of Philosophy at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich. There, he ran well attended lectures, including on the \"Theaetetus\", \"Timeaus\", and Aristotle's physics as well as public debates and seminars for the non-academic public. Through the 1980s, he enjoyed alternating between posts at ETH Zurich and UC Berkeley. In 1983, he also met Grazia Borrini, who would become his fourth and final wife. She heard of Feyerabend from train passengers in Europe and attended his seminar in Berkeley. They were married in 1989, when they both decided to try to have children, for which they needed medical assistance due to Feyerabend's war injury. Feyerabend claims that he finally understood the meaning of love because of Grazia. This had a dramatic impact on his worldview (\"Today it seems to me that love and friendship play a central role and that without them even the noblest achievements and the most fundamental principles remain pale, empty and dangerous\"). It is also in those years that he developed what he describes as \"...a trace of a moral character\u201d. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201c...a moral character cannot be created by argument, 'education' or an act of will. It cannot be created by any kind of planned action, whether scientific, political, moral or religious. Like true love, it is a gift, not an achievement. It depends on accidents, such as parental affection, some kind of stability, friendship, and-- following therefrom-- on a delicate balance between self-confidence and concern for others. We can create conditions that favor the balance; we cannot create the balance itself. Guilt, responsibility, obligation-- these ideas make sense when the balance is given. They are empty words, even obstacles, when it is lacking.\u201d\u2014\u200a\nIn 1989, Feyerabend voluntarily left Berkeley for good. After his mandatory retirement also from Zurich, in 1990, he continued to give lectures, including often in Italy, published papers and book reviews for \"Common Knowledge\", and worked on his posthumously released \"Conquest of Abundance\" and on his autobiography-- the volumes for which writing became for him \"a 'pleasurable activity', almost like composing a work of art\". He remained based in Meilen, in Switzerland, but often spent time with his wife in Rome. After a short period of suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, he died in 1994 at the Genolier Clinic, overlooking Lake Geneva, Switzerland. He had just turned 70. He is buried in his family grave, in Vienna.\nThought.\nPhilosophy of science.\nKraft Circle, hidden variables, and no-go proofs.\nDuring Feyerabend's PhD, he retrospectively describes himself as a \"raving positivist.\" He was the head organizer of the 'Kraft circle' which discussed many issues in the foundations of physics and on the nature of basic statements, which was the topic of his dissertation. In 1948, Feyerabend wrote a short paper in response to Schr\u00f6dinger's paper \"On the Peculiarity of the Scientific Worldview.\" Here, Feyerabend argued that Schr\u00f6dinger's demand that scientific theories present are \"Anschaulich\" (i.e., intuitively visualizable) is too restrictive. Using the example of the development of Bohr's atomic theory, he claims that theories that are originally unvisualizable develop new ways of making phenomena visualizable. His unpublished paper, \"Philosophers and the Physicists,\" argues for a naturalistic understanding of philosophy where philosophy is \"petrified\" without physics and physics is \"liable to become dogmatic\" without philosophy.\nFeyerabend's early career is also defined by a focus on technical issues within the philosophy of quantum mechanics. Feyerabend argues that von Neumann's 'no-go' proof only shows that the Copenhagen interpretation is consistent with the fundamental theorems of quantum mechanics but it does not logically follow from them. Therefore, causal theories of quantum mechanics (like Bohmian mechanics) are not logically ruled out by von Neumann's proof. After meeting David Bohm in 1957, Feyerabend became an outspoken defender of Bohm's interpretation and argued that hidden variable approaches to quantum mechanics should be pursued to increase the testability of the Copenhagen Interpretation.\nFeyerabend also provided his own solution to the measurement problem in 1957, although he soon came to abandon this solution. He tries to show that von Neumann's measurement scheme can be made consistent without the collapse postulate. His solution anticipates later developments of decoherence theory.\nEmpiricism, pluralism, and incommensurability.\nMuch of Feyerabend's work from the late 1950s until the late 1960s was devoted to methodological issues in science. Specifically, Feyerabend offers several criticisms of empiricism and offers his own brand of theoretical pluralism. One such criticism concerns the distinction between observational and theoretical terms. If an observational term is understood as one whose acceptance can be determined by immediate perception, then what counts as 'observational' or 'theoretical' changes throughout history as our patterns of habituation change and our ability to directly perceive entities evolve. On another definition, observation terms are those that can be known directly and with certainty whereas theoretical terms are hypothetical. Feyerabend argues that all statements are hypothetical, since the act of observation requires theories to justify its veridicality.\nTo replace empiricism, Feyerabend advances theoretical pluralism as a methodological rule for scientific progress. On this view, proliferating new theories increases the testability of previous theories that might be well-established by observations. This is because some tests cannot be unearthed without the invention of an alternative theory. One example Feyerabend uses repeatedly is Brownian motion which was not a test of the second law of classical thermodynamics. To become a test, it must be first explained by an alternative theory \u2013 namely, Einstein's kinetic theory of gases \u2013 which formally contradicts the accepted theory. By proliferating new theories, we increase the number of indirect tests of our theories. This makes theoretical pluralism central to Feyerabend's conception of scientific method.\nEventually, Feyerabend's pluralism incorporates what he calls the \"principle of tenacity.\" The principle of tenacity allows scientists to pursue theories regardless of the problems it may possess. Examples of problems might include recalcitrant evidence, theoretical paradoxes, mathematical complexity, or inconsistency with neighboring theories. Feyerabend learned of this idea from Kuhn, who argued that without tenacity all theories would have been prematurely abandoned. This principle complements the \"principle of proliferation\", which admonishes us to invent as many theories as possible, so that those invented theories can become plausible rivals.\nIn his \"Empiricism, Reduction, and Experience\" (1962), Feyerabend outlines his theory of incommensurability. His theory appears in the same year as Thomas Kuhn's discussion of incommensurability in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", but the two were developed independently. According to Feyerabend, some instances of theory change in the history of science do not involve a successor theory that retains its predecessor as a limiting case. In other words, scientific progress does not always involve producing a theory that is a generalization of the previous theory. This is because the successor theory is formally inconsistent with the previous theory attempting to explain the same domain of phenomena. Moreover, the two theories do not share the same empirical content and, therefore, cannot be compared by the same set of observation statements. For example, Buridan's impetus principle has no analogue in classical mechanics. The closest analogue would be momentum, but the two notions are qualitatively distinct (impetus causes motion whereas momentum is the result of motion). Furthermore, Feyerabend claims that there can be no 'parallel notion' of impetus that is explicable within classical mechanics. Any parallel notion that gives non-zero values must assume that inertial movements happen in a resisting medium, which is inconsistent with the assumption in classical mechanics that inertial motion happens in empty space. Therefore, \"the concept of impetus, as fixed by the usage established in the impetus theory, cannot be defined in a reasonable way within Newton's theory [since] the usage involves laws... which are inconsistent with Newtonian physics.\" In response to criticisms of Feyerabend's position, he clarifies that there are other ways in which theories can be compared such as comparing the structures of infinite sets of elements to detect isomorphisms, comparing \"local grammars\" , or building a model of a theory within its alternative. Incommensurability, however, only arises if scientists make the choice to interpret theories realistically. Theories interpreted instrumentally cannot be incommensurable, on Feyerabend's view.\nFeyerabend's pluralism is supported by what he calls the 'pragmatic theory of meaning' which he developed in his dissertation. Here, he explicitly resuscitates Neurath and Carnap's physicalism from the 1930s. According to the pragmatic theory of meaning, language consists of two parts. First, there is the characteristic of a language which is a series of noises produced under specific experimental situations. On Feyerabend's views, human observation has no special epistemic status \u2013 it is just another kind of measuring apparatus. The characteristic of a language comes from placing observers in the presence of phenomena and instructing them to make specific noises when a phenomenon is sensed. These noises, to become statements (or parts of a language with meaning), must then be interpreted. Interpretation comes from a theory, whose meaning is given is learned though not necessarily through ostension. Once we have an interpreted characteristic, we have statements that can be used to test theories.\nDeparture from Popper.\nBeginning in at least the mid-to-late 1960s, Feyerabend distanced himself from Popper both professionally and intellectually. There is a great amount of controversy about the source and nature of Feyerabend's distancing from Popper. Joseph Agassi claims that it was caused by the student revolutions at Berkeley, which somehow promoted Feyerabend's move towards epistemological anarchism defended in the 1970s. Feyerabend's friend Roy Edgley claims that Feyerabend became distanced from Popper as early as the mid-1950s, when he went to Bristol and then Berkeley and was more influenced by Thomas Kuhn and the Marxism of David Bohm.\nFeyerabend's first paper that explicitly repudiates Popper is his two-part paper on Niels Bohr's conception of complementarity. According to Popper, Bohr and his followers accepted complementarity as a consequence of accepting positivism. Popper was the founder of the theory of falsification, which Feyerabend was very critical of. He meant that no science is perfect, and therefore cannot be proven false. Once one repudiates positivism as a philosophical doctrine, Popper claims, one undermines the principle of complementarity. Against this, Feyerabend claims that Bohr was a pluralist who attempting to pursue a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics (the Bohr-Kramer-Slater conjecture) but abandoned it due to its conflict with the Bothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon experiments. While Feyerabend concedes that many of Bohr's followers (notably, Leon Rosenfeld) accept the principle of complementarity as a philosophical dogma, he contends that Bohr accepted complementarity because it was entangled with an empirically adequate physical theory of microphysics.\nAnarchist phase.\nIn the 1970s, Feyerabend outlines an anarchistic theory of knowledge captured by the slogan 'anything goes'. The phrase 'anything goes' first appears in Feyerabend's paper \"Experts in a Free Society\" and is more famously proclaimed at the end of the first chapter of \"Against Method\". Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism has been the source of contention amongst scholars. Some claim that epistemological anarchism is not a positive view of scientific method, but the conclusion of a reductio ad absurdum of 'rationalism' (the view that there are universal and unchanging rational rules for scientific reasoning). In Feyerabend's words, \"'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history.\" On this interpretation, Feyerabend aims to show that no methodological view can be held as fixed and universal and therefore the only fixed and universal rule would be \"anything goes\" which would be useless.\nOn another interpretation, Feyerabend is claiming that scientists should be unscrupulous opportunists who choose methodological rules that make sense within a given situation. On this view, there are no 'universal' methodological rules but there are local rules of scientific reasoning that should be followed. The use of the phrase 'opportunism' comes from Einstein which denotes an inquirer who changes their beliefs and techniques to fit the situation at hand, rather than pre-judge individual events with well-defined methods or convictions. Feyerabend thinks that this is justified because \"no two individuals (no two scientists; no two pieces of apparatus; no two situations) are ever exactly alike and that procedures should therefore be able to vary also.\"\nOn a third interpretation, epistemological anarchism is a generalization of his pluralism that he had been developing throughout the 1950s and 1960s. On this view, Feyerabend did not have an anarchist 'turn' but merely generalized his positive philosophy on a more general view. Epistemological anarchism is synonymous with a pluralism without limits, where one can proliferate any theory one wishes and one can tenaciously develop any theory for as long as one wishes. Relatedly, because methods depend on empirical theories for their utility, one can employ any method one wishes in attempt to make novel discoveries. This does not mean that we can believe anything we wish \u2013 our beliefs must still stand critical scrutiny \u2013 but that scientific inquiry has no intrinsic constraints. The only constraints on scientific practice are those that are materially forced upon scientists. Moreover, Feyerabend also thought that theoretical anarchism was desirable because it was more humanitarian than other systems of organization, by not imposing rigid rules on scientists.\nFor is it not possible that science as we know it today, or a \"search for the truth\" in the style of traditional philosophy, will create a monster? Is it not possible that an objective approach that frowns upon personal connections between the entities examined will harm people, turn them into miserable, unfriendly, self-righteous mechanisms without charm or humour? \"Is it not possible,\" asks Kierkegaard, \"that my activity as an objective [or critico-rational] observer of nature will weaken my strength as a human being?\" I suspect the answer to many of these questions is affirmative and I believe that a reform of the sciences that makes them more anarchic and more subjective (in Kierkegaard's sense) is urgently needed. \"Against Method\" (3rd ed.). p. 154.\nAccording to these \"existential criteria\", methodological rules can be tested by the kinds of lives that they suggest. Feyerabend's position was seen as radical, because it implies that philosophy can neither succeed in providing a general description of science, nor in devising a method for differentiating products of science from non-scientific entities like myths.\nTo support his position that methodological rules generally do not contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend analyzed counterexamples to the claim that (good) science operates according to the methodological standards invoked by philosophers during Feyerabend's time (namely, inductivism and falsificationism). Starting from episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the Copernican Revolution), he argued that these episodes violated all common prescriptive rules of science. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution. His primary case study is Galileo's hypothesis that the Earth rotates on its axis.\nMetaphysics of abundance.\nIn Feyerabend's later work, especially in \"Conquest of Abundance\", Feyerabend articulates a metaphysical theory in which the universe around us is 'abundant' in the sense that it allows for many realities to be accepted simultaneously. According to Feyerabend, the world, or 'Being' as he calls it, is pliable enough that it can change in accordance with the ways in which we causally engage with the world. In laboratories, for example, scientists do not simply passively observe phenomena but actively intervene to create phenomena with the help of various techniques. This makes entities like 'electrons' or 'genes' real because they can be stably used in a life that one may live. Since our choices about what lives we should live depend on our ethics and our desires, what is 'real' depends on what plays a role in a life that we think is worth living. Feyerabend calls this 'Aristotle's principle' as he believes that Aristotle held the same view.\nBeing, therefore, is pliable enough to be manipulated and transformed to make many realities that conform to different ways of living in the world. However, not all realities are possible. Being resists our attempts to live with it in certain ways and so not any entity can be declared as 'real' by mere stipulation. In Feyerabend's words,\n \"I do not assert that any [form of life] will lead to a well-articulated and livable world. The material humans...face must be approached in the right way. It offers resistance; some constructions (some incipient cultures - cargo cults, for example) find no point of attack in it and simply collapse\" \nThis leads Feyerabend to defend the disunity of the world thesis that was articulated by many members of the Stanford School. There are many realities that cannot be reduced to one common 'Reality' because they contain different entities and processes. This makes it possible that some realities contain gods while others are purely materialistic, although Feyerabend thought that materialistic worldviews were deficient in many unspecified ways.\nFeyerabend's ideas about a 'conquest of abundance' were first voiced in \"Farewell to Reason\", and the writings of the late 1980s and early 1990s experiment with different ways of expressing the idea, including many of the articles and essays published as part two of \"Conquest of Abundance\". A new theme of this later work is the ineffability of Being, which Feyerabend developed with reference to the work of the Christian mystic, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The remarks on ineffability in \"Conquest of Abundance\" are too unsystematic to definitively interpret.\nPhilosophy of mind.\nEliminative materialism.\nAlong with a number of mid-20th century philosophers (most notably, Wilfrid Sellars, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Richard Rorty), Feyerabend was influential in the development of eliminative materialism, a radical position in the philosophy of mind. On some definitions, eliminative materialism holds that all that exists are material processes and, therefore, our ordinary, common-sense understanding of the mind (\"folk psychology\") is false. It is described by a modern proponent, Paul Churchland, as follows:\n \"Eliminative materialism is the thesis that our commonsense conception of psychological phenomena constitutes a radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that both the principles and the ontology of that theory will eventually be displaced, rather than smoothly reduced, by completed neuroscience.\" \nFeyerabend wrote on eliminative materialism in three short papers published in the early sixties. The most common interpretation of these papers is that he was an early forerunner of eliminative materialism. This was a major influence on Patricia and Paul Churchland. As Keeley observes, \"[Paul Churchland] has spent much of his career carrying the Feyerabend mantle forward.\" More recent scholarship claims that Feyerabend was never an eliminative materialist and merely aimed to show that common criticisms against eliminative materialism were methodologically faulty. Specifically, on this interpretation, while Feyerabend defended eliminative materialism from arguments from acquaintance and our intuitive understanding of the mind, he did not explicitly claim that eliminative materialism was true. In doing so, Feyerabend leaves open the possibility that dualism is true but this would have to be shown through scientific arguments rather than philosophical stipulation. In any case, Feyerabend explicitly disavows materialism in his later philosophical writings.\nCognitive plasticity.\nFeyerabend briefly entertains and is sympathetic to the hypothesis that there are no innate, cognitive limitations imposed upon the human brain. By this he meant that there were no intrinsic limitations about what we can conceive or understand. Spread out through Feyerabend's writings are passages that suggest that this is confirmed by evidence at the time in the mind-brain sciences. Specifically, he claims that \"until now only two or three per cent of the inbuilt circuits of the brain have been utilised. A large variety of [change] is therefore possible.\" The brain, therefore, is largely plastic and can be adapted in numerous unknown ways. Similarly, he cites Nietzsche's philological findings about changes in perception from classical to Hellenistic Greece. He also criticizes E.O. Wilson's claim that genes limit \"human ingenuity\" which he claims can only be discovered by acting as if there are no limits to the kinds of lives humans can live. While Feyerabend's remarks on this subject are vague and merely suggestive, they have received uptake and confirmation in more recent research.\nPolitical philosophy.\nExpertise in a free society.\nStarting from the argument that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought that science has no intrinsic claim to intellectual authority over other intellectual traditions like religion or myths.\nBased on these arguments, Feyerabend defended the idea that science should be separated from the state in the same way that religion and state are separated in a modern secular society He envisioned a free society in which \"all traditions have equal rights and equal access to the centres of power.\" For example, parents should be able to determine the ideological context of their children's education, instead of having limited options because of scientific standards. According to Feyerabend, science should also be subjected to democratic control: not only should the subjects that are investigated by scientists be determined by popular election, scientific assumptions and conclusions should also be supervised by committees of lay people. He thought that citizens should use their own principles when making decisions about these matters. He rejected the view that science is especially \"rational\" on the grounds that there is no single common \"rational\" ingredient that unites all the sciences but excludes other modes of thought.\nFeyerabend thought that scientific expertise was partially exaggerated by needless uses of jargon and technical language and that many contributions towards science were made by laypeople. Rather than distinguish between \"experts\" and \"laypeople\" and privilege the former, Feyerabend distinguishes between \"cranks\" and \"respectable researchers\" which is defined by the virtues of inquirers rather than their credentials. In Feyerabend's words,\n \"The distinction between the crank and the respectable thinker lies in the research that is done once a certain point of view is adopted. The crank usually is content with defending the point of view in its original, undeveloped, metaphysical form, and he is not prepared to test its usefulness in all those cases which seem to favor the opponent, or even admit that there exists a problem. It is this further investigation, the details of it, the knowledge of the difficulties, of the general state of knowledge, the recognition of objections, which distinguishes the 'respectable thinker' from the crank. The original content of his theory does not\" \nAccording to this view, we cannot identify who counts as a crank based on the content of their beliefs. Someone who believes in flat earth theory, climate change denial, or astrology \u2013 for example \u2013 are not necessarily cranks, depending on how they defend those beliefs from criticism.\nDemocracy and science funding.\nFeyerabend thought that science funding agencies should be subject to democratic oversight. On this view, the allocation of funds for research should not be decided by practicing scientists exclusively, as is often the case with peer review. Rather, there should be supervision from taxpayers who determine research priorities. Because of this, Feyerabend defended the Baumann amendment which proposed that there should be Congressional veto power over the National Science Foundation's budget proposals. According to Feyerabend, this follows both from the fact that outsider criticism is necessary for science to flourish and from a right to knowledge which he believed was central to a free society.\nAncient philosophy.\nAristotle.\nFeyerabend greatly admired Aristotle's philosophy, largely due to its productivity. According to Feyerabend, Aristotle was an early epitome of naturalistic philosophy whose scientific research was part and parcel with his epistemology. He also claims that Aristotle was one of the most empiricist scientists in history and that his work in physics and mathematics continues to pay dividends after the scientific revolution.\nXenophanes and the rise of rationalism.\nIn \"Farewell to Reason\", Feyerabend criticizes Popper's claim that Xenophanes, who Feyerabend calls a \"conceited bigmouth\" with \"considerable charm\", was the first to engage in rational criticism in his arguments against anthropomorphic gods. According to Feyerabend, Xenophanes' theological writings can only constitute a criticism if the premises would be accepted by his opponents. Otherwise, Xenophanes is merely rejecting the Homeric gods. In the \"Iliad\", and elsewhere, Feyerabend interprets Homer as accepting the view that the universe is subdivided into parts with different laws and qualitative features that do not aggregate into a unified whole. This informs Homer's theology since there can be no coherent knowledge of the whole of the universe, only detailed understandings of isolated parts of the universe. Feyerabend further argues that some thinkers who came after Xenophanes, such as Aeschylus and Sophocles, also rejected Xenophanes' premise that the gods cannot be anthropomorphic. Additionally, Xenophanes represents the beginning of a tyrannical ideology which enforces 'truth' and 'morality' upon all as if there was a single universe that could be captured in a single worldview.\nFeyerabend also criticizes Xenophanes' pretensions to have developed a conception of God that has no human features, arguing that Xenophanes' God still engages in human activities (such as thinking or hearing). Moreover, he argues that Xenophanes' God resembles a monster as it becomes more detached from human affairs and is therefore more morally problematic than the Homeric gods.\nInfluence.\nIn philosophy.\nWhile the immediate academic reception of Feyerabend's most read text, \"Against Method\", was largely negative, Feyerabend is recognized today as one of the most influential philosophers of science of the 20th Century. Feyerabend's arguments against a universal method have become largely accepted, and are often taken for granted by many philosophers of science in the 21st century. His arguments for pluralism moved the topic into the mainstream and his use of historical case studies were influential in the development of the History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) as an independent discipline. His arguments against reductionism were also influential on John Dupr\u00e9, Cliff Hooker, and Alan Chalmers. He was also one of the intellectual precursors of social constructivism and science and technology studies, although he participated little in either field during his lifetime.\nOutside philosophy.\nFeyerabend's analysis of the Galileo affair, where he claims the Church was \"on the right track\" for censuring Galileo on moral grounds and were empirically correct, was quoted with approval by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) in a speech in 1990. In its autobiography, Feyerabend recalls a conversation with Stephen Jay Gould, in 1991, when Gould stated that \"Against Method\"'s arguments for pluralism motivated him to pursue research on punctuated equilibrium. Feyerabend's work was also influential for several physicists who felt empowered to experiment with approaches different from those of their supervisors as well on many social scientists who were under great pressure to conform to the 'standards' of the natural sciences.\nFeyerabend's lectures were extremely popular and well-attended. They were often received positively as entertaining, provocative, and funny. The writer Daniele Bolelli, in his book \"On the Warrior's Path\" quotes Feyerabend, highlighting the similarities between his epistemology and Bruce Lee's worldview. Feyerabend's concept of \"incommensurability\" was influential in the radical critical approach of Donald Ault in his extensive critical assessment of William Blake's work, especially in \"Narrative Unbound: Re-Visioning William Blake's\" The Four Zoas.\nFor the centennial of Feyerabend's birth, in 2024, there was a series of conferences, workshops, publications, experimental art, song recitals, and theatre pieces planned in honor of his life and works.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59659", "revid": "40138691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59659", "title": "Vallabhbhai Patel", "text": "Indian independence activist (1875\u20131950)\nVallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (; 31 October 1875 \u2013 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was an Indian independence activist and statesman who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a significant role in the Indian independence movement and India's political integration. In Persian and elsewhere, he was often called \"Sardar\" meaning \"chief\". He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.\nPatel was born in Nadiad city (present-day Kheda district, Gujarat) and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. Under the chairmanship of Patel \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution was passed by the Congress. Patel's position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. While promoting the Quit India Movement, Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that Patel's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.\nAs the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace. Besides those provinces that had been under direct British rule, approximately 565 self-governing princely states had been released from British suzerainty by the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 30). Patel, together with Jawaharlal Nehru and Louis Mountbatten persuaded almost every princely state to accede to India.\nPatel's commitment to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet \"Iron Man of India\". He is also remembered as the \"patron saint of India's civil servants\" for playing a pioneering role in establishing the modern All India Services system. The \"Statue of Unity\", the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million, was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately in height.\nEarly life and background.\nVallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. Patel's date of birth was never officially recorded; Patel entered it as 31 October on his matriculation examination papers. He belonged to the Patidars, specifically the Leva Patel community of Central Gujarat; although after his fame, both Leva Patel and Kadava Patidar have claimed him as one of their own.\nPatel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even as the barber charged with doing it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and become a barrister. Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from her parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel\u00a0\u2013 now an advocate\u00a0\u2013 earned a reputation as a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in 1903 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1905. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from the Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.\nPatel practised law in Godhra, Borsad, and Anand while taking on the financial burdens of his homestead in Karamsad. Patel was the first chairman and founder of \"Edward Memorial High School\" Borsad, today known as Jhaverbhai Dajibhai Patel High School. When he had saved enough for his trip to England and applied for a pass and a ticket, they were addressed to \"V. J. Patel\", at the home of his elder brother Vithalbhai, who had the same initials as Vallabhbhai. Having once nurtured a similar hope to study in England, Vithalbhai remonstrated his younger brother, saying that it would be disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother. In keeping with concerns for his family's honour, Patel allowed Vithalbhai to go in his place.\nIn 1909 Patel's wife Jhaverba was hospitalised in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to undergo major surgery for cancer. Her health suddenly worsened and, despite successful emergency surgery, she died in the hospital. Patel was given a note informing him of his wife's demise as he was cross-examining a witness in court. According to witnesses, Patel read the note, pocketed it, and continued his cross-examination and won the case. He broke the news to others only after the proceedings had ended. Patel decided against marrying again. He raised his children with the help of his family and sent them to English-language schools in Bombay. At the age of 36, he journeyed to England and enrolled at the Middle Temple in London. Completing a 36-month course in 30 months, Patel finished at the top of his class despite having had no previous college background.\nReturning to India, Patel settled in Ahmedabad and became one of the city's most successful barristers. Wearing European-style clothes and sporting urbane mannerisms, he became a skilled bridge player. Patel nurtured ambitions to expand his practice and accumulate great wealth and to provide his children with modern education. He had made a pact with his brother Vithalbhai to support his entry into politics in the Bombay Presidency, while Patel remained in Ahmedabad to provide for the family.\nFight for independence.\nIn September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign Gandhi's petition demanding \"Swaraj\"\u00a0\u2013 self-rule\u00a0\u2013 from Britain. A month later, he met Gandhi for the first time at the Gujarat Political Conference in Godhra. On Gandhi's encouragement, Patel became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress. Patel now energetically fought against \"veth\"\u00a0\u2013 the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans\u00a0\u2013 and organised relief efforts in the wake of plague and famine in Kheda. The Kheda peasants' plea for exemption from taxation had been turned down by British authorities. Gandhi endorsed waging a struggle there, but could not lead it himself due to his activities in Champaran. When Gandhi asked for a Gujarati activist to devote himself completely to the assignment, Patel volunteered, much to Gandhi's delight. Though his decision was made on the spot, Patel later said that his desire and commitment came after intense personal contemplation, as he realised he would have to abandon his career and material ambitions.\nSatyagraha in Gujarat.\nSupported by Congress volunteers Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Abbas Tyabji, Vallabhbhai Patel began a village-by-village tour in the Kheda district documenting grievances and asking villagers for their support for a statewide revolt by refusing to pay taxes. Patel emphasised the potential hardships and the need for complete unity and non-violence from every village in the face of provocation. When the revolt was launched and tax revenue withheld, the government sent police and intimidation squads to seize property, including confiscating barn animals and whole farms. Patel organised a network of volunteers to work with individual villages, helping them hide valuables and protect themselves against raids. Thousands of activists and farmers were arrested, but Patel was not. The revolt evoked sympathy and admiration across India, including among pro-British Indian politicians. The government agreed to negotiate with Patel and decided to suspend the payment of taxes for a year, even scaling back the rate. Patel emerged as a hero to Gujaratis. In 1920 he was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee; he would serve as its president until 1945.\nPatel supported Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement and toured the state to recruit more than 300,000 members and raise over Rs.1.5million in funds. Helping organise bonfires in Ahmedabad in which British goods were burned, Patel threw in all his English-style clothes. Along with his daughter Mani and son Dahya, he switched completely to wearing khadi, the locally produced cotton clothing. Patel also supported Gandhi's controversial suspension of resistance in the wake of the Chauri Chaura incident. In Gujarat, he worked extensively in the following years against alcoholism, untouchability, and caste discrimination, as well as for the empowerment of women. In the Congress, he was a resolute supporter of Gandhi against his Swarajist critics. Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924, and 1927. During his terms, he oversaw improvements in infrastructure: the supply of electricity was increased, and drainage and sanitation systems were extended throughout the city. The school system underwent major reforms. He fought for the recognition and payment of teachers employed in schools established by nationalists (independent of British control) and even took on sensitive Hindu\u2013Muslim issues. Patel personally led relief efforts in the aftermath of the torrential rainfall of 1927 that caused major floods in the city and in the Kheda district, and great destruction of life and property. He established refugee centres across the district, mobilised volunteers, and arranged for supplies of food, medicines, and clothing, as well as emergency funds from the government and the public.\nWhen Gandhi was in prison, Patel was asked by Members of Congress to lead the \"satyagraha\" in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He organised thousands of volunteers from all over the country to take part in processions of people violating the law. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with a local \"dacoit\" (criminal) gang related to Devar Baba in the Borsad \"taluka\" even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the \"taluka\" resisted payment of the tax and prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians believe that one of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.\nIn April 1928, Patel returned to the independence struggle from his municipal duties in Ahmedabad when Bardoli suffered from a serious double predicament of a famine and a steep tax hike. The revenue hike was steeper than it had been in Kheda even though the famine covered a large portion of Gujarat. After cross-examining and talking to village representatives, emphasising the potential hardship and need for non-violence and cohesion, Patel initiated the struggle with a complete denial of taxes. Patel organised volunteers, camps, and an information network across affected areas. The revenue refusal was stronger than in Kheda, and many sympathy \"satyagrahas\" were undertaken across Gujarat. Despite arrests and seizures of property and land, the struggle intensified. The situation came to a head in August, when, through sympathetic intermediaries, he negotiated a settlement that included repealing the tax hike, reinstating village officials who had resigned in protest, and returning seized property and land. It was by the women of Bardoli, during the struggle and after the Indian National Congress victory in that area, that Patel first began to be referred to as \"Sardar\" (or chief).\nFundamental Rights and Economic Policy: 1931.\nUnder the chairmanship of Sardar Patel, the \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution was passed by the Congress in 1931.\nAs Gandhi embarked on the Dandi Salt March, Patel was arrested in the village of Ras and was put on trial without witnesses, with no lawyer or journalists allowed to attend. Patel's arrest and Gandhi's subsequent arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujarat. Districts across Gujarat launched an anti-tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released. Once released, Patel served as interim Congress president, but was re-arrested while leading a procession in Bombay. After the signing of the Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi. Here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and civil liberties. It advocated the establishment of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re-opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. In prison, the two discussed national and social issues, read Hindu epics, and cracked jokes. Gandhi taught Patel Sanskrit. Gandhi's secretary, Mahadev Desai, kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel. When Gandhi embarked on a fast-unto-death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables, Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food. Patel was later moved to a jail in Nasik, and refused a British offer for a brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in October 1933. He was finally released in July 1934.\nPatel's position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi and for the provincial elections of 1936. In addition to collecting funds and selecting candidates, he also determined the Congress's stance on issues and opponents. Not contesting a seat for himself, Patel nevertheless guided Congressmen elected in the provinces and at the national level. In 1935 Patel underwent surgery for haemorrhoids, yet continued to direct efforts against the plague in Bardoli and again when a drought struck Gujarat in 1939. Patel guided the Congress ministries that had won power across India with the aim of preserving party discipline\u00a0\u2013 Patel feared that the British government would take advantage of opportunities to create conflict among elected Congressmen, and he did not want the party to be distracted from the goal of complete independence. Patel clashed with Nehru, opposing declarations of the adoption of socialism at the 1936 Congress session, which he believed was a diversion from the main goal of achieving independence. In 1938 Patel organised rank and file opposition to the attempts of then-Congress president Subhas Chandra Bose to move away from Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance. Patel saw Bose as wanting more power over the party. He led senior Congress leaders in a protest that resulted in Bose's resignation. But criticism arose from Bose's supporters, socialists, and other Congressmen that Patel himself was acting in an authoritarian manner in his defence of Gandhi's authority.\nLegal Battle with Subhas Chandra Bose.\nPatel's elder brother Vithalbhai Patel, died in Geneva on 22 October 1933.\nVithalbhai and Bose had been highly critical of Gandhi's leadership during their travels in Europe. \"By the time Vithalbhai died in October 1933, Bose had become his primary caregiver. On his deathbed he left a will of sorts, bequeathing three-quarters of his money to Bose to use in promoting India's cause in other countries. When Patel saw a copy of the letter in which his brother had left a majority of his estate to Bose, he asked a series of questions: Why was the letter not attested by a doctor? Had the original paper been preserved? Why were the witnesses to that letter all men from Bengal and none of the many other veteran freedom activists and supporters of the Congress who had been present at Geneva where Vithalbhai had died? Patel may even have doubted the veracity of the signature on the document. The case went to the court and after a legal battle that lasted more than a year, the courts judged that Vithalbhai's estate could only be inherited by his legal heirs, that is, his family. Patel promptly handed the money over to the Vithalbhai Memorial Trust.\"\nQuit India movement.\nOn the outbreak of World War II, Patel supported Nehru's decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi's advice, as well as an initiative by senior leader Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari to offer Congress's full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence at the end of the war and installed a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral opposition to war, while Subhash Chandra Bose was in militant opposition to the British. The British government rejected Rajagopalachari's initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi's leadership again. He participated in Gandhi's call for individual disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps mission in 1942. Patel lost more than twenty pounds during his period in jail.\nWhile Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and Maulana Azad initially criticised Gandhi's proposal for an all-out campaign of civil disobedience to force the British to grant Indian independence, Patel was its most fervent supporter. Arguing that the British would retreat from India as they had from Singapore and Burma, Patel urged that the campaign start without any delay. Though feeling that the British would not leave immediately, Patel favoured an all-out rebellion that would galvanise the Indian people, who had been divided in their response to the war. In Patel's view, such a rebellion would force the British to concede that continuation of colonial rule had no support in India, and thus speed the transfer of power to Indians. Believing strongly in the need for revolt, Patel stated his intention to resign from the Congress if the revolt were not approved. Gandhi strongly pressured the AICC to approve an all-out campaign of civil disobedience, and the AICC approved the campaign on 7 August 1942. Though Patel's health had suffered during his stint in jail, he gave emotional speeches to large crowds across India, asking them to refuse to pay taxes and to participate in civil disobedience, mass protests, and a shutdown of all civil services. He raised funds and prepared a second tier of command as a precaution against the arrest of national leaders. Patel made a climactic speech to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Governor of Burma boasts in London that they left Burma only after reducing everything to dust. So you promise the same thing to India?\u00a0... You refer in your radio broadcasts and newspapers to the government established in Burma by Japan as a puppet government? What sort of government do you have in Delhi now?...When France fell before the Nazi onslaught, in the midst of total war, Mr.\u00a0Churchill offered union with England to the French. That was indeed a stroke of inspired statesmanship. But when it comes to India? Oh no! Constitutional changes in the midst of a war? Absolutely unthinkable\u00a0... The objective this time is to free India before the Japanese can come and be ready to fight them if they come. They will round up the leaders, round up all. Then it will be the duty of every Indian to put forth his utmost effort\u2014within non-violence. No source is to be left untapped; no weapon untried. This is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime.\nHistorians believe that Patel's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. Patel's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India. Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar. Here he spun cloth, played bridge, read a large number of books, took long walks, and practised gardening. He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside. Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year. But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing \"fullest peace\" for having done \"their duty\". Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British colonial government had responded by imprisoning most of the leaders of Congress, the Quit India movement was \"by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857\", as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill. More than 100,000 people were arrested and numerous protestors were killed in violent confrontations with the Indian Imperial Police. Strikes, protests, and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India. When Patel was released on 15 June 1945, he realised that the British government was preparing proposals to transfer power to India.\nPartition and independence.\nIn the 1946 Indian provincial elections, the Congress won a large majority of the elected seats, dominating the Hindu electorate. However the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah won a large majority of Muslim electorate seats. The League had resolved in 1940 to demand Pakistan\u00a0\u2013 an independent state for Muslims\u00a0\u2013 and was a fierce critic of the Congress. The Congress formed governments in all provinces save Sindh, Punjab, and Bengal, where it entered into coalitions with other parties.\nCabinet mission and partition.\nWhen the British mission proposed two plans for transfer of power, there was considerable opposition within the Congress to both. The plan of 16 May 1946 proposed a loose federation with extensive provincial autonomy, and the \"grouping\" of provinces based on religious-majority. The plan of 16 May 1946 proposed the partition of India on religious lines, with over 565 princely states free to choose between independence or accession to either dominion. The League approved both plans while the Congress flatly rejected the proposal of 16 May. Gandhi criticised the 16 May proposal as being inherently divisive, but Patel, realising that rejecting the proposal would mean that only the League would be invited to form a government, lobbied the Congress Working Committee hard to give its assent to the 16 May proposal. Patel engaged in discussions with the British envoys Sir Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence and obtained an assurance that the \"grouping\" clause would not be given practical force, Patel converted Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, and Rajagopalachari to accept the plan. When the League retracted its approval of the 16 May plan, the viceroy Lord Wavell invited the Congress to form the government. Under Nehru, who was styled the \"Vice President of the Viceroy's Executive Council\", Patel took charge of the departments of home affairs and information and broadcasting. He moved into a government house on Aurangzeb Road in Delhi, which would be his home until his death in 1950.\nVallabhbhai Patel was one of the first Congress leaders to accept the partition of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India, and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government, and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British government without Congress's approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would, in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence. In December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant V. P. Menon on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League's tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims, and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over what he saw as the practical unworkability of any Congress\u2013League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslim-majority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office has completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our own genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.\nAfter Gandhi rejected and Congress approved the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither Patel nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition. Patel took the lead in organising relief and emergency supplies, establishing refugee camps, and visiting the border areas with Pakistani leaders to encourage peace. Despite these efforts, the death toll is estimated at between 500,000 and 1\u00a0million people. The estimated number of refugees in both countries exceeds 15\u00a0million. Understanding that Delhi and Punjab policemen, accused of organising attacks on Muslims, were personally affected by the tragedies of partition, Patel called out the Indian Army with South Indian regiments to restore order, imposing strict curfews and shoot-on-sight orders. Visiting the Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah area in Delhi, where thousands of Delhi Muslims feared attacks, he prayed at the shrine, visited the people, and reinforced the presence of police. He suppressed from the press reports of atrocities in Pakistan against Hindus and Sikhs to prevent retaliatory violence. Establishing the Delhi Emergency Committee to restore order and organising relief efforts for refugees in the capital, Patel publicly warned officials against partiality and neglect. When reports reached Patel that large groups of Sikhs were preparing to attack Muslim convoys heading for Pakistan, Patel hurried to Amritsar and met Sikh and Hindu leaders. Arguing that attacking helpless people was cowardly and dishonourable, Patel emphasised that Sikh actions would result in further attacks against Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan. He assured the community leaders that if they worked to establish peace and order and guarantee the safety of Muslims, the Indian government would react forcefully to any failures of Pakistan to do the same. Additionally, Patel addressed a massive crowd of approximately 200,000 refugees who had surrounded his car after the meetings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here, in this same city, the blood of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims mingled in the bloodbath of Jallianwala Bagh. I am grieved to think that things have come to such a pass that no Muslim can go about in Amritsar and no Hindu or Sikh can even think of living in Lahore. The butchery of innocent and defenceless men, women and children does not behove brave men\u00a0... I am quite certain that India's interest lies in getting all her men and women across the border and sending out all Muslims from East Punjab. I have come to you with a specific appeal. Pledge the safety of Muslim refugees crossing the city. Any obstacles or hindrances will only worsen the plight of our refugees who are already performing prodigious feats of endurance. If we have to fight, we must fight clean. Such a fight must await an appropriate time and conditions and you must be watchful in choosing your ground. To fight against the refugees is no fight at all. No laws of humanity or war among honourable men permit the murder of people who have sought shelter and protection. Let there be truce for three months in which both sides can exchange their refugees. This sort of truce is permitted even by laws of war. Let us take the initiative in breaking this vicious circle of attacks and counter-attacks. Hold your hands for a week and see what happens. Make way for the refugees with your own force of volunteers and let them deliver the refugees safely at our frontier.\nFollowing his dialogue with community leaders and his speech, no further attacks occurred against Muslim refugees, and a wider peace and order was soon re-established over the entire area. However, Patel was criticised by Nehru, secular Muslims, and Gandhi over his alleged wish to see Muslims from other parts of India depart. While Patel vehemently denied such allegations, the acrimony with Maulana Azad and other secular Muslim leaders increased when Patel refused to dismiss Delhi's Sikh police commissioner, who was accused of discrimination. Hindu and Sikh leaders also accused Patel and other leaders of not taking Pakistan sufficiently to task over the attacks on their communities there, and Muslim leaders further criticised him for allegedly neglecting the needs of Muslims leaving for Pakistan, and concentrating resources for incoming Hindu and Sikh refugees. Patel clashed with Nehru and Azad over the allocation of houses in Delhi vacated by Muslims leaving for Pakistan; Nehru and Azad desired to allocate them for displaced Muslims, while Patel argued that no government professing secularism must make such exclusions. However, Patel was publicly defended by Gandhi and received widespread admiration and support for speaking frankly on communal issues and acting decisively and resourcefully to quell disorder and violence.\nPolitical integration of independent India.\nAs the first Home Minister, Patel played one of the major role in the integration of the princely states into the Indian federation. This achievement formed the cornerstone of Patel's popularity in the post-independence era. He is, in this regard, compared to Otto von Bismarck who unified the many German states in 1871. Under the plan of 3 June, more than 565 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan, or choosing independence. Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede, most of the people and territory would be fragmented. The Congress, as well as senior British officials, considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving conquest of the princely states by the Indian dominion. Gandhi had said to Patel, \"The problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it.\" Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task. He asked V.P.Menon, a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India, to become his right-hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry. On 6 August 1947, Patel began lobbying the princes, attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts. Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs, inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi. At these meetings, Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order. Patel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. He proposed favourable terms for the merger, including the creation of \"privy purses\" for the rulers' descendants. While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism, Patel did not rule out force. Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith, he set a deadline of 15 August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of accession document. All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union; only Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket.\nJunagadh was especially important to Patel, since it was in his home state of Gujarat. It was also important because in this Kathiawar district was the ultra-rich Somnath temple (which in the 11th century had been plundered by Mahmud of Ghazni, who damaged the temple and its idols to rob it of its riches, including emeralds, diamonds, and gold). Under pressure from Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the Nawab had acceded to Pakistan. It was, however, quite far from Pakistan, and 80% of its population was Hindu. Patel combined diplomacy with force, demanding that Pakistan annul the accession, and that the Nawab accede to India. He sent the Army to occupy three principalities of Junagadh to show his resolve. Following widespread protests and the formation of a civil government, or \"Aarzi Hukumat\", both Bhutto and the Nawab fled to Karachi, and under Patel's orders the Indian Army and police units marched into the state. A plebiscite organised later produced a 99.5% vote for merger with India. In a speech at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh following the latter's take-over, Patel emphasised his feeling of urgency on Hyderabad, which he felt was more vital to India than Kashmir:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If Hyderabad does not see the writing on the wall, it goes the way Junagadh has gone. Pakistan attempted to set off Kashmir against Junagadh. When we raised the question of settlement in a democratic way, they (Pakistan) at once told us that they would consider it if we applied that policy to Kashmir. Our reply was that we would agree to Kashmir if they agreed to Hyderabad.\nHyderabad was the largest of the princely states, and it included parts of present-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra states. Its ruler, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan, was a Muslim, although over 80% of its people were Hindu. The Nizam sought independence or accession with Pakistan. Muslim forces loyal to Nizam, called the Razakars, under Qasim Razvi, pressed the Nizam to hold out against India, while organising attacks on people on Indian soil. Even though a Standstill Agreement was signed due to the desperate efforts of Lord Mountbatten to avoid a war, the Nizam rejected deals and changed his positions. On 7 September, Jawaharlal Nehru gave ultimatum to Nizam, demanding ban on the Razakars and return of Indian troops to Secunderabad. Pakistan foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan warned India against this ultimatum. The invasion of Hyderabad was then launched on 13 September, after the death of Jinnah on 11 September. After the defeat of Razakars, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession, joining India.\nLeading India.\nThe Governor-General of India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, along with Nehru and Patel, formed the \"triumvirate\" that ruled India from 1948 to 1950. Prime Minister Nehru was intensely popular with the masses, but Patel enjoyed the loyalty and the faith of rank and file Congressmen, state leaders, and India's civil servants. Patel was a senior leader in the Constituent Assembly of India and was responsible in large measure for shaping India's constitution.\nPatel was the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribal and excluded areas, fundamental rights, and provincial constitutions. Patel piloted a model constitution for the provinces in the Assembly, which contained limited powers for the state governor, who would defer to the president\u00a0\u2013 he clarified it was not the intention to let the governor exercise power that could impede an elected government. He worked closely with Muslim leaders to end separate electorates and the more potent demand for reservation of seats for minorities. His intervention was key to the passage of two articles that protected civil servants from political involvement and guaranteed their terms and privileges. He was also instrumental in the founding the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service, and for his defence of Indian civil servants from political attack; he is known as the \"patron saint\" of India's services. When a delegation of Gujarati farmers came to him citing their inability to send their milk production to the markets without being fleeced by intermediaries, Patel exhorted them to organise the processing and sale of milk by themselves, and guided them to create the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union Limited, which preceded the Amul milk products brand. Patel also pledged the reconstruction of the ancient but dilapidated Somnath Temple in Saurashtra. He oversaw the restoration work and the creation of a public trust, and pledged to dedicate the temple upon the completion of work (the work was completed after his death and the temple was inaugurated by the first President of India, Dr.Rajendra Prasad).\nWhen the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir began in September 1947, Patel immediately wanted to send troops into Kashmir. But, agreeing with Nehru and Mountbatten, he waited until Kashmir's monarch had acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India's military operations to secure Srinagar and the Baramulla Pass, and the forces retrieved much territory from the invaders. Patel, along with Defence Minister Baldev Singh, administered the entire military effort, arranging for troops from different parts of India to be rushed to Kashmir and for a major military road connecting Srinagar to Pathankot to be built in six months. Patel strongly advised Nehru against going for arbitration to the United Nations, insisting that Pakistan had been wrong to support the invasion and the accession to India was valid. He did not want foreign interference in a bilateral affair. Patel opposed the release of Rs.550\u00a0million to the Government of Pakistan, convinced that the money would go to finance the war against India in Kashmir. The Cabinet had approved his point but it was reversed when Gandhi, who feared an intensifying rivalry and further communal violence, went on a fast-unto-death to obtain the release. Patel, though not estranged from Gandhi, was deeply hurt at the rejection of his counsel and a Cabinet decision.\nIn 1949 a crisis arose when the number of Hindu refugees entering West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura from East Pakistan climbed to over 800,000. The refugees in many cases were being forcibly evicted by Pakistani authorities, and were victims of intimidation and violence. Nehru invited Liaquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan, to find a peaceful solution. Despite his aversion, Patel reluctantly met Khan and discussed the matter. Patel strongly criticised Nehru's plan to sign a pact that would create minority commissions in both countries and pledge both India and Pakistan to a commitment to protect each other's minorities. Syama Prasad Mookerjee and K.C.Neogy, two Bengali ministers, resigned, and Nehru was intensely criticised in West Bengal for allegedly appeasing Pakistan. The pact was immediately in jeopardy. Patel, however, publicly came to Nehru's aid. He gave emotional speeches to members of Parliament, and the people of West Bengal, and spoke with scores of delegations of Congressmen, Hindus, Muslims, and other public interest groups, persuading them to give peace a final effort.\nIn April 2015 the Government of India declassified surveillance reports suggesting that Patel, while Home Minister, and Nehru were among officials involved in alleged government-authorised spying on the family of Subhas Chandra Bose.\nFather of All India Services.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"There is no alternative to this administrative system... The Union will go, you will not have a united India if you do not have good All-India Service which has the independence to speak out its mind, which has sense of security that you will standby your work... If you do not adopt this course, then do not follow the present Constitution. Substitute something else... these people are the instrument. Remove them and I see nothing but a picture of chaos all over the country\".\n Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\n , in Constituent Assembly discussing the role of All India Services.\nHe was also instrumental in the creation of the All India Services which he described as the country's \"Steel Frame\". In his address to the probationers of these services, he asked them to be guided by the spirit of service in day-to-day administration. He reminded them that the ICS was no-longer \"neither Imperial, nor civil, nor imbued with any spirit of service\" after Independence. His exhortation to the probationers to maintain utmost impartiality and incorruptibility of administration is as relevant today as it was then. \"A civil servant cannot afford to, and must not, take part in politics. Nor must he involve himself in communal wrangles. To depart from the path of rectitude in either of these respects is to debase public service and to lower its dignity,\" he had cautioned them on 21 April 1947.\nHe, more than anyone else in post-independence India, emphasised the crucial role that civil services play in administering a country: in not merely maintaining law and order, but upholding the institutions that provide the binding cement to a society. He, more than any other contemporary of his, was aware of the needs of a sound, stable administrative structure as the lynchpin of a functioning polity. The present-day all-India administrative services owe their origin and principles to his foresight, and thus he is regarded as the Father of modern All India Services.\nRelations with Gandhi and Nehru.\nPatel was intensely loyal to Gandhi, and both he and Nehru looked to him to arbitrate disputes. However, Nehru and Patel sparred over national issues. When Nehru asserted control over Kashmir policy, Patel objected to Nehru's side-lining his home ministry's officials. Nehru was offended by Patel's decision-making regarding the states' integration, having consulted neither him nor the Cabinet. Patel asked Gandhi to relieve him of his obligation to serve, believing that an open political battle would hurt India. After much personal deliberation and contrary to Patel's prediction, Gandhi on 30 January 1948 told Patel not to leave the government. A free India, according to Gandhi, needed both Patel and Nehru. Patel was the last man to privately talk with Gandhi, who was assassinated just minutes after Patel's departure. At Gandhi's wake, Nehru and Patel embraced each other and addressed the nation together. Patel gave solace to many associates and friends and immediately moved to forestall any possible violence. Within two months of Gandhi's death, Patel suffered a major heart attack; the timely action of his daughter, his secretary, and a nurse saved Patel's life. Speaking later, Patel attributed the attack to the grief bottled up due to Gandhi's death.\nCriticism arose from the media and other politicians that Patel's home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering to leave the government. Patel's secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it as fodder for Patel's political enemies and political conflict in India. However, Nehru sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel's ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and asserted that after Gandhi's death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly endorsed Nehru's leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any notion that he sought to be prime minister.\nNehru gave Patel a free hand in integrating the princely states into India. Though the two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs, they sometimes would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing on the issues of Hyderabad's integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel's counsel on sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People's Republic of China and on ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force.\nWhen Nehru pressured Rajendra Prasad to decline a nomination to become the first President of India in 1950 in favour of Rajagopalachari, he angered the party, which felt Nehru was attempting to impose his will. Nehru sought Patel's help in winning the party over, but Patel declined, and Prasad was duly elected. Nehru opposed the 1950 Congress presidential candidate Purushottam Das Tandon, a conservative Hindu leader, endorsing Jivatram Kripalani instead and threatening to resign if Tandon was elected. Patel rejected Nehru's views and endorsed Tandon in Gujarat, where Kripalani received not one vote despite hailing from that state himself. Patel believed Nehru had to understand that his will was not law with the Congress, but he personally discouraged Nehru from resigning after the latter felt that the party had no confidence in him.\nBan on RSS.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"The other is the R.S.S. I have made them an open offer. Change your plans, give up secrecy, respect the Constitution of India, show your loyalty to the (National Flag) and make us believe that we can trust your words. Whether they are friends or foes, and even if they are our own dear children, we are not going to allow them to play with fire so that the house may be set on fire. It would be criminal to allow young men to indulge in acts of violence and destruction.\".\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Speaking on R.S.S, during a public speech.\nIn January 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Hindutva activist Nathuram Godse. Following the assassination, many prominent leaders of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were arrested, and the organisation was banned on 4 February 1948 by Patel. During the court proceedings in relation to the assassination Godse began claiming that he had left the organisation in 1946. Vallabhbhai Patel had remarked that the \"RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhi's death\".\nThe charged RSS leaders were acquitted of the conspiracy charge by the Supreme Court of India. Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the Constitution of India, accept the Tricolor as the National Flag of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.\nGolwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.\nFinal years.\nIn his twilight years, Patel was honoured by members of Parliament. He was awarded honorary doctorates of law by Nagpur University, the University of Allahabad and Banaras Hindu University in November 1948, subsequently receiving honorary doctorates from Osmania University in February 1949 and from Punjab University in March 1949. Previously, Patel had been featured on the cover page of the January 1947 issue of \"Time\" magazine.\nOn 29 March 1949 authorities lost radio contact with a Royal Indian Air Force de Havilland Dove carrying Patel, his daughter Maniben, and the Maharaja of Patiala from Delhi to Jaipur. The pilot had been ordered to fly at a low altitude due to turbulence. During the flight, loss of power in an engine caused the pilot to make an emergency landing in a desert area in Rajasthan. Owing to the aircraft's flying at a low altitude, the pilot was unable to send a distress call with the aircraft's VHF radio, nor could he use his HF equipment as the crew lacked a trained signaller. With all passengers safe, Patel and others tracked down a nearby village and local officials. A subsequent RIAF court of inquiry headed by Group Captain (later Air Chief Marshal and Chief of the Air Staff) Pratap Chandra Lal concluded the forced landing had been caused by fuel starvation. When Patel returned to Delhi, thousands of Congressmen gave him a resounding welcome. In Parliament, MPs gave a long standing ovation to Patel, stopping proceedings for half an hour.\nDeath.\nPatel's health declined rapidly through the summer of 1949. He later began coughing blood, whereupon Maniben began limiting his meetings and working hours and arranged for a personalised medical staff to begin attending to Patel. The then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy heard Patel make jokes about his impending end, and in a private meeting Patel admitted to his ministerial colleague N. V. Gadgil that he was not going to live much longer. Patel's health worsened after 2 November, when he began losing consciousness frequently and was confined to his bed. He was flown to Bombay on 12 December on advice from DrRoy, to recuperate as his condition was deemed critical. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad, and Menon all came to see him off at the airport in Delhi. Patel was extremely weak and had to be carried onto the aircraft in a chair. In Bombay, large crowds gathered at Santacruz Airport to greet him. To spare him from this stress, the aircraft landed at Juhu Aerodrome, where Chief Minister B. G. Kher and Morarji Desai were present to receive him with a car belonging to the Governor of Bombay that took Vallabhbhai to Birla House.\nAfter suffering a massive heart attack (his second), Patel died on 15 December 1950 at Birla House in Bombay. In an unprecedented and unrepeated gesture, on the day after his death more than 1,500 officers of India's civil and police services congregated to mourn at Patel's residence in Delhi and pledged \"complete loyalty and unremitting zeal\" in India's service. Numerous governments and world leaders sent messages of condolence upon Patel's death, including Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, President Sukarno of Indonesia, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister Clement Attlee of the United Kingdom.\nIn homage to Patel, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared a week of national mourning. Patel's cremation was planned at Girgaum Chowpatty, but this was changed to Sonapur (now Marine Lines) when his daughter conveyed that it was his wish to be cremated like a common man in the same place as his wife and brother were earlier cremated. His cremation in Sonapur in Bombay was attended by a crowd of one million including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajagopalachari and President Rajendra Prasad.\nLegacy.\nPatel is a widely celebrated Indian freedom fighter in India, as well as a respected leader. In his eulogy, delivered the day after Patel's death, Girija Shankar Bajpai, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of External Affairs, paid tribute to \"a great patriot, a great administrator and a great man. Patel was all three, a rare combination in any historic epoch and in any country.\" Bajpai lauded Patel for his achievements as a patriot and as an administrator, notably his vital role in securing India's stability in the aftermath of Independence and Partition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...History holds many examples of the fruits of freedom squandered by lack of attention to stability and order, the twin foundations of society. Though a revolutionary in his fight against foreign rule, Sardar Patel was no believer in abrupt or violent change; progress by evolution was really his motto. And so, although in August 1947 power changed hands, and with it the spirit of the administration, the machinery of Government was preserved. As Home Minister and Minister for States, the Sardar had a double task, conservative in the good sense of the word, in what had been Provinces in the old India, creative in the Indian States. Neither was easy. To the ordinary stresses of a transition caused by the withdrawal of trained personnel which had wielded all power for a hundred years was added the strain of partition, and the immense human upheavals and suffering that followed it. The fate of our new State hung in the balance during those perilous months when millions moved across the new frontiers under conditions which are still vivid\u2014indeed, too vivid\u2014in our memories, and therefore, need not be described. That despite some oscillation the scales stayed steady was due not only to the faith of the people in its leaders, but to the firm will and strong hand of the new Home Minister.\nOfficial Records of Patel's death\nAmong Patel's surviving family, Maniben Patel lived in a flat in Bombay for the rest of her life following her father's death; she often led the work of the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust, which organises the prestigious annual Sardar Patel Memorial Lectures, and other charitable organisations. Dahyabhai Patel was a businessman who was elected to serve in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) as an MP in the 1960s.\nPatel was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 1991. It was announced in 2014 that his birthday, 31 October, would become an annual national celebration known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day). In 2012, Patel was ranked third in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.\nPatel's family home in Karamsad is preserved in his memory. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Memorial in Ahmedabad was established in 1980 at the Moti Shahi Mahal. It comprises a museum, a gallery of portraits and historical pictures, and a library containing important documents and books associated with Patel and his life. Amongst the exhibits are many of Patel's personal effects and relics from various periods of his personal and political life.\nPatel is the namesake of many public institutions in India. A major initiative to build dams, canals, and hydroelectric power plants in the Narmada River valley to provide a tri-state area with drinking water and electricity and to increase agricultural production was named the \"Sardar Sarovar\". Patel is also the namesake of the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology in Surat, Sardar Patel University, Sardar Patel High School, and the Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University Of Agriculture and Technology in Meerut [U.P.]. India's national police training academy is also named after him.\nThe international airport of Ahmedabad is named after him. Also the international cricket stadium of Ahmedabad (also known as the Motera Stadium) is named after him. A national cricket stadium in Navrangpura, Ahmedabad, used for national matches and events, is also named after him. The chief outer ring road encircling Ahmedabad is named SP Ring Road. The Gujarat government's institution for training government functionaries is named Sardar Patel Institute of Public Administration.\nRashtriya Ekta Diwas.\nRashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day), celebrated annual on 31 October, was introduced by the Government of India and inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The official statement for Rashtriya Ekta Diwas by the Home Ministry of India cites that the National Unity Day \"will provide an opportunity to re-affirm the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the actual and potential threats to the unity, integrity and security of our country.\"\nNational Unity Day celebrates the birthday of Patel because, during his term as Home Minister of India, he is credited for the integration of over 550 independent princely states into India from 1947 to 1949 by Independence Act (1947). He is known as the \"Bismarck of India\".\nCommemorative stamps.\nCommemorative stamps released by India Post (by year) \u2013\n\"Statue of Unity\".\nThe \"Statue of Unity\" is a monument dedicated to Patel, located in the Indian state of Gujarat, facing the Narmada Dam, 3.2\u00a0km away from Sadhu Bet near Vadodara. At the height of 182 metres (597 feet), it is the world's tallest statue, exceeding the Spring Temple Buddha by 54 meters. This statue and related structures are spread over 20,000 square meters and are surrounded by an artificial lake spread across 12\u00a0km and cost an estimated 29.8\u00a0billion rupees ($425m). It was inaugurated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth. The height of the statue in meters has been picked to match the total assembly constituencies in Gujarat.\nOther institutions and monuments.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It acts as a protective physical barrier between the external environment and the internal environment. Additionally, it maintains water balance, protects the deeper tissues, excretes waste, regulates body temperature, and contains the sensory receptors that detect pain, sensation, pressure, and temperature.\nThe skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the outermost epidermis and the inner dermis, which are separated by a basement membrane (comprising basal lamina and reticular lamina). The epidermis comprises five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum known as the stratum lucidum. The dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, blood vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue. Between the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone, the hypodermis.\nStructure.\nSkin.\nThe skin is one of the largest organs of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12 to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5 to 2 m2 of surface area.\nThe skin (integument) is a composite organ, made up of at least two major layers of tissue: the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the initial barrier to the external environment. It is separated from the dermis by the basement membrane (basal lamina and reticular lamina). The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to the skin. The deepest layer of the epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers, and contains connective tissues, blood vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots, sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.\nBetween the integument and the deep body musculature there is a transitional subcutaneous zone made up of very loose connective and adipose tissue, the hypodermis. Substantial collagen bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.\nEpidermis.\nThe epidermis is the strong, superficial layer that serves as the first line of protection against the outer environment. The human epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells, which further break down into four to five layers: the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum and stratum basale. Where the skin is thicker, such as in the palms and soles, there is an extra layer of skin between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum called the stratum lucidum. The epidermis is regenerated from the stem cells found in the basal layer that develop into the corneum. The epidermis itself is devoid of blood supply and draws its nutrition from its underlying dermis.\nIts main functions are protection, absorption of nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium; four types of cells: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Merkel cells, and Langerhans cells.\nThe predominant cell keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that aids in skin protection, is responsible for the formation of the epidermal water barrier by making and secreting lipids. The majority of the skin on the human body is keratinized, with the exception of the lining of mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow water to \"stay\" atop the structure.\nThe protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow from a thin area called the nail matrix at an average of 1\u00a0mm per week. The lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as it mixes with matrix cells. Only primates have nails. In other vertebrates, the keratinizing system at the terminus of each digit produces claws or hooves.\nThe epidermis of vertebrates is surrounded by two kinds of coverings, which are produced by the epidermis itself. In fish and aquatic amphibians, it is a thin mucus layer that is constantly being replaced. In terrestrial vertebrates, it is the stratum corneum (dead keratinized cells). The epidermis is, to some degree, glandular in all vertebrates, but more so in fish and amphibians. Multicellular epidermal glands penetrate the dermis, where they are surrounded by blood capillaries that provide nutrients and, in the case of endocrine glands, transport their products.\nDermis.\nThe dermis is the underlying connective tissue layer that supports the epidermis. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue and areolar connective tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern.\nThe dermis has two layers: the papillary dermis and the reticular layer. The papillary layer is the superficial layer that forms finger-like projections into the epidermis (dermal papillae), and consists of highly vascularized, loose connective tissue. The reticular layer is the deep layer of the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging. The dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many chromatophores are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.\nHypodermis.\nThe hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter, immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibers. It is essentially composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes, which are specialized in accumulating and storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.\nThe hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort or when there is a lack of energy-providing substances, and are then transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.\nFunctions.\nThe integumentary system has multiple roles in maintaining the body's equilibrium. All body systems work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the body. The skin has an important job of protecting the body and acts as the body's first line of defense against infection, temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis.\nIts main functions include:\nSmall-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial fluid, is called integumentary exchange.\nClinical significance.\nPossible diseases and injuries to the human integumentary system include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a monarch in his own right from 1806 to 1810, ruling over the Kingdom of Holland (a French client state roughly corresponding to the modern-day Netherlands). In that capacity, he was known as Louis I (Dutch: Lodewijk I ).\nLouis was the fifth surviving child and fourth surviving son of Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino, out of eight children who lived past infancy. He and his siblings were all born in Corsica, which had been conquered by France less than a decade before his birth. Louis followed his older brothers into the French Army, where he benefited from Napoleon's patronage. In 1802, he married his step-niece Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Empress Jos\u00e9phine (Napoleon's wife).\nIn 1806, Napoleon I established the Kingdom of Holland in place of the Batavian Republic, appointing Louis as the new king. Napoleon had intended for Holland to be little more than a puppet state, but Louis was determined to be as independent as possible and became quite popular amongst his new people. Growing tired of his brother's wilfulness, Napoleon annexed Holland into the French Empire in 1810, and Louis went into exile.\nHis youngest son, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, established the Second French Empire in 1852, proclaiming himself Napoleon III.\nEarly life.\nLouis was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. He was a younger brother of Joseph, Napoleon, Lucien, and Elisa Bonaparte, and the older brother of Pauline, Caroline, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte. Louis' godparents were the island's governor, Mr de Marbeuf, and the wife of the intendant, Bertrand de Boucheporn, whom Letizia and her husband, Carlo, had befriended.\nLouis Bonaparte's early career was spent in the Army, and he served with Napoleon in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Thanks to his older brother, Napoleon, Louis was given a commission in the French Military, and was promoted to Lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment, and from there he was made Aide de Camp on Napoleon's staff. Napoleon, during his Italian Campaign, recommended Louis to Carnot, and Louis was consequently made a captain. He later became a General by the age of 25, although he felt that he had risen too high in too short a time.\nUpon Louis's return to France, he was involved in Napoleon's plot to overthrow the Directory. After becoming the First Consul, Napoleon arranged for a marriage between Louis and Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Empress Josephine, and hence Napoleon's stepdaughter. Hortense was opposed to the marriage at first. She was soon persuaded by her mother to marry Louis for the sake of the family.\nKing of Holland (1806\u20131810).\nFeeling that the Batavian Republic was too independent for his liking, Napoleon I replaced it with the Kingdom of Holland on 5 June 1806 and placed Louis on the throne. Napoleon had intended for his younger brother to be little more than a French prefect of Holland. However, Louis had his own mind, and tried to be a responsible and independent ruler. To endear himself to his adopted country, he tried to learn the Dutch language; he called himself Lodewijk I (adopting the Dutch form of his name) and declared himself Dutch rather than French. Allegedly, his Dutch was initially so poor that he told the people he was the \"Konijn van 'Olland\" (\"Rabbit of 'Olland\"), rather than \"Koning van Holland\" (\"King of Holland\"). However, his sincere effort to learn Dutch earned him respect from his subjects.\nHaving declared himself Dutch, Louis tried to make his court Dutch as well. He forced his court and ministers (mostly provided by Napoleon) to speak only Dutch and to renounce their French citizenships. This latter was too much for his wife Hortense who, in France at the time of his demands, refused his request. Louis and Hortense had never gotten along, and this demand further strained their relationship. She only came to Holland reluctantly and deliberately tried to avoid Louis as much as possible.\nLouis could never settle on the location of his capital city while he was in Holland. He changed capitals over a dozen times, trying Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and other places. On one occasion, after visiting the home of a wealthy Dutch merchant, he liked the place so much that he had the owner evicted so he could take up residence there. Then, Louis moved again after seven weeks. His constant moving kept the court in upheaval since they had to follow him everywhere. The European diplomatic corps went so far as to petition Bonaparte to remain in one place so they could keep up with him. \nHortense bore Louis's sons Napol\u00e9on-Charles Bonaparte and Napol\u00e9on Louis Bonaparte in Paris, while Louis was in Holland. In 1806, Louis called for his son to be sent to him in Holland, but he was again refused by Hortense, who believed that her son would never be returned to France. When Louis appealed to his brother Napoleon for help, Napoleon sided with Hortense. Napoleon kept the boy in his court, and he even had him named the heir to the French throne before the birth of his son.\nTwo major tragedies occurred during the reign of Louis Bonaparte: the explosion of a cargo ship loaded with gunpowder in the heart of the city of Leiden in 1807, and a major flood in Holland in 1809. In both instances, Louis personally and effectively oversaw local relief efforts, which helped earn him the title of \"Louis the Good\". Napoleon appeared disappointed and commented: \"\u2033Brother, when they say of some king or other that he is good, it means that he has failed in his rule.\u2033\"\nLouis Bonaparte's reign was short-lived due to two factors. The first was that Napoleon wanted to reduce the value of French loans from Dutch investors by two-thirds, meaning a serious economic blow to the Netherlands. The second became the pretext for Napoleon's demand of Louis's abdication. As Napoleon was preparing an army for his invasion of Russia, he wanted troops from the entire region under his control, this included troops from the Netherlands. Louis, confronted by his brother's demand, refused point-blank. Napoleon then accused Louis of putting Dutch interests above those of France, and removed most of the French forces in Holland for the coming war in the east, leaving only about 9,000 garrison soldiers in the country. Unfortunately for Louis, the British landed an army of 40,000 in 1809 in an attempt to capture Antwerp and Flushing. With Louis unable to defend his realm, France sent 80,000 militiamen, commanded by \"Mar\u00e9chal d'Empire\" The 1st Prince Bernadotte, the future King Karl XIV Johan of Sweden, and successfully repelled the invasion. Napoleon then suggested that Louis should abdicate, citing Louis's inability to protect Holland as a reason. Louis refused and declared the occupation of the Kingdom by a French army as unlawful. On 1 July 1810, Louis abdicated in favour of his second son, Napoleon Louis Bonaparte. He fled from Haarlem on 2/3 July and settled in Austria. Oudinot invaded Holland on 4 July. Napoleon incorporated Holland into France by the Decree of Rambouillet on 9 July.\nExile.\nAfter his abdication, Louis Bonaparte assumed the title of Count of Saint-Leu (\"comte de Saint-Leu\"), which was a reference to his property at Saint-Leu-la-For\u00eat near Paris. He was appointed as the Constable of France in 1808, a strictly honorary title.\nAfter his Dutch kingdom was taken away from him, the Austrian Emperor Francis I offered him asylum. Between 1811 and 1813, he found refuge in Graz, where he turned to writing and poetry. Louis wrote to Napoleon after the latter's defeat in Russia to request that the Dutch throne be restored to him; however, Napoleon refused. His request to visit the Netherlands was denied several times by King William I of the Netherlands, but King William II allowed him a visit in 1840. Although traveling in the Netherlands under a false name, some people found out that it was their former king, which led to a cheering crowd gathering under the window of his hotel room. It is said that he was quite moved by this demonstration of affection from his former subjects.\nAfter the death of his eldest brother Joseph in 1844, Louis was seen by the Bonapartists as the rightful Emperor of the French, although Louis took little action himself to advance the claim. Louis's son and heir, the future Emperor Napoleon III, on the other hand, was at that time being imprisoned in France for having attempted a Bonapartist coup d'\u00e9tat.\nLouis Bonaparte died from stroke on 25 July 1846 in Livorno, and his remains were buried at Saint-Leu-la-For\u00eat, \u00cele-de-France.\nMarriage and children.\nLouis was married on 4 January 1802 to Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of the deceased general Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais, and his wife Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie. Josephine was the first wife of Louis's brother Napoleon. Thus Hortense was also Louis's step-niece.\nThis marriage had been forced upon them and was rather loveless, though they supposedly consummated it and interacted often enough to produce three sons. As a rule, the Bonapartes, except Napoleon, loathed the Beauharnaises. Hortense also certainly had extra-marital lovers.\nHortense de Beauharnais gave birth to three sons who were officially claimed by Louis Bonaparte, despite his doubts about their paternity:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded sometime in the early 1960s, the FLQ conducted a number of attacks between 1963 and 1970, which totalled over 160 violent incidents and killed eight people and injured many more. These attacks culminated with the Montreal Stock Exchange bombing in 1969 and the October Crisis in 1970, the latter beginning with the kidnapping of British Trade Commissioner James Cross. In the subsequent negotiations, Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and murdered by a cell of the FLQ. Public outcry and a federal crackdown subsequently ended the crisis and resulted in a drastic loss of support for the FLQ, with a small number of FLQ members being granted refuge in Cuba.\nFLQ members practised propaganda of the deed and issued declarations that called for a socialist insurrection against oppressors identified with Anglo-Saxon imperialism, the overthrow of the Quebec government, the independence of Quebec from Canada and the establishment of a French-speaking \"workers' society\" in Quebec. Up to 1970, it gained the support of many left-leaning students, teachers and academics, who engaged in public strikes in solidarity with the FLQ during the October Crisis. After the kidnapping of Cross, nearly 1,000 students at signed a petition supporting the FLQ manifesto. This public support largely ended after the group announced they had killed Laporte, in a public communiqu\u00e9 that ended with an insult to the victim. The KGB, which had established contact with the FLQ before 1970, later forged documents to portray them as a CIA false flag operation, a story that gained limited traction among academic sources before declassified Soviet archives revealed the ruse. By the early 1980s, most of the imprisoned FLQ members had been paroled or released.\nHistory.\nMembers and sympathizers of the group were called \"Felquistes\" (), a word coined from the French pronunciation of the letters FLQ. Some of the members were organized and trained by Georges Schoeters, a Belgian revolutionary. FLQ members Normand Roy and Michel Lambert received guerrilla training from the Palestine Liberation Organization in Jordan. The FLQ was a loose association operating as a clandestine cell system. Various cells emerged over time: the Viger Cell founded by Robert Comeau, history professor at the ; the Dieppe Cell; the Louis Riel Cell; the Nelson Cell; the Saint-Denis Cell; the Liberation Cell; and the Ch\u00e9nier Cell. The last two of these cells were involved in what became known as the October Crisis. From 1963 to 1970, the FLQ committed over 200 violent actions, including bombings, bank hold-ups, kidnappings, at least three killings by FLQ bombs and two killings by gunfire. In 1966, \"Revolutionary Strategy and the Role of the Avant-Garde\" was prepared by the FLQ, outlining their long-term strategy of successive waves of robberies, violence, bombings, and kidnappings, culminating in revolution. The history of the FLQ is sometimes described as a series of \"waves\". The ideology was based on an extreme form of Quebec nationalism that denounced Anglo exploitation and control of Quebec, combined with Marxist\u2013Leninist ideas and arguments.\nFirst wave.\nThe first formation of the FLQ was composed of members of the Rassemblement pour l'Ind\u00e9pendance Nationale, some of whom wished for faster action. This group formed the , or Resistance Network. This group eventually broke up, forming the FLQ. The group was recruited among various sources, eventually recruiting one Mario Bachand. The FLQ commenced their attacks on 7 March 1963. Some of their more notable crimes include bombing a railway (by which then\u2013Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker had arranged to travel within the week).\n20 May 1963.\nBy 1 June 1963, eight members of the FLQ were arrested in a surprise raid. In 1963, Gabriel Hudon and Raymond Villeneuve were sentenced to 12 years in prison after their bomb killed William V. O'Neill, a furnaceman at Montreal's Canadian Army Recruiting Centre. Their targets also included English-owned businesses, banks, McGill University, Loyola College and the Black Watch Armoury.\nSecond wave.\nA group of six individuals, two of whom were brothers of FLQ members arrested in 1963 (Robert Hudon and Jean Gagnon), commenced a series of crimes in Quebec over a period between 26 September 1963 and 9 April 1964. They called themselves the Quebec Liberation Army (), and stole approximately CA$ (CA$ when adjusted for inflation as of 2023) in goods and money. Most of these individuals were also released by 1967.\nThird wave.\nA larger group of revolutionaries became known as the \"Revolutionary Army of Quebec\" (). This group attempted to focus on training, particularly in St. Boniface. A botched gun warehouse robbery on 29 August 1964 resulted in two deaths, the company's vice-president Leslie McWilliams and gunsmith Alfred Pinisch. Other employees were lined up to be shot when Pinisch burst upon the scene and was killed. Cyr Delisle, Gilles Brunet, Marcel Tardif, Fran\u00e7ois Schirm (a French Foreign Legion veteran), and Edmond Guenette, the five members arrested in connection with the deaths of MacWilliams and Pinisch, workers at the store, were sentenced to life in prison. Other members of the FLQ were arrested as well.\nFourth wave.\nCharles Gagnon and Pierre Valli\u00e8res combined their \"Popular Liberation Movement\" with the FLQ in July 1965. This also combined several other pro-sovereignty groups. This may have led to a more socialist FLQ attitude. This new group robbed a New Democratic Party office and a radio station for supplies, many of which were used to write , the revolutionary paper published by the FLQ during the many years of activity. It translates to \"The Hit (Knock)\". The 4th wave saw the increasing use of explosives, the production styles of which were sometimes detailed in . A 15-year-old FLQ member, Jean Corbo, was killed by his own explosive, and a 64-year-old female office worker died during the FLQ bombing of the shoe factory Lagrenade.\nBy August 1966, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had arrested many FLQ members. Gagnon and Valli\u00e8res had fled to the United States, where they protested in front of the Headquarters of the United Nations and were later arrested. It was during his incarceration that Valli\u00e8res wrote his book \"White Niggers of America\", which compared the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois liberation struggle to that of Black people in the United States. In September 1967, the pair were extradited to Canada.\nIn 1968, after various riots within Quebec and in Europe, a new group of FLQ was formed. Within a year, this group of Felquistes had exploded 52 bombs. Rather than , they wrote , or \"Victory\". The various members of the group were arrested by 2 May 1969.\nAttacks.\nOn 13 February 1969, the FLQ set off a powerful bomb that ripped through the Montreal Stock Exchange causing massive destruction and seriously injuring 27 people. After more bombings, on 28 September 1969 they bombed the home of Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau. After the bombing, police concluded that the bomb was placed in the toilet so inspectors could not find it.\nThe year 1969 also saw many riots, including one against McGill University. The RCMP had intercepted intelligence relating to the planned riots, and prevented excessive damage. This failed riot led to Mario Bachand leaving Canada, and another group of FLQ forming, which would become responsible for the October Crisis. This group, formed of Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard, and Nigel Hamer became known as the \"South Shore Gang\".\nOn 5 May 1969, FLQ members Jean-Pierre Charette and Alain Alard, who had previously fled from Canada to the U.S., hijacked a National Airlines Boeing 727 in New York, and diverted it to Cuba.\nIn 1969 the FLQ gave support to the \"Taxi Liberation Front\", which was opposing the Anglo-owned Murray-Hill taxi company. The TLF was created by the \"Popular Liberation Front\", which was founded by Jacques Lanct\u00f4t and Marc Carbonneau. Jacques Lanct\u00f4t is credited with writing the FLQ Manifesto prior to the October Crisis.\nThe South Shore Gang bought a house, which they named \"The Little Free Quebec\", and it quickly became a den of the FLQ. Jacques Lanct\u00f4t was charged in connection with a failed FLQ kidnapping attempt of an Israeli diplomat, and in 1970, while a member of the FLQ, likely took refuge at \"The Little Free Quebec\". These new FLQ members bought two other houses, prepared their plans, and stocked sufficient equipment for their upcoming actions.\nThe group was divided over what plans should be taken, but were reunited during the crisis itself.\nOctober Crisis.\nOn 5 October 1970, members of the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped James Richard Cross, the British Trade Commissioner, as he was leaving his home for work. Shortly afterwards, on 10 October, the Ch\u00e9nier Cell kidnapped the Minister of Labour and Vice-Premier of Quebec, Pierre Laporte. Laporte was coming from a meeting with others where they had discussed the demands of the FLQ.\nIn the following days, FLQ leaders held meetings to increase public support for the cause. Consequently, a general strike involving students, teachers and professors resulted in the closure of most French-language secondary and post-secondary academic institutions. On 15 October 1970, more than 3,000 students attended a protest rally in favour of the FLQ. Demonstrations of public support influenced subsequent government actions.\nAfter holding Laporte captive for a week, members of the FLQ killed Laporte. On 17 October, callers to a radio station announced that Laporte had been murdered and divulged the location of a map which led to the discovery of his body.\nThe FLQ released a list of demands for Cross's release:\nThe FLQ also stipulated how the above demands would be carried out:\nAs part of its Manifesto, the FLQ stated: \"In the coming year Bourassa (Quebec premier Robert Bourassa) will have to face reality; 100,000 revolutionary workers, armed and organized.\"\nCanada's Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, in his statement to the press during the October Crisis, admitted that the radicalism occurring in Quebec at this time had bred out of social unease due to imperfect legislation. \"The government has pledged that it will introduce legislation which deals not only with the symptoms but with the social causes which often underlie or serve as an excuse for crime and disorder.\" (Pierre Trudeau, CBC interview). However, despite this admission, Trudeau declared in his statement to the press that in order to deal with the unruly radicals or \"revolutionaries,\" the federal government would invoke the \"War Measures Act\", the first time the country used these powers during peacetime.\nInvoking the \"War Measures Act\" was a politically risky move for Trudeau because the Act overrode fundamental rights and privileges enumerated in the common law and in the Canadian Bill of Rights; therefore, there was a strong possibility that Trudeau might have lost popular support among Quebec voters. However, this did not occur.\nIn an impromptu interview with Tim Ralfe and Peter Reilly on the steps of Parliament, Pierre Trudeau, responding to a question of how extreme his implementation of the \"War Measures Act\" would be, Trudeau answered, \"Well, just watch me.\" This line has become a part of Trudeau's legacy.\nEarly in December 1970, police discovered the location of the kidnappers holding James Cross. His release was negotiated and on 3 December 1970, five of the FLQ members were granted their request for safe passage to Cuba by the Government of Canada after approval by Fidel Castro.\nAs a result of the invocation of the \"War Measures Act\", civil liberties were suspended. By 29 December 1970, police had arrested 453 people with suspected ties to the FLQ. Some detainees were released within hours, while others were held for up to 21 days. Several persons who were detained were initially denied access to legal counsel. Of the 453 people who were arrested, 435 were eventually released without being charged.\nOn 13 December 1970, Pierre Valli\u00e8res announced in that he had terminated his association with the FLQ. As well, Valli\u00e8res renounced the use of terrorism as a means of political reform and instead advocated the use of standard political action.\nIn late December, four weeks after the kidnappers of James Cross were found, Paul Rose and the kidnappers and murderers of Pierre Laporte were found hiding in a country farmhouse. They were tried and convicted for kidnapping and murder.\nThe events of October 1970 contributed to the loss of support for violent means to attain Quebec independence, and increased support for a political party, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which in 1976 received the most votes and elected a majority government.\nIn July 1980, police arrested and charged a sixth person in connection with the Cross kidnapping. Nigel Hamer, a British radical socialist and FLQ sympathizer, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months in jail.\nDecline.\nPolice deterrence and flagging public support contributed to the decline of the FLQ. By 1971, the Montreal Police anti-terrorist unit had highly placed informants within the FLQ organization, a cell of seven members were arrested on 5 October, the one year anniversary of the Cross kidnapping, and in December 1971 four FLQ members were arrested by a police force.\nThe support and political capacity of the FLQ changed drastically during the 1970s. The FLQ immediately lost public support after the October crisis and the murder of Laporte. The general public overwhelmingly supported the emergency powers and the presence of the military in Quebec. Laporte's murder marked a crossroads in the political history of the FLQ. It helped sway public opinion towards more conventional forms of political participation and drove up popular support for the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ).\nThe rise of the PQ attracted both active and would-be participants away from the FLQ. In December 1971, Pierre Valli\u00e8res emerged after three years in hiding to announce that he was joining the PQ. In justifying his decision he described the FLQ as a \"shock group\" whose continued activities would only play into the hands of the forces of repression against which they were no match. Those members of the FLQ who had fled began returning to Canada from late 1971 until 1982, and most received light sentences for their offences.\nKGB involvement.\nAccording to Christopher Andrew's and Vasili Mitrokhin's book based on the Mitrokhin archive, the Soviet Union's KGB likely established contact with the FLQ.\nThe KGB was concerned that the FLQ's attacks could be linked to the Soviet Union. It designed a disinformation campaign and forged documents to portray the FLQ as a CIA false flag operation. A photocopy of the forged \"CIA document\" was \"leaked\" to the \"Montreal Star\" in September 1971. The operation was so successful that Canada's prime minister believed that the CIA had conducted operations in Canada. The story was still quoted in the 1990s, even among academic authors.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among other things, he rewrote part of the Gosling code headed by the skull-and-crossbones comment and made it \"...shorter, faster, clearer and more extensible.\"\nIn 1983 UniPress began selling Gosling Emacs on Unix for $395 and on VMS for $2,500, marketing it as \"EMACS\u2013multi-window text editor (Gosling version)\".\nControversially, UniPress asked Stallman to stop distributing his version of Emacs for Unix.\nUniPress never took legal action against Stallman or his nascent Free Software Foundation, believing \"hobbyists and academics could never produce an Emacs that could compete\" with their product. All Gosling Emacs code was removed from GNU Emacs by version 16.56 (July 1985), with the possible exception of a few particularly involved sections of the display code. The latest versions of GNU Emacs (since August 2004) do not feature the skull-and-crossbones warning.\nExtension language.\nIts extension language, Mocklisp, has a syntax that appears similar to Lisp, but Mocklisp does not have lists, only strings and arrays. The Mocklisp interpreter, built by Gosling and a collaborator, was replaced by a full Lisp interpreter in GNU Emacs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of around 250,000, it is Germany's largest city on the Baltic Sea. It is located on the Kieler F\u00f6rde inlet of the Bay of Kiel and lies in the southeast of the Jutland Peninsula, on the mouth of the Schwentine River, approximately northeast of Hamburg. The world's busiest artificial waterway, the Kiel Canal, has a terminus in Kiel's Holtenau district. This canal connects the Baltic to the North Sea, with its other end in Brunsb\u00fcttel. Most of Kiel is part of Holstein. The boroughs north of the Schwentine also belong to Wagria, while those north of the Kiel Canal are historically part of Southern Schleswig.\nOriginally a small settlement, Kiel was granted city rights in 1242. Over the centuries, it developed as an important port and trading hub, particularly due to its strategic location on the Kieler F\u00f6rde inlet. Kiel became part of the Duchy of Holstein, the northernmost state of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1773 to 1864, it was ruled in personal union by the king of Denmark. In 1864, after the Second Schleswig War, the city was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. During the 20th century, Kiel played a significant role in both World War I and World War II, with its naval significance and shipbuilding industry. Following World War II, it became part of West Germany and later the unified Germany.\nKiel is one of Germany's major maritime centres, known for a variety of international sailing events, including the annual Kiel Week, which is the biggest sailing event in the world. Kiel is also known for the Kiel Mutiny, when sailors refused orders to prepare to engage the British Navy in the last weeks of World War I, sparking the German Revolution, which led to the abdication of the Kaiser and the formation of the Weimar Republic. The Olympic sailing competitions of the 1936 and the 1972 Summer Olympics were held in the Bay of Kiel.\nKiel has also been one of the traditional homes of the German Navy's Baltic fleet, and continues to be a major high-tech shipbuilding centre. The University of Kiel, founded in 1665, is home to the GEOMAR \u2013 Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. Kiel is an important sea transport hub, with passenger ferries to Sweden, Norway, Lithuania and other countries. Moreover, today the Port of Kiel is a popular destination for cruise ships touring the Baltic Sea.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe city of Kiel was founded in 1233 as \"Holstenstadt tom Kyle\" by Count Adolf IV of Holstein, and granted L\u00fcbeck city rights in 1242 by Adolf's eldest son, John I of Schauenburg. As a part of Holstein, Kiel belonged to the Holy Roman Empire and was situated only a few kilometres south of the Danish border.\nThe capital of the county (later duchy) of Holstein, Kiel was a member of the Hanseatic League from 1284 until it was expelled in 1518 for harbouring pirates. The \"Kieler Umschlag\" (trade fair), first held in 1431, became the central market for goods and money in the Duchy of Holstein. It began to decline c.\u20091850 and ceased in 1900.\nModern times.\nThe University of Kiel was founded on 29 September 1665 by Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. A number of important scholars, including Theodor Mommsen, Felix Jacoby, Hans Geiger and Max Planck, studied or taught there.\nFrom 1773 to 1864, the town belonged to the king of Denmark. However, because the king ruled Holstein as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire only through a personal union, the town was not incorporated as part of Denmark proper. Even though the empire was abolished in 1806, the Danish king continued to rule Kiel only through his position as Duke of Holstein, which became a member of the German Confederation in 1815. When Schleswig and Holstein rebelled against Denmark in 1848 (the First Schleswig War), Kiel became the capital of Schleswig-Holstein until the Danish victory in 1850.\nDuring the Second Schleswig War in 1864, Kiel and the rest of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were conquered by a German Confederation alliance of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. After the war, Kiel was briefly administered by both the Austrians and the Prussians, but the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 led to the formation of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein and the annexation of Kiel by Prussia in 1867. On 24 March 1865, King William I based Prussia's Baltic Sea fleet in Kiel instead of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk). The Imperial shipyard Kiel was established in 1867 in the town.\nWhen William I of Prussia became Emperor William I of the German Empire in 1871, he designated Kiel and Wilhelmshaven as (\"Imperial War Harbours\"). The Kiel Yacht Club was established in 1887 with Prince Henry of Prussia as its patron. Emperor Wilhelm II became its commodore in 1891.\nBecause of its new role as Germany's main naval base, Kiel very quickly increased in size in the following years, from 18,770 in 1864 to about 200,000 in 1910. Much of the old town centre and other surroundings were levelled and redeveloped to provide for the growing city. The Kiel tramway network, opened in 1881, had been enlarged to 10 lines, with a total route length of , before the end of the First World War.\nKiel was the site of the sailors' mutiny which led to the German Revolution in late 1918. Just before the end of the First World War, the German fleet stationed at Kiel was ordered to sail out for a last great battle with the Royal Navy. The sailors, who thought of it as a suicide mission which would have no effect on the outcome of the war, decided they had nothing to lose and refused to obey orders. They took over Kiel and then spread out to other north German ports, sparking the revolution which led to the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the Weimar Republic.\nDuring the Second World War, Kiel remained one of the major naval bases and shipbuilding centres of the German Reich. There was also a slave labour camp for the local industry. Owing to its status as a naval port and production site for submarines, Kiel was heavily bombed by the Allies during this period. The bombing destroyed more than 80% of the remaining old town, 72% of the central residential areas, and 83% of the industrial areas. During the RAF bombing of 23/24 July 1944, Luftwaffe fighters tried to intercept the spoof (i.e. decoy) force instead of the main force attacking Kiel, and there was no water for three days; trains and buses did not run for eight days and there was no gas available for cooking for three weeks. \nThere were several bombing raids of the port area during the period 20 February \u2013 20 April 1945 which successfully eliminated many U-boats, and the few large warships (cruisers Hipper, Scheer, and K\u00f6ln) still afloat at that time. It and its port, and the canal were seized by a British T-Force led by Major Tony Hibbert on 5 May 1945.\nLike other heavily bombed German cities, the city was rebuilt after the war. In 1946, Kiel was named the seat of government for Schleswig-Holstein, and it officially became the state's capital in 1952.\nToday, Kiel is once again an important maritime centre of Germany, with high-tech shipbuilding, submarine construction and one of the world's largest ocean research centers, the GEOMAR. In 2006, Kiel was one of the founding cities of the original European Green Capital Award.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nKiel has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"; Trewartha: \"Dolk\"). Located on the Baltic Sea coast, the temperature fluctuates less than inland, with warm winters and cool summers throughout the year. The average temperature ranges from in winter to in summer. Days with a temperature above are rare, with an average of only 2.8 days per year.\nThe Kiel weather station has recorded the following extreme values:\nNote.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDistricts.\nKiel has about 40 districts, but there is no standard division. The districts are traditionally grouped into 30 boroughs (Stadtteile). Another, more recent structure summarizes the districts in 18 political districts (Ortsteile). The city has 25 electoral districts.\nThe biggest districts, by population, are Wik (20,100), Gaarden-Ost (19,200) and Mettenhof (19,900). Gaarden, located at the southern end of the fjord, is a traditional working-class district that used to be home to mainly shipyard workers. Mettenhof is a large housing estate (satellite town) that was built in the 1960s and 1970s on the western outskirts of the city. The city districts of D\u00fcsternbrook, Schreventeich, Ravensberg and Bl\u00fccherplatz, north of the city centre, are popular places to live with many 19th century buildings, villas and tree-lined streets. The government offices, ministries and parliament of the state of Schleswig-Holstein are also mainly based in these neighbourhoods, particularly D\u00fcsternbrook.\nIn contrast to the heavy bomb damage inflicted on the central parts of the city during the Second World War, most of the residential areas were not severely damaged. Hence, Kiel's more modern-style inner city and Kiel's more historic/elaborate residential areas stand in architectural contrast to one another.\nThere are plans for large-scale improvement and building efforts for the inner city, providing better pavements, better access to and view of the waterfront, and a generally more attractive feel to the place. These plans, most notably the \"Kleiner Kiel Kanal\", a restoration of a historic canal that was filled in to make place for road infrastructure, are to be implemented in the next few years.\nMain sights.\nThe oldest building in the city is the 13th century \"Church of St. Nicholas\", which has a sculpture by Ernst Barlach in front of it called \"Geistk\u00e4mpfer\".\nKiel is Schleswig-Holstein's largest city, and therefore Kiel's shopping district is a major attraction, and will see further improvement and renovation efforts in the upcoming years. Kiel's Holstenstra\u00dfe (Holsten Street) is one of the longest shopping streets in Germany. The Rathaus (Town Hall), which was built in 1911, has an operating paternoster lift and the design of its tower was based on one in Venice. The square in front of it is bordered by a lake and the Opernhaus Kiel (Kiel Opera House). There are also a number of lakes and parks in the city centre, such as Schrevenpark. There are two botanical gardens, the Old Botanical Garden and the Botanischer Garten der Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel (or New Botanical Garden).\nAs Kiel is situated near the sea, the beaches to the north of Kiel, such as Strande, Kiel-Schilksee, M\u00f6ltenort and Laboe, are also popular places to visit in spring and summer.\nKiel Week, also known in English as the Kiel Regatta, is the largest sailing event in the world and takes place every year in the last full week in June. Many thousands of boats and ships of all kinds and eras take part in the parade. Kiel Week is also a festival, \"Volksfest\" and fair as well as a maritime event. There are a number of yachting and sailing clubs in picturesque settings.\nKiel also features a number of museums, including zoological, geological, historical, fine art, industrial and military museums. Notable is the Stadt- und Schifffahrtsmuseum Warleberger Hof (City and Maritime Museum), which belongs to the association \"Museen am Meer\". In addition to preserving architecture from the 16th century and historic rooms with painted stucco ceilings, it displays urban and cultural exhibits of the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly intriguing is the history of the carnival in Kiel. \nThe Schifffahrtsmuseum is in the former fish market building in the harbour.\nLaboe is home to the Laboe Naval Memorial and the Second World War submarine , which are both popular tourist sites.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nKiel has a population of 250,412. In 1946, when Kiel became the capital of Schleswig-Holstein, its population was about 214,000. Kiel is Germany's largest coastal city and its only state capital located on the sea. In the 1950s Kiel, with its marine port, attracted members of the navy. Kiel had its highest peak of population in 1973 at 273,000. The population declined since then. Many people moved away from this city and Kiel became very poor and had big problems with unemployed people at that time. Kiel is now a city with universities and active marine stations which attracts many young students and marines to Kiel.\nPolitics.\nCity Council.\nThe City Council is the municipal representative body of Kiel. Its composition is determined by citizens in elections held every five years.\nSince the last election on May 14, 2023, in which Alliance 90/The Greens became the strongest party in Kiel for the first time, the city has been governed by a green-red coalition. This coalition, formed by the Greens and the SPD, holds 25 of the 49 seats in the Kiel City Council and operates under a cooperation agreement from 2023 to 2028.\nMayor.\nThe current mayor of Kiel is Ulf K\u00e4mpfer of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). K\u00e4mpfer has stated that he will not run for a third five year term. His current term ends in 2026. The results of the 29 October 2019 election were as follows:\n2018 City Council election.\nThe Kiel city council governs the city alongside the Mayor. The results of the city council election on 6 May 2018 were as follows:\nCulture.\nSports.\nThere are a number of sports venues in Kiel, most notably the Wunderino Arena (formerly known as Baltic Sea Hall or \"Ostseehalle\"), which is the home ground of one of the most successful team handball clubs in the world and multiple German champion, THW Kiel. Holstein Kiel, an association football club, which plays at Holstein-Stadion, played in the Bundesliga in the 2024\u20132025 season for the first time in the club's history. \nEducation and scientific research.\nThe University of Kiel () was founded by Duke Christian Albrecht in 1665. It is the only full university of Schleswig-Holstein, with about 27,000 students. Partly linked to the University Kiel are other independent research facilities such as the German National Library of Economics \u2013 Leibniz Informationcenter for Economy, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and the research institute of the Bundeswehr for water sound and geophysics. Besides these, there are other educational institutions such as the Fachhochschule Kiel (founded in 1969) and the Muthesius School of Arts (founded in 1907). The projects Murmann School of Global Management and Economics and Multimedia Campus Kiel were ultimately unsuccessful. The offers, besides advanced training at the , dual study courses for economists, business information specialists, and industrial engineers.\nNoteworthy as a departmental research institute is the federal institute for dairy research, which was merged into the together with other institutions in 2004. The state capital Kiel is a corporative sponsoring member of the Max Planck Society.\nThe ARGE-SH, the oldest research institution of the republic of Germany, has its headquarters in Kiel.\nThere are twelve gymnasiums in Kiel, of which the , founded in 1320 as a humanistic gymnasium, is the oldest. Other secondary schools include the and the with a focus on natural sciences. There are many comprehensive schools \u2013 partially with secondary schools \u2013 all over the city area, as well as private schools.\n () is a vocational training center offering education and training in over 40 professions. It includes dual training programs, vocational schools, technical colleges, and vocational grammar schools.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nKiel's economy is dominated by the service sector, transport and maritime industries. Kiel is also one of the major ports of the German Navy, and a leading centre of German high-tech military and civil shipbuilding. Kiel is the home of Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a shipyard founded in 1838 famed for its construction of submarines. HDW built the first German submarine \"Brandtaucher\" in 1850, and is today a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, the leading German group of shipyards.\nStatistics.\nIn 2005, the GDP per person was \u20ac35,618, which is well above the national average of Germany and 159% of the European Union average.\nNotable companies.\nSome of the most notable companies having branches or their headquarters in Kiel are:\nFerry operators\nMilitary contractors\nEngineering and industrial machinery\nOthers\nKiel is also home to several insurances and banks, most notably the HSH Nordbank, Provinzial NordWest, F\u00f6rde Sparkasse, Kieler Volksbank eG and Evangelischen Bank eG.\nThere is also an active startup scene in Kiel with startup accelerator StarterKitchen and startups like SciEngines GmbH, Real-Eyes, myBoo, SealMedia, Cliplister, Druckpreis.DE, promotionbasis.de, Yoosello, GetAnEdge, Flowy Apps, fraguru, lokalportal, PianoMotion and ubique art.\nKiel is home to several media companies, including a branch of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk producing one radio channel and several local programmes in Kiel, a station of the British Forces Broadcasting Service, the daily newspaper \"Kieler Nachrichten\" and several smaller local radio channels and magazines.\nTransport.\nKiel is situated near an important pan-European motorway, the A7, which connects northern Europe with central and southern Europe.\nThe central railway station, Kiel Hauptbahnhof, has hourly trains to Hamburg, L\u00fcbeck, Flensburg, and Husum. The \"Intercity Express\" (ICE) connects Kiel with Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne and Munich. There are 8 regional railway stations within the city proper, which are connected with each other, the main railway station Kiel Hbf and other stations by regional trains, which can be used within the boundaries of the city with a normal bus ticket.\nThe city's bus service is provided by local company KVG. Autokraft and Verkehrsbetriebe Kreis Pl\u00f6n providing regional bus service, and the Schlepp- und F\u00e4hrgesellschaft Kiel provides public transport on the fjord with ferries.\nThe Port of Kiel is a significant port for passenger and cargo shipping from Germany to Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia.

It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yes\u2013no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer that floats up into a window.\nOrigin.\nThe functional component of the Magic 8 Ball was invented by Albert C. Carter, who was inspired by a spirit writing device used by his mother, a Cincinnati clairvoyant. When Carter approached store owner Max Levinson about stocking the device, Levinson called in Abe Bookman, Levinson's brother-in-law, and graduate of Ohio Mechanics Institute. In 1944, Carter filed for a patent for the cylindrical device, assigning it in 1946 to Bookman, Levinson and another partner in what came to be Alabe Crafts, Inc., combining the founder's names, Albert and Abe. Alabe marketed and sold the cylinder as The Syco-Slate. Carter died sometime before the patent was granted in 1948.\nBookman made improvements to The Syco-Slate, and in 1948 it was encased in an iridescent crystal ball. Though not successful, the revamped product caught the attention of Chicago's Brunswick Billiards, which in 1950 commissioned Alabe Crafts to make a version in the form of a traditional black-and-white 8 ball, which was possibly inspired by a gag in the 1940 Three Stooges short film, \"You Nazty Spy!\".\nCultural impact.\nAlthough originally sold as a paperweight, the Magic 8 Ball remained popular for several decades as both an office toy and a children's toy.\nIn 1971, Bookman sold Alabe Crafts, Inc., to Ideal Toys, which marketed the ball firmly at children. In 1987, the rights were again sold to Tyco Toys, spurring on another marketing campaign and resurgence in interest. Tyco Toys was acquired by Mattel, the current manufacturer, in 1997. Despite its numerous owners, the Magic 8 Ball has changed little in design and implementation.\nDesign and usage.\nThe Magic 8 Ball is a hollow plastic sphere resembling a black-and-white 8 ball. Its standard size is larger than an ordinary pool ball, but it has been made in different sizes. Inside the ball, a cylindrical reservoir contains a white plastic 20-sided regular icosahedron die floating in approximately of alcohol dyed dark blue. Each of the die's 20 faces has an affirmative, negative, or non-committal statement printed in raised letters. These messages are read through a window on the ball's bottom.\nTo use the ball, it must be held with the window initially facing down to allow the die to float within the cylinder. After asking the ball a yes\u2013no question, the user then turns the ball so that the window faces up. The die floats to the top, and one face presses against the window; the raised letters displace the blue liquid to reveal the message as white letters on a blue background. Although most users shake the ball before turning it upright, the instructions warn against doing so to avoid white bubbles.\nWhile the Magic 8 Ball has undergone very few changes, an addition in 1975 by new owners, Ideal Toy Company, fixed the bubble problem. Its patented \"Bubble Free Die Agitator\", an inverted funnel, reroutes the air trapped inside. The solution has been used ever since.\nPossible answers.\nThe 20 possible Magic 8 Ball answers were designed by Dr. Lucien Cohen, a psychology professor at the University of Cincinnati. The possible answers consist of 10 affirmative answers, five neutral, and five negative.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The stadium was in need of maintenance and had not been adequately updated. It had failed inspections before the disaster, and the wall collapsed under the force. Thirty-nine spectators\u2014mostly Italians and Juventus fans\u2014were killed in the subsequent crush, while 600 more were injured.\nAn hour before the final was due to kick off, incidents of aggression between the two sets of supporters were taking place across the flimsy divide between the Liverpool section and what was intended to be a \"neutral\" section, for those who had purchased tickets in Belgium. The throwing of objects back and forth led to larger scale physical altercations, and the chicken wire fence was soon ripped down. After initial fighting, Juventus fans in the neutral section began to run away from the Liverpool fans who had become involved, initially towards the pitch (where Belgian police would not allow them to go) and the exit (where they were not permitted to leave), and then in the direction of the decrepit wall. Fans already standing near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed, providing an escape route for some while contributing to the fatalities. Many people climbed to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the pre-match incidents, after a state of siege was declared in the city, with Juventus winning 1\u20130.\nThe tragedy resulted in English football clubs being banned by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990\u201391), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional three years, later reduced to one, and 14 Liverpool fans were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with the Belgian authorities also being blamed, including police captain Johan Mahieu, who had been in charge of security, found guilty of manslaughter. The disaster was later described as \"the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions\".\nBackground.\nIn May 1985, Liverpool were the defending European Champions' Cup winners, having won the competition after defeating Roma on penalties in the previous season's final. Again, they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, which had won unbeaten the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup. Juventus had a team of many of Italy's 1982 World Cup winning team, which played for Juventus for many years, and its playmaker, Michel Platini, was considered the best footballer in Europe or the world and was named Footballer of The Year by the magazine \"France Football\" for the second year in a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the previous season and were regarded by the specialist press as the two best teams on the continent. Both teams had contested the 1984 European Super Cup four months earlier, with a 2\u20130 victory for the Italian team.\nDespite its status as Belgium's national stadium, Heysel Stadium was in a poor state of repair by the 1985 European Cup final. The 55-year-old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years, and large parts of the facility were literally crumbling. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and Liverpool fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in the wall to get in. In some areas of the stadium, there was only one turnstile, and some fans attending the game claimed that they were never searched or asked for their tickets.\nLiverpool players and fans reportedly expressed surprise at the stadium's condition, despite reports from Arsenal fans that the ground was a \"dump\" when Arsenal had played there a few years earlier. They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition, especially since Barcelona's Camp Nou and Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u were both available. Juventus President Giampiero Boniperti and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to choose another venue and claimed that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Cup final, especially one involving two prominent European clubs. However, UEFA refused to consider a move. It was later discovered that UEFA's inspection of the stadium had lasted just thirty minutes.\nThe stadium was crammed with 58,000 to 60,000 supporters, with more than 25,000 for each team. The two ends behind the goals comprised all-standing terraces, each end split into three zones. The Juventus end was O, N, and M, and the Liverpool end was X, Y, and Z, as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster. However, the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium. The idea of the large neutral area was opposed by both Liverpool and Juventus, as it would provide an opportunity for fans of both clubs to obtain tickets from agencies or from ticket touts outside the ground and thereby create a dangerous mix of fans.\nAt the time, Belgium already had a large Italian community; many expatriate Juventus fans from Brussels, Li\u00e8ge and Charleroi bought Section Z tickets. Also, many tickets were bought up and sold by travel agents, mainly to Juventus fans. That meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section, which was nominally reserved for neutrals. Reportedly, Liverpool fans were still smarting from being attacked by Roma ultras at the 1984 European Cup final and placed next to what amounted to another Juventus section heightened tensions before the match. A small percentage of the tickets ended up in the hands of Liverpool fans.\nConfrontation.\nAt approximately 7:00p.m. local time, an hour before kickoff, the initial disturbance started. The Liverpool supporters in Section X and the mixed, but largely Juventus, supporters in Section Z (a supposedly neutral section for which tickets had been sold locally in Belgium) stood merely metres apart. The boundary between the two was marked by temporary chain link fencing and a central thinly-policed no man's land. Hooligans began to throw flares, bottles and stones across the divide and picked up stones from the crumbling terraces beneath them.\nAs kickoff approached, the exchange of objects increased. Eventually angry Liverpool fans charged towards the Juventus fans, the boundary between Section X and Z broke down, and the few police officers stationed at the divide were overpowered. As the Juventus fans started fleeing, initially towards the pitch (but the Belgian police would not allow them to go there) and the exit (where the officials would not open the gate to allow them to leave) and then towards the decrepit concrete wall at the perimeter of Section Z. Fans standing near the wall were crushed, and as the pressure mounted the entire lower portion of the wall collapsed, burying fans underneath it as it fell. Some fans managed to climb over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured.\nIn retaliation for the events in Section Z, many Juventus fans advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters, but police intervention stopped the advance. A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks, bottles and stones for two hours. One Juventus fan was also seen firing a starting gun at Belgian police.\nMatch.\nIt was decided that the match should eventually start for public policy doctrine reasons because abandoning the match would have risked inciting further disturbances. This decision was jointly made by UEFA officials, the Italian, English and Belgian national associations, the country's Ministry of Interior led by local Premier Wilfried Martens, Brussels Mayor Herv\u00e9 Brouhon, and the city's police force, despite the scale of the disaster, the state of siege in the City of Brussels consequently declared by the Belgian government and Juventus' expressed concerns about the match proceeding. After the captains of both sides spoke to the crowd and appealed for calm, the players took the field knowing that people had died. Years later, Liverpool captain Phil Neal said that in hindsight, it would have been \"a better decision\" to call off the game.\nJuventus won the match 1\u20130 thanks to a penalty scored by Platini, which was awarded by the Swiss referee, Daina, for a foul against Zbigniew Boniek.\nAt the end of the game, the trophy was given in front of the stadium's Honor Stand by UEFA President Jacques Georges to Juventus Captain Gaetano Scirea. The chants of fans of both teams in the stands and the massive invasion of the pitch by journalists and fans at the end of the match generated the collective hysteria. Some of the Italian club players celebrated the title in the middle of the pitch in front of their fans in the M section, and some of the Liverpool players applauded their fans between the X and Z sections.\nLiverpool players only realised the extent of the tragedy when they boarded their bus at a Brussels hotel to go to the airport, when a crowd of Juventus supporters surrounded the bus. Police had to escort the bus out of the lot. The police allowed Liverpool's bus to drive directly onto the tarmac at Brussels Airport to prevent potential disturbances at the terminal.\nVictims.\nOf the 39 people killed, 32 were Italian (including two minors), four Belgian, two French, and one from Northern Ireland.\nInvestigation.\nThe investigation focused initially on the actions of Liverpool fans. On 30 May, official UEFA observer Gunter Schneider said, \"Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt.\" UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an eighteen-month investigation, the dossier of leading Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. The investigation concluded that blame should not rest solely with the fans, and some culpability lay also with the police and authorities. Several top officials were incriminated by her findings, including police captain Johan Mahieu, who had been in charge of security. He was subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter.\nEffect on stadiums.\nAfter Heysel, English clubs began to impose stricter rules intended to make it easier to prevent troublemakers from attending domestic games, with legal provision to exclude troublemakers for three months introduced in 1986, and the Football Spectators Act 1989 introduced in 1991.\nSerious progress on legal banning orders preventing foreign travel to matches was arguably not made until the violence involving England fans (allegedly mainly involving neo-Nazi groups, such as Combat 18) at a match against Ireland on 15 February 1995 and violent scenes at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Rioting at UEFA Euro 2000 saw the introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers\u2014by 2004, 2,000 banning orders were in place, compared to fewer than 100 before Euro 2000.\nThe main reforms to English stadiums came after the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989, which ultimately resulted in the death of 97 Liverpool fans. All-seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitch-side fencing was removed and closed-circuit cameras became widespread. Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium.\nThe Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for some matches of the Belgium national team until 1990, when UEFA banned Belgium from hosting a European final for a minimum of 10 years. In 1994, the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the King Baudouin Stadium. On 28 August 1995 the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany. It then hosted a major European final again on 8 May 1996 when Paris Saint-Germain defeated Rapid Vienna 1\u20130 to win the Cup Winners' Cup.\nLitigation.\nBritish police undertook a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice. Some seventeen minutes of film and many still photographs were examined. \"TV Eye\" produced an hour-long programme featuring the footage while British newspapers published the photographs.\nA total of 34 people were arrested and questioned with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter\u2014the only extraditable offence applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February\u2013March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison, but, over the subsequent months, judges permitted their release as the start of the trial was further delayed.\nThe trial eventually began in October 1988, with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster: Albert Roosens, the head of the Belgian Football Association, for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans; and two police chiefs\u2014Michel Kensier and Johan Mahieu\u2014who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night. Two of the 26 Liverpool fans were in custody in Britain at the time and stood trial later. In April 1989, fourteen fans were convicted and given three-year sentences, half of which were suspended for five years, allowing them to return to the UK. One man who was acquitted was Ronnie Jepson, who would go on to make 414 appearances over a thirteen-year career in the English Football League.\nAftermath.\nEnglish club ban.\nPressure mounted to ban English clubs from European competition. On 31 May 1985, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked The Football Association (the FA) to withdraw English clubs from European competition before they were banned, but two days later, UEFA banned English clubs for \"an indeterminate period of time\". On 6 June, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) extended this ban to all worldwide matches, but this was modified a week later to allow friendly matches outside of Europe to take place. In December 1985, FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe, though the Belgian government banned any English clubs from playing in their country.\nThough the England national team was not subjected to any bans, English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions, with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years' suspension as well. In April 1989, following years of campaigning from the English football authorities, UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs (with the exception of Liverpool) into its competitions from the 1990\u201391 season onward effective from 11 July 1990. In April 1991 UEFA's executive committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the 1991\u201392 season onward, a year later than their compatriots, but two years earlier than initially foreseen. In the end, all English clubs served a five-year-ban, while Liverpool were excluded for six years.\nAccording to former Liverpool striker Ian Rush, who signed with Juventus a year later, he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy.\nEngland's UEFA coefficient.\nPrior to the introduction of the ban, England were ranked first in the UEFA coefficient ranking due to the performance of English clubs in European competition in the previous five seasons. Throughout the ban, England's points were kept in the ranking until they would have naturally been replaced.\nThe places vacated by English clubs in the UEFA Cup were reallocated to the best countries who would usually only have two spots in the competition\u2014countries ranked between ninth and twenty-first. For the 1985\u201386 UEFA Cup, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands were granted an additional spot each, while in 1986\u201387, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, France, and East Germany were the recipients. The 1987\u201388 season saw Portugal, Austria, and Sweden gain an additional place, with Sweden and Yugoslavia gaining the places for the 1988\u201389 competition. The final year of the English ban, 1989\u201390 saw Austria receive a spot, while a play-off round was played between a French and a Yugoslav side for the final space\u2014due to the two countries having the same number of points in the ranking.\nEngland was removed from the rankings in 1990 due to having no points. England did not return to the top of the coefficient rankings until 2008.\nBanned clubs.\nThe following clubs were denied entry to European competitions during this period:\nThe number of places available to English clubs in the UEFA Cup would however have been reduced had English teams been eliminated early in the competition. By the time of the re-admittance of all English clubs except Liverpool in 1990\u201391, England was only granted one UEFA Cup entrant (awarded to the league runners-up); prior to the ban, they had four entry slots, a number not awarded to England again under regular means.\nWelsh clubs playing in the English league system, who could qualify for the European Cup Winners' Cup via the Welsh Cup, were unaffected by the ban. Bangor City (1985\u201386), Wrexham (1986\u201387), Merthyr Tydfil (1987\u201388), Cardiff City (1988\u201389), and Swansea City (1989\u201390) all competed in the Cup Winners' Cup during the ban on English clubs, despite playing in the English league system.\nIn the meantime, many other clubs missed out on a place in the UEFA Cup due to the return of English clubs to European competitions only being gradual\u2014in 1990, the league had no UEFA coefficient points used to calculate the number of teams, and even though Manchester United won the Cup Winners' Cup in the first season of returning in 1990\u201391, it took several more years for England to win back the points to the previous level, due to the coefficient being calculated over a five-year period and there being a one-year delay between the publication of the rankings and their impact on club allocation.\nLiverpool's additional year of exclusion from Europe meant that there was no English representation in the 1990\u201391 European Cup, as they were 1989\u201390 Football League First Division champions.\nRepercussions on UEFA Cup qualification.\nDue to the weak coefficient, Football League Cup winners Nottingham Forest also missed out on UEFA Cup places in 1990\u201391, along with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The teams who missed out on the 1991\u201392 UEFA Cup, for the same reason were Sheffield Wednesday, Crystal Palace, and Leeds United. Arsenal and Manchester City were unable to take part for the 1992\u201393 competition. For 1993\u201394, Blackburn Rovers and Queens Park Rangers would have qualified.\nLeeds United missed out in 1994\u201395 and initially 1995\u201396, though they qualified for the latter via the new UEFA Fair Play ranking, which at the time gave their three top-ranking associations' highest-placed team who've not already qualified for Europe a UEFA Cup spot. Remaining outside the top three of the coefficient rankings, England retained its three UEFA Cup berths instead of four. Sixth-placed Everton lost a Fair Play berth for 1996\u201397 by UEFA, as punishment for the FA due to Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon fielding weakened teams in the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\nBy this point, while England's coefficient was no longer directly affected by the ban due to it being outside of the five-year window, their coefficient continued to be affected by years of under-representation in the competition. As a result, Aston Villa missed out via their league position for 1997\u201398 and 1998\u201399 but qualified for both through Fair Play. Restructuring of UEFA competitions for 1999\u20132000 gave the top six associations of the coefficient ranking three UEFA Cup berths (the top three gained four Champions League berths, whilst 4\u20136 got three), which England now reached, whilst associations ranked seventh and eighth were given four berths for the competition.\nCommemorations.\nIn 1985, a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea, Turin. The monument includes an epitaph written by Torinese journalist Giovanni Arpino. Since 2001 to 2017 it has been situated in front of the club's headquarters in Corso Galileo Ferraris and since then in Juventus Headquarter. In 1991, another memorial monument for the 39 victims of the disaster, was inaugurated in Reggio Emilia, the hometown of the victim Claudio Zavaroni, in front of Stadio Mirabello: every year the committee \"Per non dimenticare Heysel\" (In order not to forget Heysel) holds a ceremony on 29 May with relatives of the victims, representatives of Juventus, survivors and various supporters clubs from various football clubs, including Inter Milan, Milan AC, Reggiana and Torino. During Euro 2000, members of the Italian team left flowers on the site in honour of the victims.\nOn 29 May 2005, a \u00a3140,000 sculpture was unveiled at the new Heysel stadium, to commemorate the disaster. The monument is a sundial designed by French artist Patrick Rimoux and includes Italian and Belgian stone and the poem \"Funeral Blues\" by Englishman W.\u00a0H.\u00a0Auden to symbolise the sorrow of the three countries. Thirty-nine lights shine, one for each who died that night.\nOn 26 May 2010, a permanent plaque was unveiled on the Centenary Stand at Anfield to honour the Juventus fans who died 25 years earlier. This plaque is one of two permanent memorials to be found at Anfield, along with one for the 97 fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. In May 2012, a Heysel Memorial was unveiled in the J-Museum at Turin. There is also a tribute to the disaster's victims in the club's \"Walk of Fame\" in front of the Juventus Stadium. Two years later Juventus' officials announced a memorial in the Continassa headquarter. In February 2014, an exhibition in Turin was dedicated both to the Heysel tragedy and Superga air disaster. The name of the exhibition was \"Settanta angeli in un unico cielo \u2013 Superga e Heysel tragedie sorelle\" (70 angels in the one same heaven \u2013 Superga and Heysel sister tragedies) and gathered material from 4 May 1949 and 29 May 1985.\nOn 12 November 2015, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), Juventus' representatives led by Mariella Scirea and J-Museum president Paolo Garimberti and members of the Italian victims association held a ceremony in front of the Heysel monument in King Baudouin Stadium for the 30th anniversary of the event. The following day, FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio announced the retirement of \"Squadra Azzurra\"'s number 39 shirt prior to the friendly match between Italy and Belgium.\nAt games.\nA memorial service for those killed in the disaster was held before Liverpool's match with Arsenal at Anfield on 18 August 1985, their first fixture after the disaster. However, according to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", it was \"drowned out\" by chanting. Juventus and Liverpool were drawn together in the quarter-finals of the 2004\u201305 Champions League, their first meeting since Heysel. Before the first leg at Anfield, Liverpool fans held up placards to form a banner saying \"amicizia\" (\"friendship\" in Italian). The gesture was met with a mixed reaction from Juventus fans, with some applauding and others choosing to turn their backs on it. In the return leg in Turin, Juventus fans displayed banners reading \"Easy to speak, difficult to pardon: Murders\" and \"15-4-89. Sheffield. God exists\", the latter a reference to the Hillsborough disaster, in which 97 Liverpool fans were killed in a crush. A number of Liverpool fans were attacked in the city by Juventus ultras.\nIn May 2015, during a Serie A match between Juventus and Napoli at Turin, Juventus fans held up placards to form a banner saying \"+39 Rispetto\" (\"respect +39\" in Italian) including the names of the victims of the disaster.\nIn an interview with \"Planet Football\", Liverpool footballer Mark Lawrenson spoke about his experience in the immediate aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster, describing it as a \"surreal, ugly night\" and \"a horrific chain of events.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city was the capital of Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf province in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam, located near the center of Vietnam. The original site was a Cham city known as Kandarpapura and later as Amarendrapura and was the capital of the Champa Kingdom from 192 to 605. On 1 January 2025, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf province was upgraded to become Vietnam's sixth centrally-governed municipality, named Hu\u1ebf. The former provincial city was dissolved to establish two new urban districts: Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n district and Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a district.\nFollowing the conquest of the city in 1307 by Vietnam, it was renamed to Hu\u1ebf. Hu\u1ebf (Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a) was the capital of \u0110\u00e0ng Trong from 1738 to 1775 and of Vietnam during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty from 1802 to 1945. The city served as the old Imperial City and administrative capital for the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty and later functioned as the administrative capital of the protectorate of Annam during the French Indochina period. It contains a UNESCO-designated site, the Complex of Hu\u1ebf Monuments, which is a popular tourist attraction. Alongside its moat and thick stone walls the complex encompasses the Imperial City of Hu\u1ebf, with palaces and shrines; the Forbidden Purple City, once the emperor's home; and a replica of the Royal Theater.\nNearly 4.2 million visitors had visited the city in 2019 and many of its historic landmarks are still undergoing restoration.\nHistory.\nThe oldest ruins in Hu\u1ebf belong to the Kingdom of L\u00e2m \u1ea4p, dating back to the 4th century AD. The ruins of its capital, the ancient city of Kandarpapura (lit. 'the city where \u015aiva burnt Kama'), is now located in Long Tho Hill, three kilometers to the west of the city. Kandarpapura might have only been established during the reign of Kandarpadharma (r. 629\u2013640) and it was named after the king, certainly it may be not the name of the capital of former L\u00e2m \u1ea4p kingdom. Another Champa ruin in the vicinity, the ancient city of Hoa Chau is dated back to the 9th century.\nIn 1306, the King of Champa, Ch\u1ebf M\u00e2n offered Vietnam two Cham prefectures, \u00d4 and L\u00fd, in exchange for marriage with a Vietnamese (Tr\u1ea7n dynasty) princess named Huy\u1ec1n Tr\u00e2n. The Vietnamese King Tr\u1ea7n Anh T\u00f4ng accepted this offer. He took and renamed \u00d4 and L\u00fd prefectures to Thuan prefecture and H\u00f3a prefecture, respectively, the two being often referred collectively to as Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a region.\nIn 1592, the M\u1ea1c dynasty was forced to flee to Cao B\u1eb1ng province and the L\u00ea emperors were enthroned as \"de jure\" Vietnamese rulers under the leadership of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim, the leader of L\u00ea dynasty loyalists. Later, Kim was poisoned by a M\u1ea1c dynasty general which paved the way for his son-in-law, Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m, to take over the leadership. Kim's eldest son, Nguyen U\u00f4ng, was also assassinated in order to secure Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m's authority. Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng, another son of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim, feared a fate like Nguy\u1ec5n U\u00f4ng's so he pretended to have a mental illness. He asked his sister Ngoc Bao, who was a wife of Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m, to entreat Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m to let Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng govern Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a, the furthest south region of Vietnam at that time.\nBecause M\u1ea1c dynasty loyalists were revolting in Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a, and Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m was busy fighting the M\u1ea1c dynasty's forces in northern Vietnam during this time, Ngoc Bao's request was approved, and Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng went south. After Ho\u00e0ng pacified Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a, he and his heir Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean secretly made this region loyal to the Nguy\u1ec5n family; then they rose against the Tr\u1ecbnh lords. Vietnam erupted into a new civil war between two \"de facto\" ruling families: the clan of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords and the clan of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords.\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n lords chose Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean, a northern territory of Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a, as their family seat. In 1687 during the reign of Nguy\u1ec5n lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Tr\u0103n, the construction of a citadel was started in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n (later renamed as Hu\u1ebf) a village in Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean province. The citadel was a powerful symbol of Nguy\u1ec5n family rather than a defensive building because the Tr\u1ecbnh lords' army could not breach Nguy\u1ec5n lords' defense in the northern regions of Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n. In 1744, Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n officially became the capital of central and southern Vietnam after Nguy\u1ec5n lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t proclaimed himself Vo V\u01b0\u01a1ng (\"Vo King\" or \"Martial King\" in Vietnamese). Among westerners living in the capital at this period was the Portuguese Jesuit Jo\u00e3o de Loureiro from 1752 onwards.\nHowever, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellions broke out in 1771 and quickly occupied a large area from Quy Nhon to B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn province, thereby weakening the authority and power of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. While the war between T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion and Nguy\u1ec5n lord was being fought, the Tr\u1ecbnh lords sent south a massive army and easily captured Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n in 1775. After the capture of Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, the Tr\u1ecbnh lords' general Ho\u00e0ng Ng\u0169 Ph\u00fac made a tactical alliance with T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and withdrew almost all troops to Tonkin and left some troops in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n. In 1786, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion defeated the Tr\u1ecbnh garrison and occupied Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n. Under the reign of the emperor Quang Trung, Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n became the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty capital. In 1802, Nguyen \u00c1nh, a successor of the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, recaptured Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n and unified the country. Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh rebuilt the citadel entirely and made it the Imperial City capital of all of Vietnam.\nIn 1802, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac \u00c1nh (later Emperor Gia Long) succeeded in establishing his control over the whole of Vietnam, thereby making Hue the national capital.\nThe second emperor of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty to rule from Hu\u1ebf, reigning from his birthday on 14 February 1820 until his death, on 20 January 1841 was Minh M\u1ea1ng. He was a younger son of Emperor Gia Long, whose eldest son, Crown Prince C\u1ea3nh, had died in 1801. Minh M\u1ea1ng was well known for his opposition to French involvement in Vietnam, and for his rigid Confucian orthodoxy.\nDuring the French colonial period, Hue was in the protectorate of Annam. It remained the seat of the Imperial Palace until 1945, when Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i abdicated and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) government was established with its capital at Ha Noi (Hanoi), in the north.\nWhile B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was proclaimed \"Head of the State of Vietnam\" with the help of the returning French colonialists in 1949 (although not with recognition from the communists or the full acceptance of the Vietnamese people), his new capital was Sai Gon (Saigon), in the south.\nThe city was also the battleground for the Battle of Hu\u1ebf, which was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. During the Republic of Vietnam, Hue, being very near the border between the North and South, was vulnerable in the Vietnam War. In the Tet Offensive of 1968, during the Battle of Hu\u1ebf, the city suffered considerable damage not only to its physical features but also to its reputation from combination of American military bombing of historic buildings held by the North Vietnamese and from the massacre at Hu\u1ebf.\nAfter the war's conclusion in 1975, many of the historic features of Hu\u1ebf were neglected because they were seen by the victorious communist regime and some other Vietnamese as \"relics from the feudal regime\"; the Communist Party of Vietnam (then Workers' Party of Vietnam) doctrine described the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty as \"feudal\" and \"reactionary\". With the adoption of liberalizing reforms, however, these hostile policies have been abandoned. Many historic areas of the city are being restored, and the city is quickly developing into a tourism and transportation hub for central Vietnam.\nIn recognition of Hu\u1ebf's rapid development, the city became Vietnam's sixth centrally-governed municipality in 2025. As part of this process, Hu\u1ebf annexed the rest of Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf province to streamline administration.\nGeography.\nThe city is located in central Vietnam on the banks of the H\u01b0\u01a1ng River, just a few miles inland from the South China Sea. It is about south of Hanoi and about north of Ho Chi Minh City. Hu\u1ebf is bordered by Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110i\u1ec1n district and South China Sea to the north, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ee7y town to the south and east, Ph\u00fa Vang district to the east and H\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u00e0 town to the west. Located on the two banks of the H\u01b0\u01a1ng River, north of H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass, from Da Nang, from Thu\u1eadn An Seaport and Phu Bai International Airport and from Ch\u00e2n M\u00e2y Port. The natural area is and the population in 2012 is estimated at 344,581 people. As of 2021, after the territorial expansion, the city has a total area of and the population is 652,572 people (including those who are not registered residents).\nLocated near Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n mountain range, Hu\u1ebf city is a plain area in the lower reaches of the Perfume River and Bo River, with an average altitude of 3\u20134 m above sea level and often flooded when the river's headwaters H\u01b0\u01a1ng has medium and large rainfall. This plain area is relatively flat, although there are alternating hills and low mountains such as Ng\u1ef1 B\u00ecnh mountain and Vong Canh Hill.\nClimate.\nHu\u1ebf features a tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\") under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, falling short of a tropical rainforest climate because there is less than of rain in March and April. The dry season is from February to August, with high temperatures of . The rainy season is from August to January, with a flood season from October onwards. The average rainy season temperature is , although it has fallen as low as . The highest temperature recorded was 42.2\u00a0\u00b0C on 27 April 2024, while the lowest was 8.8\u00a0\u00b0C in January 1934.\nGovernment.\nAdministrative divisions.\nHue comprises 36 administrative divisions, including 29 \"ph\u01b0\u1eddng\" (urban wards):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nand 7 \"x\u00e3\" (rural communes):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nName-giving.\nHistorically, the qualities valued by the royal family were reflected in its name-giving customs, which came to be adopted by society at large. As a rule, royal family members were named after a poem written by Minh M\u1ea1ng, the second emperor of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. The poem, \"\u0110\u1ebf h\u1ec7 thi\", has been set as a standard frame to name every generation of the royal family, through which people can know the family order as well as the relationship between royal members. More importantly, the names reflect the essential personality traits that the royal regime would like their offspring to uphold. This name-giving tradition is proudly kept alive and nowadays people from Hu\u1ebf's royal family branches (normally considered 'pure' Hu\u1ebf) still have their names taken from the words in the poem.\nClothing.\nThe design of the modern-day \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\", a Vietnamese national costume, developed from the costumes worn by civilians in \u0110\u00e0ng Trong in the 18th century after the costume reform of lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t. A court historian of the time described the rules of dress as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Th\u01b0\u1eddng ph\u1ee5c th\u00ec \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng, \u0111\u00e0n b\u00e0 d\u00f9ng \u00e1o c\u1ed5 \u0111\u1ee9ng ng\u1eafn tay, c\u1eeda \u1ed1ng tay r\u1ed9ng ho\u1eb7c h\u1eb9p t\u00f9y ti\u1ec7n. \u00c1o th\u00ec hai b\u00ean n\u00e1ch tr\u1edf xu\u1ed1ng ph\u1ea3i kh\u00e2u k\u00edn li\u1ec1n, kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c x\u1ebb m\u1edf. Duy \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng kh\u00f4ng mu\u1ed1n m\u1eb7c \u00e1o c\u1ed5 tr\u00f2n \u1ed1ng tay h\u1eb9p cho ti\u1ec7n khi l\u00e0m vi\u1ec7c th\u00ec \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c ph\u00e9p.Outside court, men and women wear gowns with straight collars and short sleeves. The sleeves are large or small depending on the weather. There are seams on both sides running down from the sleeve, so the gown is not open anywhere. Men may wear a round collar and a short sleeve for more convenience.\u2014\u200a\nThis outfit evolved into the \"\u00e1o ng\u0169 th\u00e2n\", a type of five-part costume popular in Vietnam in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by Paris fashions, Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00e1t T\u01b0\u1eddng and other artists associated with Hanoi University redesigned the \"ng\u0169 th\u00e2n\" to create the modern \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\" in the 1920s and 1930s. While the \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\" and \"n\u00f3n l\u00e1\" are generally seen as a symbol of Vietnam as a whole, the combination is seen by Vietnamese as being particularly evocative of Hue. Violet-coloured \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\" are especially common in Hu\u1ebf, the color having a special connection to the city's heritage as a former capital.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Hu\u1ebf forms the heart of Central Vietnamese cuisine, but one of the most striking differences is the prominence of vegetarianism in the city. Several all-vegetarian restaurants are scattered in various corners of the city to serve the locals who have a strong tradition of eating a vegetarian meal twice a month, as part of their Buddhist beliefs. Nam Ch\u00e2u H\u1ed9i Qu\u00e1n is a traditional dining hall. Hue dishes are known for their relatively small serving size with refined presentation, a vestige of its royal cuisine. Hue cuisine is notable for often being very spicy.\nHue cuisine has both luxurious and popular rustic dishes. It consists of several distinctive dishes from small and delicate creations, originally made to please the appetites of Nguyen feudal lords, emperors, and their hundreds of concubines and wives.\nBesides B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u1ebf, other famous dishes include:\nAdditionally, Hue is also famous for its delicious sweet desserts such as Lotus seeds sweet soups, Lotus seed wrapped in logan sweet soup, Areca flower sweet soup, Grilled pork wrapped in cassava flour sweet soup, and Green sticky rice sweet soup.\nReligion.\nThe imperial court practiced various religions such as Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. The most important altar was the Esplanade of Sacrifice to the Heaven and Earth, where the monarch would offer each year prayers to the Heaven and Earth.\nIn Hu\u1ebf, Buddhism enjoyed stronger support than elsewhere in Vietnam, with more monasteries than anywhere else in the country serving as home to the nation's most famous monks.\nIn 1963, Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c drove from Hu\u1ebf to Saigon to protest anti-Buddhist policies of the South Vietnamese government, setting himself on fire on a Saigon street. Photos of the self-immolation became some of the enduring images of the Vietnam War.\nTh\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, a world-famous Zen master who originated from Hue and lived for years in exile including France and the United States, returned to his home town in October 2018 and resided there at the Tu Hieu pagoda until his death in 2022.\nTourism.\nHu\u1ebf is well known for its historic monuments, which have earned it a place in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. The seat of the Nguy\u1ec5n emperors was the Imperial City, which occupies a large, walled area on the north side of the Perfume River. Inside the citadel was a forbidden city where only the emperors, concubines, and those close enough to them were granted access; the punishment for trespassing was death. Today, little of the forbidden city remains, though reconstruction efforts are in progress to maintain it as a historic tourist attraction.Roughly along the Perfume River from Hu\u1ebf lie myriad other monuments, including the tombs of several emperors, including Minh M\u1ea1ng, Kh\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ecbnh, and T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c. Also notable is the Thi\u00ean M\u1ee5 Temple, the largest pagoda in Hu\u1ebf and the official symbol of the city.\nA number of French-style buildings lie along the south bank of the Perfume River. Among them are Hue High School for the Gifted, the oldest high school in Vietnam, and Hai Ba Trung High School.\nThe Hu\u1ebf Museum of Royal Fine Arts on 3 Le Truc Street also maintains a collection of various artifacts from the city. In addition to the various touristic attractions in Hue itself, the city also offers day-trips to the Demilitarized Zone lying approximately north, showing various war settings like The Rockpile, Khe Sanh Combat Base or the V\u1ecbnh M\u1ed1c tunnels. Most of the hotels, bars, and restaurants for tourists in Hue are located in Pham Ngu Lao, Chu Van An and Vo Thi Sau street, which together form the backpacker district.\nIn the first 11 months of 2012, Hue received 2.4 million visitors, an increase of 24.6% from the same period of 2011. 803,000 of those 2.4 million visitors were foreign guests, an increase of 25.7%. Although tourism plays a key role in the city's socioeconomic development, it also has negative impacts on the environment and natural resource base. For example, services associated with tourism, such as travel, the development of infrastructure and its operation, and the production and consumption of goods, are all energy-intensive. Research by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network has identified traditional 'garden houses' as having the potential to increase tourist traffic and revenue. Apart from the environmental, economic and cultural benefits provided by garden houses, their promotion could pave the way for other low carbon development initiatives.\nInfrastructure.\nHealth.\nThe Hu\u1ebf Central Hospital, established in 1894, was the first Western hospital in Vietnam. The hospital, providing 2078 beds and occupying , is one of three largest in the country along with Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi and Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, and is managed by the Ministry of Health.\nTransportation.\nHu\u1ebf railway station provides a rail connection to major Vietnamese cities, via the North\u2013South railway. Phu Bai International Airport is just south of the city centre.\nNotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%\" class=\"wraplinks\""}

It occurred during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the two standing-only central pens within the Leppings Lane stand allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, police match commander David Duckenfield ordered exit gate C to be opened in an attempt to ease crowding, which led to an influx of supporters entering the pens. This resulted in overcrowding of those pens and the fatal crush; with a total of 97 fatalities and 766 injuries, the disaster is the deadliest in British sporting history. Ninety-four people died on the day; one more died in hospital days later, and two more suffered irreversible brain damage on the day and died in 1993 and 2021 respectively. The match was abandoned and replayed at Old Trafford in Manchester on 7 May 1989; Liverpool won and went on to win that season's FA Cup.\nIn the following days and weeks, South Yorkshire Police (SYP) fed the press false stories suggesting that football hooliganism and drunkenness by Liverpool supporters had caused the disaster. Blaming Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990, which found that the main cause was a failure of crowd control by SYP. Following the Taylor Report, the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of any individuals or institutions. The disaster led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds, notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football.\nThe first coroner's inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, completed in 1991, concluded with verdicts of \"accidental death\" in respect of all the deceased. Families disputed the findings, and fought to have the case re-opened. In 1997 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluded that there was no justification for a new inquiry. Private prosecutions brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000. In 2009 a Hillsborough Independent Panel was formed to review the evidence. Reporting in 2012, it confirmed Taylor's 1990 criticisms and revealed details about the extent of police efforts to shift blame onto fans, the role of other emergency services and the errors of the first coroner's inquests. The panel's report resulted in the previous findings of accidental death being quashed, and the creation of new coroner's inquests. It also produced two criminal investigations led by police in 2012: Operation Resolve to look into the causes of the disaster, and by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to examine actions by police in the aftermath.\nThe second coroner's inquests were held from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016. They ruled that the supporters were unlawfully killed owing to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care. The inquests also found that the design of the stadium contributed to the crush, and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions. Public anger over the actions of their force during the second inquests led to the suspension of the SYP chief constable, David Crompton, following the verdict. In June 2017, six people were charged with offences including manslaughter by gross negligence, misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice for their actions during and after the disaster. The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently dropped all charges against one of the defendants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBefore the disaster.\nVenue.\nHillsborough Stadium had been constructed in 1899 to house Sheffield Wednesday. It was selected by the Football Association (FA) as a neutral venue to host the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs. Kick-off was scheduled for 3:00pm on 15 April 1989, and fans were advised to take up positions 15 minutes beforehand.\nAt the time of the disaster most English football stadiums had high steel fencing between the spectators and the playing field in response to pitch invasions. Hooliganism had affected the sport for some years and was particularly virulent in England. Since 1974, when these security standards were put in place, crushes had occurred in several English stadiums.\nA report by Eastwood &amp; Partners for a safety certificate for the stadium in 1978 concluded that although it failed to meet the recommendations of the \"Green Guide\", a guide to safety at sports grounds, the consequences were minor. It emphasised the general situation at Hillsborough was satisfactory compared with most grounds. Sheffield Wednesday were later criticised for neglecting safety in the stadium, especially after an incident in the semi-final of the 1981 FA Cup. The Leppings Lane end of the ground did not hold a valid safety certificate at the time of the disaster; it had not been updated since 1979.\nRisks associated with confining fans in pens were highlighted by the \"Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds\" (the Popplewell inquiry) after the Bradford City stadium fire in May 1985. It made recommendations on the safety of crowds penned within fences, including that \"all exit gates should be manned at all times ... and capable of being opened immediately from the inside by anyone in an emergency\".\nPrevious incidents.\nHillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s. During the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs. Police believed there would have been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended that the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: \"Bollocks \u2013 no one would have been killed\". The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. This particular change, and other later alterations to the stadium, invalidated the stadium's safety certificate which was not renewed, and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure.\nAfter the crush in 1981, Hillsborough was not selected to host an FA Cup semi-final again until 1987. Significant overcrowding was observed at the ground during that year's quarter-final between Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City, and again during the semi-final between Coventry City and Leeds United. The Leeds fans were assigned the Leppings Lane end for the semi-final; one fan described disorganisation at the turnstiles and no steward or police direction inside the stadium, resulting in the crowd in one enclosure becoming so compressed that he was at times unable to raise and clap his hands. Other accounts told of fans having to be pulled to safety from above.\nLiverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-final at Hillsborough in 1988, and fans again reported crushing at the Leppings Lane end. Liverpool lodged a complaint before the match in 1989. One supporter wrote to the Football Association and the Minister for Sport: \"The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to move and where I, and others around me, felt considerable concern for personal safety.\"\nSouth Yorkshire Police command changes.\nSouth Yorkshire Police (SYP) presence at the previous year's FA Cup semi-final (also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and also at Hillsborough Stadium) had been overseen by Chief Superintendent Brian L. Mole. Mole had supervised numerous police deployments at the stadium in the past. In October 1988 a probationary PC in Mole's F division, South Yorkshire was handcuffed, photographed, and stripped by fellow officers in a fake robbery, as a hazing prank. Four officers resigned and seven were disciplined over the incident. Chief Superintendent Mole himself was to be transferred to the Barnsley division for \"career development reasons\". The transfer was to be done with immediate effect on 27 March 1989.\nMeanwhile, Hillsborough was accepted as the FA Cup semi-final venue on 20 March 1989 by the Football Association. The first planning meeting for the semi-final took place on 22 March and was attended by newly promoted Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, not by Mole. No known minutes exist of this meeting. Although Mole could have been assigned the semi-final match's planning despite his transfer, that was not done. This left planning for the semi-final match to Duckenfield, who had never commanded a sell-out football match before, and who had \"very little, if any\" training or personal experience in how to do so.\nDisaster.\nAccess to the stadium.\nAs is common practice at domestic football matches in England, opposing supporters were segregated in and around the stadium. Nottingham Forest were allocated the South Stand and Spion Kop, with a combined capacity of 29,800 spectators, reached by 60 turnstiles spaced along the south and east sides of the ground. Liverpool were allocated the North Stand and West Stand, with a combined capacity of 24,256 spectators, reached by 23 turnstiles from a narrow concourse off Leppings Lane. Ten turnstiles (numbered 1 to 10) provided access to 9,700 seats in the North Stand, six turnstiles (numbered 11 to 16) provided access to 4,456 seats in the upper tier of the West Stand, and a further seven turnstiles (lettered A to G) gave access to 10,100 standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand. Although a greater number of Liverpool supporters were expected to attend the match, Forest had been allocated the larger spectator area, to avoid the approach routes of rival fans crossing. As a result of the stadium layout and the segregation policy, the additional turnstiles that would normally have allowed access to the North Stand from the east were not being used, and the Liverpool fans were forced to converge on the single entrance at Leppings Lane. On the day of the match, radio and television broadcasters were advising anyone without a ticket not to attend. Rather than establishing crowd safety as their top priority, the clubs, local authorities and police viewed their roles and responsibilities through the 'lens of hooliganism'.\nBuild-up.\nThree chartered trains had transported Liverpool supporters to Sheffield for the 1988 semi-final, but only one such train was provided in 1989. The 350 passengers arrived at the ground at about 2:20pm. Many of the supporters wished to enjoy the day and were in no hurry to enter the stadium too early. Some were delayed by roadworks while crossing the Pennines on the M62 motorway which resulted in minor traffic congestion. Between 2:30pm and 2:40pm, there was a build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane, eager to enter the stadium before the game started. At 2:46pm, the BBC's football commentator John Motson had already noticed the uneven distribution of people in the Leppings Lane pens, and while rehearsing for the match off-air he had suggested a nearby cameraman look as well. \"There's gaps, you know, in parts of the ground. Well, if you look at the Liverpool end, to the right of the goal, there's hardly anybody \"on\" those steps... that's it. Look down there.\"\nA bottleneck developed outside the stadium, with more fans arriving than could be safely filtered through the turnstiles before the 3:00pm kick-off. People presenting tickets at the wrong turnstiles, and those who had been refused entry, were blocked from leaving because of the crowd behind them and remained as an obstruction. Fans outside the ground could hear cheering as the teams came onto the pitch ten minutes before the start of the match, and as the match kicked off, but could not gain entrance. A police constable radioed control requesting that the game be delayed, as had happened in 1987, to ensure the safe passage of supporters into the ground, but the request to delay the kick-off by 20 minutes was declined.\nBy this time, an estimated 5,000 fans were trying to enter through the turnstiles. Amid increasing safety concerns, and to avoid fatalities outside the ground, the police opened a large exit gate (Gate C) that ordinarily permitted the free flow of supporters departing the stadium after a match. Two more gates (A and B) were subsequently opened to further relieve the pressure. After an initial rush, thousands of supporters entered the stadium \"steadily at a fast walk\".\nCrush.\nWhen the gates were opened, thousands of fans entered a narrow tunnel leading from the rear of the terrace into two overcrowded central pens (pens 3 and 4), creating pressure at the front. Hundreds of people were pressed against one another and the fencing by the weight of the crowd behind them. People entering were unaware of the problems at the front of the pens; police or stewards would normally stand at the entrance to the tunnel and, if the central pens reached capacity, they would direct people to the side pens, but that did not happen on this occasion, for reasons not fully explained.\nThe match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest started at 3:00pm, as scheduled. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 from the rear entrance tunnel as the match began. For some time, problems at the front of the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside the pens and a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar later reported that fans behind him were pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. At first, the police made attempts to stop people from spilling out of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:04pm, a shot from Liverpool's Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar; possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way.\nPolice superintendent Roger Greenwood (the most senior SYP officer in command inside the ground on the day) realised the situation, and ran onto the field to gain the attention of referee Ray Lewis, who stopped the match at 3:05:30. At this point, people were climbing the fence at the front of the pens in an effort to escape the crush and get to the pitchside. A small gate in the fence had been forced open and some fans managed to escape via this route, while others continued to climb over the fencing. Some were pulled to safety by people at the front of the upper tier of the West Stand above the Leppings Lane terrace. The intensity of the crush broke more crush barriers on the terrace. Holes were made in the perimeter fencing by fans desperately attempting to rescue others.\nThe crowd in the Leppings Lane terrace spilled onto the pitch, where the many injured and traumatised fans who had climbed to safety congregated. The football players were ushered to their dressing rooms and informed that there would be a 30-minute postponement. The people still trapped in the pens were packed so tightly that many victims died of compressive asphyxia while standing. Meanwhile, on the pitch, police, stewards and members of the St John Ambulance service were overwhelmed. Many uninjured fans were assisting the injured; several attempted CPR and others tore down advertising hoardings to use as makeshift stretchers. SYP chief superintendent John Nesbit later briefed Michael Shersby MP, at a Police Federation meeting in October 1989, that allowing the fans to help with the rescue effort was a deliberate strategy \"otherwise they might have turned their frustration on the police.\"\nSYMAS response.\nThe agreed protocol for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS) was that ambulances were to queue at the entrance to the gymnasium under the North Stand, termed the \"casualty reception point\", or CRP. Any individuals within the stadium that were seriously injured were to be delivered expeditiously by police and paramedics to the CRP to receive medical attention. The system of ferrying injured from any location within the stadium to the CRP required a formal declaration to be made by those in charge for it to take effect. As this declaration was not immediately performed, there was confusion among those attempting to administer aid on the pitch. This indecision migrated to the first responders waiting in ambulances at the CRP, which quickly deteriorated into an ambulance car park. Some crews were hesitant to leave their vehicles, unsure of whether patients were coming to them, or vice versa. Others who did leave their vehicles were then faced with the obstacles inherent in placing distance between themselves and their equipment. As the Panel explained in their report:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The equipment was no use on the ambulance vehicle when critical early resuscitation was taking place some distance away on the pitch, behind the Leppings Lane end and in the gymnasium. Some ambulance crew did take equipment when they left their vehicle, but there was no systematic direction to do so, not all did, and none initially had been given any information about the situation inside the stadium.\nA total of 42 ambulances arrived at the stadium. Two ambulances managed to make their way onto the pitch of their own accord, and a third entered the field at the direction of deputy chief ambulance officer Alan Hopkins, who felt its visibility might allay crowd concerns. The remaining 39 ambulances were collectively able to transport approximately 149 people to either Northern General Hospital, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, or Barnsley Hospital for treatment.\nThe adverse comments of two doctors regarding the emergency response appeared in the media. Their views were not \"a maverick view from a disaffected minority but the considered opinion of the majority of professionals present from the outset.\"\nReactions.\nCondolences flooded in from across the world, led by Queen Elizabeth II. Other messages came from Pope John Paul II, US President George H. W. Bush, and the chief executive of Juventus (fans of Liverpool and Juventus had been involved in the Heysel Stadium disaster) amongst many others.\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Home Secretary Douglas Hurd visited Hillsborough the day after the disaster and met survivors. Anfield stadium was opened on the Sunday to allow fans to pay tribute to the dead. Thousands of fans visited and the stadium filled with flowers, scarves and other tributes. In the following days more than 200,000 people visited the \"shrine\" inside the stadium. The following Sunday, a link of football scarves spanning the distance across Stanley Park from Goodison Park to Anfield was created, with the final scarf in position at 3:06pm. Elsewhere on the same day, a silence \u2013 opened with an air-raid siren at three o'clock \u2013 was held in central Nottingham with the colours of Forest, Liverpool and Wednesday adorning Nottingham Council House.\nAt Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, a requiem mass attended by 3,000 people was held by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Derek Worlock. The first reading was read by Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. Liverpool players Ronnie Whelan, Steve Nicol, and former manager Joe Fagan carried the communion bread and wine.\nThe FA chief executive Graham Kelly, who had attended the match, said the FA would conduct an inquiry into what had happened. Speaking after the disaster, Kelly backed all-seater stadiums, saying \"We must move fans away from the ritual of standing on terraces\". Standing on terraces and the use of perimeter fencing around the pitch, the use of CCTV, the timing of football matches and policing of sporting events were factors for a subsequent inquiry to consider.\nUEFA President Jacques Georges caused controversy by describing the Liverpool supporters as \"beasts\", wrongly suggesting that hooliganism was the cause of the disaster, which had occurred less than four years after the Heysel Stadium disaster. His remarks led to Liverpool F.C. calling for his resignation, but he apologised on discovering hooliganism was not the cause.\nAt the 1989 FA Cup final between Liverpool and local rivals Everton, held just five weeks after the Hillsborough disaster, the players from both participating teams wore black armbands as a gesture of respect to the victims.\nDuring the final match of the 1988\u201389 Football League season, contested on 26 May 1989 between Liverpool and second-place Arsenal, the Arsenal players presented flowers to fans in different parts of Anfield in memory of those who had died in the Hillsborough disaster.\nDisaster appeal fund.\nA disaster appeal fund was set up with donations of \u00a3500,000 from the UK Government, \u00a3100,000 from Liverpool F.C. and \u00a325,000 each from the cities of Liverpool, Sheffield, and Nottingham. The Liverpool F.C. donation was the amount the club would have received (as its share of the match income) had the semi-final gone ahead as planned. Within days, donations had passed \u00a31million, swelled by donations from individuals, schools and businesses. Other fundraising activities included a Factory Records benefit concert and several fundraising football matches. The two teams involved in the Bradford City stadium fire, Bradford City and Lincoln City, met for the first time since the 1985 disaster in a game that raised \u00a325,000 for the Hillsborough fund. By the time the appeal closed in 1990, it had raised more than \u00a312million. Much of the money went to victims and relatives of those involved in the disaster and provided funds for a college course to improve the hospital phase of emergency care.\nIn May 1989, a charity version of the Gerry and the Pacemakers song \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\" was released in aid of those affected. The record was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman and featured Liverpool musicians Paul McCartney, Gerry Marsden (of the Pacemakers), Holly Johnson, and The Christians. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one on 20 May, and remained at the top of the chart for three weeks. Despite having stronger ties to Liverpool F.C., Gerry and the Pacemakers' earlier hit \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" was not used because it had recently been re-recorded for the Bradford City stadium fire appeal.\nEffect on survivors.\nBy the disaster's 10th anniversary in 1999, at least three people who survived were known to have taken their own lives. Another survivor had spent eight years in psychiatric care. There were cases of alcoholism, drug abuse, and collapsed marriages involving people who had witnessed the events. The lingering effects of the disaster were seen as a cause, or contributory factor, in all of these.\nVictims.\nIn total, ninety-seven people died as a result of injuries incurred during the disaster. Ninety-four people, aged from 10 to 67 years old, died on the day, either at the stadium, in the ambulances, or shortly after arrival at hospital. A total of 766 people were reported to have suffered injuries, among whom 300 were hospitalised. The less seriously injured survivors who did not live in the Sheffield area were advised to seek treatment for their injuries at hospitals nearer to their homes. On 19 April, the number of deaths reached 95 when 14-year-old Lee Nicol died in hospital after being taken off life support. The 96th victim died in March 1993, when artificial feeding and hydration were withdrawn from 22-year-old Tony Bland after nearly four years, during which time he had remained in a persistent vegetative state showing no sign of improvement.\nThis followed a legal challenge in the High Court by his family to have his treatment withdrawn, a landmark challenge which succeeded in November 1992.\nAndrew Devine, aged 22 at the time of the disaster, suffered similar injuries to Tony Bland and was also diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. In March 1997 \u2013 just before the eighth anniversary of the disaster \u2013 it was reported he had emerged from the condition and was able to communicate using a touch-sensitive pad, and he had been showing signs of awareness of his surroundings for up to three years before. Devine died in 2021, as a consequence of the injuries sustained at Hillsborough; the coroner ruled that he had been unlawfully killed and thus the 97th fatality of the disaster.\nTwo sisters, three pairs of brothers, and a father and son were among those who died, as were two men about to become fathers for the first time: 25-year-old Steven Brown of Wrexham and 30-year-old Peter Thompson of Widnes. Jon-Paul Gilhooley, aged 10, was the youngest person to die. His cousin, Steven Gerrard, then aged 8, went on to become Liverpool F.C.'s captain. Gerrard has said the disaster inspired him to lead the team he supported as a boy and become a top professional football player. The oldest person to die at Hillsborough was 67-year-old Gerard Baron, an older brother of former Liverpool player Kevin Baron.\nStephen Whittle is considered by some to be another victim of Hillsborough, as due to work commitments, he had sold his ticket to a friend (whom he and his family chose not to identify), who then died in the disaster; the resulting feeling of survivor guilt is believed to be the main reason he took his own life at age 50 in February 2011. In addition, it was also noted that Whittle became withdrawn from friends and family, and was unable to go to football matches due to his guilt and related feeling of responsibility for his friend's death.\nThe majority of victims who died were from Liverpool (38) and Greater Merseyside (20). A further 20 were from counties adjacent to Merseyside. An additional three victims came from Sheffield with two more living in counties adjacent to South Yorkshire. The remaining 14 victims lived in other parts of England.\nAges.\nOf those who died, 79 were aged under 30, 38 of whom were under 20, and all but three of the victims were aged under 50.\n1989\u20131991 coroner's hearing.\nInquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned immediately after the disaster.\nResumed on 19 November 1990, they proved to be controversial. South Yorkshire coroner Stefan Popper limited the main inquests to events up to 3:15pm on the day of the disaster \u2013 nine minutes after the match was halted and the crowd spilt onto the pitch. Popper said this was because the victims were either dead, or brain dead, by 3:15pm. The decision angered the families, many of whom felt the inquests were unable to consider the response of the police and other emergency services after that time. The inquests returned verdicts of accidental death on 26 March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing or an open verdict, and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the officers who had been present at the disaster. Trevor Hicks, whose two daughters had been killed, described the verdicts as 'lawful' but 'immoral'.\nPopper's decision regarding the cut-off time was subsequently endorsed by the Divisional Court who considered it to have been justified in the light of the medical evidence available to him. Relatives later failed to have the inquests reopened to allow more scrutiny of police actions and closer examination of the circumstances of individual cases.\nFamilies believed that Popper was 'too close' to the police. After the verdicts Barry Devonside, who had lost his son, witnessed Popper hosting a celebration party with police officers.45\nOne of the individual cases where the circumstances of death were not fully resolved was that of Kevin Williams, the fifteen-year-old son of Anne Williams. Anne Williams, who died in 2013, rejected the coroner's decision that the Hillsborough victims, including her son, had died before 3:15pm, citing witness statements that described him showing signs of life at 4:00pm. She unsuccessfully appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in 2009. The Hillsborough Independent Panel considered the available evidence and stated that \"the initial pathologist's opinion appeared definitive, but further authoritative opinions raised significant doubts about the accuracy of that initial opinion.\"\nPopper had excluded the witness evidence of two qualified Merseyside doctors (John Ashton and Glyn Phillips) who had been inside the stadium on the day and who had been critical of the chaotic emergency response. The views of both were dismissed by the Taylor report. They both gave evidence at the 2016 Warrington inquests. Phillips stated that the exclusion of their evidence was a 'serious error of judgement' by Popper. He said that he 'could not fathom why he didn't call us, other than he specifically did not want to hear our evidence, in which case the first inquests were coloured and flawed before they even started'.\nAshton and Phillips were not the only doctors present at the disaster not to be called to give evidence to the Popper inquests. The only one called was the Sheffield Wednesday club doctor.\nTaylor Inquiry.\nAfter the disaster, Lord Justice Taylor was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the events. The Taylor Inquiry sat for a total of 31 days (between 15 May and 29 June 1989) and published two reports: an interim report (1 August 1989) which laid out the events of the day and immediate conclusions; and a final report (19 January 1990) which outlined general recommendations on football ground safety. The two publications together became known as the Taylor Report.\nTaylor concluded that policing on the day \"broke down\" and \"the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control\". Attention was focused on the decision to open the secondary gates; moreover, the kick-off should have been delayed, as had been done at other venues and matches.\nSheffield Wednesday was also criticised for the inadequate number of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and the poor quality of the crush barriers on the terraces, \"respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster\".\nPolice control.\nTaylor found there was \"no provision\" for controlling the entry of spectators into the turnstile area. He dismissed the claim by senior police officers that they had no reason to anticipate problems, since congestion had occurred at both the 1987 and 1988 semi-finals. He said that \"the Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short period. That it might so occur was foreseeable\". The failure by the police to give the order to direct fans to empty areas of the stadium, was described by Taylor as \"a blunder of the first magnitude\".\nThere was no means for calculating when individual enclosures had reached capacity. A police officer ordinarily made a visual assessment before guiding fans to other pens. However, on the day of the disaster, \"by 2:52pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full [...] to allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was courting disaster\".\nThe report noted that the official capacity of the central pens was 2,200, that the Health and Safety Executive found this should have been reduced to 1,693 due to crush barriers and perimeter gates, but actually an estimated 3,000 people were in the pens around 3:00pm. The report said \"When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. ... [T]here was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve pressure\". Further that: \"The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to overcrowding\".\nRegarding the decision to allocate Liverpool spectators to the West and North Ends, Taylor stated \"I do not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters\".\nLord Taylor noted with regard to the performance of the senior police officers in command that \"...neither their handling of the problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank\".\nBehaviour of fans.\nLord Taylor concluded that the behaviour of Liverpool fans, including accusations of drunkenness, were secondary factors, and said that most fans were: \"not drunk, nor even the worse for drink\". He concluded that this formed an exacerbating factor but that police, seeking to rationalise their loss of control, overestimated the element of drunkenness in the crowd.\nThe report dismissed the theory, put forward by South Yorkshire Police, that fans attempting to gain entry without tickets or with forged tickets were contributing factors.\nEmergency response.\nTaylor concluded that in responding to the disaster there had been no fault on the part of the emergency services (St John Ambulance, South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and fire brigade).\nPolice evasion.\nTaylor concluded his criticism of South Yorkshire Police by describing senior officers in command as \"defensive and evasive witnesses\" who refused to accept any responsibility for error: \"In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank\". Further stating: \"South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. ... [T]he police case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. ... Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt\".\nEffect on stadiums in Britain.\nThe Taylor Report had a deep impact on safety standards for stadiums in the UK. Perimeter and lateral fencing was removed and many top stadiums were converted to all-seated. Purpose-built stadiums for Premier League and most Football League teams since the report are all-seater.\nIn July 1992, the government announced a relaxation of the regulation for the lower two English leagues (known now as League One and League Two). The Football Spectators Act does not cover Scotland, but the Scottish Premier League chose to make all-seater stadiums a requirement of league membership, this has not applied since the creation of the Scottish Professional Football League in 2013. In England and Wales all-seating is a requirement of the Premier League and of the Football League for clubs who have been present in the Championship for more than three seasons.\nSeveral campaigns have attempted to get the government to relax the regulation and allow standing areas to return to Premiership and Championship grounds.\nStuart-Smith scrutiny.\nIn May 1997, when the Labour Party came into office, Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered an investigation. It was performed by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The appointment of Stuart-Smith was not without controversy. At a meeting in Liverpool with relatives of those involved in Hillsborough in October 1997, he flippantly remarked \"Have you got a few of your people or are they like the Liverpool fans, turn up at the last minute?\" He later apologised for his remark, saying it was not intended to offend. The terms of reference of his inquiry were limited to \"new evidence\", that is \"...evidence which was not available or was not presented to the previous inquiries, courts or authorities.\" Therefore, evidence such as witness statements which had been altered were classed as inadmissible.\nWhen he presented his report in February 1998, he concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a new inquiry into the disaster. In paragraph 5 of his summary, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.\nImportantly, Stuart-Smith's report supported the coroner's assertion that evidence after 3:15pm was inadmissible as \"that by 3:15pm the principal cause of death, that is, the crushing, was over.\" This was controversial as the subsequent response of the police and emergency services would not be scrutinised. Announcing the report to the House of Commons, Home Secretary Jack Straw backed Stuart-Smith's findings and said that \"I do not believe that a further inquiry could or would uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for the distress of those who have been bereaved.\" However, the determination by Stuart-Smith was heavily criticised by the Justice Minister, Lord Falconer, who stated \"I am absolutely sure that Sir Murray Stuart-Smith came completely to the wrong conclusion\". Falconer added: \"It made the families in the Hillsborough disaster feel after one establishment cover-up, here was another.\"\nHillsborough Independent Panel.\nThe Hillsborough Independent Panel was instituted in 2009 by the British government to investigate the Hillsborough disaster, to oversee the disclosure of documents about the disaster and its aftermath and to produce a report. On 12 September 2012, it published its report and simultaneously launched a website containing 450,000 pages of material collated from 85 organisations and individuals over two years.\nHistory.\nIn the years after the disaster, the Hillsborough Family Support Group had campaigned for the release of all relevant documents into the public domain. After the disaster's 20th anniversary in April 2009, supported by the Culture Secretary, Andy Burnham, and Minister of State for Justice, Maria Eagle, the government asked the Home Office and Department of Culture, Media and Sport to investigate the best way for this information to be made public. In April 2009, the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced she had requested secret files concerning the disaster be made public.\nIn December 2009, Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the Hillsborough Independent Panel's remit would be to oversee \"full public disclosure of relevant government and local information within the limited constraints set out in the disclosure protocol\" and \"consult with the Hillsborough families to ensure that the views of those most affected by the disaster are taken into account\". An archive of all relevant documentation would be created and a report produced within two years explaining the work of the panel and its conclusions.\nThe panel was chaired by James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool. Other members were:\nFindings.\nOn 12 September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel concluded that no Liverpool fans were responsible in any way for the disaster, and that its main cause was a \"lack of police control\". Crowd safety was \"compromised at every level\" and overcrowding issues had been recorded two years earlier. The panel concluded that \"up to 41\" of the 96 who had died up to that date, might have survived had the emergency services' reactions and co-ordination been better. The number is based on post-mortem examinations which found some victims may have had heart, lung or blood circulation function for some time after being removed from the crush. The report stated that placing fans who were \"merely unconscious\" on their backs rather than in the recovery position, would have resulted in their deaths due to airway obstruction. Their report was in 395 pages and delivered 153 key findings.\nThe findings concluded that 164 witness statements had been altered. Of those statements, 116 were amended to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire Police. South Yorkshire Police had performed blood alcohol tests on the victims, some of them children, and ran computer checks on the national police database in an attempt to \"impugn their reputation\". The report concluded that the then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, Irvine Patnick, passed inaccurate and untrue information from the police to the press.\nThe panel noted that, despite being dismissed by the Taylor Report, the idea that alcohol contributed to the disaster proved remarkably durable. Documents disclosed confirm that repeated attempts were made to find supporting evidence for alcohol being a factor, and that available evidence was significantly misinterpreted. It noted \"The weight placed on alcohol in the face of objective evidence of a pattern of consumption modest for a leisure event was inappropriate. It has since fuelled persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour\".\nThe evidence it released online included altered police reports.\nEffects.\nSubsequent apologies were released by Prime Minister David Cameron on behalf of the government, Ed Miliband on behalf of the opposition, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, South Yorkshire Police, and former editor of \"The Sun\", Kelvin MacKenzie, who apologised for making false accusations under the headline \"The Truth\". MacKenzie said he should have written a headline that read \"The Lies\", although this apology was rejected by the Hillsborough Family Support Group and Liverpool fans, as it was seen to be \"shifting the blame once again.\"\nAfter publication, the Hillsborough Family Support Group called for new inquests for the victims. They also called for prosecutions for unlawful killing, corporate manslaughter and perversion of the course of justice in respect of the actions of the police both in causing the disaster and covering up their actions; and in respect of Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Sheffield Council and the Football Association for their various responsibilities for providing, certifying and selecting the stadium for the fatal event.\nCalls were made for the resignation of police officers involved in the cover-up, and for Sheffield Wednesday, the police and the Football Association to admit their blame. Calls were also made for Sir Dave Richards to resign as chairman of the Premier League and give up his knighthood as a result of his conduct at Sheffield Wednesday at the time of the disaster. The Home Secretary called for investigations into law-breaking and promised resources to investigate individual or systematic issues.\nOn 23 October 2012, Norman Bettison resigned with immediate effect as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police, after Maria Eagle MP on the floor of the House and protected by parliamentary privilege, accused him of boasting about concocting a story that all the Liverpool fans were drunk and police were afraid they were going to break down the gates and decided to open them. Bettison denied the claim, and other allegations about his conduct, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fans' behaviour, to the extent that it was relevant at all, made the job of the police, in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles, harder than it needed to be. But it didn't cause the disaster any more than the sunny day that encouraged people to linger outside the stadium as kick off approached. I held those views then, I hold them now. I have never, since hearing the Taylor evidence unfold, offered any other interpretation in public or private.\nMerseyside Police Authority confirmed that Bettison would receive an \u00a383,000 pension, unless convicted of a criminal offence. Hillsborough families called for the payments to be frozen during the IPCC investigation. In the same 22 October House of Commons debate, Stephen Mosley MP alleged West Midlands police pressured witnesses \u2013 both police and civilians \u2013 to change their statements. Maria Eagle confirmed her understanding that WMP actions in this respect would be the subject of IPCC scrutiny.\nSecond coroner's hearing.\nFollowing an application on 19 December 2012 by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the High Court quashed the verdicts in the original inquests and ordered fresh inquests to be held. Sir John Goldring was appointed as Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) and West Yorkshire (West) to conduct those inquests. The inquests hearings started on Monday 31 March 2014 at Warrington. Transcripts of the proceedings and evidence that was produced during the hearings were published at the Hillsborough Inquests official website. On 6 April 2016, the nine jurors were sent out to consider their verdicts. These were formally given to the inquests at 11:00 on 26 April 2016. The jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing in respect of all 96 victims (by majority verdict of 7\u20132). Upon receiving the April 2016 verdict, Hillsborough Family Support Group chair Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James was killed in the disaster, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let's be honest about this \u2013 people were against us. We had the media against us, as well as the establishment. Everything was against us. The only people that weren't against us was our own city. That's why I am so grateful to my city and so proud of my city. They always believed in us.\nOn the day after the verdicts were reached, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, made a statement to Parliament which included the verdicts of the jury to the fourteen questions they had been asked regarding the roles of South Yorkshire police, the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, Sheffield Wednesday football club and Hillsborough stadium's engineers and two specific questions relating to the time and cause of death for each of the dead. In addition to the \"unlawful killing\" verdict, the jury concluded that \"errors or omissions\" by police commanding officers, Sheffield Wednesday, the ambulance service and the design and certification of the stadium had all \"caused or contributed\" to the deaths, but that the behaviour of football supporters had not. In all but one case, the jury recorded the time of death as later than the 3:15pm cut-off point adopted by the coroner at the original inquests.\nPrime Minister David Cameron also responded to the April 2016 verdict by saying that it represented a \"long overdue\" but \"landmark moment in the quest for justice\", adding \"All families and survivors now have official confirmation of what they always knew was the case, that the Liverpool fans were utterly blameless in the disaster that unfolded at Hillsborough.\" The Labour Party described the handling of the Hillsborough disaster as the \"greatest miscarriage of justice of our times\", with Labour MPs Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram calling for accountability and the prosecution of those responsible. Liberal Democrat MP John Pugh called for David Cameron to make a formal apology in the House of Commons to the families of those killed at Hillsborough and to the city of Liverpool as a whole.\nEchoing his 2012 expression of regret former Home Secretary Jack Straw apologised to the families for the failures of his 1997 review of the disaster.\nKelvin MacKenzie, who wrote the now-infamous \"The Truth\" front page for the \"Sun\", said that although he was \"duped\" into publishing his story, that his \"heart goes out\" to the families of those affected, saying that \"It's quite clear today the fans had nothing to do with it\". However, MacKenzie did not accept any personal responsibility for the story.\nDuring the inquests, Maxwell Groome \u2013 a police constable at the time of the disaster \u2013 made allegations of a high-level \"conspiracy\" by Freemasons to shift blame for the disaster onto Superintendent Roger Marshall, also that junior officers were pressured into changing their statements after the disaster, and told not to write their accounts in their official police pocketbooks. Groome also claimed that match commander Duckenfield was a member of the \"highly influential\" Dole lodge in Sheffield (the same lodge as Brian Mole, his predecessor). Coroner Sir John Goldring warned the jury that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that any Masonic meeting actually took place, or that those named were all Freemasons, advising the jury to cast aside \"gossip and hearsay\". During the inquests, Duckenfield confirmed that he became a Freemason in 1975 and became Worshipful Master of his local lodge in 1990, a year after the disaster; following this revelation, Freemasons were forbidden to take part in the IPCC investigation and Operation Resolve as civilian investigators to prevent any perceived bias.\nIndependent Police Complaints Commission investigation.\nFollowing the inquests verdicts, South Yorkshire police announced it would refer the actions of its officers to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). West Yorkshire Police announced it would refer its Chief Constable, Norman Bettison, to the IPCC in mid-September. Bettison had been one of a number of police officers who were accused by the Hillsborough Independent Panel of manipulating evidence. In early October, Bettison announced his retirement, becoming the first senior figure to step down since publication of the panel's report.\nThe IPCC announced on 12 October 2012 that it would investigate the failure of the police to declare a major incident, failure to close the tunnel to the stands which led to overcrowded pens despite evidence it had been closed in such circumstances in the past; changes made to the statements of police officers; actions which misled Parliament and the media; shortcomings of previous investigations; and the role played by Norman Bettison.\nBy 22 October 2012, the names of at least 1,444 serving and former police officers had been referred to the IPCC investigation. In its announcement, the IPCC praised the tenacity of the Hillsborough families' campaign for truth and justice. On 16 October 2012, the Attorney General announced in Parliament he had applied to have the original inquests' verdicts quashed, arguing it proceeded on a false basis and evidence now to hand required this exceptional step.\nOn 12 July 2013, it was reported that the IPCC had found that in addition to the now 164 police statements known to have been altered, a further 55 police officers had changed their statements. Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC said, \"We know the people who have contacted us are the tip of the iceberg.\" That was after the IPCC's Hillsborough Contact team had received 230 pieces of correspondence since October 2012.\nThe IPCC is also investigating the actions of West Midlands Police, who in 1989 had been tasked with investigating South Yorkshire Police's conduct for both the original inquests and also the Taylor independent inquiry.\nIn April 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it would consider bringing charges against both individuals and corporate bodies once the criminal investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission \u2013 Operation Resolve \u2013 had been completed.\n'The patronising disposition of unaccountable power' report.\nIn April 2016, the then Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the Right Reverend James Jones (Bishop of Liverpool from 1998 to 2013) to produce a report on the experiences of the Hillsborough families, in the hope that their pain and suffering would not be repeated and that their perspective would not be lost. After carrying out a thorough review, Jones published his report \u2013 titled \"The patronising disposition of unaccountable power: A report to ensure that the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated\" \u2013 on 1 November 2017. Having met the Hillsborough families in one-to-one meetings and group sessions whilst compiling his report, Jones was able to include numerous first-hand accounts of their encounters with private and public authorities.\nThe report identified 25 'points of learning', of which the following drew particular attention:\nIn the report, James also called for the government to give \"full consideration\" to a proposed Public Authority Accountability Bill, known informally as 'The Hillsborough Law', which would include a legal duty of candour on public authorities and officials to be truthful and to proactively cooperate with official investigations and inquiries. The full text of the draft bill was provided as an appendix to his report.\nSix years after the report was published, on 6 December 2023, the government issued its response and signed the Hillsborough Charter giving a commitment to transparency following a public tragedy. However, the proposal for a 'Hillsborough Law' was rejected as it was considered by the government to be \"not necessary\".\nCriminal and civil cases.\nProsecutions.\nIn February 2000, a private prosecution was brought against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and another officer, Bernard Murray. The prosecution argued that the crush was \"foreseeable\" hence the defendants were \"grossly negligent\". Prosecutor Alun Jones told the court that Duckenfield gave the order to open the gates so that hundreds of fans could be herded onto the already crowded terraces at the stadium. Jones stated that minutes after the disaster, Duckenfield \"deceitfully and dishonestly\" told senior FA officials that the supporters had forced the gate open. Duckenfield admitted that he had lied in certain statements regarding the causes of the disaster. The prosecution ended on 24 July 2000, when Murray was acquitted and the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Duckenfield. On 26 July, the judge refused the prosecution's application for a retrial of Duckenfield.\nPolice disciplinary charges were abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and, because Murray was unavailable, it was decided not to proceed with disciplinary charges against him. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.\nHome Secretary Theresa May announced on 18 December 2012 that a new police inquiry would be initiated to examine the possibility of charging agencies other than the police over the Hillsborough deaths. The inquiry was first headed by former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart, and later by Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley.\nOn 28 June 2017, it was announced that six people were to be charged with offences in relation to the disaster. Former Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, in charge of the match, faced 95 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. He faced no charge in respect of the death of Tony Bland, who died four years after the disaster. Former Chief Inspector Sir Norman Bettinson faced four counts of misconduct in public office. Former Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Club Secretary Graham Mackrell faced a charge of breaching the Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975. Solicitor Peter Metcalf, former Chief Superintendent Donald Denton, and former Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster were all charged with perverting the course of justice, for having altered 68 police officers' statements in order to \"mask the failings\" of the police force.\nOn 9 August 2017, all except Duckenfield appeared at Warrington Magistrates Court. Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the charge against him. No formal pleas were taken from the other four defendants. All five were bailed to appear at the Crown Court in September. Duckenfield was not required to appear as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) needed to apply to the High Court to lift a court order before he could be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges. On 29 June 2018, a ruling was made that Duckenfield would be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges.\nIt was announced in December 2017 that a police officer and a farrier would not be prosecuted over allegations that they fabricated a story about a police horse being burned with cigarettes at Hillsborough. Although there was enough evidence to charge the farrier with perverting the course of justice, it was felt not to be in the public interest to charge him. There was insufficient evidence against the police officer to charge him with the offence.\nOn 21 August 2018, it was announced that all charges against Bettison were being dropped as the CPS felt that there was insufficient evidence to have a realistic chance of a conviction. The death of two witnesses and contradictions in the evidence of others were cited as part of the reason for the decision. Representatives of the 96 victims of the disaster stated that they would be asking for an independent review of the decision under the Right to Review Scheme.\nAt a trial preparation hearing at Preston Crown Court on 10 September 2018, Duckenfield pleaded not guilty to all 95 charges against him. Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the two charges against him. A provisional trial date was set for 14 January 2019, on which date the trial started at Preston Crown Court before Mr Justice Openshaw.\nOn 13 March 2019, it was reported that Duckenfield would not be called to give evidence in his defence. It was also reported that the jury would be directed to find Mackrell not guilty on the charge of contravening the stadium's safety certificate due to a lack of evidence. On 3 April, the jury returned with a guilty verdict against Mackrell on a health and safety charge but was unable to reach a verdict on Duckenfield. It was announced on 25 June that Duckenfield would face a retrial, which was scheduled to start on 7 October at Preston Crown Court. On 28 November 2019, Duckenfield was found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.\nOn 26 May 2021, Denton, Foster and Metcalfe were all found not guilty of perverting the course of justice by altering 68 police officers' statements, when Mr Justice William Davis found that they had no case to answer. The reason given was that the public inquiry in 1990, to which the altered statements were submitted, was not a statutory inquiry, and therefore not a Court of Law. Consequently, a course of public justice could not have been perverted. The ruling also noted that the original statements had neither been destroyed, nor had they been ordered to be destroyed.\nIn response to the acquittals, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg called the lack of accountability over Hillsborough \"the greatest scandal of British policing of our lifetimes\". Garston and Halewood MP Maria Eagle called for the law to be changed to \"prevent another catastrophic failure of justice\".\nPsychiatric injury and other litigation.\nVarious negligence cases were brought against the police by spectators who had been at the ground but had not been in the pens, and by people who watched the incident unfolding on television (or heard about it on the radio). A case, \"Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police\" [1992] 1 A.C. 310, was eventually appealed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and was an important milestone in the law of claims of secondary victims for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury. It was held that claimants who watched the disaster on television/listened on radio were not 'proximal' and their claims were rejected.\nAnother psychiatric injury claim was brought to the House of Lords, \"White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police\" [1999] 2 A.C. 455. It was brought by police officers on duty against the chief constable who was said to have been vicariously liable for the disaster. Their claims were dismissed and the Alcock decision was upheld. It affirmed the position of the courts once again towards claims of psychiatric injuries of secondary victims.\nA third legal case which resulted from the Hillsborough disaster was \"Airedale N.H.S. Trust v Bland\" [1993] A.C. 789, a landmark House of Lords decision in English criminal law, that allowed the life-support machine of Tony Bland, a Hillsborough victim in a persistent vegetative state, to be switched off.\nIn April 2016, an action was launched in the High Court on behalf of victims' relatives against both SYP and the West Midlands Police force (who had investigated the actions of SYP) alleging misfeasance in public office, involving a concerted cover-up designed to shift blame away from the police. An agreement was reached to settle the case in April 2021, but reporting restrictions were put in place due to the pending trial of Denton, Foster and Metcalf. Following the finding that they did not have a case to answer, the restrictions were lifted.\n\"Hillsborough Law\".\nA \"Public Authority (Accountability) Bill\", sometimes known as a \"Hillsborough Law\", has been proposed by bereaved families of various such disasters whereby public bodies and public servants (such as police) would have a \"duty of candour\". \nThe legislation, which received its first reading in Parliament in September 2025, aims to prevent future cover-ups by public officials and ensure justice for victims of major disasters like Hillsborough. Keir Starmer met with campaigners, including Margaret Aspinall, whose son died at Hillsborough, to mark the bill's introduction. Aspinall said she was grateful to Starmer for fulfilling his promise. Starmer had previously faced criticism for delays, having pledged to introduce the law by the 36th anniversary of the disaster in April 2025. He insisted he wanted to \"take the time to get it right\" amid concerns from campaigners and MPs about civil servants watering down the bill. Starmer and other government ministers have framed the Hillsborough Law as a measure to address institutional failures in a range of public disasters, including the Horizon IT scandal, the infected blood scandal, and the Grenfell Tower fire. \nThe proposed legislation has been praised by campaigner groups and local leaders, including Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, who described it as a \"landmark moment\".\nMemorials.\nPermanent memorials.\nSeveral memorials have been erected in memory of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster.\nMemorial ceremonies.\nThe disaster has been acknowledged on 15 April every year by the community in Liverpool and football in general. An annual memorial ceremony is held at Anfield and at a church in Liverpool. The 10th and 20th anniversaries were marked by special services to remember the victims. Liverpool F.C. typically request that they are not scheduled to play on the anniversary of the disaster.\nFrom 2007, an annual Hillsborough Memorial service was held at Spion Kop, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The ceremony was held on the Spion Kop Battlefield that gave its name to the Kop Stand at Anfield. There is a permanent memorial to the 96 fans who died, in the form of a bench in view of the battlefield at a nearby lodge. South African Liverpool supporters were responsible for the service and the bench was commissioned in 2008. Following on from the Hillsborough families' decision to conclude official memorials at Anfield with a final service in 2016, it was decided not to hold any further memorials at Spion Kop. The Memorial bench remains at Spion Kop Lodge. In April 2023, a single seat was added to commemorate the 97th victim, Andrew Devine.\nIn 2014, to mark the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the FA decided that all FA Cup, Premier League, Football League, and Football Conference matches played between 11 and 14 April would kick-off seven minutes later than originally scheduled with a six-minute delay and a one-minute silence tribute.\n10th anniversary.\nIn 1999, Anfield was packed with a crowd of around 10,000 people ten years after the disaster. A candle was lit for each of the 96 victims. The clock at the Kop End stood still at 3:06pm, the time that the referee had blown his whistle in 1989 and a minute's silence was held, the start signalled by match referee from that day, Ray Lewis. A service led by the Right Reverend James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool, was attended by past and present Liverpool players, including Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman and Alan Hansen. According to the BBC report: \"The names of the victims were read from the memorial book and floral tributes were laid at a plaque bearing their names.\" A gospel choir performed and the ceremony ended with a rendition of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". The anniversary was also marked by a minute's silence at the weekend's league games and FA Cup semi-finals.\n20th anniversary.\nIn 2009, on the 20th anniversary of the disaster, Liverpool's request that their Champions League quarter-finals return leg, scheduled for 15 April, be played the day before was granted.\nThe event was remembered with a ceremony at Anfield attended by over 28,000 people. The Kop, Centenary and Main Stands were opened to the public before part of the Anfield Road End was opened to supporters. The memorial service, led by the Bishop of Liverpool began at 14:45 BST and a two-minute silence (observed across Liverpool and in Sheffield and Nottingham, including public transport coming to a stand-still) was held at the time of the disaster twenty years earlier, 15:06 BST. Burnham, by then the Sports Minister, addressed the crowd but was heckled by supporters chanting \"Justice for the 96\". The ceremony was attended by survivors of the disaster, families of victims and the Liverpool team, with goalkeeper Pepe Reina leading the team and management staff onto the pitch. Team captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain Jamie Carragher handed the freedom of the city to the families of all the victims. Candles were lit for each of the 96 people who died. Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool's manager at the time of the disaster, read a passage from the Bible, \"Lamentations of Jeremiah\". The Liverpool manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, set 96 balloons free. The ceremony ended with 96 rings of church bells across the city and a rendition of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".\nOther services took place at the same time, including at the Anglican Liverpool Cathedral and the Roman Catholic Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. After the two-minute silence, bells on civic buildings rang out throughout Merseyside.\nA song was released to mark the 20th anniversary, entitled \"Fields of Anfield Road\", which peaked at number 14 in the UK charts.\nLiverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester United players showed respect by wearing black armbands during their Champions League quarter-final matches on 14 and 15 April 2009.\nOn 14 May, more than 20,000 people packed Anfield for a match held in memory of the victims. The Liverpool Legends, comprising ex-Liverpool footballers beat the All Stars, captained by actor Ricky Tomlinson, 3\u20131. The event also raised cash for the Marina Dalglish Appeal which was contributed towards a radiotherapy centre at University Hospital in Aintree.\nWith the imminent release of police documents relating to events on 15 April 1989, the Hillsborough Family Support Group launched Project 96, a fundraising initiative on 1 August 2009. At least 96 current and former Liverpool footballers are being lined up to raise \u00a396,000 by auctioning a limited edition (of 96) signed photographs.\nOn 11 April 2009, Liverpool fans sang \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" as a tribute to the upcoming anniversary of the disaster before the home game against Blackburn Rovers (which ended in Liverpool winning 4\u20130) and was followed by former Liverpool player, Stephen Warnock presenting a memorial wreath to the Kop showing the figure \" 96 \" in red flowers.\nOther tributes.\nThe Hillsborough disaster touched not only Liverpool, but football clubs in England and around the world. Supporters of Everton, Liverpool's traditional local rivals, were affected, many of them having lost friends and family. Supporters laid down flowers and blue and white scarves to show respect for the dead and unity with fellow Merseysiders.\nOn 19 April 1989, four days after the disaster, the second leg of the European Cup semi-final tie between AC Milan and Real Madrid was played. The referee blew his whistle two minutes into the game to stop play and a minute's silence was held for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough. Halfway through the minute's silence, the Milan fans sang Liverpool's \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" as a sign of respect. In April 1989, Bradford City and Lincoln City held a friendly match to benefit the victims of Hillsborough. The occasion was the first in which the two teams had met since the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire that had claimed 56 lives at Valley Parade.\nOn 30 April 1989, a friendly match organised by Celtic F.C. was played at Celtic Park, Glasgow, between the home club and Liverpool. This game was Liverpool's first appearance on the football field since the disaster two weeks earlier. The crowd numbered more than 60,000, including around 6,000 Liverpool fans, and all the match proceeds went to the Hillsborough appeal fund. Liverpool won the match by four goals to nil.\nAs a result of the disaster, Liverpool's scheduled match against Arsenal was delayed from 23 April until the end of the season, and the game eventually decided the league title. At the rescheduled fixture, Arsenal players brought flowers onto the pitch and presented them to the Liverpool fans around the stadium before the game commenced.\nDuring a 2011 debate in the House of Commons, the Labour MP for Liverpool Walton, Steve Rotheram, read out a list of the victims and, as a result, the names were recorded in the \"Hansard\" transcripts.\nIn December 2021, Liverpool City Council nominated Andrew Devine posthumously for the freedom of the city of Liverpool, a tribute given to the original 96 victims in 2016.\nControversies.\nMedia portrayal.\nInitial media coverage \u2013 spurred by what Phil Scraton calls in \"Hillsborough: The Truth\" \"the Heysel factor\" and \"hooligan hysteria\" \u2013 began to shift the blame onto the behaviour of the Liverpool fans at the stadium, making it a public order issue. As well as \"The Sun\"'s 19 April 1989 \"The Truth\" article (see below) other newspapers published similar allegations; the \"Daily Star\" headline on the same day reported \"Dead fans robbed by drunk thugs\"; the \"Daily Mail\" accused the Liverpool fans of being \"drunk and violent and their actions were vile\", and \"The Daily Express\" ran a story alleging that \"Police saw 'sick spectacle of pilfering from the dying'.\" Peter McKay in the \"Evening Standard\" wrote that the \"catastrophe was caused first and foremost by violent enthusiasm for soccer and in this case the tribal passions of Liverpool supporters [who] literally killed themselves and others to be at the game\" and published a front-page headline \"Police attack 'vile' fans\" on 18 April 1989, in which police sources blamed the behaviour of a section of Liverpool fans for the disaster.\nIn Liverpool local journalist John Williams of the \"Liverpool Daily Post\" wrote in an article titled \"I Blame the Yobs\" that \"The gatecrashers wreaked their fatal havoc ... Their uncontrolled fanaticism and mass hysteria ... literally squeezed the life out of men, women and children ... yobbism at its most base ... Scouse killed Scouse for no better reason than 22 men were kicking a ball\".\nIn other regional newspapers, the \"Manchester Evening News\" wrote that the \"Anfield Army charged on to the terrace behind the goal \u2013 many without tickets\", and the \"Yorkshire Post\" wrote that the \"trampling crush\" had been started by \"thousands of fans\" who were \"latecomers ... forc[ing] their way into the ground\". The \"Sheffield Star\" published similar allegations to \"The Sun\", running the headline \"Fans in Drunken Attacks on Police\".\nMany of the more serious allegations \u2013 such as stealing from the dead and assault of police officers and rescue workers \u2013 appeared on 18 April, although several evening newspapers published on 15 April 1989 also gave inaccurate reporting of the disaster, as these newspapers went to press before the full extent or circumstances of the disaster had been confirmed or even reported. This included the Wolverhampton-based \"Express &amp; Star\", which reported that the match had been cancelled as a result of a \"pitch invasion in which many fans were injured\". This article was presumably published before there were any reports that people had been killed. These media reports and others were examined during the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel report.\n\"The Sun\".\nOn 19 April, four days after the disaster, Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of \"The Sun\", ordered \"The Truth\" as the front-page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: \"Some fans picked pockets of victims\", \"Some fans urinated on the brave cops\" and \"Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life\". Mackenzie reportedly spent two hours deciding on which headline to run; his original instinct being for \"You Scum\" before eventually deciding on \"The Truth\".\nThe information was provided to the newspaper by \"Whites Press Agency\",&lt;ref name=\"gov.uk/co/04601475\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"thejournal/593040\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"theguardian/patnick-dies\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a news agency in Sheffield; the newspaper cited claims by police inspector Gordon Sykes, that Liverpool fans had pickpocketed the dead, as well as other claims by unnamed police officers and local Conservative MP Irvine Patnick. \"The Daily Express\" also carried Patnick's version, under the headline \"Police Accuse Drunken Fans\" which gave Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the \"mayhem caused by drunks\" and that policemen told him they were \"hampered, harassed, punched and kicked\".\nThe story accompanying \"The Sun\" headlines claimed \"drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims\" and \"police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon\". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a partially unclothed dead girl had been verbally abused, and that Liverpool fans were \"openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead\". In fact many Liverpool fans helped security personnel stretcher away victims and gave first aid to the injured. \"The Guardian\" later wrote that \"The claim that supporters higher up the Leppings Lane terrace had urinated on police pulling bodies out of the crush appeared to have roots in the fact that those who were dying or sustaining serious injuries suffered compression asphyxia and many involuntarily urinated, vomited and emptied their bowels as they were crushed.\"\nIn their history of \"The Sun\", Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed \u2013 \"looking like rabbits in the headlights\" \u2013 as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it \u2013 they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.\nMacKenzie maintained for years that his \"only mistake was to believe a Tory MP\". In 1993, he told a House of Commons committee, \"I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said\", but privately said at a 2006 dinner that he had only apologised under the instruction of Rupert Murdoch, believing: \"all I did wrong was tell the truth ... I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now\". On \"Question Time\" the next year, MacKenzie publicly repeated the claims he said at the dinner; he said that he believed some of the material they published in \"The Sun\" but was not sure about all of it.\nWidespread boycotts of the newspaper throughout Merseyside followed immediately and continue to this day. Boycotts include both customers refusing to purchase it, and retailers refusing to stock it. The \"Financial Times\" reported in 2019 that Merseyside sales were estimated to drop from 55,000 per day to 12,000 per day, an 80% decrease. Chris Horrie estimated in 2014 that the tabloid's owners had lost \u00a315million per month since the disaster, in 1989 prices. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales nationally.\nIn 2004, after Wayne Rooney gave exclusive interviews to \"The Sun\", causing backlash in Liverpool, \"The Sun\" ran a front-page story apologising for \"the most terrible mistake in its history\", saying \"We long ago apologised publicly... We gladly say sorry again today: fully, openly, honestly and without reservation\". It said criticism of Rooney was wrong and co-ordinated by the \"Liverpool Echo\" and \"Liverpool Post\". The \"Liverpool Echo\" condemned the apology as \"cynical and shameless\". In 2012, under the headline \"The Real Truth\", \"The Sun\" made a front-page apology, saying \"we are profoundly sorry for false reports\". The editor at the time, Dominic Mohan, wrote: \"We published an inaccurate and offensive story about the events at Hillsborough. We said it was the truth \u2013 it wasn't... for that we're deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry\". Following the second inquest in 2016, \"The Sun\"'s eighth and ninth pages carried images of the 96 victims and an editorial which apologised \"unreservedly\", saying \"the police smeared [supporters] with a pack of lies which in 1989 the Sun and other media swallowed whole\". A lengthier apology was published online.\nJames Murdoch made a full apology for \"The Sun\"'s coverage when he appeared at a hearing of the House of Commons Select committee dealing with the News International phone hacking scandal in 2012.\nOn 12 September 2012, after the publication of the report exonerating the Liverpool fans, MacKenzie issued the following statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield, in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. As the prime minister has made clear, these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves. It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth. I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.\nIn response, Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected MacKenzie's apology as \"too little, too late\", calling him \"lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife\". A press conference held by families of the victims also banned all \"Sun\" reporters from entering, with a sign on the door reading \"NO ENTRY TO SUN JOURNALISTS\".\nFollowing the April 2016 verdict of unlawful killing, \"The Sun\" and the first print edition of the \"Times\" (both owned by News International), did not cover the stories on their front pages, with \"The Sun\" relegating the story to pages 8 and 9. An apology appeared on page 10, reiterating previous statements that the 1989 headline had been an error of judgement.\nThe coverage was widely condemned on social media, with Twitter users saying that this reflected \"Murdoch's view on Hillsborough\", which was a \"smear\", which \"now daren't speak its name\". On the night of the verdict coverage, more than 124,000 tweets used the term \"The Sun\".\nHowever, on Sky News, \"The Sun\"'s Political Editor Tom Newton Dunn defended this decision, saying: \"I don't think it should all be about \"The Sun\" \u2013 it was not us who committed Hillsborough.\" Trevor Kavanagh, the political editor at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, said that he was \"not sorry at all\" about the reporting and supported his former boss Kelvin MacKenzie, stating that \"we were clearly misled about the events and the authorities, including the police, actively concealed the truth\".\nIn February 2017, Liverpool F.C. issued a ban on \"The Sun\" journalists from entering their grounds in response to the coverage of Hillsborough by the newspaper. Everton F.C. followed in April 2017 on the eve of the 28th anniversary of the disaster after a column by Kelvin MacKenzie concerning Everton footballer Ross Barkley. MacKenzie was suspended as a contributor to the newspaper.\n\"The Times\".\nThe journalist Edward Pearce was criticised for writing a controversial article in the aftermath of the disaster, at a time when a number of victims' funerals were taking place. His column in \"The Sunday Times\" on 23 April 1989, included the text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the second time in half a decade a large body of Liverpool supporters has killed people ... the shrine in the Anfield goalmouth, the cursing of the police, all the theatricals, come sweetly to a city which is already the world capital of self-pity. There are soapy politicians to make a pet of Liverpool, and Liverpool itself is always standing by to make a pet of itself. 'Why us? Why are we treated like animals?' To which the plain answer is that a good and sufficient minority of you behave like animals.\nPearce went on to reflect that if South Yorkshire Police bore any responsibility, it was \"for not realising what brutes they had to handle.\"\nPhil Scraton described Pearce's comments as amongst the \"most bigoted and factually inaccurate\" published in the wake of the disaster. A number of complaints were made to the Press Council concerning the article, but the Council ruled that it was unable to adjudicate on comment pieces, though the Council noted that tragedy or disaster is not an occasion for writers to exercise gratuitous provocation.\nOn 27 April 2016, \"Times\" staffers in the sports department expressed their outrage over the paper's decision to cover 26 April inquest, which ruled that the 96 dead were unlawfully killed, only on an inside spread and the sports pages, with some in the newspaper claiming there was a \"mutiny\" in the sports department. The \"Times\" later tweeted that \"We made a mistake with the front page of our first edition, and we fixed it for our second edition.\"\nThe \"Times\" was the only major UK newspaper not to give the story front-page coverage other than fellow News UK-owned \"Sun\". Gary Lineker described the incident as \"disgusting as it is unsurprising\", and David Walsh, chief sports writer at the \"Sunday Times\", said it was a \"shocking misjudgment\" to not include this story on the front page. However, insiders dismissed any suggestion that a visit by News UK owner Rupert Murdoch to the \"Times\" newsroom on the day of the verdict had anything to do with the editorial decision.\n\"FHM Australia\".\nThe November 2002 edition of the men's lifestyle magazine \"FHM\" in Australia was withdrawn from sale soon after its publication, and a public apology made in the Australian and British editions, because it contained jokes mocking the disaster. As a result, Emap Australia, who owned \"FHM\" at the time, pledged to make a donation to the families of the victims. Although the original apology was not printed in the magazine as it was not considered \"serious enough\", its Australian editor, Geoff Campbell, released a statement: \"We deeply regret the photograph captions published in the November issue of the Australian edition of \"FHM\", accompanying an article about the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. The right course of action is to withdraw this edition from sale \u2013 which we will be doing. We have been in contact with the Hillsborough Family Support Group and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign to express our deep regret and sincere apologies.\" The British edition disassociated itself from the controversy, stating: \"\"FHM\" Australia has its own editorial team and these captions were written and published without consultation with the UK edition, or any other edition of \"FHM\".\"\nThe vice-chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said he wanted all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, \"I am going to write to every fanzine in the country \u2013 including Liverpool F.C.'s \u2013 telling them to ban \"FHM.\" People are very upset by it. I think there will be a real boycott.\" He added it would be like making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 88 Australians were killed.\n\"The Spectator\".\n\"The Spectator\" was criticised for an editorial which appeared in the magazine on 16 October 2004 following the death of British hostage Kenneth John \"Ken\" Bigley in Iraq, in which it was claimed that the response to Bigley's killing was fuelled by the fact he was from Liverpool, and went on to criticise the \"drunken\" fans at Hillsborough and call on them to accept responsibility for their \"role\" in the disaster:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The extreme reaction to Mr Bigley's murder is fed by the fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune \u2013 its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union \u2013 and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the \"Sun\" newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.\nAlthough the editor Boris Johnson did not write this piece, journalist Simon Heffer said he had written the first draft of the article at Johnson's request. Johnson apologised at the time of the article, travelling to Liverpool to do so, and again following the publication of the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; Johnson's apology was rejected by Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose son James, 18, died in the disaster:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What he has got to understand is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.\nThe \"Spectator\"'s comments were widely circulated following the April 2016 verdict by the Hillsborough inquest's second hearing proving unlawful killing of the 96 dead at Hillsborough.\n\"EastEnders\".\nIn November 2007, the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" caused controversy when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made a reference to the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: \"Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then what did we end up with? Hillsborough.\" This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.\nCharles Itandje.\nLiverpool goalkeeper Charles Itandje was accused of having shown disrespect towards the Hillsborough victims during the 2009 remembrance ceremony, as he was spotted on camera \"smiling and nudging\" teammate Damien Plessis. He was suspended from the club for a fortnight and many fans felt he should not play for the club again. He was omitted from the first team squad and never played for the club in any capacity again.\nJeremy Hunt.\nOn 28 June 2010, following England's departure from the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying \"I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems that we had in Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us.\" He later apologised and said \"I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence.\" Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.\nFans' chants.\nFans of rival clubs have been known to chant about the Hillsborough disaster at football matches, in order to upset Liverpool fans. Following the findings of the Independent Panel in September 2012, Alex Ferguson and two Manchester United fan groups called for an end to the \"sick chants\". Leeds United chairman Ken Bates endorsed this call in the club programme and stated, \"Leeds have suffered at times with reference to Galatasaray; some of our so-called fans have also been guilty as well, particularly in relation to Munich.\" \"Munich\" is a reference to the deaths of eight Manchester United players in the Munich air disaster of 1958.\nOliver Popplewell.\nIn October 2011, Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had chaired the public inquiry into the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire at Valley Parade that killed 56 people, called on the families of the Hillsborough victims to look at the \"quiet dignity and great courage relatives in the West Yorkshire city had shown in the years following the tragedy\". He said of the Bradford families: \"They did not harbour conspiracy theories. They did not seek endless further inquiries. They buried their dead, comforted the bereaved and succoured the injured. They organised a sensible compensation scheme and moved on. Is there, perhaps, a lesson there for the Hillsborough campaigners?\"\nPopplewell was criticised for the comments, including a rebuke from a survivor of the Bradford fire. Labour MP Steve Rotheram, commented: \"How insensitive does somebody have to be to write that load of drivel?\"\nDavid Crompton.\nIn 2013, a formal complaint was made against David Crompton, South Yorkshire's chief constable, over internal emails relating to the Hillsborough disaster. On 8 September 2012, just four days before the Hillsborough Independent Panel Report was published, Crompton had emailed the force's assistant chief constable Andy Holt and head of media Mark Thompson. In the email, which came to light as the result of a Freedom of Information request, Crompton had said that the families' \"version of certain events has become 'the truth' even though it isn't\". South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright appointed chief constable Simon Parr of Cambridgeshire Constabulary to head an investigation into the matter. Wright said: \"The request has been submitted by a firm of solicitors in Liverpool acting on behalf of a number of individuals affected by the event.\"\nIn March 2016, Crompton announced that he would retire in November. On 26 April 2016, after the inquest jury delivered a verdict affirming all the charges against the police, Crompton \"unequivocally accepted\" the verdicts, including unlawful killing, said that the police operation at the stadium on the day of the disaster had been \"catastrophically wrong\", and apologised unreservedly. Following continued criticism of Crompton in the wake of the unlawful killing verdict, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Alan Billings suspended Crompton from duty on 27 April 2016.\nCivil servant.\nIn June 2014, an unnamed 24-year-old British civil servant was sacked for posting offensive comments about the disaster on Wikipedia.\nSteven Cohen.\nIn 2009, nearly twenty years to the day after the disaster, Steven Cohen, a presenter on Fox Soccer Channel and Sirius satellite radio in the United States (an Englishman and Chelsea fan), stated on his radio show that Liverpool fans \"without tickets\" were the \"root cause\" and \"perpetrators\" of the disaster. A boycott of advertisers by American Liverpool fans eventually brought about an apology from him. Despite this he was replaced as presenter of Fox Football Fone-in. His actions were disowned by Chelsea Football Club and he no longer works as a broadcaster.\nBernard Ingham.\nIn 1996, Sir Bernard Ingham, former press secretary to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, caused controversy with his comments about the disaster. In a letter addressed to a victim's parent, Ingham wrote that the disaster was caused by \"tanked up yobs\". In another letter written to a Liverpool supporter, also written in 1996, Ingham remarked that people should \"shut up about Hillsborough\". On the day of the inquest verdict, Ingham refused to apologise or respond to the previous comments he made, telling a reporter, \"I have nothing to say.\" There have since been calls to have Ingham stripped of his knighthood.\nTopman.\nIn March 2018, British clothing retailer Topman marketed a T-shirt which was interpreted by members of the public, including relatives of Hillsborough victims, as mocking the disaster. The T-shirt was red with white details like a Liverpool shirt, and had the number 96 on the back like a football shirt, with the text \"Karma\" and \"What goes around comes back around\", and a white rose, as associated with Yorkshire. Topman stated that the T-shirt was in reference to a Bob Marley song re-released in 1996 and apologised and withdrew the item.\nRadio, television and theatre.\n1989: \"After Dark\" (TV discussion programme).\nOn 20 May 1989, five weeks after the disaster, Channel 4's \"After Dark\" programme broadcast an extended live discussion called \"Football \u2013 The Final Whistle?\". Among the guests were bereaved father James Delaney and his wife Eileen, who said \"they didn't give the poor people who were killed any dignity ... I bent down to kiss and talk to [my son] and as we stood up there was a policeman who came from behind me ... trying to usher myself and my husband out ... I had to scream at the police officer to allow us privacy ... the total attitude was, you've identified number 33 so go!\"\nFurther extracts from what Eileen Delaney said on the programme can be found on the Hillsborough Justice Campaign website and in Phil Scraton's book \"Hillsborough: The Truth\".\n1994: \"The Cook Report\".\nIn 1994 Roger Cook led an investigation into the Hillsborough disaster in Series 9, Episode 3 of The Cook Report entitled \"Kevin's Mum\".\n1996: \"Hillsborough\" (TV drama).\nA television drama, based on the disaster and subsequent events, titled simply \"Hillsborough\", was produced by Granada Television in 1996. It won the BAFTA Award for Best Single Drama in 1997. The cast included Christopher Eccleston, Annabelle Apsion, Ricky Tomlinson and Mark Womack. The film was aired for the first time in 1996, and has been shown four times since then: in 1998, in 2009, in September 2012 (shortly after the release of the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel), and again on 1 May 2016 on ITV.\n2009: \"The Reunion\" (Radio discussion programme).\nOn the 20th anniversary of the disaster, BBC Radio 4 produced an episode of their series \"The Reunion\" on the subject of Hillsborough. Sue MacGregor brought together a group of people who were involved in the disaster to talk about the events of that day at a time when they were still in the midst of their fight for justice. The programme was repeated on 1 May 2016, at the end of the week in which the Hillsborough inquest ruled that the 96 Liverpool football fans died unlawfully.\n2014: \"Hillsborough\" (TV documentary).\nThe American sports network ESPN produced the documentary \"Hillsborough\" as part of its \"30 for 30\" series of sports films (under a new \"Soccer Stories\" subdivision). Directed by Daniel Gordon and co-produced with the BBC, the two-hour film chronicles the disaster, the investigations, and their lingering effects; it also includes interviews with survivors, victims' relatives, police officers and investigators. \"Hillsborough\" first aired in the US on 15 April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the disaster.\nAs the documentary included previously unreleased security camera footage from the stadium on the day of the disaster, it could not be shown in the UK upon initial release due to the 2012 High Court inquest still being in progress. After the inquest verdict, the BBC aired the documentary on 8May 2016, with additional footage from the inquest, as well as its final verdict.\n2022: \"Anne\" (TV drama).\n\"Anne\" is a four-part docudrama about Anne Williams' campaign to reveal the truth about her son's death, which aired on ITV in January 2022. Williams was portrayed by Maxine Peake, whose performance was described in \"The Guardian\" as \"almost unwatchably intense\".\nStage plays.\nTwo British stage plays also dealt with the disaster with different view points:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dick\nFlow My Tears, the Policeman Said is a 1974 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. The novel is set in a futuristic dystopia where the United States has become a police state in the aftermath of a Second American Civil War. The story follows genetically enhanced pop singer and television star Jason Taverner who wakes up in a world where he has never existed.\nThe book was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1974 and a Hugo Award in 1975, and was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1975.\nPlot.\nThe novel is set in a dystopian version of 1988, following a Second Civil War which led to the collapse of the United States' democratic institutions. The National Guard (\"nats\") and US police force (\"pols\") reestablished social order through instituting a dictatorship, with a \"Director\" at the apex, and police marshals and generals as operational commanders in the field. Resistance to the regime is largely confined to university campuses, where radicalized former university students eke out a desperate existence in subterranean kibbutzim. Recreational drug use is widespread, and the age of consent has been lowered to 12. The black population has almost been rendered extinct. Most commuting is undertaken by personal aircraft, allowing great distances to be covered in little time.\nThe novel begins with the protagonist, Jason Taverner, a singer, hosting his weekly TV show which has an audience of 30 million viewers. His special guest is his girlfriend Heather Hart, also a singer. Both Hart and Taverner are \"Sixes\", members of an elite class of genetically engineered humans. While leaving the studio, Taverner is telephoned by a former lover, who asks him to pay her a visit. When Taverner arrives at her apartment, the former lover attacks him by throwing a parasitic life-form at him. Although he manages to remove most of the life-form, parts of it are left inside him. After being rescued by Hart, he is taken to a medical facility.\nWaking up the following day in a seedy hotel with no identification, Taverner becomes worried, as failure to produce identification at one of the numerous police checkpoints would lead to imprisonment in a forced labor camp. Through a succession of phone calls made from the hotel to colleagues and friends who now claim not to know him, Taverner establishes that he is no longer recognized by the outside world. He soon manages to bribe the hotel's clerk into taking him to Kathy Nelson, a forger of government documents. However, Kathy reveals that both she and the clerk are police informants, and that the lobby clerk has placed a microscopic tracking device on him. She promises not to turn Taverner over to the police on the condition that he spend the night with her. Although he attempts to escape, Kathy confronts him again after he successfully passes a police checkpoint using the forged identity cards. Feeling in her debt, he accompanies Kathy to her apartment block, where Inspector McNulty, Kathy's police handler, is waiting. McNulty has located Taverner via the tracking device the hotel lobby clerk placed on him, and instructs Taverner to come with him to the 469th Precinct police station so that further biometric identity checks can be performed.\nAt the station, McNulty erroneously reports the man's name as Jason Tavern, revealing the identity of a Wyoming diesel engine mechanic. During questioning, Taverner goes along with McNulty's mistake, explaining that he no longer resembles Tavern due to extensive plastic surgery. McNulty accepts this explanation and decides to release Taverner while lab checks are run on the rest of the documents. He issues Taverner a seven-day police pass to ensure he can pass police checkpoints in the interim period. Deciding to lie low, Taverner heads to a Las Vegas bar in the hopes of meeting a woman with whom he can stay. Instead, he encounters a former lover, Ruth Gomen; although she no longer recognizes him, he succeeds in his bid to seduce her and is taken back to her apartment. On the orders of Police General Felix Buckman, Gomen's apartment is raided and Taverner is taken into custody, being transported immediately to the Police Academy in Los Angeles.\nBuckman personally interrogates Taverner, soon reaching the conclusion that Taverner genuinely does not know why he no longer appears to exist. However, he suspects that Taverner may be part of a larger plot involving the Sixes. He orders Taverner released, although ensuring that tracking devices are again placed on him. Outside the police academy, Taverner is approached by Alys Buckman, Felix's hypersexual sister and lover. Alys removes the tracking devices from Taverner and invites him to the home she shares with her brother. On the way there, she tells Taverner that she knows he is a TV star and reveals copies of his records.\nAt the Buckmans' home, Taverner takes Alys up on an offer of mescaline. When he has a bad reaction to the drug, Alys goes to find him a medicine to counteract it. When she does not return, Taverner goes to search for her, only to find her skeletal remains on the bathroom floor. Frightened and confused, he flees, unsuccessfully pursued by a private security guard. To aid in his escape, he asks for the help of Mary Anne Dominic, a potter. Heading to a cafe with her, they find that one of his records is on the jukebox. When his song plays, people begin to recognize him as a celebrity. After parting with Dominic, Taverner goes to the apartment of his celebrity girlfriend Heather Hart. She returns home, horrified, and shows Taverner a newspaper mentioning that he is wanted in connection with Alys Buckman's death, the motive believed to have been his jealousy over Alys' purported relationship with Hart.\nAn autopsy reveals that Alys' death was caused by an experimental reality-warping drug called KR-3. The coroner explains to Felix that, as Alys was a fan of Taverner, her use of the drug caused Taverner to be transported to a parallel universe where he no longer existed. Her death then caused his return to his own universe. The Police General decides to implicate Taverner in Alys' death to distract attention from his incest. The press are informed that Taverner is a suspect in the case and, wishing to clear his name, Taverner surrenders himself to the police. Heartbroken over the death of his sister, Felix returns home, suffering a nervous breakdown on the way.\nIn an epilogue, the final fates of the main characters are disclosed. Buckman retires to Borneo where he is assassinated soon after writing an expos\u00e9 of the global police apparatus. Taverner is cleared of all charges and dies of old age, while Heather Hart abandons her celebrity career and becomes a recluse. Dominic's pottery wins an international award and her works become of great value while she lives into her eighties. KR-3 test trials are deemed too destructive and the project is abandoned. Ultimately, the revolutionary students give up and voluntarily enter forced-labor camps. The detention camps later dwindle away and close down, the government no longer posing a threat.\nReception.\n\"New York Times\" reviewer Gerald Jonas praised the novel, saying that \"Dick skillfully explores the psychological ramifications of this nightmare,\" but concludes that the story's concluding rationalization of its events is an artistic \"miscalculation [and] a major flaw in an otherwise superb novel.\"\nTitle.\nThe title is a reference to \"Flow, my tears\", an ayre by the 16th century composer John Dowland, setting to music a poem by an anonymous author (possibly Dowland himself). Quotations from the piece begin every major section of the novel, and Dowland's work is referenced in several of Dick's works. The poem begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe novel is parodied as \"The Android Cried Me a River\" in Dick's later novel \"VALIS\".\nAuthor's interpretation.\nIn his undelivered speech \"How to Build a Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later,\" Dick recounts how in describing an incident at the end of the book (end of chapter 27) to an Episcopalian priest, the priest noted its striking similarity to a scene in the Acts of the Apostles in the Bible. In Dick's book, the police chief, Felix Buckman, meets a black stranger at an all-night gas station, and uncharacteristically makes an emotional connection with him. After handing the stranger a drawing of a heart pierced by an arrow, Buckman flies away, but he quickly returns and hugs the stranger, and they strike up a friendly conversation. In Acts Chapter 8, the disciple Philip meets an Ethiopian eunuch (a black man) sitting in a chariot, to whom he explains a passage from the Book of Isaiah, and then converts him to Christianity.\nDick further notes that eight years after writing the book, he himself uncharacteristically came to the aid of a black stranger who had run out of gas. After giving the man some money and then driving away, he returned to help the man reach a gas station. Dick was then struck by the similarity between this incident and that described in his book.\nDick also recounts an unusual dream he had when writing the book, and how he felt compelled to get it into the text of the novel. Years later, he came to interpret this dream as the key to understanding the real meaning of the story, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Deciphered, my novel tells a quite different story from the surface story (\u2026). The real story is simply this: the return of Christ, now king rather than suffering servant. Judge rather than victim of unfair judgment. Everything is reversed. The core message of my novel, without my knowing it, was a warning to the powerful: You will shortly be judged and condemned.\nAdaptations.\nStage.\nMabou Mines presented the world premiere of a theatrical adaptation of \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\" at the Boston Shakespeare Theatre from June 18\u201330, 1985. The play received mixed reviews but was widely covered by the Boston media. Linda Hartinian, a personal friend of Dick, adapted the novel to the stage and designed the set, in addition to portraying Mary Ann Dominic and reading Dick's 1981 \"Tagore Letter\" at the end of the play.\nThe \"Boston Phoenix\" quotes Hartinian on the subject in an interview before the play opened: \"[Dick] was someone I admired and looked up to, and I knew he had always wanted one of his works to be adapted. One day when I came to visit him he jumped up and grabbed this manuscript and said 'I want to give you something, but I don't have anything, so I'm going to give you this manuscript, and someday its gonna be worth a lot of money.'\" The \"Phoenix\" continues, \"It was a draft of \"Flow My Tears\", and as Hartinian discovered when she sat down to adapt the book, it contained many passages that had been cut from the published text, including a discussion of ways to remember deceased writers that was to prove prescient. Naturally Hartinian based her script on her private edition.\"\nThe play was directed by Bill Raymond, Hartinian's husband. \"It was in response to Linda's loss that we chose \"Tears\",\" he told the Phoenix, \"because \"Flow My Tears\" is in fact a novel about grief, and not necessarily just about loss of identity.\"\nThe play has been performed by Mabou Mines in Boston and New York City, and by the Prop Theatre in Chicago, and the https:// in Los Angeles. The Evidence Room production received positive reviews including one from the Los Angeles Times which stated that \"the piece is vintage Dick, fluctuating between the inventive and the paranoiac.\"\nFilm.\nOn February 1, 2004, \"Variety\" announced that Utopia Pictures &amp; Television had acquired the rights to produce adaptations of three of Dick's novels: \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\", \"VALIS\" and \"Radio Free Albemuth\". In 2007, The Halcyon Company acquired the first-look rights to Dick's works, and in May 2009 they announced that after \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009), they would next adapt \"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\".\nThe book is referenced in the 2001 film \" Waking Life\" and in Richard Kelly's 2006 film \"Southland Tales\", in which an underground revolutionary dressed as a police officer (played by Jon Lovitz) says, \"Flow my tears\" as he shoots two rivals. Also, two of the main characters are Roland and Ronald Taverner.\nMusic.\nGary Numan referenced the novel in the 1978 song \"Listen to the Sirens\" from the debut Tubeway Army album. The song opens with the lyric, \"\"Flow My Tears\", the new police song\".\"\nThe Human League utilised a character named Jason Taverner as the host of their elusive 1979 demo tape, which has since become known by fans as the \"Taverner Tape\". Taverner introduces each of the songs and mentions that he hosts his own network TV show.\nAmerican grindcore band Discordance Axis, released a song by the same name on their 1997 album \"Jouhou\". Discordance Axis were influenced by cyberpunk and science fiction.\nAvant-Pop collective MMC Ensemble, references the novel on their first release, \"Twin Lovers\" within the songs \"Montgomery L. Hopkins\", \"Jason Taverner Does Not Exist\", \"Sixes\", \"Watts Proper\", and \"Twin Lovers\".\nThe American indie rock band Built to Spill released a song, \"Nowhere Nothin' Fuckup\" on their 1993 album \"Ultimate Alternative Wavers\". The song on the album has the same name as protagonist Jason Taverner's hit played repeatedly on the jukebox by character Anne Dominic in the coffee shop in the novel.\nAmerican bass guitar player Stu Hamm released a Philip K. Dick themed solo album in 1998 titled Radio Free Albemuth featuring the song \"Flow My Tears\".\nSee also.\nThe movie The Moustache explores similar themes and plot twists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fetish models do not necessarily work exclusively in that form of modeling.\nFetish models often wear fetish fashion, an extreme and provocative style of clothing designed to elicit a strong emotional reaction or sexual desire on the part of the observer. Such clothing ranges from exotic stylized bathing suits to body armor and sci-fi fantasy suits.\nBondage models appear in various forms of bondage. Other fetish modeling may involve body modification, appearing in fetish photography or exotic glamour photography, or wearing sexual fantasy costumes that fulfil a uniform fetish (e.g. French maid, nurse, etc.). As well as modelling for photography, fetish models also make public appearances at events such as BDSM fairs and parties.\nSome pornographic actors and glamour models also work as fetish models.\nTypes of fetish models.\nFetish modelling covers a wide range of fetishes, including those involving bondage and ', latex and PVC, corsets, tattoos, body piercings, shoe fetishism, food fetishism and '. Fetishes may also involve body parts, such as breast fetishism, navel fetishism and foot fetishism.\nFetish models are usually considered to work in a different category from Gothic fashion models or alternative models, whose work is generally far more niche-specific. Fetish modelling is usually considered to be a part of the sex industry due to the popular perception that it has a solely adult audience. However, in recent times, many aspects of the fetish fashion market have been incorporated and accepted into mainstream fashion, with fashion creators using exotic materials such as latex or sheer fabric instead of cotton or wool for their creations. Some fetish models only involve themselves in the aesthetic aspects of the work rather than involving themselves directly with sex and sexuality.\nPopular culture.\nThere have been several notable performers and producers of both the bondage and fetish area who have attained mainstream notability. The most recognized is the 1950s bondage model and pin-up girl, Bettie Page, who posed for photographer Irving Klaw for mail-order photographs and was subsequently featured in \"Playboy\". She was the first famous bondage model.\nIn the 1960s, the popular British TV program \"The Avengers\" included several fetish costume elements worn by its female lead performers. This began with Honor Blackman and included Diana Rigg's leather catsuits and leotards, as well as Tara King's use of thigh-length boots and leather evening gloves.\nThe neo-burlesque performer Dita Von Teese started her career as a fetish model and stripper. Other notable fetish models include the Russian-American performer Mosh and the Canadian photographic model Bianca Beauchamp.\nMarkets.\nThere are specialized fetish magazines that feature and promote fetish models, including \"Skin Two\", \"Secret\", Italian \"A Magazine\" (not to be confused with the now defunct \"A(sian) Magazine\"), and \"Marquis\".\nFetish models may run personal adult pay websites and are featured on fetish adult pay sites.\nThere are also fetish fashion designers. Most of these designers employ fetish models for their clothing line. Fetish fashion shows are hosted several times a year, including Vex, The Baroness, Skintwo, and House of Harlot.\nAwards.\nThe SIGNY awards were awarded each year between 2000 and 2005 (except 2002) to the bondage models voted as the best of that year.

(formerly WorldCom and MCI WorldCom) was a telecommunications company. For a time, it was the second-largest long-distance telephone company in the United States, after AT&amp;T. WorldCom grew largely by acquiring other telecommunications companies, including MCI Communications in 1998, and filed for bankruptcy in 2002 after an accounting scandal, in which several executives, including CEO Bernard Ebbers, were convicted of a scheme to inflate the company's assets. In January 2006, the company, by then renamed MCI, was acquired by Verizon Communications and was later integrated into Verizon Business.\nWorldCom was originally headquartered in Clinton, Mississippi, before moving to Ashburn, Virginia, when it changed its name to MCI.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nIn 1983, in a coffee shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Bernard Ebbers and three other investors formed Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. based in Jackson, Mississippi, and in 1985, Ebbers was named chief executive officer.\nThe company acquired more than 60 telecommunications firms, and in 1995, it changed its name to WorldCom.\nIn 1989, it merged with Advantage Companies Inc. In 1995, it was renamed LDDS WorldCom and moved to Clinton, Mississippi.\nThe company grew rapidly in the 1990s through mergers and acquisitions.\nWorldCom's first major acquisition was in 1992. It outbid larger rivals Sprint Corporation and AT&amp;T to secure the $720 million acquisition of Advanced Telecommunications Corporation. The deal made WorldCom a substantially larger player in the telecoms market.\nOther acquisitions followed: Metromedia Communication Corp. and Resurgens Communications Group (1993), IDB Communications Group, Inc (1994), Williams Technology Group, Inc. (1995), and MFS Communications Company (1996)\u2014the last of which brought along MFS' newly acquired UUNET Technologies, Inc.\nMCI acquisition.\nOn November 4, 1997, WorldCom and MCI Communications announced a $37 billion merger to form MCI WorldCom, making it the largest corporate merger in U.S. history. MCI divested its \"internetMCI\" business to gain approval from the United States Department of Justice. On September 15, 1998, the merger was consummated, forming MCI WorldCom.\nIn February 1998, WorldCom acquired CompuServe from H&amp;R Block. Retaining the CompuServe Network Services Division, WorldCom traded its online service to America Online for AOL's network division, ANS. In June 2001, WorldCom acquired the corporate parent of Digex, Intermedia Communications, and then sold all of Intermedia's non-Digex assets to Allegiance Telecom.\nProposed Sprint merger.\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint Corporation and MCI WorldCom announced plans for a $129 billion merger. Had the deal been completed, it would have been the largest corporate merger in history, creating a merged company that would have surpassed AT&amp;T as the largest communications company in the United States. But the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Union were concerned that the deal would create a monopoly. On July 13, 2000, the boards of directors of both companies terminated the merger. Later that year, MCI WorldCom renamed itself back into \"WorldCom\".\nAccounting scandals.\nBetween September 2000 and April 2002, the board of directors of WorldCom authorized several loans and loan guarantees to CEO Bernard Ebbers so that he would not have to sell his WorldCom shares to meet margin calls as the share price plummeted during the bursting of the dot-com bubble. By April 2002, the board had lost patience with these loans. Directors also believed that Ebbers did not seem to have a coherent strategy after the Sprint merger collapsed. On April 26, the board voted to ask for Ebbers' resignation. Ebbers formally resigned on April 30, 2002 and was replaced by John W. Sidgmore, former CEO of UUNET. As part of his departure, Ebbers's loans were consolidated into a single $408.2 million promissory note. In 2003, Ebbers defaulted on the note and WorldCom foreclosed on many of his assets.\nBeginning modestly during mid-1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, Ebbers, CFO Scott Sullivan, controller David Myers and general accounting director Buford \"Buddy\" Yates used fraudulent accounting methods to disguise WorldCom's decreasing earnings in order to maintain the company's stock price.\nThe fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:\nIn June 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom led by division vice president Cynthia Cooper and senior associate Eugene Morse worked together, often at night and secretly, to investigate and reveal what was initially valued as $3.8 billion worth of fraudulent entries in WorldCom's books. The investigation was triggered by suspicious balance sheet entries discovered during a routine capital expenditure audit. Cooper notified the company's audit committee and board of directors in June 2002. The board moved swiftly, forcing Myers to resign and firing Sullivan when he refused to resign. Arthur Andersen withdrew its audit opinion for 2001. Cooper and her team had exposed the largest accounting fraud in American history, displacing the fraud uncovered at Enron less than a year earlier. By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been fraudulently inflated by about $11 billion, the largest accounting fraud ever uncovered until the exposure of Bernard Madoff's giant Ponzi scheme in 2008.\nBy this time, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were already looking into the matter as well. The SEC launched a formal inquiry into these matters on June 26, 2002. The SEC was already investigating WorldCom for questionable accounting practices.\nThe fraud came to light just days after Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice in the Enron scandal, a verdict that effectively put Andersen out of business. In his post-mortem of the Enron scandal, \"Conspiracy of Fools,\" journalist Kurt Eichenwald argued that Andersen's failure to uncover WorldCom's deceit would have brought Andersen down even if it had escaped the Enron fraud unscathed.\nBankruptcy.\nOn July 21, 2002, WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the largest such filing in United States history at the time. (It would be overtaken in September 2008 by the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual in a span of 11 days.) The WorldCom bankruptcy proceedings were held before U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez, who simultaneously heard the Enron bankruptcy proceedings, which were the second-largest bankruptcy case resulting from one of the largest corporate fraud scandals. None of the criminal proceedings against WorldCom and its officers and agents were originated by referral from Gonzalez or the Department of Justice lawyers. By the bankruptcy reorganization agreement, the company paid $750 million to the SEC in cash and stock in the new MCI, which was intended to be paid to wronged investors.\nEffective December 16, 2002, Michael Capellas became chairman and chief executive officer. On April 14, 2003, WorldCom changed its name to MCI, and relocated its corporate headquarters from Clinton, Mississippi, to Ashburn, Virginia.\nEven before then, however, employees from the MCI side of the merger had taken over top executive posts, while many longtime executives from the old WorldCom were pushed out. In late 2002, the company began moving most of its operations to its campus in Ashburn, which had opened in 2000. Capellas, for instance, spent most of his time in Northern Virginia. After the name change, one executive from the old MCI said, \"We're taking our company back.\" Another wrote in an email, \"My company was not founded in a motel coffee shop.\"\nIn May 2003, in a controversial deal, the company was given a $45 million no-bid contract by the United States Department of Defense to build a cellular phone service in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led reconstruction effort despite the fact that the company was not known for its expertise in building wireless networks.\nWorldCom agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2.25 billion to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The deal was approved by federal judge Jed Rakoff in July 2003. In a sweeping consent decree, the SEC and Rakoff essentially took control of WorldCom. Rakoff appointed former SEC chairman Richard C. Breeden to oversee WorldCom's compliance with the SEC agreement. Breeden actively involved himself with the management of the company, and prepared a report for Rakoff, titled Restoring Trust, in which he proposed extensive corporate governance reforms, as part of an effort to \"cast the new MCI into what he hoped would become a model of how shareholders should be protected and how companies should be run\".\nPost-bankruptcy.\nThe company emerged from bankruptcy in 2004 with about $5.7 billion in debt and $6 billion in cash. About half of the cash was intended to pay various claims and settlements. Previous bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar, in bonds and stock in the new MCI company. The previous stockholders' stock was cancelled.\nIt had yet to pay many of its creditors, who had waited for two years for a portion of the money owed. Many of the small creditors included former employees, primarily those who were dismissed during June 2002 and whose severance and benefits were withheld when WorldCom filed for bankruptcy.\nCitigroup settled with Worldcom investors for $2.65 billion on May 10, 2004. In March 2007, 16 of WorldCom's 17 former underwriters reached settlements with investors.\nOn March 15, 2005, Ebbers was convicted on all charges related to the $11 billion accounting scandal: fraud, conspiracy and filing false documents with regulators. Other former WorldCom officials charged with criminal penalties in relation to the company's financial misstatements include former CFO Scott Sullivan (entered a guilty plea on March 2, 2004, to one count each of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and filing false statements), former controller David Myers (pleaded guilty to securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and filing false statements on September 27, 2002), former accounting director Buford Yates (pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges on October 7, 2002), and former accounting managers Betty Vinson and Troy Normand (both pleading guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud on October 10, 2002).\nOn July 13, 2005, Ebbers received a sentence that would have kept him imprisoned for 25 years. At time of sentencing, Ebbers was 63 years old. On September 26, 2006, Ebbers surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Prisons prison at Oakdale, Louisiana, the Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution, to begin serving his sentence; he was released in late 2019 for health reasons and died in February 2020, after serving 13 years of his sentence.\nIn December 2005, Microsoft announced a partnership with MCI to provide Windows Live Messenger customers voice over IP service to make telephone calls\u2014called \"MCI Web Calling\". After the merger with Verizon, this product was renamed \"Verizon Web Calling\".\nIn January 2006, the company was acquired by Verizon Communications and was later integrated into Verizon Business.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is part of the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range. The main peaks are Sant Jeroni (1,236 m), Montgr\u00f3s (1,120 m), and Les Agulles (903 m).\nIt is the site of the Benedictine abbey, Santa Maria de Montserrat, which hosts the Virgin of Montserrat sanctuary. \n\"Montserrat\" literally means \"serrated (like the common handsaw) mountain\" in Catalan. It describes its peculiar aspect with a multitude of rock formations that are visible from a great distance. The mountain is composed of strikingly pink conglomerate, a form of sedimentary rock. Montserrat was designated as a National Park in 1987. The Monastery of Montserrat which houses the virgin that gives its name to the monastery is also on the mountain, although it is also known as \"La Moreneta\" (\"the little tan/dark one\" in Catalan).\nGeology.\nMontserrat is formed of conglomerate that was originally deposited in a fan delta at the margin of the Ebro Basin, part of the foreland basin to the Pyrenees, during the middle Eocene. The conglomerate was derived from the uplifting Catalan Coastal Ranges to the southeast of the basin and the clast type is dominated by Triassic sedimentary rocks. The fan had an original size of between 100 and 150 square kilometres. The resistance of the Montserrat conglomerate to erosion compared to the rest of the fill of the Ebro Basin explains its current mountainous nature.\nThe dominant clast lithology in the conglomerate is limestone and the sequence is cemented by calcite. The presence of so much carbonate in the rock has led to the formation of typical karst landforms, such as cave systems and karst towers.\nNamesakes.\nIn 1493, Christopher Columbus named the Caribbean island of Montserrat \"Santa Maria de Montserrate\", after the \"Virgin of Montserrat\". Again, in 1606, the Spanish expedition of Luis Va\u00e9z de Torres charted Mount Ernest island in the Torres Strait as \"Santa Maria de Montserrate\", due to its relatively high peak.\nIn Bogot\u00e1, the Monserrate mountain (3,152 m high) has a funicular and aerial lift similar to those at Montserrat.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59700", "revid": "50951359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59700", "title": "Girona", "text": "City in Catalonia, Spain\nGirona (; ) is the capital city of the Province of Girona in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain, at the confluence of the Ter, Onyar, Galligants, and G\u00fcell rivers. The city had an official population of 106,476 in 2024, but the population of the Girona\u2013Salt urban area is estimated to be about 156,400 (2020). Girona is also capital of the \"comarca\" of the Giron\u00e8s and the vegueria of Girona. Since much of the old quarter of this ancient city has been preserved, Girona is a popular tourist destination. The city is located northeast of Barcelona.\nHistory.\nThe first historical inhabitants in the region were Iberians; Girona is the ancient \"Gerunda\", a city of the Ausetani. Later, the Romans built a citadel there, which was given the name of \"Gerunda\". The Visigoths ruled in Girona until it was conquered by the Moors in 715. Charlemagne reconquered it in 785 and made it one of the fourteen original counties of Catalonia. It was sacked by the Moors in 827, 842, 845, 935, and 982. Wilfred the Hairy incorporated Girona into the County of Barcelona in 878.\nIn the 11th century, Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona declared Girona a city. The ancient county became a duchy within the Principality of Catalonia in 1351 when King Peter III of Aragon gave the title of Duke to his first-born son, John. In 1414, King Ferdinand I in turn gave the title of Prince of Girona to his first-born son, Alfonso. The title is currently carried by Princess Leonor of Asturias, the second since the 16th century to do so.\nThe earliest documented evidence of a Jewish Catalan community in Girona dates to about 885. The 12th century saw the Jewish community of Girona flourish, having one of the most important Kabbalistic schools in Europe. The Rabbi of Girona, Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi (better known as Nahmanides or Ramban) was appointed Great Rabbi of Catalonia. Centred on the Jewish Call (Call Jueu), the Jewish community of Girona came to an end in 1492, when the Catholic Monarchs outlawed Judaism throughout Spain and Jews were given the choice of conversion or exile (see Alhambra Decree). For 400 years before that time, the Jewish cemetery was located beside the road to France, just north of the old city between the mountain Montju\u00efc, or \"Jewish Mountain\" in medieval Catalan, and the river Ter.\nGirona has undergone twenty-five sieges throughout its history. It was besieged by the French royal armies under Charles de Monchy d'Hocquincourt in 1653, under Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds in 1684, and twice in 1694 under Anne Jules de Noailles. During the Third siege of Girona of the Peninsular War, the city was besieged from May to December 1809 by 35,000 French Napoleonic troops under Vergier, Augereau and Gouvion Saint-Cyr. Continuously under heavy bombardment, Girona held out obstinately under the leadership of \u00c1lvarez de Castro until disease and famine compelled it to capitulate on 12 December. Girona was the centre of the Ter department during the French rule, which lasted from 1809 to 1813. The defensive city walls of the western side were demolished at the turn of the 20th century to allow for the expansion of the city, while the walls of the eastern side remained untouched but abandoned.\nBetween 1983 and 2003, the missing parts of the city walls on the eastern side of the city were reconstructed. A walking route following the walls, known as \"el Passeig de la Muralla\", is now a popular tourist route around the old city.\nGeography.\nGirona was founded in a strategic location along a natural corridor between the Empord\u00e0 plain and the Catalan Coastal Depression, thereby connecting the Costa Brava and France to the north with Barcelona and other population centres in the south of Catalonia. This corridor is a defile formed by the Ter river between the Gavarres massif and the Catalan Transversal Range.\nThe Ter river is the most important water course in the region. In Girona it flows through the north of the town, from southwest to northeast. It is in Girona where the Ter meets the Onyar, the second largest river in the area. The Onyar crosses the city from south to north and it has historically conditioned the city's development, as catastrophic floods have periodically affected the town since historic times.\nSeismic activity.\nGirona is located in a seismic zone, which means it occasionally has earthquakes throughout the year. Most of them are not felt, and some are felt as a minor vibration or light shaking. The strongest earthquake recorded in Girona was the magnitude 6.7 Principality of Catalonia 1428 earthquake.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Girona has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"), with hot summers and cool winters. In winter, frost occurs frequently (41.3 days per year from November to March), but snowfall is quite rare. Temperatures in winter can drop to below /, especially during days with thermal inversion. Maximum temperatures in summer above are very rare. Average annual rainfall is usually slightly above . The wettest seasons are autumn (September\u2013November) and spring (April\u2013early June). Thunderstorms can occur throughout the year, more frequently in summer, averaging 23.9 days per year. but usually there still is a significant arid period. This can be seen through the natural vegetation around the city, as drought-tolerant oaks (\"Quercus ilex\" and, to a lesser extent, \"Quercus suber\" and \"Quercus pubescens\") and pines (\"Pinus pinaster\", \"Pinus pinea\" and \"Pinus halepensis\") dominate the majority of plant communities.\nMain sights.\nGirona is a popular destination for tourists and day-trippers from Barcelona. The old town stands on the steep hill of the Caputxins to the east of the river Onyar, while the more modern section stands on the plains to the west. The city has a number of \"Art Nouveau\" buildings including the \"Farinera Teixidor\" by Rafael Mas\u00f3.\nCathedral.\nThe ancient cathedral, which stood on the site of the present one, was used by the Moors as a mosque, and after their final expulsion was either entirely remodelled or rebuilt. The existing structure is one of the most important monuments of the school of the Majorcan architect Jaume Fabre and an excellent example of Catalan Gothic architecture. It is approached in ninety steps. An aisle and chapels surround the choir, which opens by three arches into the nave, of which the pointed stone vault is the second widest in the world (22.98 m), second only to that of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Among its interior decorations is the 14th century altarpiece which is the work of Valencian silversmith Pere Berne\u00e7. It is divided into three tiers of statuettes and reliefs, framed in canopied niches of cast and hammered silver. A gold and silver altar-frontal was carried off by the French in 1809. The cathedral contains the tombs of Ramon Berenguer and his wife.\nOld fortifications.\nThe old fortifications are another popular sight. Historically, these played a vital role in protecting Girona from invaders for hundreds of years. The city wall of the old town was an important military construction built in Roman times in the 1st century BC. It was thoroughly rebuilt under the reign of Peter III the Ceremonious in the second half of the 14th century, with the Roman wall used as a foundation. At the start of the 16th century, the wall was absorbed into the city and the walled precinct lost its military value. Bit by bit, the wall was degrading, as parts were gradually altered from the inside and the outside, until the walls were almost entirely demolished at the beginning of the 20th century. The remaining walls and lookout towers that make up these fortifications are today split in two \u2013 a small section to the north of the old town, and a much larger section to the east and south which was reconstructed in the period 1983\u20132003. It is now possible to walk the walls and climb the towers, from which visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Girona and the surrounding countryside.\nSant Feliu.\nThe Collegiate Church of Sant Feliu is noteworthy from an architectural point of view. Its principal style is 14th-century Gothic, although the fa\u00e7ade dates from the 18th, and it is one of the few Spanish churches that possesses a genuine spire. It contains, besides the sepulchre of its patron and the tomb of the valiant \u00c1lvarez, a chapel dedicated to St. Narcissus, who according to tradition was one of the early bishops of the See of Girona.\nSant Pere de Galligants.\nThe Benedictine church of the monastery of Sant Pere de Galligants is in the early Romanesque style, dating to about the year 1130, though the monastery dates to about 950. The monastery slightly predates the Monastery of St. Daniel.\nPla\u00e7a de la Independ\u00e8ncia.\nThe Pla\u00e7a de la Independ\u00e8ncia is one of the best-known and busiest squares in Girona. Located in the Mercadal district in the city centre, it is also known as Pla\u00e7a de Sant Agust\u00ed, after the former Convent of Sant Agust\u00ed. Its name refers to the 1808\u20131814 War of Spanish Independence, part of the larger Peninsular War, against Napoleon Bonaparte.\nThe interest of the square lies in its 19th-century style, despite it being surrounded by identical austere neoclassical buildings with porches dedicated to the defenders of the city of Girona during the 1808 and 1809 sieges.\nHowever, the symmetrical proportions of the square correspond more to contemporary interventions than its architectural past. The municipal architect Mart\u00ed Sureda i Deulovol was the first to conceive a porticoed square with closed and neoclassical loops, and with some buildings having matching aesthetic proportions. The development of the area followed this scheme only in part, as the construction of the first theatres in the city did not follow the original concept of Mart\u00ed Sureda. The surrounding part of the city is primarily constructed in the Noucentisme architectural style of the early 20th century, and the area is now a lively social and commercial hub with an abundance of caf\u00e9s and restaurants, including some well-known historic establishments like the Caf\u00e9 Royal, Cinema Alb\u00e9niz and Casa Marieta.\nCases de l'Onyar.\nThe picturesque houses overlooking the river Onyar are seen as an iconic image of Girona, but their current appearance is relatively recent. The houses were built over many years from the 17th to 20th century, although most date to the 19th century and were not originally seen with the multicoloured appearance of today. The fa\u00e7ades were painted and restored in a palette of 29 colours, an idea conceived during the later years of the Franco dictatorship by local artists Enric Ansesa and James J. Faix\u00f3 and ultimately realized in 1982. Ansesa has since related the symbolism of the colours as a \"great signal of change\" following the end of Francoism, contrasting this with the city of his youth which he described as a \"Girona in black and white, a city of grief and funerals, of the religious fundamentalism of the first Fridays of the month\u201d.\nOne of these houses (at Ballesteries 29, Girona) is Casa Mas\u00f3, the birthplace of the architect Rafael Mas\u00f3 and an example of Noucentisme in Girona. Since 2006 it has been the headquarters of the http://. The fa\u00e7ade abutting the river can be recognised by its unique white color.\nJewish heritage.\nThe historic Jewish quarter or \"Call\" has been the centre of archaeological and restoration work in recent decades. In 1492, at the culmination of a period of increasing repression, the remaining Jewish community in Girona was forced to choose between conversion and expulsion. After the expulsion of the Jews, the neighbourhood was sealed off and new houses were built over the old ones. When the dictator Francisco Franco died in November 1975, interest in the region's cultural history was revived. Some of the old buildings were excavated leading to the discovery of the home of Nahmanides, which was sold to the city in 1987.\nA rectangular indentation that once held a mezuzah can be seen at the entrance of a number of buildings in the \"Call\", such as the doorway of an old building on Carrer de Sant Lloren\u00e7. The Centre Bonastruc \u00e7a Porta on Carrer de la For\u00e7a is the site of a 15th century synagogue, and the building today hosts the Girona Museum of Jewish History and the https://. Excavations in the early 2000s also turned up 1,200 old documents, including Talmudic commentaries, accounts of Jewish domestic life, a description of the ancient synagogue and the names of Girona Jews who converted to Christianity in 1492.\nCulture.\nPopular culture.\nThe \"Barri Vell\" and the Girona Cathedral have been the set of several films, e.g. \"The Monk\" and episode 10 of season 6 of \"Game of Thrones\".\nSports.\nDuring the professional cycling season, various non-European pro cyclists have called Girona home, as illustrated in the book by Michael Barry, written during his time with the US Postal Service cycling team. Between races, cyclists do their training rides outside the city, which provides excellent training terrain.\nIn the spring of 1997, Marty Jemison, Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie moved to Girona as teammates on the US Postal Service Professional Cycling Team. This was the first year that American cyclists started living in Girona and meeting for training rides at the Pont de Pedra. Later, other well-known professional cyclists such as Lance Armstrong came to live in the city.\nFootball is also widely popular. The local Football club is Girona FC, who were promoted to La Liga in 2017. In December 2023, they recorded their first-ever league victory over FC Barcelona to temporarily reach the top of the table. The club's stadium is Estadi Montilivi.\nThe city has a roller hockey team, GEiEG, one of the most important in Spain, which competes in the OK Liga.\nEducation.\nThe city is the home of the Jaume Vicens Vives Secondary School, as well as the Universitat de Girona (University of Girona).\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nThe town is on the Autopista AP-7 and N-II. The city is also the hub of the local road network with routes to the coast and inland towards the Pyrenees.\nBuses.\nThe city has a comprehensive urban bus service operated by private companies. There are also services to the other towns in the Girona province and long-distance buses.\nRail.\nGirona is served at its new railway station to the west of the Old Town. There are conventional trains from Barcelona to Portbou and the French border.\nGirona is also an important stop on the AVE services from Paris, Marseille, Toulouse and Figueres to Barcelona, and from Figueres to Barcelona and Madrid.\nThe journey time to Barcelona is approximately 1 hour 35 minutes on the stopping \"Regional\" trains, 1 hour and 15 minutes by conventional train (\"Media Distancia\") or 37 minutes on the AVE. Madrid is reached in 3\u00a0h 45\u00a0min, also on the AVE.\nAirport.\nThe town's airport, Girona-Costa Brava, is south of the town centre. It grew tremendously principally as a result of Ryanair choosing it as one of their European hubs, but then shrank again after they relocated most of the flights to Barcelona El Prat.\nGirona Airport is approximately a 30-minute bus ride from the bus terminal and train station in Girona city, and an hour from Barcelona centre, to the south. The bus stops in the centre of Barcelona, at the \"Estaci\u00f3 d'Autobusos Barcelona Nord\", Barcelona's main bus terminal.\nMost low-cost airlines mention \"Barcelona\" in their descriptions of Girona airport.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nGirona is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is thus a variety of brush with a long handle. It is commonly used in combination with a dustpan.\nA distinction is made between a \"hard broom\" and a \"soft broom\" and a spectrum in between. Soft brooms are used in some cultures chiefly for sweeping walls of cobwebs and spiders, like a \"feather duster\", while hard brooms are for rougher tasks like sweeping dirt off sidewalks or concrete floors, or even smoothing and texturing wet concrete. The majority of brooms are somewhere in between, suitable for sweeping the floors of homes and businesses, soft enough to be flexible and to move even light dust, but stiff enough to achieve a firm sweeping action.\nThe broom is also a symbolic object associated with witchcraft and ceremonial magic.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"broom\" derives from types of shrubs referred to as brooms. \"Common broom\" typically refers to whatever shrub is most commonly used to make the bristles for a broomstick in a given region. The name of the shrubs began to be used for the household implement in Late Middle English and gradually replaced the earlier \"besom\" during the Early Modern English period. The song \"Buy Broom Buzzems\" (by William Purvis 1752\u20131832) still refers to the \"broom besom\" as one type of besom (i.e. \"a besom made from broom\").\nFlat brooms, made of broom corn, were invented by Shakers in the 19th century with the invention of the broom vice.\nA smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster.\nFunction.\nBrooms are used to clean dust and ash. They may be used to clean homes, appliances such as ovens and fireplaces, or outdoor areas such as streets and yards.\nHistory.\nThe earliest brooms and brushes are from prehistory, when things such as bird wings and burs were fastened to handles of bone, ivory, or wood. The indigenous peoples of the Southwestern United States created brooms from yucca plants for cleaning pueblos. The indigenous people of Saint Lucia created brooms from coconut fronds for cleaning around hearths. Brooms are mentioned in the 1540 manuscript \"Codex Mendoza\" of the Aztecs, which instructs girls to sweep.\nThe birch besom was made by fastening twigs to a handle with a strip of ash wood, harvested from a log after washing it in a running stream. The besom became a symbol of breweries in England, where brewers used it as a whisk while fermenting alcoholic beverages, and the brooms were typically displayed by pubs. When not in use, a brewer's besom was stored and dried on wall pegs or hanging by a leather cord. The broom was not washed so that yeast would remain in the bristles for future uses. Hearth besoms were created in Ireland to keep ash on a hearth. Until the 18th century, brooms were crafted by hand.\nIn 1797, the quality of brooms changed when Levi Dickenson, a farmer in Hadley, Massachusetts, made a broom for his wife, using the tassels of sorghum, a grain he was growing for the seeds. His wife spread good words around town, creating demand for Dickenson's sorghum brooms. The sorghum brooms held up well, but ultimately, like all brooms, fell apart. Dickenson subsequently invented a machine that would make better brooms, and faster than he could. In 1810, the foot treadle broom machine was invented. This machine played an integral part in the Industrial Revolution.\nThe Shakers began growing broom corn to create brooms in the present-day United States, which they crafted on treadle wheels and stored hanging on the wall under a cotton hood. The Shaker Theodore Bates invented the flat broom in 1798. Benjamin Franklin grew French broom, a practice which was then taken up by Thomas Jefferson, who had broomsticks made from the plant. Americans commonly kept brooms with their fireplaces by the early 19th century. At this time, brooms were often made by children, the disabled, the elderly, and slaves. By the middle of the century, brooms were created in factories with machine presses, trimmers, and winding machines and then sold door-to-door. People in the American frontier crafted brooms with a wet rawhide fastening, which dried and hardened around the bristles.\nHenry Hadley invented a hybridized machine-harvested broom corn at the University of Illinois in 1983 for more efficient creation of brooms. Modern factory-made brooms are made with straw bristles, which are flattened and stitched together before a handle is inserted. In industrialized countries, brooms are sometimes replaced or superseded by powered cleaning instruments such as leaf blowers and vacuum cleaners. Brooms remain commonly used for cleaning purposes in the 21st century.\nOne source mentions that the United States had 303 broom factories by 1839 and that the number peaked at 1,039 in 1919. Most of these were in the Eastern United States; during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the number of factories declined to 320 in 1939. The state of Oklahoma became a major center for broom production because broom corn grew especially well there, with The Oklahoma Broom Corn Company opening a factory in El Reno in 1906. Faced with competition from imported brooms and synthetic bristles, most of the factories closed by the 1960s.\nDesign and types.\nA broom is made up of two parts: the handle, which is a long cylindrical stick, and the stiff fibers lined parallel at its base.\nThe United States International Cooperation Administration made a distinction between brooms based on bristle quality. Parlor brooms are made of smooth green fibers and typically have brushes 14 to 18 inches long. Carpet brooms are a cheaper variant of the parlor broom that uses bristles rejected for use in parlor brooms for being off-color or lower quality. Standard brooms use bristles that were deemed too low-quality for either parlor brooms or carpet brooms, often dyed green to emulate other brooms. Hearth brooms, or toy brooms, are made of miscellaneous fibers that cannot be used in other brooms. They are not typically sold as consumer products.\nWarehouse brooms use heavier fibers such as rattan or palmyra palm and are bound with metal. Different grades of warehouse broom are used to denote the surface it is designed for, such as smelters, decks, or railroads. Their brushes measure about 16 to 18 inches long.\nCob brooms are used to clean webs from high areas and were historically made with round brushes. Whisk brooms use bristles that are shorter and finer than other brooms. Rubber brooms were created in the early 20th century to prevent the debris raised when sweeping with straw brooms.\nMaterials and production.\nBrush.\nThe brush of a broom is most commonly made with the fibers of broom corn. Other common plant materials used in brooms include palmyra, rice straw, rice root, piassava, grass, sedge, and twigs. They may use a mix of materials, with lower quality fibers filling out the brush. Broom making involves botanical knowledge, particularly about broom plants.\nFor manufactured brooms, the fibers are sorted by quality and fitted into the appropriate type of broom. They are then put through an evener to align the fibers, a saw to remove stems, and a scraper to break open the straw and remove the seeds. The fibers are dyed or bleached to achieve a uniform color, or they are wetted if they are already high quality so they can be more easily wound. The outer fibers of the brush are typically treated with a dye, called broom crystals, to preserve the color after use. \nAs an alternative to plant fibers, brooms can be fitted with synthetic brushes made of materials like nylon or plastic.\nHandle and fastening.\nWooden broom handles are commonly made from hardwood or fir. Commercial wood broom handles are painted or finished. Lacquers can increase the lifespan of the broom's handle in addition to serving an aesthetic purpose. Wooden broom handles are often about 42 inches long and seven-eighths to one and one-eighth inches in diameter.\nMetal tension wires, sometimes crafted specifically for use in brooms, are put through a winding machine to fasten the bristles to the handle. The wire is wound through a hole in the handle before fastening the brush, typically over the last six inches of the handle. Additional bristles are added to the sides for a flat brush shape and to provide a surface for sweeping. The stem ends of the fibers are then cut and tapered and the wire is nailed into the handle. The wire is then finished by one of several methods, such as with a metal cap, with a velvet coat, or by being tapered. After the broom is wired, the fibers can again be scraped or seeded.\nTwine, often made of cotton or linen, is used to stitch the brush. At least five stitches will typically be used. The outside of the brush may be wrapped with a material like leather, replacing a twine band used to hold the brush together during manufacturing.\nCommercially sold brooms may apply a glued label to the fastening with the brand name or broom model, which can be used as a cover for the clamp marks left by a wiring machine.\nMagic.\nIn the context of witchcraft, \"broomstick\" is likely to refer to the broom as a whole, known as a \"besom\". The first known reference to witches flying on broomsticks dates to the 11th-century Islamic traditionalist theologian Ibn Qudamahin his book al-Mughn\u012b ( The Persuader ). The first reference to witches flying on broomsticks in Europe dates to 1453, confessed by the male witch Guillaume Edelin. The concept of a flying ointment used by witches appears at about the same time, recorded in 1456.\nIn Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 film, \"The Wizard of Oz\", the Wicked Witch of the West used a broomstick to fly over Oz. She also used it to skywrite \"Surrender Dorothy\" above the Emerald City. The Wizard commands Dorothy and her three traveling companions to bring the Wicked Witch's broomstick to him in order to grant their wishes. Dorothy carries it to the Wizard with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion after the Wicked Witch's death.\nIn Disney's 1940 film \"Fantasia\", Mickey Mouse, playing The Sorcerer's Apprentice, brings a broom to life to do his chore of filling a well full of water. The broom overdoes its job and when chopped into pieces, each splinter becomes a new broom that flood the room until Yen Sid stops them. This story comes from a poem by Goethe called \"Der Zauberlehrling\" (\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"). The Disney brooms have had recurring cameos in Disney media, mostly portrayed as janitors, albeit not out of control or causing chaos such as in the original appearance.\nThis flight was also in \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" as well as \"Hocus Pocus\".\nIn Eswatini (Swaziland), witches' broomsticks are short bundles of sticks tied together without a handle.\nFlying brooms play an important role in the fantasy world of Harry Potter, used for transportation as well as for playing the popular airborne game of Quidditch. Flying brooms, along with Flying carpets, are the main means of transportation in the world of Poul Anderson's \nOperation Chaos.\nThe Flying Broom () is a feminist organization in Turkey, deliberately evoking the associations of a Flying Broom with witches.\nCulture.\nBrooms are used in some rituals.\nJumping the broom is a tradition sometimes practiced in African American weddings in which the couple leaps over a broom to symbolically represent the leap into domestic life. The tradition was practiced by enslaved Americans and other groups of low social class in the United States through the 19th century. It was revitalized by Alex Haley after it was prominently featured in his novel \"\" in 1976 and became part of a broader reclamation of Black heritage at the time. Other marginalized groups, such as the Celts and the Romani, have historically been described as practicing similar traditions in Britain. The precise origin of jumping the broom is uncertain.\nThe M\u00e9tis people of Canada have a broom dancing tradition. There are broom dancing exhibitions where people show off their broom dancing skills. The lively broom dance involves fast footwork and jumping.\nDuring World War II, American submarine crews would tie a broom to their boat's conning tower when returning to port to indicate that they had \"swept\" the seas clean of enemy shipping. The tradition has been devalued in recent years by submarine crews who fly a broom simply when returning from their boat's shake-down cruise. This tradition may stem from the action of the Dutch admiral Maarten Tromp who tied a broom to his main mast after defeating the British admiral Robert Blake at the Battle of Dungeness in 1652. This has often been interpreted as a message that he would \"sweep the British from the seas\". This story remains unsubstantiated, but may have its origin in the tradition of hoisting a broom as a sign that a ship was for sale, which seems more likely as Tromp had captured two of Blake's ships in the battle.\nIn Bhojpuri, it is called \"Ba\u1e5bhan\u012b\" (prosperer), as it is believed that it's prospers the family and house.\nLiterature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But a Broom-Stick, perhaps you will say, is an Emblem of a Tree standing on its Head; and pray what is Man, but a Topsy-turvey Creature, his Animal Faculties perpetually mounted on his Rational; His Head where his Heels should be, groveling on the Earth, and yet with all his Faults, he sets up to be an universal Reformer and Corrector of Abuses, a Remover of Grievances, rakes into every Sluts Corner of Nature, bringing hidden Corruptions to the Light, and raises a mighty Dust where there was none before, sharing deeply all the while, in the very same Pollutions he pretends to sweep away: His last Days are spent in Slavery to Women, and generally the least deserving; till worn to the Stumps, like his Brother Bezom, he is either kickt out of Doors, or made use of to kindle Flames, for others to warm themselves by.\nPolitics.\nFor much of the 20th century, political cartoons and propaganda would often depict new or oncoming leaders sweeping away old, corrupt or unpopular figures.\nThe broom is used as a symbol of the following political parties:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "59703", "revid": "1782949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59703", "title": "Toshiba", "text": "Japanese electronics conglomerate\n is a Japanese multinational electronics company headquartered in Minato, Tokyo. Its diversified products and services include power, industrial and social infrastructure systems, elevators and escalators, electronic components, semiconductors, hard disk drives, printers, batteries, lighting, as well as IT solutions such as quantum cryptography. It was formerly also one of the biggest manufacturers of personal computers, consumer electronics, home appliances, and medical equipment.\nThe Toshiba name is derived from its former name, Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K. which in turn was a 1939 merger between Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. A technology company with a long history and sprawling businesses, Toshiba is a household name in Japan and has long been viewed as a symbol of the country's technological prowess post-World War II. As a semiconductor company and the inventor of flash memory, Toshiba had been one of the top 10 in the chip industry until its flash memory unit was spun off as Kioxia in the late 2010s. The company was also relevant in consumer personal computers, releasing the first mass-market laptop in 1985 and later ranking as a major vendor of laptops; it exited the PC business in 2020 having divested it into Dynabook Inc.\nToshiba faced trouble during the 2010s amid a much-publicised accounting scandal that affected its reputation, and the bankruptcy of its subsidiary nuclear energy company Westinghouse in 2017. This forced the conglomerate to shed a number of underperforming businesses, essentially eliminating the company's century-long presence in consumer markets. After a rejection to split the company, Toshiba was purchased by a consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) and Tolba in 2023; Toshiba turned private as a result and was delisted after 74 years from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it was formerly a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX 100 indices. \nHistory.\nTanaka Seisakusho.\n was the first company established by Tanaka Hisashige (1799\u20131881), one of the most original and productive inventor-engineers during the Tokugawa / Edo period. Established on 11 July 1875, it was the first Japanese company to manufacture telegraph equipment. It also manufactured switches, and miscellaneous electrical and communications equipment.\nThe company was inherited by Tanaka's adopted son, and later became half of the present Toshiba company. Several people who worked at Tanaka Seisakusho or who received Tanaka's guidance at a Kubusho (Ministry of Industries) factory later became pioneers themselves. These included Miyoshi Sh\u014dichi who helped Fujioka Ichisuke make the first power generator in Japan and to establish a company, Hakunetsusha to make bulbs; Oki Kibatar\u014d, the founder of the present Oki Denki (Oki Electric Industry); and Ishiguro Keizabur\u014d, a co-founder of the present Anritsu.\nAfter the demise of the founder in 1881, Tanaka Seisakusho became partly owned by General Electric and expanded into the production of torpedoes and mines at the request of the Imperial Japanese Navy, to become one of the largest manufacturing companies of the time; however, as the Navy started to use competitive bids and then build its own works, the demand decreased substantially and the company started to lose money. The main creditor to the company, Mitsui Bank, took over the insolvent company in 1893 and renamed it Shibaura Seisakusho (Shibaura Engineering Works).\nShibaura Seisakusho.\n was the new name given to Tanaka Seisakusho after it was declared insolvent in 1893 and taken over by Mitsui Bank. In 1910, it formed a tie-up with General Electric (GE), which, in exchange for technology, acquired about a quarter of the shares of Shibaura. The relation with GE continued until the beginning of World War II and resumed in 1953 with GE's 24 percent shareholding in the successor company, Tokyo Shibaura Denki. This percentage decreased substantially since then.\nHakunetsusha (Tokyo Denki).\n was a company established by Miyoshi Sh\u014dichi and Fujioka Ichisuke, two of Japan's industrial pioneers during the Tokugawa / Edo period. It specialized in the manufacturing of lightbulbs. The company was established in 1890 and started out by selling bulbs using bamboo filaments; however, following the opening up of trade with the West through the Unequal treaty, Hakunetsusha met with fierce competition from imports. Its bulb cost about 60 percent more than the imports and the quality was poorer.\nThe company managed to survive with the booms after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u201395 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305, but afterward its financial position was precarious. In 1905, the company was renamed Tokyo Denki (Tokyo Electric) and entered into a financial and technological collaboration with General Electric of the US. General Electric acquired 51 percent share of ownership, sent a vice president, and provided the technology for bulb-making. Production equipment was bought from GE and Tokyo Denki soon started selling its products with GE's trademark.\n1939 to 2000.\nToshiba was founded in 1939 by the merger of Shibaura Seisakusho and Tokyo Denki. The merger of Shibaura and Tokyo Denki created a new company called Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Tokyo Shibaura Electric) (). It was soon nicknamed Toshiba, but it was not until 1978 that the company was officially renamed Toshiba Corporation. The company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in May 1949.\nThe group expanded rapidly, driven by a combination of organic growth and by acquisitions, buying heavy engineering, and primary industry firms in the 1940s and 1950s. Groups created include Toshiba Music Industries/Toshiba EMI (1960), Toshiba International Corporation (the 1970s), Toshiba Electrical Equipment (1974), Toshiba Chemical (1974), Toshiba Lighting and Technology (1989), Toshiba America Information Systems (1989) and Toshiba Carrier Corporation (1999). The first mini-split ductless air conditioner was sold in 1961 by Toshiba in Japan.\nToshiba is responsible for a number of Japanese firsts, including radar (1912), the TAC digital computer (1954), transistor television, color CRTs and microwave oven (1959), color video phone (1971), Japanese word processor (1978), MRI system (1982), personal computer Pasopia (1981), laptop personal computer (1986), NAND EEPROM (1991), DVD (1995), the Libretto sub-notebook personal computer (1996) and HD DVD (2005). In 1977, Toshiba acquired the Brazilian company Semp (Sociedade Eletromercantil Paulista), subsequently forming Semp Toshiba through the combination of the two companies' South American operations.\nIn 1987, Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of Toshiba, was accused of illegally selling CNC milling machines used to produce very quiet submarine propellers to the Soviet Union in violation of the CoCom agreement, an international embargo on certain countries to COMECON countries. The Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal involved a subsidiary of Toshiba and the Norwegian company Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk. The incident strained relations between the United States and Japan, and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries. Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said: \"What Toshiba and Kongsberg did was ransom the security of the United States for $517 million.\"\n2000 to 2010.\nIn 2001, Toshiba signed a contract with Orion Electric, one of the world's largest OEM consumer video electronic makers and suppliers, to manufacture and supply finished consumer TV and video products for Toshiba to meet the increasing demand for the North American market. The contract ended in 2008, ending seven years of OEM production with Orion.\nIn December 2004, Toshiba quietly announced it would discontinue manufacturing traditional in-house cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions. In 2005, Matsushita Toshiba Picture Display Co. Ltd. (a joint venture between Panasonic and Toshiba created in 2002) stopped production of CRTs at its factory in Horseheads, New York. A year later, in 2006, it stopped production at its Malaysian factory, following heavy losses. In 2006, Toshiba terminated sales of CRT TVs in Japan and production of in-house plasma TVs. To ensure its future competitiveness in the flat-panel digital television and display market, Toshiba has made a considerable investment in a new kind of display technology called SED. This technology was never sold to the public, as it was not price-competitive with LCDs. Toshiba sold its share in SED Inc. to Canon after Nano-Proprietary, which owns several patents related to SED technology, claimed SED Inc. was not a subsidiary of Canon.\nBefore World War II, Toshiba was a member of the Mitsui Group zaibatsu (family-controlled vertical monopoly). Today Toshiba is a member of the Mitsui keiretsu (a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings), and still has preferential arrangements with Mitsui Bank and the other members of the keiretsu. Membership in a keiretsu has traditionally meant loyalty, both corporate and private, to other members of the keiretsu or allied keiretsu. This loyalty can extend as far as the beer the employees consume, which in Toshiba's case is Asahi.\nIn July 2005, BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse Electric Company, then estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (\u00a31 billion). The bid attracted interest from several companies including Toshiba, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and when the \"Financial Times\" reported on 23 January 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company's offer at $5 billion (\u00a32.8 billion). The sale of Westinghouse by the Government of the United Kingdom surprised many industry experts, who questioned the wisdom of selling one of the world's largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; China, the United States and the United Kingdom were all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power. The acquisition of Westinghouse for $5.4 billion was completed on 17 October 2006, with Toshiba obtaining a 77 percent share, and partners The Shaw Group a 20 percent share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3 percent share.\nIn late 2007, Toshiba took over from Discover Card as the sponsor of the top-most screen of One Times Square in New York City. It displays the iconic 60-second New Year's countdown on its screen, as well as messages, greetings, and advertisements for the company. The sponsor of the New Year's countdown was taken over by Capital One on 31 December 2018. In January 2009, Toshiba acquired the HDD business of Fujitsu.\n2010 to 2014.\nToshiba announced on 16 May 2011, that it had agreed to acquire all of the shares of the Swiss-based advanced-power-meter maker Landis+Gyr for $2.3 billion. In 2010 the company released a series of television models including the WL768, YL863, VL963 designed in collaboration with Danish designer Timothy Jacob Jensen.\nIn April 2012, Toshiba agreed to acquire IBM's point-of-sale business for $850 million, making it the world's largest vendor of point-of-sale systems.\nIn July 2012, Toshiba was accused of fixing the prices of LCD panels in the United States at a high level. While such claims were denied by Toshiba, they agreed to settle alongside several other manufacturers for a total of $571 million. In December 2013, Toshiba completed its acquisition of Vijai Electricals Limited plant at Hyderabad and set up its own base for manufacturing of transmission and distribution products (transformers and switchgears) under the Social Infrastructure Group in India as Toshiba Transmission &amp; Distribution Systems (India) Private Limited.\nIn January 2014, Toshiba completed its acquisition of OCZ Storage Solutions. OCZ Technology stock was halted on 27 November 2013. OCZ then stated they expected to file a petition for bankruptcy and that Toshiba Corporation had expressed interest in purchasing its assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. On 2 December 2013, OCZ announced Toshiba had agreed to purchase nearly all of OCZ's assets for $35 million. The deal was completed on 21 January 2014 when the assets of OCZ Technology Group became a new independently operated subsidiary of Toshiba named OCZ Storage Solutions. OCZ Technology Group then changed its name to ZCO Liquidating Corporation; on 18 August 2014, ZCO Liquidating Corporation and its subsidiaries were liquidated. OCZ Storage Solutions was dissolved on 1 April 2016 and absorbed into Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc., with OCZ becoming a brand of Toshiba.\nIn March 2014, Toshiba sued SK Hynix, accusing the company of stealing technology of its NAND flash memory. In the late same year, the two companies settled with a deal in which SK Hynix pays US$278 million to Toshiba. Toshiba had sued Hynix in the early 2000s for patent infringement. In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies agreed a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.\n2015 accounting scandal.\nToshiba first announced in May 2015 that it was investigating an accounting scandal and it might have to revise its profits for the previous three years. On 21 July 2015, CEO Hisao Tanaka announced his resignation amid an accounting scandal that he called \"the most damaging event for our brand in the company's 140-year history\". Profits had been inflated by $1.2 billion over the previous seven years. Eight other senior officials also resigned, including the two previous CEOs. Chairman Masashi Muromachi was appointed acting CEO. Following the scandal, Toshiba Corp. was removed from a stock index showcasing Japan's best companies. That was the second reshuffle of the index, which picks companies with the best operating income, return on equity and market value.\nToshiba announced in early 2015 that they would stop making televisions in its own factories. From 2015 onward, Toshiba televisions will be made by Compal for the U.S., or by Vestel and other manufacturers for the European market. In September 2015, Toshiba shares fell to their lowest point in two and a half years. The firm said in a statement that its net losses for the quarterly period were 12.3 billion yen ($102m; \u00a366m). The company noted poor performances in its televisions, home appliances and personal computer businesses. In October 2015, Toshiba sold the image sensor business to Sony. In December 2015, Muromachi said the episode had wiped about $8 billion off Toshiba's market value. He forecast a record 550 billion yen (about US$4.6 billion) annual loss and warned the company would have to overhaul its TV and computer businesses. Toshiba would not be raising funds for two years, he said. The next week, a company spokesperson announced Toshiba would seek 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in 2016, taking the company's indebtedness to more than 1 trillion yen (about $8.3 billion).\nIn January 2016, Toshiba's security division unveiled a new bundle of services for schools that use its surveillance equipment. The program, which is intended for both K-12 and higher education, includes education discounts, alerts, and post-warranty support, among other features, on its IP-based security gear. In March 2016, Toshiba was preparing to start construction on a cutting-edge new semiconductor plant in Japan that would mass-produce chips based on the ultra-dense flash variant. Toshiba expected to spend approximately 360 billion yen, or $3.2 billion, on the project through May 2019. In April 2016, Toshiba recalled 100,000 faulty laptop lithium-ion batteries, which were made by Panasonic, that can overheat, posing burn and fire hazards to consumers, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Toshiba first announced the recall in January and said it was recalling the batteries in certain Toshiba Notebook computers sold since June 2011.\nIn May 2016, it was announced that Satoshi Tsunakawa, the former head of Toshiba's medical equipment division, was named CEO. This appointment came after the accounting scandal that occurred. In September 2016, Toshiba announced the first wireless power receiver IC using the Qi 1.2.2 specification, developed in association with the Wireless Power Consortium. In December 2016, Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation was acquired by Canon. A Chinese electrical appliance corporation Midea Group bought a controlling 80.1% stake in the Toshiba Home Appliances Group.\n2017 US nuclear construction liabilities.\nIn late December 2016, the management of Toshiba requested an \"urgent press briefing\" to announce that the newly-found losses in the Westinghouse subsidiary from Vogtle Electric Generating Plant nuclear plant construction would lead to a write-down of several billion dollars, bankrupting Westinghouse and threatening to bankrupt Toshiba. The exact amount of the liabilities was unavailable. In January 2017, a person with direct knowledge of the matter reported that the company plans on making its memory chip division a separate business, to save Toshiba from bankruptcy.\nIn February 2017, Toshiba revealed unaudited details of a 390 billion yen ($3.4 billion) corporate wide loss, mainly arising from its majority owned US based Westinghouse nuclear construction subsidiary which was written down by 712 billion yen ($6.3 billion). On 14 February 2017, Toshiba delayed filing financial results, and chairman Shigenori Shiga, formerly chairman of Westinghouse, resigned. Construction delays, regulatory changes and cost overruns at Westinghouse-built nuclear facilities Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Waynesboro, Georgia and VC Summer units 2 and 3 in South Carolina, were cited as the main causes of the dramatic fall in Toshiba's financial performance and collapse in the share price. Fixed priced construction contracts negotiated by Westinghouse with Georgia Power left Toshiba with uncharted liabilities that resulted in the sale of key Toshiba operating subsidiaries to secure the company's future.\nWestinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 29 March 2017. Toshiba was estimated to have a 9 billion dollar annual net loss. On 11 April 2017, Toshiba filed unaudited quarterly results. Auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers had not signed off on the accounts because of uncertainties at Westinghouse. Toshiba stated that \"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern exists\". On 25 April 2017, Toshiba announced its decision to replace its auditor after less than a year. Earlier in April, the company filed twice-delayed business results without an endorsement from auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\nOn 20 September 2017, Toshiba's board approved a deal to sell its memory chip business to a group led by Bain Capital for US$18 billion, with financial backing by companies such as Apple, Dell Technologies, Hoya Corporation, Kingston Technology, Seagate Technology, and SK Hynix. The newly independent company was named Toshiba Memory Corporation, and then renamed Kioxia. On 15 November 2017, Hisense reached a deal to acquire 95% of Toshiba Visual Solutions (television sets) for US$113.6 million. Later that month, the company announced that it would pull out of its long-standing sponsorships of the Japanese television programs \"Sazae-san\", \"Nichiy\u014d Gekijo\", and the video screens on top of One Times Square in New York City. The company cited that the value of these placements were reduced by its exit from consumer-oriented lines of business. On 6 April 2018, Toshiba announced the completion of the sale of Westinghouse's holding company to Brookfield Business Partners and some partners for $4.6 billion.\nPresent and future.\nIn June 2018, Toshiba sold 80.1% of its Client Solutions (personal computers) business unit to Sharp for $36m, with an option allowing Sharp to buy the remaining 19.9% share. Sharp renamed the business to Dynabook, a brand name Toshiba had used in Japan, and started releasing products under that name. On 30 June 2020, Sharp exercised its option to acquire the remaining 19.9% percent of Dynabook shares from Toshiba. In May 2019, Toshiba announced that it would put non-Japanese investors on its board for the first time in nearly 80 years. In November, the company transferred its logistics service business to SBS Group.\nIn January 2020, Toshiba unveiled its plan to launch quantum cryptography services by September the same year. It also announced a number of other technologies waiting for commercialization, including an affordable solid-state Lidar based on silicon photomultiplier, high-capacity hydrogen fuel cells, and a proprietary computer algorithm named \"Simulated Bifurcation Algorithm\" that mimics quantum computing, of which it plans to sell access to other parties such as financial institutions, social networking services, etc. The company claims the algorithm running on a desktop PC at room temperature environment is capable of surpassing the performance of similar algorithms running on existing supercomputers, even that of laser-based quantum computer when a specialized setting is given. It has been added to quantum computing services offered by major cloud platforms including Microsoft Azure. In October 2020, Toshiba made a decision to pull out of the system LSI business citing mounted losses while reportedly mulling on the sale of its semiconductor fabs as well. In April 2021, CVC Capital Partners made a takeover offer.\nOn 12 November 2021, Toshiba announced that it would split into three separate companies. Two of the companies will respectively focus on infrastructure and electronic devices; the third, which will retain the Toshiba name, would manage the 40.6% stake in Kioxia and all other remaining assets. The company expected to complete the plan by March 2024 but the plan was challenged by stockholders, and at an extraordinary general meeting on 24 March 2022, they rejected the plan. They also rejected an alternative plan put forward by a large institutional investor that would have had the company search for buyers among private equity firms. Toshiba announced in February 2022 that it plans to split into two companies instead after the original proposal proved unpopular with shareholders.\nIn March 2023, the company announced it had accepted a \u00a5trillion ($billion) buyout offer from a consortium of 20 companies, which was led by Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), a Tokyo-based private equity firm, and includes Orix, Chubu Electric Power, and Rohm. On September 27, after the public offering was completed in the middle of that month, it was reported that it would be transferred to a new parent company, TBJH. On 22 December 2023, it was announced that JIP's purchase of the company had been completed, two days after being delisted. This move brought the company back to Japan after it had been run by overseas activist investors.\nOperations.\nAs of 2012, Toshiba had 39 R&amp;D facilities worldwide, which employed around 4,180 people, and was organized into four main business groupings: the Digital Products Group, the Electronic Devices Group, the Home Appliances Group and the Social Infrastructure Group. In the year ended 31 March 2012, Toshiba had total revenues of \u00a5, of which 25.2 percent was generated by the Digital Products Group, 24.5 percent by the Electronic Devices Group, 8.7 percent by the Home Appliances Group, 36.6 percent by the Social Infrastructure Group and 5 percent by other activities. In the same year, 45 percent of Toshiba's sales were generated in Japan and 55 percent in the rest of the world.\nToshiba invested a total of \u00a5 in R&amp;D in the year ended 31 March 2012, equivalent to 5.2 percent of sales. Toshiba registered a total of 2,483 patents in the United States in 2011, the fifth-largest number of any company (after IBM, Samsung Electronics, Canon and Panasonic). Toshiba had around 141,256 employees as of 31 March 2018.\nProducts, services, and standards.\nToshiba has had a range of products and services, including air conditioners, consumer electronics (including televisions and DVD and Blu-ray players), control systems (including air-traffic control systems, railway systems, security systems and traffic control systems), electronic point of sale equipment, elevators and escalators, home appliances (including refrigerators and washing machines), IT services, lighting, materials and electronic components, medical equipment (including CT and MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment and X-ray equipment), office equipment, business telecommunication equipment personal computers, semiconductors, power systems (including electricity turbines, fuel cells and nuclear reactors) power transmission and distribution systems, and TFT displays.\nHD DVD.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nHD DVD logo \nToshiba had played a critical role in the development and proliferation of DVD. On 19 February 2008, Toshiba announced that it would be discontinuing its HD DVD storage format, the successor of DVD, following defeat in a format war against Blu-ray. The HD DVD format had failed after most of the major US film studios backed the Blu-ray format, which was developed by Sony, Panasonic, Philips and Pioneer Corporation. Conceding the abandonment of HD DVD, Toshiba's president, Atsutoshi Nishida said \"We concluded that a swift decision would be best [and] if we had continued, that would have created problems for consumers, and we simply had no chance to win\".\nToshiba continued to supply retailers with machines until the end of March 2008, and continued to provide technical support to the estimated one million people worldwide who owned HD DVD players and recorders. Toshiba announced a new line of stand-alone Blu-ray players as well as drives for PCs and laptops, and subsequently joined the BDA, the industry body which oversees the development of the Blu-ray format.\nREGZA.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nREGZA wordmark \nREGZA (Real Expression Guaranteed by amaZing Architecture) is a unified television brand owned and manufactured by Toshiba. In 2010 REGZA name disappeared from the North American market, and from March 2015 new TVs carrying the Toshiba name are designed and produced by Compal Electronics, a Taiwanese company, to which Toshiba has licensed its name. REGZA is also used in Android-based smartphones that were developed by Fujitsu Toshiba Mobile Communications.\n3D television.\nIn October 2010, Toshiba unveiled the Toshiba Regza GL1 21\" LED-backlit LCD TV glasses-free 3D prototype at CEATEC 2010. This system supports 3D capability without glasses (utilizing an integral imaging system of 9 parallax images with a vertical lenticular sheet). The retail product was released in December 2010.\n4K Ultra HD televisions.\n4K Ultra HD (3840\u00d72160p) televisions provides four times the resolution of 1080p Full HD televisions. Toshiba's 4K HD LED televisions are powered by a CEVO 4K Quad + dual-core processor.\nPersonal computers.\nIn 1985, Toshiba released the T1100, the world's first commercially accepted laptop PC. Toshiba designed and developed PCs, predominantly laptops, under several product lines including Satellite, Port\u00e9g\u00e9, Libretto, Qosmio and Tecra. Toshiba initialized process of divestment of the personal computer and laptop business, Toshiba Client Solutions, in 2018 with sale of 80.1% of shares to Sharp Corporation. Eventually Toshiba fully exited from the personal computing market in June 2020, transferring the remaining 19.9% shares in Toshiba Client Solutions (since being renamed to Dynabook Inc.) to Sharp. Toshiba's divested personal computing business adopted the Dynabook name after a computer concept targeted for children and after one of its product lines.\nFlash memory.\nIn the 1980s, a Toshiba team led by Fujio Masuoka invented flash memory, both NOR and NAND types. In March 2015, Toshiba announced the development of the first 48-layer, three-dimensional flash memory. The new flash memory is based on a vertical stacking technology that Toshiba calls BiCS (Bit Cost Scaling), stores two bits of data per transistor, and can store 128Gbits (16GB) per chip. This allowed flash memory to keep scaling up the capacity as Moore's Law was considered to be obsolete. Toshiba's memory division was spun off as Toshiba Memory Corporation, now Kioxia.\nEnvironmental record.\nToshiba has been judged as making \"low\" efforts to lessen its impact on the environment. In November 2012, they came second from the bottom in Greenpeace's 18th edition of the Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics companies according to their policies on products, energy, and sustainable operations. Toshiba received 2.3 of a possible 10 points, with the top company (WIPRO) receiving 7.1 points. \"Zero\" scores were received in the categories \"Clean energy policy advocacy\", \"Use of recycled plastics in products\" and \"Policy and practice on sustainable sourcing of fibres for paper\". In 2010, Toshiba reported that all of its new LCD TVs comply with the Energy Star standards and 34 models exceed the requirements by 30% or more.\nToshiba partnered with China's Tsinghua University in 2008 in order to form a research facility to focus on energy conservation and the environment. The new Toshiba Energy and Environment Research Center is located in Beijing where forty students from the university will work to research electric power equipment and new technologies that will help stop the global warming process. Through this partnership, Toshiba hopes to develop products that will better protect the environment and save China. This contract between Tsinghua University and Toshiba originally began in October 2007 when they signed an agreement on joint energy and environment research. The projects that they conduct work to reduce car pollution and to create power systems that don't negatively affect the environment.\nOn 28 December 1970, Toshiba began the construction of unit 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which was damaged in the Fukushima I nuclear accidents on 14 March 2011. In April 2011, CEO Norio Sasaki declared nuclear energy would \"remain as a strong option\" even after the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. In late 2013, Toshiba entered the solar power business in Germany, installing PV systems on apartment buildings.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
