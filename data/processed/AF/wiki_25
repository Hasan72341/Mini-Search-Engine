It is located from Sacramento and from San Francisco, on the edge of the Sacramento Valley in Northern California. The city was founded in 1851 and is named after Juan Manuel Vaca.\nAs of the 2020 census, Vacaville had a population of 102,386, making it the third-largest city in Solano County.\nHistory.\nPrior to European contact, the indigenous Patwin tribe lived in the area with the Ululato tribelet establishing a chiefdom around the Ululato village in what is now downtown Vacaville along the Ulatis Creek.\nThe early settler pioneers of the land were Juan Manuel Cabeza Vaca and Juan Felipe Pe\u00f1a, who were awarded a Mexican land grant in 1842. The same year, Vaca and Pe\u00f1a's families settled in the area of Lagoon Valley. Pe\u00f1a's Adobe home is the oldest standing building, built in 1842, now at Pe\u00f1a Adobe Park.\nDiscussions for the sale of a portion of land to William McDaniel began in August 1850. A written agreement was signed on December 13, 1851, forming a township, nine square miles of land were deeded to William McDaniel for $3,000, and the original city plans were laid out from that. In the agreement, McDaniel's would name the new town after Juan Manuel Cabeza Vaca.\nIn 1880, Leonard Buck created the California Fruit Shipping Association, and the L.W. and F.H. Buck Company, an early company auctioning fruit in the state, and Vacaville was soon home to many large produce companies and local farms, which flourished due to the Vaca Valley's rich soil. Because of Vacaville's flourishing agricultural industry, as well as an increasing number of immigrants coming into the United States, Vacaville had a large Japanese and Chinese population. While their professions varied, many of these Japanese and Chinese worked for the fruit companies in Vacaville.\nIt officially became a city in 1892.\nIn 1885, the first grade school built was Ulatis School. In 1898, the town's first high school was built, Vacaville Union High School.\nIn 1968, the Vacaville Heritage Council was established.\nIn August 2020, parts of Vacaville were evacuated due to the Hennessey Fire, which resulted in the burning of over in five counties, including in Vacaville, where farms and homes were destroyed.\nOn August 29, 2022, a truck transporting tomatoes crashed on Interstate 80 in Vacaville, injuring four, splattering over 150,000 of the tomatoes onto the eastbound section of the freeway, and significantly delaying eastbound traffic for hours. The peculiarity of the freeway accident subsequently resulted in international news coverage.\nGeography.\nVacaville is surrounded by the Vaca Mountains to the south and to the west and the Sacramento Valley to the north and to the east.\nA number of rare and endangered species occur in the Vacaville area. Endangered plants, which have historically occurred in the vernal pool areas in and around Vacaville include \"Legenre limosa\", \"Plagiobothrys hystriculus\", \"Downingia humilis\", Contra Costa goldfields (\"Lasthenia conjugens\"), and showy Indian clover (\"Trifolium amoenum\"). To this day Trifolium amoenum can still be found in Lagoon Valley Regional Park.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 0.77% is covered by water. Excluding the Putah South Canal and minor local creeks, the only significant body of water within the city is the Lagoon Valley Lake.\nThe unincorporated communities of Allendale and Elmira are generally considered to be part of \"greater\" Vacaville.\nClimate.\nVacaville has a typical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Csa\") with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Characteristic of inland California, summers can get quite hot. Autumns are warm in the early part, but quickly cool down as the wet season approaches. Winters can be cool, and often foggy, but are mild compared to other regions. Spring is a rather pleasant season with fairly mild temperatures and not so much rain. The greater majority of precipitation falls in the autumn, winter, and spring, little to none in summer.\nThe wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 2012 with 5.0 inches. The most precipitation in one month was in January 1916. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on February 27, 1940.

It is based on Margaret Landon's novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher who is hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals.\nIn 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence. Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical. The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable. They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner.\nThe musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner). Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances. A hit West End London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with the 1956 film for which Brynner won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the musical was recorded several times. In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death.\nChristopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the Tony Award for Best Revival, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of \"The King and I\" continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world.\nHistorical background.\nMongkut, King of Siam, was about 57 years old in 1861. He had lived half his life as a Buddhist monk, was an able scholar, and founded a new order of Buddhism and a temple in Bangkok (paid for by his half-brother, King Nangklao). Through his decades of devotion, Mongkut acquired an ascetic lifestyle and a firm grasp of Western languages. When Nangklao died in 1850, Mongkut became king. At that time, various European countries were striving for dominance, and American traders sought greater influence in Southeast Asia. He ultimately succeeded in keeping Siam an independent nation, partly by familiarizing his heirs and harem with Western ways.\nIn 1861, Mongkut wrote to his Singapore agent, Tan Kim Ching, asking him to find a British lady to be governess to the royal children. At the time, the British community in Singapore was small, and the choice fell on a recent arrival there, Anna Leonowens (1831\u20131915), who was running a small nursery school in the colony. Leonowens was the Anglo-Indian daughter of an Indian Army soldier and the widow of Thomas Owens, a clerk and hotel keeper. She had arrived in Singapore two years previously, claiming to be the genteel widow of an officer and explaining her dark complexion by stating that she was Welsh by birth. Her deception was not detected until long after her death, and had still not come to light when \"The King and I\" was written.\nUpon receiving the King's invitation, Leonowens sent her daughter, Avis, to school in England, to give Avis the social advantage of a prestigious British education, and traveled to Bangkok with her five-year-old son, Louis. King Mongkut had sought a Briton to teach his children and wives after trying local missionaries, who used the opportunity to proselytize. Leonowens initially asked for $150 in Singapore currency per month. Her additional request, to live in or near the missionary community to ensure she was not deprived of Western company, aroused suspicion in Mongkut, who cautioned in a letter, \"we need not have teacher of Christianity as they are abundant here\". King Mongkut and Leonowens came to an agreement: $100 per month and a residence near the royal palace. At a time when most transport in Bangkok was by boat, Mongkut did not wish to have to arrange for the teacher to get to work every day. Leonowens and Louis temporarily lived as guests of Mongkut's prime minister, and after the first house offered was found to be unsuitable, the family moved into a brick residence (wooden structures decayed quickly in Bangkok's climate) within walking distance of the palace.\nIn 1867, Leonowens took a six-month leave of absence to visit her daughter Avis in England, intending to deposit Louis at a school in Ireland and return to Siam with Avis. However, due to unexpected delays and opportunities for further travel, Leonowens was still abroad in late 1868, when Mongkut fell ill and died. Leonowens did not return to Siam, although she continued to correspond with her former pupil, the new king Chulalongkorn.\nCreation.\nIn 1950, British actress Gertrude Lawrence's business manager and attorney, Fanny Holtzmann, was looking for a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (a fictionalized version of Leonowens' experiences) was sent to her by Landon's agent. According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Holtzmann was worried that Lawrence's career was fading. The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since \"Lady in the Dark\" closed in 1943. Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on \"Anna and the King of Siam\" would be ideal for her client, who purchased the rights to adapt the novel for the stage.\nHoltzmann initially wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but he declined. She was going to approach No\u00ebl Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, and asked her to see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when they had both appeared in \"Andr\u00e9 Charlot's London Revue of 1924\" on Broadway and on tour in North America.\nRodgers and Hammerstein had disliked Landon's novel as a basis for a musical when it was published, and their views still held. It consists of vignettes of life at the Siamese court, interspersed with descriptions of historical events unconnected with each other, except that the King creates most of the difficulties in the episodes, and Anna tries to resolve them. Rodgers and Hammerstein could see no coherent story from which a musical could be made until they saw the 1946 film adaptation, starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, and how the screenplay united the episodes in the novel. Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about writing a star vehicle. They had preferred to make stars rather than hire them, and engaging the legendary Gertrude Lawrence would be expensive. Lawrence's voice was also a worry: her limited vocal range was diminishing with the years, while her tendency to sing flat was increasing. Lawrence's temperament was another concern: though she could not sing like one, the star was known to be capable of diva-like behavior. In spite of this, they admired her acting \u2013 what Hammerstein called her \"magic light\", a compelling presence on stage \u2013 and agreed to write the show. For her part, Lawrence committed to remaining in the show until June 1, 1953, and waived the star's usual veto rights over cast and director, leaving control in the hands of the two authors.\nHammerstein found his \"door in\" to the play in Landon's account of a slave in Siam writing about Abraham Lincoln. This would eventually become the narrated dance, \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\". Since a frank expression of romantic feelings between the King and Anna would be inappropriate in view of both parties' upbringing and prevailing social mores, Hammerstein wrote love scenes for a secondary couple, Tuptim, a junior wife of the King, and Lun Tha, a scholar. In the Landon work, the relationship is between Tuptim and a priest, and is not romantic. The musical's most radical change from the novel was to have the King die at the end of the musical. Also, since Lawrence was not primarily a singer, the secondary couple gave Rodgers a chance to write his usual \"soaring\" romantic melodies. In an interview for \"The New York Times\", Hammerstein indicated that he wrote the first scene before leaving for London and the West End production of \"Carousel\" in mid-1950; he wrote a second scene while there.\nThe pair had to overcome the challenge of how to represent Thai speech and music. Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with Lorenz Hart titled \"Chee-chee\", did not wish to use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using open fifths and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears. Hammerstein faced the problem of how to represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. For the King's style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic way of talking, which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. The forceful style reflected the King's personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, \"A Puzzlement\". Many of the King's lines, including his first utterance, \"Who? Who? Who?\", and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon's version. Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.\nWith Rodgers laid up with back trouble, Hammerstein completed most of the musical's book before many songs were set to music. Early on, Hammerstein contacted set designer Jo Mielziner and costume designer Irene Sharaff and asked them to begin work in coordination with each other. Sharaff communicated with Jim Thompson, an American who had revived the Thai silk industry after World War II. Thompson sent Sharaff samples of silk cloth from Thailand and pictures of local dress from the mid-19th century. One such picture, of a Thai woman in western dress, inspired the song \"Western People Funny\", sung by the King's chief wife, Lady Thiang, while dressed in western garb.\nProducer Leland Hayward, who had worked with the duo on \"South Pacific\", approached Jerome Robbins to choreograph a ballet for \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\". Robbins was very enthusiastic about the project and asked to choreograph the other musical numbers as well, although Rodgers and Hammerstein had originally planned little other dancing. Robbins staged \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\" as an intimate performance, rather than a large production number. His choreography for the parade of the King's children to meet their teacher (\"March of the Royal Siamese Children\") drew great acclaim. Robert Russell Bennett provided the orchestrations, and Trude Rittmann arranged the ballet music.\nThe pair discussed having an Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. The lyrics for that scene proved to be very difficult for Hammerstein to write. He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as \"I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay\" and \"The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey).\" Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. \"Hello, Young Lovers\", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, and at the end of the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on \"South Pacific\", listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.\nCasting and auditions.\nAlthough the part of the King was only a supporting role to Lawrence's Anna, Hammerstein and Rodgers thought it essential that a well-known theatrical actor play it. The obvious choice was Rex Harrison, who had played the King in the movie, but he was booked, as was No\u00ebl Coward. Alfred Drake, the original Curly in \"Oklahoma!\", made contractual demands which were deemed too high. With time running short before rehearsals, finding an actor to play the King became a major concern. Mary Martin, the original Nellie Forbush in \"South Pacific\", suggested that her co-star in a 1946 musical set in China, \"Lute Song\", try for the role. Rodgers recounted the audition of the Russian-American performer, Yul Brynner:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They told us the name of the first man and out he came with a bald head and sat cross-legged on the stage. He had a guitar and he hit his guitar one whack and gave out with this unearthly yell and sang some heathenish sort of thing, and Oscar and I looked at each other and said, \"Well, that's it.\"\nBrynner termed Rodgers' account \"very picturesque, but totally inaccurate\". He recalled that as an established television director (in CBS's \"Starlight Theatre\", for example), he was reluctant to go back on the stage. His wife, his agent and Martin finally convinced him to read Hammerstein's working script, and once he did, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to do the project. In any case, Brynner's fierce, mercurial, dangerous, yet surprisingly sensitive King was an ideal foil for Lawrence's strong-willed, yet vulnerable Anna, and when the two finally came together in \"Shall We Dance?\", where the King hesitantly touches Anna's waist, the chemistry was palpable.\nPre-rehearsal preparations began in late 1950. Hammerstein had wanted Logan to direct and co-write the book, as he had for \"South Pacific\", but when Logan declined, Hammerstein decided to write the entire book himself. Instead of Logan, the duo hired as director John van Druten, who had worked with Lawrence years earlier. The costume designer, Sharaff, wryly pointed the press to the incongruity of a Victorian British governess in the midst of an exotic court: \"The first-act finale of \"The King and I\" will feature Miss Lawrence, Mr. Brynner, and a pink satin ball gown.\" Mielziner's set plan was the simplest of the four Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals he had worked on, with one main set (the throne room), a number of front-stage drops (for the ship and Anna's room, for example) and the entire stage cleared for \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\".\nThe show was budgeted at $250,000 (US$ in 2024 dollars) making it the most expensive Rodgers and Hammerstein production to that point, and prompting some mockery that costs exceeded even their expensive flop \"Allegro\". Investors included Hammerstein, Rodgers, Logan, Martin, Billy Rose and Hayward. The children who were cast as the young princes and princesses came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, including Puerto Rican or Italian, though none were Thai. Johnny Stewart was the original Prince Chulalongkorn but left the cast after only three months, replaced by Ronnie Lee. Sandy Kennedy was Louis, and Broadway veteran Larry Douglas played Lun Tha.\nShortly before rehearsals began in January 1951, Rodgers had the first Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, including Lawrence's own songs. Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. James Poling, a writer for \"Collier's\" who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She took the center of the barren stage wearing, for practice, a dirty muslin hoop over her slacks, with an old jacket thrown over her shoulders for warmth. She began rather quietly on the note, \"Your servant! Your servant! Indeed I'm not your servant!\" Then she gradually built the scene, slowly but powerfully, until, in a great crescendo, she ended prone on the floor, pounding in fury, and screaming, \"Toads! Toads! Toads! All of your people are toads.\" When she finished, the handful of professionals in the theatre burst into admiring applause.\nAt his first meeting with Sharaff, Brynner, who had only a fringe of hair, asked what he was to do about it. When told he was to shave it, Brynner was horror-struck and refused, convinced he would look terrible. He finally gave in during tryouts and put dark makeup on his shaved head. The effect was so well-received that it became Brynner's trademark.\nLawrence's health caused her to miss several rehearsals, though no one knew what was wrong with her. When the tryout opened in New Haven, Connecticut on February 27, 1951, the show was nearly four hours long. Lawrence, suffering from laryngitis, had missed the dress rehearsal but managed to make it through the first public performance. The \"Variety\" critic noted that despite her recent illness she \"slinks, acts, cavorts, and in general exhibits exceedingly well her several facets for entertaining\", but the \"Philadelphia Bulletin\" printed that her \"already thin voice is now starting to wear a great deal thinner\". Leland Hayward came to see the show in New Haven and shocked Rodgers by advising him to close it before it went any further. Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45\u00a0minutes too long. Gemze de Lappe, who was one of the dancers, recalled one cut that she regretted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They took out a wonderful scene. Mrs. Anna's first entrance into the palace comes with a song in which she sings, \"Over half a year I have been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting outside your door.\" At the end she points her umbrella at him, or something like that, and the King says \"Off with her head\" or words to that effect, and the eunuchs pick her up and carry her off. The King says \"Who, who, who?\" with great satisfaction, and finds out that he has just thrown out the English schoolteacher. So he says, \"Bring her back!\" and she is ushered in\u00a0... we all loved it.\nThis song, \"Waiting\", was a trio for Anna, the King, and the Kralahome (the King's prime minister). \"Who Would Refuse?\", the Kralahome's only solo, was also dropped. Left without a note to sing, Mervyn Vye abandoned the show and was replaced by John Juliano. \"Now You Leave\", a song for Lady Thiang (played by Dorothy Sarnoff in the original production), was also cut. After the cuts, Rodgers and Hammerstein felt that the first act was lacking something. Lawrence suggested that they write a song for Anna and the children. Mary Martin reminded them of a song that had been cut from \"South Pacific\", \"Suddenly Lucky\". Hammerstein wrote a new lyric for the melody, and the resulting song became \"Getting to Know You\". \"Western People Funny\" and \"I Have Dreamed\" were also added in Boston.\nBrynner regretted that there were not more tryout performances, feeling that the schedule did not give him an adequate opportunity to develop the complex role of the King. When he told this to Hammerstein and Rodgers, they asked what sort of performance they would get from him, and he responded, \"It will be good enough, it will get the reviews.\"\nPlot.\nAct 1.\nIn 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, arrives in Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his many children. Anna's young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King's prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna refuses to be intimidated (\"I Whistle a Happy Tune\"). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are expected to live \u2013 a violation of Anna's contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house. She considers returning to Singapore aboard the vessel that brought them, but goes with her son and the Kralahome.\nSeveral weeks pass, during which Anna and Louis are confined to their palace rooms. The King receives a gift from the king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives. She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart (\"My Lord and Master\"). The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this. She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives. They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom (\"Hello, Young Lovers\"). The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him \u2013 several dozen \u2013 and is to teach their mothers as well. The princes and princesses enter in procession (\"March of the Royal Siamese Children\"). Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.\nAnna has not given up on the house, and teaches the children proverbs and songs extolling the virtues of home life, to the King's irritation. The King has enough worries without battling the schoolteacher, and wonders why the world has become so complicated (\"A Puzzlement\"). The children and wives are hard at work learning English (\"The Royal Bangkok Academy\"). The children are surprised by a map showing how small Siam is compared with the rest of the world (\"Getting to Know You\"). As the crown prince, Chulalongkorn, disputes the map, the King enters a chaotic schoolroom. He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about \"home\". Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children. The King orders her to obey as \"my servant\"; she repudiates the term and hurries away. The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action. Meanwhile, Lun Tha comes upon Tuptim, and they muse about having to hide their relationship (\"We Kiss in a Shadow\").\nIn her room, Anna replays the confrontation in her mind, her anger building (\"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\"). Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged to take over Siam as a protectorate. Anna is shocked by the accusations \u2013 the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian \u2013 but she is reluctant to see him after their argument. Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support (\"Something Wonderful\"). Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation. The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation. Anna \"guesses\" \u2013 the only guise in which the King will accept advice \u2013 that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion. Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", that can be presented to the guests. News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare. The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house \"as provided in agreement, etc., etc.\"\nAct 2.\nThe wives are dressed in their new European-style gowns, which they find confining (\"Western People Funny\"). In the rush to prepare, the question of undergarments has been overlooked, and the wives have practically nothing on underneath their gowns. When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the \"evil eye\" and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna's, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.\nAs final preparations for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she should be ready to leave after the performance (\"I Have Dreamed\"). Anna encounters them, and they confide in her (\"Hello, Young Lovers\", reprise). The play (\"Small House of Uncle Thomas\", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party. The anti-slavery message is blunt.\nAfter the play, Sir Edward reveals that the British threat has receded, but the King is distracted by his displeasure at Tuptim's rebellious message. After Sir Edward leaves, Anna and the King express their delight at how well the evening went, and he presents her with a ring. Secret police report that Tuptim is missing. The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care, as Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries to explain to him the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance (\"Shall We Dance?\"). He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna's gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her. Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.\nSeveral months pass with no contact between Anna and the King. Anna is packed and ready to board a ship leaving Siam. Chulalongkorn arrives with a letter from the King, who has been unable to resolve the conflicts within himself and is dying. Anna hurries to the King's bedside and they reconcile. The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn. The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King. The prince orders the end of the custom of kowtowing that Anna hated. The King grudgingly accepts this decision. As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies. Anna kneels by the late King, holding his hand and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.\nMusical numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProductions.\nOriginal productions.\n\"The King and I\" opened on Broadway on March 29, 1951, with a wide expectation of a hit by the press and public. Both Hammerstein and Rodgers professed to be worried. The composer complained that most people were not concerned about whether the show was good, but whether it was better than \"South Pacific\". Even the weather cooperated: heavy rain in New York stopped in time to allow the mostly wealthy or connected opening night audience to arrive dry at the St. James Theatre. Margaret Landon, author of the book on which the musical was based, was not invited to opening night.\nBrynner turned in an outstanding performance that night, nearly stealing the show. Lawrence knew that the company was nervous because of her illnesses. The director, John van Druten, described how her opening night performance put all worries to rest: \"She came on the stage with a new and dazzling quality, as if an extra power had been granted to the brilliance of her stage light. She was radiant and wonderful.\" The rave reviews in the newspapers lifted Lawrence's spirits, and she expected a lengthy run as Anna, first on Broadway, then in London's West End, and finally on film. Lawrence won a Tony Award for her leading role, while Brynner won the award for best featured actor. The show won the Tony for best musical, and designers Mielziner and Sharaff received awards in their categories.\nDe Lappe remembered the contrast between Lawrence's indifferent singing voice and the force of her performance:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; I used to listen to Gertrude Lawrence on the public address system every night in our dressing rooms, and she'd get onto a note and sag down off of it. The night after I left the show to go into \"Paint Your Wagon\", Yul Brynner gave me house seats and I saw her from the front and I was so taken by her. She had such a star quality, you didn't care if she sang off-key. She more than dominated the stage. Boy, was that a lesson to me.\nLawrence's death and aftermath.\nLawrence had not yet discovered that she was nearing death from liver cancer, and her weakened condition was exacerbated by the demands of her role. At the age of 52, she was required to wear dresses weighing while walking or dancing a total of during a 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hour performance eight times a week. Lawrence found it hard to bear the heat in the theatre during the summer months. Her understudy, Constance Carpenter, began to replace her in matinees. Later in the year Lawrence's strength returned, and she resumed her full schedule, but by Christmas she was battling pleurisy and suffering from exhaustion. She entered the hospital for a full week of tests. Just nine months before her death, the cancer still was not detected. In February 1952, bronchitis felled her for another week, and her husband Richard Aldrich asked Rodgers and Hammerstein if they would consider closing the show for Easter week to give her a chance to recover fully. They denied his request, but agreed to replace her with the original Ado Annie from \"Oklahoma!\", Celeste Holm, for six weeks during the summer. Meanwhile, Lawrence's performances were deteriorating, prompting audiences to become audibly restive. Rodgers and Hammerstein prepared a letter, never delivered, advising her that \"eight times a week you are losing the respect of 1,500\u00a0people\". On August 16, 1952, she fainted following a matinee performance and was admitted to the NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital. She slipped into a coma and died on September 6, 1952, at the age of 54. Her autopsy revealed liver cancer. On the day of her funeral, the performance of \"The King and I\" was cancelled. The lights of Broadway and the West End were dimmed in her honor, and she was buried in the ball gown she wore during Act 2.\nCarpenter assumed the role of Anna and went on to play it for 620 performances. Other Annas during the run included Holm, Annamary Dickey and Patricia Morison. Although Brynner later boasted of never missing a show, he missed several, once when stagehands at the St. James Theatre accidentally struck him in the nose with a piece of scenery, another time due to appendicitis. Also, for three months in 1952 (and occasionally in 1953), Alfred Drake replaced Brynner. One young actor, Sal Mineo, began as an extra, then became an understudy for a younger prince, then an understudy and later a replacement for Crown Prince Chulalongkorn. Mineo began a close friendship and working relationship with Brynner which would last for more than a decade. Another replacement was Terry Saunders as Lady Thiang. She reprised the role in the 1956 film. The last of the production's 1,246 performances was on March 20, 1954. The run was, at the time, the fourth longest ever for a Broadway musical. A U.S. national tour began on March 22, 1954, at the Community Theatre, Hershey, Pennsylvania, starring Brynner and Morison. The tour played in 30 cities, closing on December 17, 1955, at the Shubert Theatre, Philadelphia.\nThe original London production opened on October 8, 1953, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was warmly received by both audiences and critics; it ran for 946 performances. The show was restaged by Jerome Whyte. The cast featured Valerie Hobson, in her last role, as Anna; Herbert Lom as the King; and Muriel Smith as Lady Thiang. Martin Benson played the Kralahome, a role he reprised in the film. Eve Lister was a replacement for Hobson, and George Pastell replaced Lom during the long run. \"The New York Times\" theatre columnist Brooks Atkinson saw the production with Lister and Pastell, and thought the cast commonplace, except for Smith, whom he praised both for her acting and her voice. Atkinson commented, \"\"The King and I\" is a beautifully written musical drama on a high plane of human thinking. It can survive in a mediocre performance.\"\nThe musical was soon premiered in Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe.\nEarly revivals.\nThe first revival of \"The King and I\" in New York was presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company in April and May 1956 for three weeks, starring Jan Clayton and Zachary Scott, directed by John Fearnley, with Robbins' choreography recreated by June Graham. Muriel Smith reprised her London role of Lady Thiang, and Patrick Adiarte repeated his film role, Chulalongkorn. This company presented the musical again in May 1960 with Barbara Cook and Farley Granger, again directed by Fearnley, in another three-week engagement. Atkinson admired the purity of Cook's voice and thought that she portrayed Anna with \"a cool dignity that gives a little more stature to the part than it has had before.\" He noted that Granger brought \"a fresh point of view \u2013 as well as a full head of hair\". Joy Clements played Tuptim, and Anita Darian was Lady Thiang. City Center again presented the show in June 1963, starring Eileen Brennan and Manolo Fabregas, directed by Fearnley. Clements and Darian reprised Tuptim and Thiang respectively. In the final City Center Light Opera production, Michael Kermoyan played the King opposite Constance Towers for three weeks in May 1968. Darian again played Lady Thiang. For all of these 1960s productions, Robbins' choreography was reproduced by Yuriko, who had played the role of Eliza in the original Broadway production and reprised the role in the City Center productions.\nThe Music Theatre of Lincoln Center, with Rodgers as producer, presented the musical in mid-1964 at the New York State Theater, starring Ris\u00eb Stevens and Darren McGavin, with Michael Kermoyan as the Kralahome. Lun Tha, Tuptim and Thiang were played by Frank Porretta, Lee Venora and Patricia Neway. Costumes were by Irene Sharaff, the designer for the original productions and the film adaptation. The director was Edward Greenberg, with the Robbins choreography again reproduced by Yuriko. This was Music Theatre's debut production, a five-week limited engagement.\n\"The King and I\" was revived at London's Adelphi Theatre on October 10, 1973, running for 260 performances until May 25, 1974, starring Sally Ann Howes as Anna and Peter Wyngarde as the King. Roger Redfarn directed, and Sheila O'Neill choreographed. The production, which began in June 1973 with a tour of the English provinces, earned mixed to warm reviews. Michael Billington in \"The Guardian\" called the revival \"well played and well sung\". Although he was enthusiastic about Howes as Anna, Billington thought Wyngarde \"too fragile to be capable of inspiring unholy terror\". He praised Redfarn's production \u2013 \"whipped along at a good pace and made a sumptuous eyeful out of the interpolated ballet on 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'.\" Less favorably, Robert Cushman in \"The Observer\" thought the production \"scenically and economically under-nourished\". He liked Wyngarde's King (\"a dignified clown\") but thought Howes not formidable enough to stand up to him as Anna. He noted that \"she sings beautifully and the songs are the evening's real justification\".\nBrynner reprises the role.\nIn early 1976, Brynner received an offer from impresarios Lee Gruber and Shelly Gross to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from laryngitis that he lip-synched, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the orchestra pit. The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening in New York at the Uris Theatre (today the Gershwin Theatre) on May 2, 1977. The production featured Martin Vidnovic as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated. Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography. Sharaff again designed costumes, and Michael Kermoyan reprised the role of the Kralahome, while June Angela was Tuptim. The run lasted 696\u00a0performances, almost two years, during which each of the stars took off three weeks, with Angela Lansbury replacing Towers and Kermoyan replacing Brynner. The production was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical.\nBrynner insisted on renovations to the Uris before he would play there, stating that the theatre resembled \"a public toilet\". He also insisted that dressing rooms on the tour and at the Uris be arranged to his satisfaction. According to his biographer Michelangelo Capua, for years afterwards, performers thanked Brynner for having backstage facilities across the country cleaned up. \" New York Times\" reviewer Clive Barnes said of the revival, \"The cast is a good one. Mr. Brynner grinning fire and snorting charm is as near to the original as makes little difference\" and called Towers \"piquantly ladylike and sweet without being dangerously saccharine\". However, fellow \"Times\" critic Mel Gussow warned, later in the run, that \"to a certain extent [Brynner] was coasting on his charisma\".\nThe tour was extended in 1979, after the New York run, still starring Brynner and Towers. The production then opened in the West End, at the London Palladium, on June 12, 1979, and was reported to have the largest advance sale in English history. Brynner stated, \"It is not a play, it is a happening.\" Virginia McKenna starred in London as Anna, winning an Olivier Award for her performance. June Angela again played Tuptim, and John Bennett was the Kralahome. It ran until September 27, 1980.\nBrynner took only a few months off after the London run ended, which contributed to his third divorce; he returned to the road in early 1981 in an extended U.S. tour of the same production, which eventually ended on Broadway. Mitch Leigh produced and directed, and Robbins' choreography was reproduced by Rebecca West, who also danced the role of Simon of Legree, which she had danced at the Uris in 1977. Patricia Marand played Anna, Michael Kermoyan was again the Kralahome, Patricia Welch was Tuptim. During 1981, Kate Hunter Brown took over as Anna, continuing in the role for at least a year and a half. By 1983, Mary Beth Peil was playing Anna. On September 13, 1983, in Los Angeles, Brynner celebrated his 4,000th\u00a0performance as the King; on the same day he was privately diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and the tour had to shut down for a few months while he received painful radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. \"The Washington Post\" reviewer saw Brynner's \"absolutely last farewell tour\" in December 1984 and wrote of the star:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe production reached New York in January 1985, running for 191 performances at the Broadway Theatre, with Brynner, Peil, Welch and West still playing their roles. The part of Eliza was played by the leading man's fourth wife, Kathy Lee Brynner, and newcomer Jeffrey Bryan Davis played Louis. During the run, Brynner was unable to sing \"A Puzzlement\", due to what was announced as a throat and ear infection, but he \"projected bursting vitality to the top of the balcony.\" He received a special Tony Award for his role as the King and had come to dominate the musical to such an extent that Peil was nominated merely for a featured actress Tony as Anna. Leigh was nominated for a Tony for his direction. \"New York Times\" critic Frank Rich praised Brynner but was ambivalent about the production, which he called \"sluggish\", writing that Brynner's \"high points included his fond, paternalistic joshing with his brood in 'The March of the Siamese Children,' his dumb-show antics while attempting to force the English schoolteacher Anna to bow, and, of course, the death scene.\u00a0... The star aside, such showmanship is too often lacking in this \"King and I.\"\" The last performance was a special Sunday night show, on June 30, 1985, in honor of Brynner and his 4,625th performance of the role. Brynner died less than four months later, on October 10, 1985.\nFrom August 1989 to March 1990, Rudolf Nureyev played the King in a North American tour opposite Liz Robertson, with Kermoyan as the Kralahome, directed by Arthur Storch and with the original Robbins choreography. Reviews were uniformly critical, lamenting that Nureyev failed to embody the character, \"a King who stands around like a sulky teenager who didn't ask to be invited to this party. ... Not even his one dance number ... goes well. ... Rodgers and Hammerstein's King [is] supposed to be a compelling personality [but Nureyev's] bears no resemblance to the man described ... in the \"Something Wonderful\" number. The show therefore comes across as something of a charade ... with everyone pretending to be dealing with a fearsome potentate who, in fact, is displaying very little personality at all.\"\nRenshaw's production (1991\u20132003).\nThe first major revival to break away from the original staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by Christopher Renshaw, starring Hayley Mills as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script when reshaping the piece into what he called \"an authentic Thai experience\". The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo). The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit. Renshaw \"cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land\", and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors. He also asked choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Jerome Robbins to create a \"spiritual\" ballet, for the King's entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II. According to Renshaw, \"The reds and golds were very much inspired by what we saw at the royal palace\", and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok. For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large emerald Buddha loomed over Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, \"The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides in the form of the elephant.\"\nStanley Green, in his \"Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre\", viewed the central theme of \"The King and I\" as \"the importance of mutual understanding between people of differing ethnic and cultural backgrounds\", but Renshaw felt the musical suffered from 1950s attitudes when \"Orientalism was used as an exoticism rather than a real understanding of the particular culture.\" He stated that his production was informed by authentic Thai cultural, aesthetic and religious ideas that he learned from visiting Thailand. A feature in \"Playbill\" commented that the production focused on the \"clash of ideologies and cultures, of East versus West\". Theatre arts professor Eileen Blumenthal, however, called the production \"a \"King and I\" for the age of political correctness\". While she acknowledged that the musical's treatment of Asian cultures had come to be viewed as insensitive over the decades since its premiere, she argued that Rodgers and Hammerstein's script was more sensitive than most orientalist literature of its day, in that \"West learns from East as well as the other way around\", and that, moreover, the musical's treatment of its Asian subject is fantastical, not intended to be realistic. She concluded that the show is a documentary of \"who we've been\" in the West, and that \"The King and I\" should not be suppressed, because it is \"too good\".\nThe production was reproduced on Broadway, opening on April 11, 1996, at the Neil Simon Theatre, starring Donna Murphy as Anna, who won a Tony Award for her performance, and Lou Diamond Phillips as the King, with Randall Duk Kim as the Kralahome, Jose Llana as Lun Tha, Joohee Choi as Tuptim and Taewon Yi Kim as Lady Thiang. Jenna Ushkowitz made her Broadway debut as one of the children. The production was nominated for eight Tony Awards, winning best revival and three others, with acting nominations for Phillips and Choi, who each won Theatre World Awards, and seven Drama Desk Awards, winning for Outstanding Revival of a Musical; Renshaw won for his direction. The production was praised for \"lavish\u00a0... sumptuous\" designs by Roger Kirk (costumes) and Brian Thomson (sets), who both won Tony and Drama Desk Awards for their work. Faith Prince played the role of Anna later in the run, followed by Marie Osmond. The revival ran on Broadway for 780 performances, and Kevin Gray replaced Phillips. The production then toured in the U.S., starring Mills and Victor Talmadge. Other Annas on this tour included Osmond, Sandy Duncan, Stefanie Powers and Maureen McGovern, who ended the tour in Chicago in June 1998.\nThe production opened on May 3, 2000, at the London Palladium, directed by Renshaw and choreographed by Lubovitch, and using the Kirk and Thomson designs. It reportedly took in \u00a38 million in advance ticket sales. The cast included Elaine Paige as Anna and Jason Scott Lee as the King, with Sean Ghazi as Luan Tha and Ho Yi as the Kralahome. Lady Thiang was, again, played by Taewon Yi Kim, of whom \"The Observer\" wrote, \"Her 'Something Wonderful' was just that.\" The show was nominated for an Olivier Award for outstanding musical. Later in the run, Lee was replaced as the King by Paul Nakauchi. The revival was generally well received. \"The Daily Mirror\" said: \"\"The King and I\" waltzed back to the West End in triumph last night.\" The \"Daily Express\" observed, \"Love it or loathe it, \"The King and I\" is an unstoppable smash.\" \"Variety\", however, noted a lack of chemistry between the leads, commenting that \"there\u2019s something not entirely right in Siam when the greatest applause is reserved for Lady Thiang\". Replacements included Josie Lawrence as Anna, Keo Woolford as the King and Saeed Jaffrey as the Kralahome. The show closed on January 5, 2002. It toured the UK in 2002 and 2003, with Stefanie Powers and then Marti Webb as Anna and Ronobir Lahiri as the King.\n2004\u2013present.\nAnother U.S. national tour began in mid-2004, directed by Baayork Lee (who appeared in the original production at age 5), with choreography by Susan Kikuchi, reproducing the Robbins original. Sandy Duncan again starred as Anna, while Martin Vidnovic played the King. He had played Lun Tha in the 1977 Broadway production and voiced the King in the 1999 animated film. Stefanie Powers took over for Duncan throughout 2005. Near the end of the tour in November 2005, \"Variety\" judged that Lee had successfully \"harnessed the show's physical beauty and its intrinsic exotic flavor.\"\nJeremy Sams directed, and Kikuchi choreographed, a limited engagement of the musical in June 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. It starred Maria Friedman and Daniel Dae Kim. A U.K. national tour starred Ramon Tikaram as the King and Josefina Gabrielle as Anna, directed by Paul Kerryson, with choreography by David Needham. It opened in December 2011 in Edinburgh and continued into May 2012. In June 2014, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris presented an English-language production of \"The King and I\" directed by Lee Blakeley and choreographed by Peggy Hickey, with sets by Jean-Marc Puissant, costumes by Sue Blane and lighting by Rick Fisher, starring Susan Graham as Anna, Lambert Wilson as the King and Lisa Milne as Lady Thiang. \"The New York Times\" called it \"a grand new staging that has set French critics searching for superlatives.\" In April 2016, this production transferred to Lyric Opera of Chicago featuring Kate Baldwin as Anna, Paolo Montalban as the King and Ali Ewoldt and was enthusiastically received by the critics.\nThe Renshaw production was revived again in April 2014 by Opera Australia for performances in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, directed by Renshaw and featuring Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes. Some critics questioned anew the portrayal of the Siamese court as barbaric and asked why a show where \"the laughs come from the Thai people mis-understanding British ... culture\" should be selected for revival.\nA fourth Broadway revival began previews on March 12 and opened on April 16, 2015, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. The production was directed by Bartlett Sher and starred Kelli O'Hara as Anna and Ken Watanabe, as the King, in his American stage debut. It featured Ruthie Ann Miles as Lady Thiang, Paul Nakauchi as the Kralahome, Ashley Park as Tuptim, Conrad Ricamora as Lun Tha, Jake Lucas as Louis Leonowens, and Edward Baker-Duly as Sir Edward Ramsey. Choreography by Christopher Gattelli was based on the original Jerome Robbins dances. The designers included Michael Yeargan (sets), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting). Reviews were uniformly glowing, with Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" calling it a \"resplendent production\", praising the cast (especially O'Hara), direction, choreographer, designs and orchestra, and commenting that Sher \"sheds a light [on the vintage material] that isn't harsh or misty but clarifying [and] balances epic sweep with intimate sensibility.\" The production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Leading Actress (for O'Hara), Best Featured Actress (for Miles) and best costume design (for Zuber), and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. Replacements for the King included Jose Llana Hoon Lee and Daniel Dae Kim. Replacements for Anna included Marin Mazzie. The revival closed on June 26, 2016, after 538 performances. A U.S. national tour of the production began in November 2016. The cast included Laura Michelle Kelly as Anna, Llana as the King and Joan Almedilla as Lady Thiang. The production was reproduced at the London Palladium from June through September 2018. O'Hara and Watanabe reprised their roles, with Naoko Mori and Ruthie Ann Miles sharing the role of Lady Thiang, Na-Young Jeon as Tuptim, Dean John-Wilson as Lun Tha and Takao Osawa as the Kralahome. It was nominated for 6 Olivier Awards, including Best Musical Revival. The production was filmed and shown in theatres in late 2018.\nA tour of the Lincoln Center production began in February 2023 in the U.K. and Ireland, directed by Sher, choreographed by Gattelli and starring Darren Lee as the King and Helen George as Anna. The cast also features Dean John-Wilson as Lun Tha. Designers include Yeargan (sets), Zuber (costumes) and Holder (lights). The tour continued until January 2024, when the production moved into the Dominion Theatre in the West End for a limited run until March 2024.\n\"The King and I\" continues to be a popular choice for productions by community theatres, school and university groups, summer camps and regional theatre companies.\nAdaptations.\nThe musical was filmed in 1956 with Brynner re-creating his role opposite Deborah Kerr. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won five, including Best Actor for Brynner, with Kerr nominated for Best Actress. Sharaff won for best costume design. The film was directed by Walter Lang (who was also nominated for an Oscar) and choreographed by Robbins. Marni Nixon dubbed the singing voice of Anna, and Rita Moreno played Tuptim. Saunders as Thiang, Adiarte as Chulalongkorn and Benson as the Kralahome reprised their stage roles, as did dancers Yuriko and de Lappe. Alan Mowbray appeared in the new role of the British Ambassador, while Sir Edward Ramsey (demoted to the Ambassador's aide) was played by Geoffrey Toone. The movie's script was faithful to the stage version, although it cut a few songs; reviews were enthusiastic. Thomas Hischak, in his \"The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia\", states: \"It is generally agreed that the [movie] is the finest film adaptation of any R &amp; H musical\". Thai officials judged the film offensive to their monarchy and banned both film and musical in 1956.\nA non-musical 1972 TV comedy series, starring Brynner, was broadcast in the U.S. by CBS but was cancelled in mid-season after 13 episodes. It followed the main storyline of the musical, focusing on the relationship between the title characters. Samantha Eggar played \"Anna Owens\", with Brian Tochi as Chulalongkorn, Keye Luke as the Kralahome, Eric Shea as Louis, Lisa Lu as Lady Thiang, and Rosalind Chao as Princess Serena. The first episode aired on September 17, 1972, and the last aired on December 31, 1972. Margaret Landon was unhappy with this series and charged the producers with \"inaccurate and mutilated portrayals\" of her literary property; she unsuccessfully sued for copyright infringement.\n\"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\" was a Broadway revue, directed by Robbins, showcasing scenes from some of his most popular earlier works on Broadway. The show ran from February 1989 to September 1990 and won six Tony Awards, including best musical. It featured \"Shall We Dance\" and \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\" ballet, with Kikuchi as Eliza. Yuriko was the choreographic \"reconstruction assistant\".\nRich Animation Studios, Morgan Creek Productions and Warner Bros. Pictures released a 1999 animated film adaptation of the musical. Except for using some of the songs and characters, the story is unrelated to the Rodgers and Hammerstein version. Geared towards children, the adaptation includes cuddly animals, including a dragon. Voices were provided by Miranda Richardson as Anna (speaking), Christiane Noll as Anna (singing), Martin Vidnovic as the King, Ian Richardson as the Kralahome and Adam Wylie as Louis. Hischak dislikes the film but praises the vocals, adding that one compensation of the film is hearing Barbra Streisand sing a medley of \"I Have Dreamed\", \"We Kiss in a Shadow\" and \"Something Wonderful\", which is borrowed from Streisand's 1985 \"The Broadway Album\" and played under the film's closing credits. He expressed surprise \"that the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization allowed it to be made\" and noted that \"children have enjoyed \"The King and I\" for five decades without relying on dancing dragons\". Ted Chapin, president of that organization, has called the film his biggest mistake in granting permission for an adaptation.\nMusic and recordings.\nMusical treatment.\nIn his music, Rodgers sought to give some of the music an Asian flavor. This is exhibited in the piercing major seconds that frame \"A Puzzlement\", the flute melody in \"We Kiss in a Shadow\", open fifths, the exotic 6/2 chords that shape \"My Lord and Master\", and in some of the incidental music. The music for \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\" was for the most part written not by Rodgers, but by dance music arranger Trude Rittmann, though \"Hello, Young Lovers\" and a snatch of \"A Puzzlement\" are quoted within it.\nBefore Rodgers and Hammerstein began writing together, the AABA form for show tunes was standard, but many of the songs in \"The King and I\" vary from it. \"I Have Dreamed\" is an almost continuous repetition of variations on the same theme, until the ending, when it is capped by another melody. The first five notes (an eighth note triplet and two half notes) of \"Getting to Know You\" also carry the melody all the way through the refrain. According to Mordden, this refusal to accept conventional forms \"is one reason why their frequently heard scores never lose their appeal. They attend to situation and they unveil character, but also, they surprise you.\"\nAccording to Rodgers' biographer William Hyland, the score for \"The King and I\" is much more closely tied to the action than that of \"South Pacific\", \"which had its share of purely entertaining songs\". For example, the opening song, \"I Whistle a Happy Tune\", establishes Anna's fear upon entering a strange land with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip. Hyland calls \"Hello, Young Lovers\" an archetypical Rodgers ballad: simple, with only two chords in the first eight bars, but moving in its directness.\nRecordings.\nThe original cast recording of \"The King and I\" was released by Decca Records in 1951. While John Kenrick admires it for the performances of the secondary couple, Larry Douglas and Doretta Morrow, and for the warmth of Lawrence's performance, he notes that \"Shall We Dance\" was abridged, and there are no children's voices \u2013 the chorus in \"Getting to Know You\" is made up of adults. In 2000, the recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Later in the same year Patrice Munsel and Robert Merrill made the first studio recording of selections from the musical. Hischak comments that in the 1953 London cast album, Valerie Hobson's vocals were no stronger than Lawrence's and that the highlight is Muriel Smith's \"Something Wonderful\" in a disc with too many cuts. He calls Anna's songs \"well served\" by Marni Nixon's singing in the 1956 film soundtrack and judges the recording as vocally satisfying. Kenrick describes the film soundtrack as a \"mixed bag\": he is pleased that it includes several songs cut from the film, and he praises Nixon's vocals, but he dislikes the supporting cast and suggests watching the movie instead for its visual splendor.\nKenrick prefers the 1964 Lincoln Center cast recording to the earlier ones, especially approving of the performances of Ris\u00eb Stevens as Anna and Patricia Neway as Lady Thiang. The recording, for the first time, included the narrated ballet music for \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\". Because a single LP limited a single-disc album to about fifty minutes, its inclusion required the absence of some of the other numbers. Kenrick finds the recording of the 1977 Broadway revival cast to be \"[e]asily the most satisfying \"King &amp; I\" on CD\". He judges it to be Brynner's best performance, calling Towers \"great\" and Martin Vidnovic, June Angela and the rest of the supporting cast \"fabulous\", though lamenting the omission of the ballet. Hischak, in contrast, says that some might prefer Brynner in his earlier recordings, when he was \"more vibrant\". Kenrick enjoys the 1992 Angel studio recording mostly for the Anna of Julie Andrews, who he says is \"pure magic\" in a role she never performed on stage. Kenrick praises the performance of both stars on the 1996 Broadway revival recording, calling Lou Diamond Phillips \"that rarity, a King who can stand free of Brynner's shadow\". Hischak finds the soundtrack to the 1999 animated film with Christiane Noll as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the King, as well as Barbra Streisand singing on one track, more enjoyable than the movie itself, but Kenrick writes that his sole use for that CD is as a coaster.\nCritical reception.\nOpening night reviews of the musical were strongly positive. Richard Watts in the \"New York Post\" termed it \"[a]nother triumph for the masters\". Critic John Mason Brown stated, \"They have done it again.\" \"The New York Times\" drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: \"This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and \"The King and I\" is a beautiful and lovable musical play.\" Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in \"The New Yorker\", who wrote, \"Even those of us who find [the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to take pleasure in the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them.\" Otis Guernsey wrote for the \"New York Herald Tribune\", \"Musicals and leading men will never be the same after last night\u00a0... Brynner set an example that will be hard to follow\u00a0... Probably the best show of the decade.\nThe balance of opinion among the critics of the original London production was generally favorable, with a few reservations. In \"The Observer\", Ivor Brown predicted that the piece would \"settle down for some years at Drury Lane.\" The anonymous critic of \"The Times\" compared the work to Gilbert and Sullivan: \"Mr. Rodgers charmingly echoes Sullivan in the king's more topsy-turvy moments; and Mr. Hammerstein attends very skilfully to the lurking Gilbertian humour.\" Less favorably, in the \"Daily Express\", John Barber called the work \"this treacle-bin \"Mikado\"\", and declared that only one of the cast, Muriel Smith, could really sing.\nIn 1963, \"New York Times\" reviewer Lewis Funke said of the musical, \"Mr. Hammerstein put all of his big heart into the simple story of a British woman's adventures, heartaches, and triumphs.\u00a0... A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [Landon's book] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity.\" Fourteen years later, another \"Times\" reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical \"unsophisticated and untroubled. Even its shadows are lightened with a laugh or a sweetly sentimental tear\u00a0... we can even be persuaded to take death as a happy ending\".\nThe reworked 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" disliked it: \"This latest \"King and I\" might look like a million dollars as a regional production; on Broadway\u00a0... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, there has been a serious failure of the theatrical imagination.\" But Liz Smith enthused: \"\"The King and I\" is perfect\"; and the \"Houston Chronicle\" wrote, of the subsequent tour, \"\"The King and I\" is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey.\" Critic Richard Christiansen in the \"Chicago Tribune\" observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: \"Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [\"The King and I\"] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age.\" When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the \"Financial Times\" called it \"a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals\".\nThe 2015 Broadway revival initially received uniformly glowing reviews. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"resplendent production\" and commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[In the] 1996 production ... [a] dark strain of sadomasochistic tension born of Victorian repression and Eastern sensuality was introduced into sunny Siam. ... Mr. Sher is no strong-armed revisionist. He works from within vintage material, coaxing shadowy emotional depths to churn up a surface that might otherwise seem shiny and slick. ... [T]he show is both panoramic and personal, balancing dazzling musical set pieces with sung introspective soliloquies. [The direction] enhances [scenes'] emotional weight. No one is merely a dancer or an extra or an archetype, which may be the greatest defense this show offers against what can come across as cute condescension toward the exotic East. ... [The] portrayal of the varied forms and content of love [and] some of [Rodgers and Hammerstein's] lushest ballads ... acquire freshening nuance and anchoring conviction\".\nMarilyn Stasio, in \"Variety\", termed the production \"sumptuous\" and \"absolutely stunning\". She noted a \"still pertinent theme: the dissonant dynamic when Western civilization tries to assert its values on ancient Eastern cultures.\" In \"USA Today\", Elysa Gardner wrote of the grins and tears evoked by the production. \"[W]atching these people from vastly different cultures carefully but joyfully reach for common ground ... can be almost unbearably moving. ... [Rodgers and Hammerstein's] textured humanity and appeals for tolerance, like their shimmering scores, only gain resonance as time passes.\" The production's attempts to achieve historical accuracy and explore the work's dark themes with a modern sensibility led some reviewers to conclude that it succeeds at converting the musical's orientalism into \"a modern critique of racism and sexism\". Other commentators, however, such as composer Mohammed Fairouz, argued that an attempt at sensitivity in production cannot compensate for \"the inaccurate portrayal of the historic King Mongkut as a childlike tyrant and the infantilization of the entire Siamese population of the court\", which demonstrate a racist subtext in the piece, even in 1951 when it was written. Benjamin Ivry opined that \"the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization should shelve the [musical] as a humanitarian gesture toward Southeast Asian history and art\".\nFifty years after its premiere, Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest summed up the musical:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The King and I\" is really a celebration of love in all its guises, from the love of Anna for her dead husband; the love of the King's official wife, Lady Thiang, for a man she knows is flawed and also unfaithful; the desperation of forbidden love; and a love that is barely recognized and can never be acted upon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a hot-summer mediterranean climate on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification scale. Its population was 18,988 at the 2020 United States census. Other nearby cities include Vacaville, Winters, Davis, Woodland, and Rio Vista.\nHistory.\nThe first semi-permanent European settlement to develop in the Dixon area emerged during the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century when the community of Silveyville was founded in 1852 by Elijah Silvey as a halfway point between the Pacific coast and the rich gold fields of Sacramento along a route commonly traveled by miners. In 1868, Central Pacific railroad came through the area and missed Silveyville by a few miles. As a result, local leaders decided to physically relocate Silveyville closer to the tracks in order to enjoy the benefits of commerce and travel. One of the first buildings that still stands in Dixon from the 1871 move is the Dixon Methodist Church located at 209 N. Jefferson Street.\nOriginally, the city was named \"Dicksville\" after Thomas Dickson who donated 10 acres of his land for the construction of a railroad depot following the completion of the tracks and subsequent relocation of Silveyville to the now-Dixon area. However, when the first rail shipment of merchandise arrived from San Francisco in 1872, it was mistakenly addressed to \"Dixon\"\u2014a name that has been used since, mainly out of simplicity.

{"id": "60866", "revid": "11221496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60866", "title": "Vallejo, California", "text": "Vallejo ( ; ) is a city in Solano County, California, United States, and the second largest city in the North Bay region of the Bay Area. Located on the shores of San Pablo Bay, the city had a population of 126,090 at the 2020 United States census. Vallejo is home to no the California Maritime Academy, Touro University California and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.\nVallejo is named after Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, the famed Californio general and statesman. The city was founded in 1851 on Gen. Vallejo's Rancho Suscol to serve as the capital city of California, which it was 1852\u20131853, after which the Californian government moved to neighboring Benicia, named in honor of Gen. Vallejo's wife Benicia Carrillo de Vallejo. The Mare Island Naval Shipyard was founded in 1854, and defined Vallejo's economy until the turn of the 21st century.\nHistory.\nVallejo was once home of the Coast Miwok as well as Suisunes and other Patwin Native American tribes. There are three confirmed Native American sites located in the rock outcrops in the hills above Blue Rock Springs Park. The California Archaeological Inventory has indicated that the three Indian sites are located on Sulphur Springs Mountain.\nMexican era.\nThe city of Vallejo was once part of the Rancho Suscol Mexican land grant of 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Gen. Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. The city was named after this Mexican military officer and title holder who was appointed in settling and overseeing the North Bay region. Gen. Vallejo was responsible for military peace in the region and founded the pueblo of Sonoma in 1836.\nIn 1846, independence-minded Anglo immigrants rose up against the Mexican government of California in what would be known as the Bear Flag Revolt which resulted in Gen. Vallejo's imprisonment in Sutter's Fort. This was subsequently followed by the annexation of the California Republic to the United States. Gen. Vallejo, though a Mexican army officer, generally acquiesced in the annexation of California to the United States, recognizing the greater resources of the United States and benefits that would bring to California.\nPost-Conquest era.\nIn 1851, Vallejo was declared to become the official California State Capitol, with the new government prepared to meet for the first time the following year. In 1852, the legislature convened for the first time. However, Vallejo did not follow through with constructing a Capitol State Building for them to meet in. In 1853, it was again the meeting place for the legislature, solely for the purpose of moving the capitol officially to Benicia, which occurred on February 4, 1853, after only a month. Benicia is named after Vallejo's wife, Benicia de Vallejo. After the legislature left, the federal government established a naval shipyard on Mare Island, which helped the city overcome the loss. Due to the presence of the shipyard, Filipinos began to immigrate to Vallejo beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. The yard functioned for over a hundred years, finally closing in 1996.\nThe U.S. government appointed the influential Vallejo as Indian agent for Northern California. He also served on the state constitutional convention in 1849. Afterward, Vallejo remained active in state politics, but challenges to his land titles around Sonoma eventually left him impoverished and reduced his ranch from 250,000 acres to a mere 300. He eventually retired from public life, questioning the wisdom of his having welcomed the American acquisition of California in the first place. Vallejo died in 1890, a symbol of the eclipse of Californio wealth, power, and prestige.\nAlthough the town is named after General Vallejo, the man regarded as the true founder of Vallejo is General John B. Frisbie. Even before his daughter Epifania had formally married Frisbie, Vallejo had already granted him power of attorney over the land grant. It was Frisbie who hired E. H. Rowe, the man who designed the city layout and who named the east\u2013west streets after states and the north\u2013south streets after California counties.\nModern era.\nMare Island Naval Shipyard was a critical submarine facility during WW II, both for constructing and overhauling vessels.\nDowntown Vallejo retains many of its historic Victorian and Craftsman homes.\nOn May 6, 2008, the city council voted 7\u20130 to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, at the time becoming the largest California city to do so. Stephanie Gomes, Vallejo City Councilwoman, largely blamed exorbitant salaries and benefits for Vallejo firefighters and police officers. Reportedly, salaries and benefits for public safety workers accounted for at least 80 percent of Vallejo's general-fund budget. On November 1, 2011, a federal judge released Vallejo from bankruptcy after nearly three years.\nGeography.\nAccording to United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Land area is , and (37.02%) is water. The Napa River flows until it changes into the Mare Island Strait in Vallejo which then flows into San Pablo Bay, in the northeastern part of San Francisco Bay.\nVallejo is located on the southwestern edge of Solano County, California in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California. Vallejo borders the city of Benicia to the east, American Canyon and the Napa county line to the north, the Carquinez Strait to the south and the San Pablo Bay to the west.\nSeveral faults have been mapped in the vicinity of Vallejo. The San Andreas Fault and Hayward Faults are the most active faults, although the San Andreas is at some distance. Locally, the Sulphur Springs Valley Thrust Fault and Southampton Fault are found. No quaternary seismic activity along these minor faults has been observed with the possible exception of a slight offset revealed by trenching. The no Sulphur Mountain and Green Valley faults have been associated with the Concord Fault to the south. The Concord Fault is considered active. \nHistorically there have been local cinnabar mines in the Vallejo area. The Hastings Mine and St. John's Mine contribute ongoing water contamination for mercury; furthermore, mine shaft development has depleted much of this area's spring water. Both Rindler Creek and Blue Rock Springs Creek have been affected.\nClimate.\nVallejo has a mild, coastal Mediterranean climate and can be an average of cooler than nearby inland cities. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the northeastern shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from heatwaves than areas directly on or nearer the Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate such as San Francisco and Oakland. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between in January and in July. However, summer is very long with June\u2013September being almost equal in historical average temperatures. This seasonal lag sees October averages being higher than in May in spite of it being after the Equinox (meaning less daylight than darkness).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVallejo was named the most diverse city in the United States in a 2012 study by Brown University based on 2010 census data, and the most diverse city in California by a Niche study based on 2017 American Community Survey data. In 2022, Vallejo was again named the most diverse small town in America, with a 77% chance any two residents would be of a different census racial category.

Artists pushed out of larger Bay Area cities like San Francisco and Oakland have been working with city leaders to revitalize the once blighted downtown area.\nThe artist-run Vallejo Art Walk scheduled on the second Friday of every month in downtown Vallejo has been recognized as a hub for artists in the Bay Area and the entirety of California.\nLGBTQ community.\nAs early as the 1940s and before, Vallejo is known to have had a well-formed gay community, which was a short drive or boat ride away from San Francisco. At one time, Vallejo boasted eight gay bars. After a migration of gays and lesbians from San Francisco in the decade 2000\u20132009, openly gay members of the community encountered what they described as a backlash against them. The school district was threatened by the ACLU with a lawsuit for harassment on behalf of a 17-year-old lesbian by school administrators. The school settled the lawsuit with the student.

A 2023 \"Vallejo Sun\" story described Vallejo's police department as \"one of California\u2019s most deadly.\" In 2020, the department engaged a consulting firm to assess how to address extensive killings by its officers. The firm issued 45 recommendations, which were endorsed by the California attorney general; but according to reporting from the \"Vallejo Free Press\" and \"ProPublica\", only two of the recommendations had been fully implemented by 2022.\nVallejo has seen a rate of killings by police officers that is significantly higher than the national average and other Bay Area cities. These incidents included the fatal shooting of Willie McCoy by six officers in 2019 and the shooting of Sean Monterrosa, who was unarmed, during protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. One of the officers who killed McCoy had previously killed an unarmed man as he fled, while another killed three men over a five-month period and was later promoted. Vallejo Police killed 19 people between 2010 and 2020. In 2012, police shootings accounted for six of the 20 homicides to occur in the city, and the frequency of officer-involved shootings stood at around 38 times the national rate.\nEducation.\nVallejo is served by one school district: the Vallejo City Unified School District (VCUSD).

It served as the capital of California for nearly thirteen months from 1853 to 1854. The population was 27,131 at the 2020 United States census. Benicia is just east of Vallejo and across the strait from Martinez.\nHistory.\nThe City of Benicia was founded on May 19, 1847, by Dr. Robert Semple, Thomas O. Larkin, and Comandante General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, on land donated to them by General Vallejo in December 1846. It was named for the General's wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo, a member of the Carrillo family of California, a prominent Californio dynasty. The General intended that the city be named \"Francisca\" after his wife, but this name was dropped when the former city of \"Yerba Buena\" changed its name to \"San Francisco,\" so her second given name was used instead. In his memoirs, William Tecumseh Sherman contended that Benicia was \"the best natural site for a commercial city\" in the region.\nIn February 1848, first word of gold found at Sutter's Mill was leaked at a Benicia Tavern, thus starting the California Gold Rush. Benicia became a way station on the way to the Sierras.\nIn March 1850, Benicia became one of the first incorporated cities in California, a month after Sacramento. Benicia was the original county seat of Solano County. The lower floor of the Benicia Masonic Hall, built in 1850 with lumber donated by Benicia founder Robert Semple on land donated by Alexander Riddell, was used as the County court room and offices prior to the completion of Benicia's city hall. In 1858, the county seat was moved to Fairfield.\nIn 1853, Benicia became the third site selected to serve as the California State capital, after San Jose and nearby Vallejo, and its newly constructed city hall was California's capitol from February 11, 1853, to February 25, 1854. Soon after, the legislature was moved to the courthouse in Sacramento, which has remained the State capital ever since. The restored capitol is part of the Benicia Capitol State Historic Park, and is the only building remaining of the State's pre-Sacramento capitols.\nThe original campus of Mills College was founded in Benicia in 1852 as the \"Young Ladies Seminary\", and was the first women's college west of the Rocky Mountains. Before moving to Oakland in 1871, it was located on West I Street, just north of First Street.\nFrom 1860 to 1861, Benicia was indirectly involved in the Pony Express. When riders missed their connection with a steamer in Sacramento, they continued on to Benicia and crossed over to Martinez via the ferry. One of the earliest companies in California, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, established a major shipyard in Benicia in the 19th century. The prolific shipbuilder Matthew Turner formed the Matthew Turner Shipyard at Benicia in 1883.\nBenicia became an important wheat storage and shipping site. It was also the site of the United States Army's Benicia Arsenal.\nOn December 1, 1879, the Central Pacific Railroad rerouted the Sacramento-Oakland portion of its transcontinental line to Benicia and established a major railroad ferry across the Carquinez Strait from Benicia to Port Costa. The world's largest ferry, the Solano, later joined by the even larger Contra Costa, carried entire trains across the Carquinez Strait from Benicia to Port Costa, whence they continued on to the Oakland Pier.\nOn June 5, 1889, the legendary prize fight between James J. Corbett and Joe Choynski was held on a barge off the coast of Benicia. The match lasted 28 rounds, and is now commemorated by a plaque near Southampton Bay.\nModern era.\nIn 1901, the world's first long-distance powerline crossing over Carquinez Strait was built. After California's wheat output dropped in the early 20th century and especially after the Southern Pacific (which took over the operations of the Central Pacific) opened a railroad bridge to Martinez on October 15, 1930, eliminating the ferry crossing and the Benicia station, Benicia declined until the economic boom of World War II, in which the population doubled to about 7,000 residents.\nA major fire on March 22, 1945, destroyed a half-block of businesses, including the nearly-century-old \u201cold brewery\u201d, and the Solano Hotel, with flames briefly threatening the old state capitol, now a historical landmark. A roof fire was quickly extinguished and the structure was not badly damaged. Losses were estimated at $125,000.\nTwo developments in the early 1960s completely changed Benicia: The closing of the Benicia Arsenal in 1960\u201364, and the completion of the Benicia\u2013Martinez Bridge in 1962. The closing of the Arsenal removed Benicia's traditional economic base, but allowed city leaders to create an industrial park on Arsenal land which eventually provided more revenue for the city than the Army had. The completion of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge made it possible for the city to become a suburb of San Francisco and Oakland, and suburban development in the Benicia hills began in the late 1960s.\nOn December 20, 1968, near the Benicia water pumping station on Lake Herman Road, the Zodiac Killer made his debut by killing Vallejo natives David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen as they rested or \"necked\" in Faraday's car. Near the same area on July 4 of the following year, the killer struck again, killing Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin and injuring Michael Mageau at the Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, immediately next to Benicia.\nNortheast of the town's residential areas an oil refinery was built and completed in 1969 by Humble Oil (later Exxon Corporation). The refinery was later bought by Valero Energy Corporation, a San Antonio-based oil company, in 2000.\nBetween 1970 and 1995, the population of Benicia grew steadily at a rate of about 1,000 people per year, and the city changed from a blue-collar town of 7,000 to a white-collar bedroom suburb of 27,000.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , comprising 9.26%, are water. Benicia is located on the north side of the Carquinez Strait.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Benicia had a population of 27,131.

Located at 600 Montgomery Street between Clay and Washington Streets in the city's Financial District, it was the tallest building in San Francisco from its completion in 1972 until 2017 when the newly constructed Salesforce Tower surpassed its height. The building no longer houses the headquarters of the Transamerica Corporation, which moved its U.S. headquarters to Baltimore, Maryland. The building is still associated with the company by being depicted on the company's logo. Designed by architect William Pereira and built by Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company, the building stands at . On completion in 1972 it was the eighth-tallest building in the world. It is also a popular tourist site. In 2020, the building was sold to NYC investor Michael Shvo, who in 2022 hired Norman Foster to redesign the interiors and renovate the building.\nHistory.\nThe area in which the building stands is historically important in the history of San Francisco. It is built on reclaimed land and stands on what was once the shoreline of Yerba Buena Cove, around which the Mexican \"pueblo\" of Yerba Buena was founded in 1834. During the Mexican-American War, a detachment from the USS \"Portsmouth\" landed on this shoreline in 1846 and raised the American flag at what is now Portsmouth Square, establishing American ownership of the city. Land reclamation of Yerba Buena Cove proceeded rapidly in the expanding city, and the Montgomery Block building was built on the site in 1853. The building housed offices and apartments for some of the city's best-known financiers, lawyers, and artists for over 100 years, before being demolished in 1959 and replaced by a parking lot.\nTransamerica Corporation was founded by A. P. Giannini in 1928, who bought the former Fugazi Bank Building at 4 Columbus Avenue, across from Montgomery Block, as a home for the newly-founded company. The flatiron-shaped building served as the headquarters for Transamerica Corporation until its 1972 move across the street into the Transamerica Pyramid. The former Transamerica Building now serves as San Francisco headquarters of the Church of Scientology.\nThe new Transamerica building was commissioned by Transamerica CEO John (Jack) R. Beckett, who chose an unusual pyramidal shape because he wished to allow light in the street below. Construction began on the site of the former Montgomery Block in 1969 and was completed in 1972, overseen by San Francisco\u2013based contractor Dinwiddie Construction, now Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company. Upon completion, the building had a structural height of and 48 floors of retail and office space.\nThe Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest skyscraper west of Chicago upon completion in 1972, surpassing the then Bank of America Center, also in San Francisco. It was surpassed by the Aon Center, Los Angeles, in 1974. In 2017, the still under-construction Salesforce Tower surpassed the Transamerica Pyramid as the tallest building in San Francisco, and upon completion in 2018, surpassed the Transamerica Pyramid by 117 feet in roof height and by 217 in total height.\nThe building is evocative of San Francisco and has become one of the many symbols of the city. Designed by architect William Pereira, it faced opposition during planning and construction and was sometimes referred to by detractors as \"Pereira's Prick\". John King of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" summed up the improved opinion of the building in 2009 as \"an architectural icon of the best sort \u2013 one that fits its location and gets better with age.\" King also wrote in 2011 that it is \"a uniquely memorable building, a triumph of the unexpected, unreal and engaging all at once. ... It is a presence and a persona, snapping into different focus with every fresh angle, every shift in light.\"\nThe building is thought to have been the intended target of a terrorist attack, involving the hijacking of airplanes as part of the Bojinka plot, which was foiled in 1995. It is one of 39 San Francisco high rises reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as potentially vulnerable to a large earthquake, due to a flawed welding technique.\nIn 1999, Transamerica was acquired by the Dutch insurance company Aegon. Transamerica and Aegon maintained only minimal presence in the building, with the majority of Transamerica's operations being shifted to Cedar Rapids, Iowa and other back office locations around the United States. In 2011, Transamerica moved out of the building and out of San Francisco entirely, relocating its headquarters to the Transamerica Tower in Baltimore. (The company would move out of that building in 2015 after further downsizing.) Although the building was no longer Transamerica Corporation headquarters, it is still associated with the company and is depicted in the company's logo, appearing even on the new company building in Baltimore.\nIn 2020, Aegon sold the building to SHVO and Deutsche Finance America for $650 million. In 2022, SHVO and partners hired architect Norman Foster to undertake a $250 million renovation.\nDesign.\nThe land use and zoning restrictions for the parcel limited the number of square feet of office that could be built upon the lot, which sits at the north boundary of the financial district.\nThe building is a tall, four-sided pyramid with two \"wings\" to accommodate an elevator shaft on the east and a stairwell and a smoke tower on the west. The top of the building is the spire. There are four cameras pointed in the four cardinal directions at the top of this spire forming the \"Transamerica Virtual Observation Deck.\" Four monitors in the lobby, whose direction and zoom can be controlled by visitors, display the cameras' views 24 hours a day. An observation deck on the 27th floor was closed: the Pyramid's official website says that it was closed to the public in 2001, while \"The New York Times\" reported that it has been closed \"[s]ince the late 1990s\". It was replaced by the virtual observation deck a few years later. The video signal from the \"Transamericam\" was used for years by a local TV news station for live views of traffic and weather in downtown San Francisco.\nThe top of the Transamerica Pyramid is covered with aluminum panels. During the Christmas holiday season, on Independence Day, and during the anniversary of 9/11, a brightly twinkling beacon called the \"Crown Jewel\" is lit at the top of the pyramid.\nPark.\nAt the base of the building is a half-acre privately owned public space designed by Tom Galli called Redwood Park. A number of redwood trees were transplanted to this park from the Santa Cruz Mountains when the tower was built. It features a fountain and pond designed by Anthony Guzzardo, containing a jumping frog and lily pads bronze sculpture commemorating \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" by Mark Twain (sculpture by Richard Clopton, 1996); a Glenna Goodacre bronze sculpture of children at play (1989); a bronze plaque honoring the dogs Bummer and Lazarus, celebrating their skill at catching rats; and benches and tables offering respite to workers and visitors alike.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a suburb located about north of Cincinnati and is situated on the east bank of the Great Miami River. The population was 44,907 as of the 2020 census. Incorporated in 1955 from portions of Fairfield Township, it includes the former hamlets of Symmes Corner, Fair Play, Furmandale, and Stockton. The Fairfield City School District is one of the largest in Ohio and serves both the City of Fairfield and Fairfield Township.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nPrior to European settlement the Fairfield area was home to several Indian tribes, most prominently the Shawnee and the Miami. The prehistoric Hopewell and Adena peoples constructed numerous earthworks around the city, though most were unwittingly removed by early settlers in order to accommodate farm fields.\nThe area that is now Fairfield was part of the original Symmes Purchase. Also known as the Miami Purchase, the region was acquired by Judge John Cleves Symmes from the Continental Congress in 1788 and included much of the land between the Little Miami and Great Miami rivers that became the present day counties of Hamilton, Butler, and Warren.\nAs the area was settled hamlets developed to serve the surrounding countryside. Judge Symmes' great-nephew, Celadon Symmes, was the founder and first settler of Symmes Corner. Located at the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Nilles Road it now serves as Fairfield's town center. \nThe hamlet of Fair Play was located on the east bank of the Great Miami River. It was known for its mills, including Ohio's first paper mill. The community was destroyed by a flood in the late 1800s. Today the Miami Chapel Cemetery and the Fair Play School are some of the few remaining vestiges of the village.\nIn the 1850s, the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railway (today CSX) was extended through Fairfield, fostering the development of several communities. The villages of Schencks Station and Stockton were established along the rail line. Schencks Station was located near the present-day intersection of Symmes Road and State Route 4 and was named for local landowner Aaron Schenck. Stockton could be found at the crossroads of State Route 4 and Seward Road. Originally known as Jones Station, the village provided area farms with necessities including a smithy, a general store, churches, and a school. In between the two communities was the village of Furmandale; also known as Schnapstown or Snaptown. Located at the current intersection of Winton and Nilles roads, the community took its name from Nathaniel Furman who operated a private school for girls within the community. A few miles to the east of these communities was the Miami-Erie Canal which, prior to the arrival of the railroad, enabled early settlers to move their commodities to market.\nGrowth and incorporation.\nFairfield remained a quiet, primarily agricultural community until the mid-20th century. As the City of Hamilton grew its industry expanded south into present day Fairfield. Fisher Body, a manufacturing division of General Motors, established a plant at the northeast corner of State Route 4 and Symmes Road near the location of what was Schencks Station. During the same timeframe Fairfield started to experience residential growth, initially as a southern suburb of Hamilton. In 1954 a group of citizens wishing to avoid annexation into Hamilton organized an incorporation campaign. The initial petition was to create a municipal corporation from Fairfield Township in its entirety. A referendum was held in April 1954 with incorporation failing by a vote of 1,219 to 831. A renewed effort focused on those precincts that voted affirmatively. A second referendum was held in July 1954 with incorporation winning by a vote of 738 to 216. Fairfield was established as a statutory village in 1955 with a mayor-council form of government.\nThe next 30 years represented a period of rapid growth for the community. By 1960 the village had exceeded a population of 5,000 and was reclassified as a statutory city. The Interstate 275 beltway was constructed around Cincinnati in the late 1970s. The new road provided easy access to Fairfield from the northern Cincinnati suburbs, thus providing an additional high quality transportation route. This, in turn, drove substantial commercial and residential investment in the community.\nGrowing pains and stabilization.\nThe city's form-of-government was a subject of debate almost from its inception. In 1961 a charter commission was formed to study the issue. After due consideration the commission recommended adoption of a charter with the council-administrator form of government, but the initiative was rejected by the voters. The question resurfaced in 1971, but did not progress beyond council conversations. In 1976 the issue gained momentum with form-of-government becoming an issue in council campaigns. In 1978 a charter commission was established and charged with framing a charter that would establish a council-administrator form-of-government. The city's second charter commission spent eight months researching the charters of various Ohio communities. A referendum was held on June 5, 1979, in which the issue was approved by a vote of 1,423 to 1,265. The council-administrator (later council-manager) form went into effect on January 1, 1980.\nGeneral Motors announced that the Hamilton-Fairfield Chevrolet Pontiac Canada Group, known as the Fisher Body plant, would be phased out in the first quarter of 1989. The effect of the plant closing was a loss of 2,500 jobs and 28 percent of the city's income tax revenue, amounting to $1.7 million.\nThe city regained economic balance in the 1990s and experienced wide, diverse business development. With a population of 39,729 at the beginning of 1990, the city's explosive population growth had begun to slow, allowing it to focus on quality development of remaining residential and commercial areas. During this time, Fairfield updated and expanded its sanitary sewers, established detention basins for better stormwater control, continued to address road improvements, and established a community center.\nIn 1995, Fairfield withdraw from Fairfield, Union, and Springfield townships via a paper township called \"Heritage Township\", reusing a name from a previous failed attempt to incorporate Symmes and Deerfield townships as a city.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Butler County line serves as Fairfield's southern corporate boundary with a small portion of the City extending into Hamilton County. This portion contains no population. The city is bounded on the north by the City of Hamilton and the eponymously named Fairfield Township; the east by West Chester and Fairfield townships; the south by the cities of Springdale and Forest Park as well as Springfield and Colerain townships; and on the west by Fairfield and Ross townships. \nThe city is bisected by a major rail line and is served by several interstate, federal and state highways which provide for excellent access. This transportation infrastructure has contributed to Fairfield's economic success.\nMost of Fairfield sits on top of the Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer; one of the largest underground reservoirs in the Midwest. The aquifer provides a clean and safe source of drinking water for communities up and down the course of the Great Miami River. The cities of Fairfield, Hamilton and Cincinnati operate water production facilities within Fairfield corporate boundaries; all of which draw from the aquifer.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 44,907 people living in the city, for a population density of 2,155.47 people per square mile (832.25/km2).

The corporate headquarters of insurance company Cincinnati Financial is located in Fairfield.\nJungle Jim's International Market is a regional tourism destination featuring food and beverage items from all over the world. Jim Bonaminio started the market in 1971 as a produce stand. A reluctant planning commission approved his request on the condition that he would ultimately construct a permanent storefront. Today Jungle Jim's International Market has 50,000 weekly shoppers and annual sales of nearly $100 million.\nTop employers.\nAs of 2022, Fairfield's largest employers were:\nGovernment.\nThe City of Fairfield is a charter municipality and operates under the council-manager form of government, combining the strong political leadership of elected officials with the professional expertise of an appointed city manager. Legislative authority under this form of government is vested in City Council, the body that is chosen by the electorate. Council hires the manager to serve as the city's full-time chief executive officer. Fairfield City Council consists of seven members, three of who are elected at-large with the remainder elected by ward. Council members serve staggered, four-year terms with the ward members running together followed two years later by the at-large members and the Mayor. The Mayor, who is directly elected and also serves a four-year term, acts as the official and ceremonial head of the government and presides over all meetings of Council. Mayoral duties include the right to introduce legislation and to take part in discussion of all matters before Council with the right to vote in the event of a tie. The Mayor appoints the chairs of the various council committees and issues official proclamations. Council, in addition to appointing the city manager and passing legislation, approves the annual operating, capital and tax budgets, contracts in the city's name, levies taxes, appoints board and commission members, and appoints the law director and the clerk of council.\nThe city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city, implements Council action, hires and oversees the staff, prepares and implements the annual operating and capital budgets and keeps the elected officials advised of the city's financial sustainability.\nThe Fairfield Municipal Court is part of the city from a budgetary perspective, but otherwise operates as a completely autonomous agency. Municipal court judges in Ohio are elected to six-year terms on a nonpartisan judicial ballot.\nRecreation.\nFairfield operates a parks and recreation system with over 500 acres of parkland. Harbin Park is the city's largest at 230 acres. It annually hosts the Cincinnati Cyclocross, a cycling competition spread over three days and three Greater Cincinnati communities. Harbin also plays host to the city's Red White &amp; Kaboom fireworks show held annually on July 3 in celebration of Independence Day.\nMarsh Lake Park was acquired from the Martin\u2013Marietta Corporation in 2017. The city had, since the early 1990s, leased the eastern portion of the property from Martin\u2013Marietta. Per the terms of an agreement between the city and the company the property was deeded to Fairfield upon the cessation of mining operations in 2017.\nHuffman Park is one of the city's newest recreational facilities. It was donated, developed and dedicated in 2012 in memory of Fairfield residents Anna and Harold Huffman who owned and lived on the property for more than 50 years. Funding for the development of the park was provided by the Anna &amp; Harold W. Huffman Foundation. It promotes ecology with plantings of native species and a prairie that provides wildlife habitat.\nIn addition to the park system, city facilities include the Community Arts Center; the 1817 Elisha Morgan Mansion; and the Village Green Amphitheater that hosts the seasonal Groovin' on the Green Concert Series, 4th Friday Concert Series and the Village Green Farmer's Market. The city operates two municipal golf courses and an aquatic center.\nFairfield is also home to Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy, which has coached various Olympians.\nTransportation.\nPublic transit in the city is provided by the Butler County Regional Transit Authority and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority.\nEducation.\nFairfield City School District operates Fairfield High School as well as the Fairfield Freshmen School, two middle schools and six elementary schools. Parochial education options include Sacred Heart of Jesus School, Stephen T. Badin High School and Cincinnati Christian schools. A branch campus of Miami University is located a few miles north of Fairfield in the City of Hamilton. The Fairfield Lane Library is a branch of the Lane Public Library system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60874", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60874", "title": "Photoluminescence", "text": "Light emission from substances after they absorb photons\nPhotoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) is light emission from any form of matter after the absorption of photons (electromagnetic radiation). It is one of many forms of luminescence (light emission) and is initiated by photoexcitation (i.e. photons that excite electrons to a higher energy level in an atom), hence the prefix \"photo-\". Following excitation, various relaxation processes typically occur in which other photons are re-radiated. Time periods between absorption and emission may vary: ranging from short femtosecond-regime for emission involving free-carrier plasma in inorganic semiconductors or metals up to milliseconds for phosphoresence processes in molecular systems; and under special circumstances delay of emission may even span to minutes or hours.\nObservation of photoluminescence at a certain energy can be viewed as an indication that an electron transitioned between states separated by this transition energy. While this is generally true in atoms and similar systems, correlations and other more complex phenomena also act as sources for photoluminescence in many-body systems such as semiconductors or metals. A theoretical approach to handle this is given by the semiconductor luminescence equations.\nForms.\nPhotoluminescence processes can be classified by various parameters such as the energy of the exciting photon with respect to the emission.\nResonant excitation describes a situation in which photons of a particular wavelength are absorbed and equivalent photons are very rapidly re-emitted. This is often referred to as resonance fluorescence. For materials in solution or in the gas phase, this process involves electrons but no significant internal energy transitions involving molecular features of the chemical substance between absorption and emission. In crystalline inorganic semiconductors where an electronic band structure is formed, secondary emission can be more complicated as events may contain both coherent contributions such as resonant Rayleigh scattering where a fixed phase relation with the driving light field is maintained (i.e. energetically elastic processes where no losses are involved), and incoherent contributions (or inelastic modes where some energy channels into an auxiliary loss mode),\nThe latter originate, e.g., from the radiative recombination of excitons, Coulomb-bound electron-hole pair states in solids. Resonance fluorescence may also show significant quantum optical correlations.\nMore processes may occur when a substance undergoes internal energy transitions before re-emitting the energy from the absorption event. Electrons change energy states by either resonantly gaining energy from absorption of a photon or losing energy by emitting photons. In chemistry-related disciplines, one often distinguishes between fluorescence and phosphorescence. The former is typically a fast process, yet some amount of the original energy is dissipated so that re-emitted light photons will have lower energy than did the absorbed excitation photons. The re-emitted photon in this case is said to be red shifted, referring to the reduced energy it carries following this loss (as the Jablonski diagram shows). For phosphorescence, electrons which absorbed photons, undergo intersystem crossing where they enter into a state with altered spin multiplicity (see term symbol), usually a triplet state. Once the excited electron is transferred into this triplet state, electron transition (relaxation) back to the lower singlet state energies is quantum mechanically forbidden, meaning that it happens much more slowly than other transitions. The result is a slow process of radiative transition back to the singlet state, sometimes lasting minutes or hours. This is the basis for \"glow in the dark\" substances.\nPhotoluminescence is an important technique for measuring the purity and crystalline quality of semiconductors such as GaN and InP and for quantification of the amount of disorder present in a system.\nTime-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is a method where the sample is excited with a light pulse and then the decay in photoluminescence with respect to time is measured. This technique is useful for measuring the minority carrier lifetime of III-V semiconductors like gallium arsenide (GaAs).\nPhotoluminescence properties of direct-gap semiconductors.\nIn a typical PL experiment, a semiconductor is excited with a light-source that provides photons with an energy larger than the bandgap energy.\nThe incoming light excites a polarization that can be described with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Once the photons are absorbed, electrons and holes are formed with finite momenta formula_1 in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The excitations then undergo energy and momentum relaxation towards the band-gap minimum. Typical mechanisms are Coulomb scattering and the interaction with phonons. Finally, the electrons recombine with holes under emission of photons.\nIdeal, defect-free semiconductors are many-body systems where the interactions of charge-carriers and lattice vibrations have to be considered in addition to the light-matter coupling. In general, the PL properties are also extremely sensitive to internal electric fields and to the dielectric environment (such as in photonic crystals) which impose further degrees of complexity. A precise microscopic description is provided by the semiconductor luminescence equations.\nIdeal quantum-well structures.\nAn ideal, defect-free semiconductor quantum well structure is a useful model system to illustrate the fundamental processes in typical PL experiments. The discussion is based on results published in Klingshirn (2012) and Balkan (1998).\nThe fictive model structure for this discussion has two confined quantized electronic and two hole subbands, e1, e2 and h1, h2, respectively.\nThe linear absorption spectrum of such a structure shows the exciton resonances of the first (e1h1) and the second quantum well subbands (e2, h2), as well as the absorption from the corresponding continuum states and from the barrier.\nPhotoexcitation.\nIn general, three different excitation conditions are distinguished: resonant, quasi-resonant, and non-resonant. For the resonant excitation, the central energy of the laser corresponds to the lowest exciton resonance of the quantum well. No, or only a negligible amount of the excess, energy is injected to the carrier system. For these conditions, coherent processes contribute significantly to the spontaneous emission. The decay of polarization creates excitons directly. The detection of PL is challenging for resonant excitation as it is difficult to discriminate contributions from the excitation, i.e., stray-light and diffuse scattering from surface roughness. Thus, speckle and resonant Rayleigh-scattering are always superimposed to the incoherent emission.\nIn case of the non-resonant excitation, the structure is excited with some excess energy. This is the typical situation used in most PL experiments as the excitation energy can be discriminated using a spectrometer or an optical filter. One has to distinguish between quasi-resonant excitation and barrier excitation.\nFor quasi-resonant conditions, the energy of the excitation is tuned above the ground state but still below the barrier absorption edge, for example, into the continuum of the first subband. The polarization decay for these conditions is much faster than for resonant excitation and coherent contributions to the quantum well emission are negligible. The initial temperature of the carrier system is significantly higher than the lattice temperature due to the surplus energy of the injected carriers. Finally, only the electron-hole plasma is initially created. It is then followed by the formation of excitons.\nIn case of barrier excitation, the initial carrier distribution in the quantum well strongly depends on the carrier scattering between barrier and the well.\nRelaxation.\nInitially, the laser light induces coherent polarization in the sample, i.e., the transitions between electron and hole states oscillate with the laser frequency and a fixed phase. The polarization dephases typically on a sub-100 fs time-scale in case of nonresonant excitation due to ultra-fast Coulomb- and phonon-scattering.\nThe dephasing of the polarization leads to creation of populations of electrons and holes in the conduction and the valence bands, respectively. The lifetime of the carrier populations is rather long, limited by radiative and non-radiative recombination such as Auger recombination. During this lifetime a fraction of electrons and holes may form excitons, this topic is still controversially discussed in the literature. The formation rate depends on the experimental conditions such as lattice temperature, excitation density, as well as on the general material parameters, e.g., the strength of the Coulomb-interaction or the exciton binding energy.\nThe characteristic time-scales are in the range of hundreds of picoseconds in GaAs; they appear to be much shorter in wide-gap semiconductors.\nDirectly after the excitation with short (femtosecond) pulses and the quasi-instantaneous decay of the polarization, the carrier distribution is mainly determined by the spectral width of the excitation, e.g., a laser pulse. The distribution is thus highly non-thermal and resembles a Gaussian distribution, centered at a finite momentum. In the first hundreds of femtoseconds, the carriers are scattered by phonons, or at elevated carrier densities via Coulomb-interaction. The carrier system successively relaxes to the Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution typically within the first picosecond. Finally, the carrier system cools down under the emission of phonons. This can take up to several nanoseconds, depending on the material system, the lattice temperature, and the excitation conditions such as the surplus energy.\nInitially, the carrier temperature decreases fast via emission of optical phonons. This is quite efficient due to the comparatively large energy associated with optical phonons, (36meV or 420K in GaAs) and their rather flat dispersion, allowing for a wide range of scattering processes under conservation of energy and momentum. Once the carrier temperature decreases below the value corresponding to the optical phonon energy, acoustic phonons dominate the relaxation. Here, cooling is less efficient due their dispersion and small energies and the temperature decreases much slower beyond the first tens of picoseconds. At elevated excitation densities, the carrier cooling is further inhibited by the so-called hot-phonon effect. The relaxation of a large number of hot carriers leads to a high generation rate of optical phonons which exceeds the decay rate into acoustic phonons. This creates a non-equilibrium \"over-population\" of optical phonons and thus causes their increased reabsorption by the charge-carriers significantly suppressing any cooling. Thus, a system cools slower, the higher the carrier density is.\nRadiative recombination.\nThe emission directly after the excitation is spectrally very broad, yet still centered in the vicinity of the strongest exciton resonance. As the carrier distribution relaxes and cools, the width of the PL peak decreases and the emission energy shifts to match the ground state of the exciton (such as an electron) for ideal samples without disorder. The PL spectrum approaches its quasi-steady-state shape defined by the distribution of electrons and holes. Increasing the excitation density will change the emission spectra. They are dominated by the excitonic ground state for low densities. Additional peaks from higher subband transitions appear as the carrier density or lattice temperature are increased as these states get more and more populated. Also, the width of the main PL peak increases significantly with rising excitation due to excitation-induced dephasing and the emission peak experiences a small shift in energy due to the Coulomb-renormalization and phase-filling.\nIn general, both exciton populations and plasma, uncorrelated electrons and holes, can act as sources for photoluminescence as described in the semiconductor-luminescence equations. Both yield very similar spectral features which are difficult to distinguish; their emission dynamics, however, vary significantly. The decay of excitons yields a single-exponential decay function since the probability of their radiative recombination does not depend on the carrier density. The probability of spontaneous emission for uncorrelated electrons and holes, is approximately proportional to the product of electron and hole populations eventually leading to a non-single-exponential decay described by a hyperbolic function.\nEffects of disorder.\nReal material systems always incorporate disorder. Examples are structural defects in the lattice or disorder due to variations of the chemical composition. Their treatment is extremely challenging for microscopic theories due to the lack of detailed knowledge about perturbations of the ideal structure. Thus, the influence of the extrinsic effects on the PL is usually addressed phenomenologically. In experiments, disorder can lead to localization of carriers and hence drastically increase the photoluminescence life times as localized carriers cannot as easily find nonradiative recombination centers as can free ones.\nResearchers from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have studied the photoinduced entropy (i.e. thermodynamic disorder) of InGaN/GaN p-i-n double-heterostructure and AlGaN nanowires using temperature-dependent photoluminescence. They defined the photoinduced entropy as a thermodynamic quantity that represents the unavailability of a system's energy for conversion into useful work due to carrier recombination and photon emission. They have also related the change in entropy generation to the change in photocarrier dynamics in the nanowire active regions using results from time-resolved photoluminescence study. They hypothesized that the amount of generated disorder in the InGaN layers eventually increases as the temperature approaches room temperature because of the thermal activation of surface states, while an insignificant increase was observed in AlGaN nanowires, indicating lower degrees of disorder-induced uncertainty in the wider bandgap semiconductor. To study the photoinduced entropy, the scientists have developed a mathematical model that considers the net energy exchange resulting from photoexcitation and photoluminescence.\nPhotoluminescence from metals.\nUnlike photoluminescence from semiconductors, photoluminescence from metals is a much weaker effect. In particular, its quantum yield is order of magnitude lower. Nevertheless, metal photoluminecence is of fundamental importance (e.g., for our understanding of electron structure and population dynamics in metals) as well as practical importance (e.g., for thermometry, see next Section).\nPhotoluminescent materials for temperature detection.\nIn phosphor thermometry, the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence process is exploited to measure temperature. Somewhat similarly, anti-Stokes photoluminescence from metals can be used for thermometry.\nExperimental methods.\n\"Photoluminescence spectroscopy\" is a widely used technique for characterisation of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors and molecules. The technique itself is fast, contactless, and nondestructive. Therefore, it can be used to study the optoelectronic properties of materials of various sizes (from microns to centimeters) during the fabrication process without complex sample preparation. For example, photoluminescence measurements of solar cell absorbers can predict the maximum voltage the material could produce. In chemistry, the method is more often referred to as fluorescence spectroscopy, but the instrumentation is the same. The relaxation processes can be studied using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to find the decay lifetime of the photoluminescence. These techniques can be combined with microscopy, to map the intensity (confocal microscopy) or the lifetime (fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy) of the photoluminescence across a sample (e.g. a semiconducting wafer, or a biological sample that has been marked with fluorescent molecules). Modulated photoluminescence is a specific method for measuring the complex frequency response of the photoluminescence signal to a sinusoidal excitation, allowing for the direct extraction of minority carrier lifetime without the need for intensity calibrations. It has been used to study the influence of interface defects on the recombination of excess carriers in crystalline silicon wafers with different passivation schemes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60875", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60875", "title": "Triboluminescence", "text": "Mechanical generation of light\nTriboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated when a material is mechanically pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed (see tribology). The phenomenon is not fully understood but appears in most cases to be caused by the separation and reunification of static electric charges, see also triboelectric effect. The term comes from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (\"to rub\"; see tribology) and the Latin \"lumen\" (light). Triboluminescence can be observed when breaking sugar crystals and peeling adhesive tapes.\n\"Triboluminescence\" is often a synonym for \"fractoluminescence\" (a term mainly used when referring only to light emitted from fractured crystals). Triboluminescence differs from piezoluminescence in that a piezoluminescent material emits light when deformed, as opposed to broken. These are examples of mechanoluminescence, which is luminescence resulting from any mechanical action on a solid.\nHistory.\nQuartz rattlers of the Uncompahgre Ute indigenous people.\nThe Uncompahgre Ute indigenous people from Central Colorado are one of the first documented groups of people in the world credited with the application of mechanoluminescence involving the use of quartz crystals to generate light. The Ute constructed unique ceremonial rattles made from buffalo rawhide which they filled with clear quartz crystals collected from the mountains of Colorado and Utah. When the rattles were shaken at night during ceremonies, the friction and mechanical stress of the quartz crystals impacting together produced flashes of light visible through the translucent buffalo hide.\nEarly scientific reports.\nThe first recorded observation is attributed to English scholar Francis Bacon when he recorded in his 1620 \"Novum Organum\" that \"It is well known that all sugar, whether candied or plain, if it be hard, will sparkle when broken or scraped in the dark.\" The scientist Robert Boyle also reported on some of his work on triboluminescence in 1663. In 1675. Astronomer Jean-Felix Picard observed that his barometer was glowing in the dark as he carried it. His barometer consisted of a glass tube that was partially filled with mercury. The empty space above the mercury would glow whenever the mercury slid down the glass tube.\nIn the late 1790s, sugar production began to produce more refined sugar crystals. These crystals were formed into a large solid cone for transport and sale. This solid sugar cone had to be broken into usable chunks using a sugar nips device. People began to notice that tiny bursts of light were visible as sugar was \"nipped\" in low light, an established example of triboluminescence.\nMechanism of action.\nThere remain a few ambiguities about the effect. The current theory of triboluminescence\u2014based upon crystallographic, spectroscopic, and other experimental evidence\u2014is that upon fracture of asymmetrical materials, charge is separated. When the charges recombine, the electrical discharge ionizes the surrounding air, causing a flash of light. Research further suggests that crystals that display triboluminescence often lack symmetry and are poor conductors. However, there are substances which break this rule, and which do not possess asymmetry, yet display triboluminescence, such as hexakis(antipyrine)terbium iodide. It is thought that these materials contain impurities, which make the substance locally asymmetric. Further information on some of the possible processes involved can be found in the page on the triboelectric effect.\nThe biological phenomenon of triboluminescence is thought to be controlled by recombination of free radicals during mechanical activation.\nExamples.\nIn common materials.\nCertain household materials and substances can be seen to exhibit the property:\nA diamond may begin to glow while being rubbed; this occasionally happens to diamonds while a facet is being ground or the diamond is being sawn during the cutting process. Diamonds may fluoresce blue or red. Some other minerals, such as quartz, are triboluminescent, emitting light when rubbed together.\nTriboluminescence as a biological phenomenon is observed in mechanical deformation and contact electrification of epidermal surface of osseous and soft tissues, during chewing food, at friction in joints of vertebrae, during sexual intercourse, and during blood circulation.\nWater jet abrasive cutting of ceramics (e.g., tiles) creates a yellow/orange glow at the point of impact of very high-speed flow.\nFractoluminescence.\n\"Fractoluminescence\" is often used as a synonym for triboluminescence. It is the emission of light from the fracture (rather than rubbing) of a crystal, but fracturing often occurs with rubbing. Depending upon the atomic and molecular composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures, a charge separation can occur, making one side of the fractured crystal positively charged and the other side negatively charged. Like in triboluminescence, if the charge separation results in a large enough electric potential, a discharge across the gap and through the bath gas between the interfaces can occur. The potential at which this occurs depends upon the dielectric properties of the bath gas.\nEMR propagation during fracturing.\nThe emission of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) during plastic deformation and crack propagation in metals and rocks has been studied. The EMR emissions from metals and alloys have also been explored and confirmed. Molotskii presented a dislocation mechanism for this type of EMR emission. In 2005, Srilakshmi and Misra reported an additional phenomenon of secondary EMR during plastic deformation and crack propagation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys.\nEMR during the micro-plastic deformation and crack propagation from several metals and alloys and transient magnetic field generation during necking in ferromagnetic metals were reported by Misra (1973\u201375), which have been confirmed and explored by several researchers. Tudik and Valuev (1980) were able to measure the EMR frequency during tensile fracture of iron and aluminum in the region 100\u00a0THz by using photomultipliers. Srilakshmi and Misra (2005a) also reported an additional phenomenon of secondary electromagnetic radiation in uncoated and metal-coated metals and alloys. If a solid material is subjected to stresses of large amplitudes, which can cause plastic deformation and fracture, emissions such as thermal, acoustic, ions, and exo-emissions occur.\nDeformation induced EMR.\nThe study of deformation is essential for the development of new materials. Deformation in metals depends on temperature, type of stress applied, strain rate, oxidation, and corrosion. Deformation-induced EMR can be divided into three categories: effects in ionic crystal materials, effects in rocks and granites, and effects in metals and alloys. EMR emission depends on the orientation of the grains in individual crystals since material properties are different in differing directions. Amplitude of the EMR pulse increases as long as the crack grows as new atomic bonds are broken, leading to EMR. The pulse starts to decay as the cracking halts. Observations from experiments showed that emitted EMR signals contain mixed frequency components.\nTest methods to measure EMR.\nThe most widely used tensile test method is used to characterize the mechanical properties of materials. From any complete tensile test record, one can obtain important information about the material's elastic properties, the character and extent of plastic deformation, yield, and tensile strengths and toughness. The information obtained from one test justifies the extensive use of tensile tests in engineering materials research. Therefore, investigations of EMR emissions are mainly based on the tensile test of the specimens. From experiments, it can be shown that tensile crack formation excites more intensive EMR than shear cracking, increasing the elasticity, strength, and loading rate during uniaxial loading increases amplitude. Poisson's ratio is a key parameter for EMR characterization during triaxial compression. If the Poisson's ratio is lower, it is harder for the material to strain transversally and hence there is a higher probability of new fractures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60876", "revid": "46642245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60876", "title": "Markov chain", "text": "Random process independent of past history\nIn probability theory and statistics, a Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic process describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, \"What happens next depends only on the state of affairs \"now\".\" A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Markov processes are named in honor of the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.\nMarkov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes. They provide the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, and have found application in areas including Bayesian statistics, biology, chemistry, economics, finance, information theory, physics, signal processing, and speech processing.\nThe adjectives \"Markovian\" and \"Markov\" are used to describe something that is related to a Markov process.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrinciples.\nDefinition.\nA Markov process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property (sometimes characterized as \"memorylessness\"). In simpler terms, it is a process for which predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based solely on its present state and\u2014most importantly\u2014such predictions are just as good as the ones that could be made knowing the process's full history. In other words, conditional on the present state of the system, its future and past states are independent.\nA Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either a discrete state space or a discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).\nTypes of Markov chains.\nThe system's state space and time parameter index need to be specified. The following table gives an overview of the different instances of Markov processes for different levels of state space generality for both discrete and continuous time:\nNote that there is no definitive agreement in the literature on the use of some of the terms that signify special cases of Markov processes. Usually the term \"Markov chain\" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is, a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), but a few authors use the term \"Markov process\" to refer to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) without explicit mention. In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see Markov model). Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the state space of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space. However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or countably infinite state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see Variations). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\nTransitions.\nThe changes of state of the system are called transitions. The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a transition matrix describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.\nA discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps. The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the integers or natural numbers, and the random process is a mapping of these to states. The Markov property states that the conditional probability distribution for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.\nSince the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future. However, the statistical properties of the system's future can be predicted. In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.\nHistory.\nAndrey Markov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906. Markov processes in continuous time were discovered long before his work in the early 20th century in the form of the Poisson process. Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences, motivated by a disagreement with Pavel Nekrasov who claimed independence was necessary for the weak law of large numbers to hold. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector of values, so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains.\nIn 1912 Henri Poincar\u00e9 studied Markov chains on finite groups with an aim to study card shuffling. Other early uses of Markov chains include a diffusion model, introduced by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest in 1907, and a branching process, introduced by Francis Galton and Henry William Watson in 1873, preceding the work of Markov. After the work of Galton and Watson, it was later revealed that their branching process had been independently discovered and studied around three decades earlier by Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e-Jules Bienaym\u00e9. Starting in 1928, Maurice Fr\u00e9chet became interested in Markov chains, eventually resulting in him publishing in 1938 a detailed study on Markov chains.\nAndrey Kolmogorov developed in a 1931 paper a large part of the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmogorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov\u2013Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.\nExamples.\nA non-Markov example.\nSuppose that there is a coin purse containing five coins worth 25\u00a2, five coins worth 10\u00a2 and five coins worth 5\u00a2, and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If formula_1 represents the total value of the coins set on the table after n draws, with formula_2, then the sequence formula_3 is \"not\" a Markov process.\nTo see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus formula_4. If we know not just formula_5, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that formula_6 with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value formula_5 we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about formula_8 are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to formula_5.\nHowever, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining formula_1 to represent the \"total value\" of the coins on the table, we could define formula_1 to represent the \"count\" of the various coin types on the table. For instance, formula_12 could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model could be represented by formula_13 possible states, where each state represents the number of coins of each type (from 0 to 5) that are on the table. (Not all of these states are reachable within 6 draws.) Suppose that the first draw results in state formula_14. The probability of achieving formula_15 now depends on formula_16; for example, the state formula_17 is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the formula_18 state depends exclusively on the outcome of the formula_19 state.\nFormal definition.\nDiscrete-time Markov chain.\nA discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables \"X\"1, \"X\"2, \"X\"3, ... with the Markov property, namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:\nformula_20 if both conditional probabilities are well defined, that is, if formula_21\nThe possible values of \"X\"\"i\" form a countable set \"S\" called the state space of the chain.\nFinite state space.\nIf the state space is finite, the transition probability distribution can be represented by a matrix, called the transition matrix, with the (\"i\", \"j\")th element of P equal to\nformula_29\nSince each row of P sums to one and all elements are non-negative, P is a right stochastic matrix.\nStationary distribution relation to eigenvectors and simplices.\nA stationary distribution \u03c0 is a (row) vector, whose entries are non-negative and sum to 1, is unchanged by the operation of transition matrix P on it and so is defined by\nformula_30\nBy comparing this definition with that of an eigenvector we see that the two concepts are related and that\nformula_31\nis a normalized (formula_32) multiple of a left eigenvector e of the transition matrix P with an eigenvalue of 1. If there is more than one unit eigenvector then a weighted sum of the corresponding stationary states is also a stationary state. But for a Markov chain one is usually more interested in a stationary state that is the limit of the sequence of distributions for some initial distribution.\nThe values of a stationary distribution formula_33 are associated with the state space of P and its eigenvectors have their relative proportions preserved. Since the components of \u03c0 are positive and the constraint that their sum is unity can be rewritten as formula_34 we see that the dot product of \u03c0 with a vector whose components are all 1 is unity and that \u03c0 lies on a simplex.\nTime-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state space.\nIf the Markov chain is time-homogeneous, then the transition matrix P is the same after each step, so the \"k\"-step transition probability can be computed as the \"k\"-th power of the transition matrix, P\"k\".\nIf the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then there is a unique stationary distribution \u03c0. Additionally, in this case P\"k\" converges to a rank-one matrix in which each row is the stationary distribution \u03c0:\nformula_35\nwhere 1 is the column vector with all entries equal to 1. This is stated by the Perron\u2013Frobenius theorem. If, by whatever means, formula_36 is found, then the stationary distribution of the Markov chain in question can be easily determined for any starting distribution, as will be explained below.\nFor some stochastic matrices P, the limit formula_36 does not exist while the stationary distribution does, as shown by this example:\nformula_38\nformula_39\nBecause there are a number of different special cases to consider, the process of finding this limit if it exists can be a lengthy task. However, there are many techniques that can assist in finding this limit. Let P be an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" matrix, and define formula_40\nIt is always true that\nformula_41\nSubtracting Q from both sides and factoring then yields\nformula_42\nwhere I\"n\" is the identity matrix of size \"n\", and 0\"n\",\"n\" is the zero matrix of size \"n\"\u00d7\"n\". Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so Q must be a stochastic matrix (see the definition above). It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above and the fact that Q is a stochastic matrix to solve for Q. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in P is 1, there are \"n+1\" equations for determining \"n\" unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in Q and substitutes each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitutes the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector 0, and next left-multiplies this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find Q.\nHere is one method for doing so: first, define the function \"f\"(A) to return the matrix A with its right-most column replaced with all 1's. If [\"f\"(P \u2212 I\"n\")]\u22121 exists then\nformula_43\nExplain: The original matrix equation is equivalent to a system of n\u00d7n linear equations in \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" variables. And there are \"n\" more linear equations from the fact that Q is a right stochastic matrix whose each row sums to 1. So it needs any \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" independent linear equations of the (\"n\"\u00d7\"n\"+\"n\") equations to solve for the \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" variables. In this example, the \"n\" equations from \"Q multiplied by the right-most column of (P-I\"n\")\" have been replaced by the \"n\" stochastic ones.\nOne thing to notice is that if P has an element P\"i\",\"i\" on its main diagonal that is equal to 1 and the \"i\"th row or column is otherwise filled with 0's, then that row or column will remain unchanged in all of the subsequent powers P\"k\". Hence, the \"i\"th row or column of Q will have the 1 and the 0's in the same positions as in P.\nConvergence speed to the stationary distribution.\nAs stated earlier, from the equation formula_44 (if exists) the stationary (or steady state) distribution \u03c0 is a left eigenvector of row stochastic matrix P. Then assuming that P is diagonalizable or equivalently that P has \"n\" linearly independent eigenvectors, speed of convergence is elaborated as follows. (For non-diagonalizable, that is, defective matrices, one may start with the Jordan normal form of P and proceed with a bit more involved set of arguments in a similar way.)\nLet U be the matrix of eigenvectors (each normalized to having an L2 norm equal to 1) where each column is a left eigenvector of P and let \u03a3 be the diagonal matrix of left eigenvalues of P, that is, \u03a3 = diag(\"\u03bb\"1,\"\u03bb\"2,\"\u03bb\"3...,\"\u03bb\"\"n\"). Then by eigendecomposition\nformula_45\nLet the eigenvalues be enumerated such that:\nformula_46\nSince P is a row stochastic matrix, its largest left eigenvalue is 1. If there is a unique stationary distribution, then the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector is unique too (because there is no other \u03c0 which solves the stationary distribution equation above). Let u\"i\" be the \"i\"-th column of U matrix, that is, u\"i\" is the left eigenvector of P corresponding to \u03bb\"i\". Also let x be a length \"n\" row vector that represents a valid probability distribution; since the eigenvectors u\"i\" span formula_47 we can write\nformula_48\nIf we multiply x with P from right and continue this operation with the results, in the end we get the stationary distribution \u03c0. In other words, \u03c0 = a1 u1 \u2190 xPP...P = xP\"k\" as \"k\" \u2192 \u221e. That means\nformula_49\nSince \u03c0 is parallel to u1(normalized by L2 norm) and \u03c0(\"k\") is a probability vector, \u03c0(\"k\") approaches to a1 u1 = \u03c0 as \"k\" \u2192 \u221e with a speed in the order of \"\u03bb\"2/\"\u03bb\"1 exponentially. This follows because formula_50 hence \"\u03bb\"2/\"\u03bb\"1 is the dominant term. The smaller the ratio is, the faster the convergence is. Random noise in the state distribution \u03c0 can also speed up this convergence to the stationary distribution.\nContinuous-time Markov chain.\nA continuous-time Markov chain formula_51 is defined by a finite or countable state space \"S\", a transition rate matrix \"Q\" with dimensions equal to that of the state space and initial probability distribution defined on the state space. For \"i\"\u00a0\u2260\u00a0\"j\", the elements \"q\"\"ij\" are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state \"i\" to state \"j\". The elements \"q\"\"ii\" are chosen such that each row of the transition rate matrix sums to zero, while the row-sums of a probability transition matrix in a (discrete) Markov chain are all equal to one.\nThere are three equivalent definitions of the process.\nInfinitesimal definition.\nLet formula_52 be the random variable describing the state of the process at time \"t\", and assume the process is in a state \"i\" at time \"t\". \nThen, knowing formula_53, formula_54 is independent of previous values formula_55, and as \"h\" \u2192 0 for all \"j\" and for all \"t\",\nformula_56\nwhere formula_57 is the Kronecker delta, using the little-o notation.\nThe formula_58 can be seen as measuring how quickly the transition from \"i\" to \"j\" happens.\nJump chain/holding time definition.\nDefine a discrete-time Markov chain \"Y\"\"n\" to describe the \"n\"th jump of the process and variables \"S\"1, \"S\"2, \"S\"3, ... to describe holding times in each of the states where \"S\"\"i\" follows the exponential distribution with rate parameter \u2212\"q\"\"Y\"\"i\"\"Y\"\"i\".\nTransition probability definition.\nFor any value \"n\" = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and times indexed up to this value of \"n\": \"t\"0, \"t\"1, \"t\"2, ... and all states recorded at these times \"i\"0, \"i\"1, \"i\"2, \"i\"3, ... it holds that\nformula_59\nwhere \"p\"\"ij\" is the solution of the forward equation (a first-order differential equation)\nformula_60\nwith initial condition P(0) is the identity matrix.\nLocally interacting Markov chains.\n\"Locally interacting Markov chains\" are Markov chains with an evolution that takes into account the state of other Markov chains. This corresponds to the situation when the state space has a (Cartesian-) product form.\nSee interacting particle system and stochastic cellular automata (probabilistic cellular automata).\nSee for instance \"Interaction of Markov Processes\"\nor.\nDiscrete-time Markov process with general state space.\nHarris chains.\nMany results for discrete-time Markov chains with finite state space can be generalized to chains with uncountable state space through Harris chains.\nThe use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.\nContinuous-time Markov process with general state space.\nThe definition of Markov processes in continuous time with general state space is more technical than the above.\nA continuous-time Markov process formula_61 is a stochastic process adapted to a filtration formula_62 with values in a locally compact Polish space formula_63 (e.g., formula_64). The latter essentially ensures that the conditional expectations of formula_52 are regular, which, in simple terms, means that they behave \"nicely\". Then formula_66 is called a \"Markov process\", if it satisfies the Markov property, i.e., for all formula_67 and formula_68\nformula_69.\nMoreover, formula_66 is called \"time-homogeneous\", if it satisfies the weak Markov property for all formula_71:\nformula_72.\nThe function formula_73 is the so-called \"transition function\" of formula_66 and formula_75 the \"transition semigroup\" of the process. Transition functions are generalizations of the transition matrices used in the setting with finite state space.\nIn a more abstract way, Markov processes can also be defined or constructed the other way around: Let formula_75 be a transition semigroup, i.e.,\nwhere formula_81 is the Dirac-measure in formula_82, and formula_83. Then formula_66 is a homogeneous Markov process w.r.t. the natural filtration formula_85, if for all formula_86, formula_87 the underlying probability measure formula_88 satisfies\nformula_89.\nOr, if no probability measure formula_88 has been specified, the above equation defines a measure formula_91 on formula_92 under which the process formula_66 started in formula_82 is a Markov process by construction.\nIn other words, Markov processes can be defined either as stochastic processes formula_66 on a filtered probability space, or indirectly in terms of a transition semigroup (i.e., the transition probabilities of the process), which induces a probability space under which formula_66 has the Markov property.\nProperties.\nTwo states are said to \"communicate\" with each other if both are reachable from one another by a sequence of transitions that have positive probability. This is an equivalence relation which yields a set of communicating classes. A class is \"closed\" if the probability of leaving the class is zero. A Markov chain is \"irreducible\" if there is one communicating class, the state space.\nA state \"i\" has period \"k\" if \"k\" is the greatest common divisor of the number of transitions by which \"i\" can be reached, starting from \"i\". That is:\nformula_97\nThe state is \"periodic\" if formula_98; otherwise formula_99 and the state is \"aperiodic\".\nA state \"i\" is said to be \"transient\" if, starting from \"i\", there is a non-zero probability that the chain will never return to \"i\". It is called \"recurrent\" (or \"persistent\") otherwise. For a recurrent state \"i\", the mean \"hitting time\" is defined as:\nformula_100\nState \"i\" is \"positive recurrent\" if formula_101 is finite and \"null recurrent\" otherwise. Periodicity, transience, recurrence and positive and null recurrence are class properties \u2014 that is, if one state has the property then all states in its communicating class have the property.\nA state \"i\" is called \"absorbing\" if there are no outgoing transitions from the state.\nIrreducibility.\nSince periodicity is a class property, if a Markov chain is irreducible, then all its states have the same period. In particular, if one state is aperiodic, then the whole Markov chain is aperiodic.\nIf a finite Markov chain is irreducible, then all states are positive recurrent, and it has a unique stationary distribution given by formula_102.\nErgodicity.\nA state \"i\" is said to be \"ergodic\" if it is aperiodic and positive recurrent. In other words, a state \"i\" is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of 1, and has finite mean recurrence time.\nIf all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic. Equivalently, there exists some integer formula_103 such that all entries of formula_104 are positive.\nIt can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number \"N\" such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number \"N\". In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with\u00a0\"N\"\u00a0=\u00a01.\nA Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.\nTerminology.\nSome authors call any irreducible, positive recurrent Markov chains ergodic, even periodic ones. In fact, merely irreducible Markov chains correspond to ergodic processes, defined according to ergodic theory.\nSome authors call a matrix \"primitive\" if there exists some integer formula_103 such that all entries of formula_104 are positive. Some authors call it \"regular\".\nIndex of primitivity.\nThe \"index of primitivity\", or \"exponent\", of a regular matrix, is the smallest formula_103 such that all entries of formula_104 are positive. The exponent is purely a graph-theoretic property, since it depends only on whether each entry of formula_109 is zero or positive, and therefore can be found on a directed graph with formula_110 as its adjacency matrix. \nThere are several combinatorial results about the exponent when there are finitely many states. Let formula_111 be the number of states, then\nMeasure-preserving dynamical system.\nIf a Markov chain has a stationary distribution, then it can be converted to a measure-preserving dynamical system: Let the probability space be formula_125, where formula_126 is the set of all states for the Markov chain. Let the sigma-algebra on the probability space be generated by the cylinder sets. Let the probability measure be generated by the stationary distribution, and the Markov chain transition. Let formula_127 be the shift operator: formula_128. Similarly we can construct such a dynamical system with formula_129 instead.\nSince \"irreducible\" Markov chains with finite state spaces have a unique stationary distribution, the above construction is unambiguous for irreducible Markov chains.\nIn ergodic theory, a measure-preserving dynamical system is called \"ergodic\" if any measurable subset formula_130 such that formula_131 implies formula_132 or formula_133 (up to a null set).\nThe terminology is inconsistent. Given a Markov chain with a stationary distribution that is strictly positive on all states, the Markov chain is \"irreducible\" if its corresponding measure-preserving dynamical system is \"ergodic\".\nMarkovian representations.\nIn some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the \"current\" and \"future\" states. For example, let \"X\" be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process \"Y\", such that each state of \"Y\" represents a time-interval of states of \"X\". Mathematically, this takes the form:\nformula_134\nIf \"Y\" has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of \"X\".\nAn example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an autoregressive time series of order greater than one.\nHitting times.\nThe \"hitting time\" is the time, starting in a given set of states, until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.\nExpected hitting times.\nFor a subset of states \"A\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"S\", the vector \"k\"\"A\" of hitting times (where element formula_135 represents the expected value, starting in state \"i\" that the chain enters one of the states in the set \"A\") is the minimal non-negative solution to\nformula_136\nTime reversal.\nFor a general Markov process formula_66 in continuous time (a CTMC or a process with general state space), the reverse process formula_138 from a fixed time formula_139 is again a Markov process. This follows directly from the Markov property: Informally speaking, the future and the past are independent given the present. Under time-reversal, their roles are just interchanged. However, the reverse process is not time-homogeneous in general. If for some random time formula_140 (not necessarily a stopping time) the stopped process formula_141 is a time-homogeneous Markov process, then the reverse process formula_142 is again time-homogeneous.\nIf formula_66 is a CTMC, then by Kelly's lemma formula_144 has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.\nA chain is said to be \"reversible\" if the reversed process is the same as the forward process (in distribution). Kolmogorov's criterion states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.\nEmbedded Markov chain.\nOne method of finding the stationary probability distribution, \u03c0, of an ergodic continuous-time Markov chain, \"Q\", is by first finding its embedded Markov chain (EMC). Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a jump process. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, \"S\", is denoted by \"s\"\"ij\", and represents the conditional probability of transitioning from state \"i\" into state \"j\". These conditional probabilities may be found by\nformula_145\nFrom this, \"S\" may be written as\nformula_146\nwhere \"I\" is the identity matrix and diag(\"Q\") is the diagonal matrix formed by selecting the main diagonal from the matrix \"Q\" and setting all other elements to zero.\nTo find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find formula_147 such that\nformula_148\nwith formula_147 being a row vector, such that all elements in formula_147 are greater than 0 and formula_151 = 1. From this, \u03c0 may be found as\nformula_152\nAnother discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a \u03b4-skeleton\u2014the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing \"X\"(\"t\") at intervals of \u03b4 units of time. The random variables \"X\"(0),\u00a0\"X\"(\u03b4),\u00a0\"X\"(2\u03b4),\u00a0... give the sequence of states visited by the \u03b4-skeleton.\nSpecial types of Markov chains.\nMarkov model.\nMarkov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:\nBernoulli scheme.\nA Bernoulli scheme is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is independent of even the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states). A Bernoulli scheme with only two possible states is known as a Bernoulli process.\nNote, however, by the Ornstein isomorphism theorem, that every aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain is isomorphic to a Bernoulli scheme; thus, one might equally claim that Markov chains are a \"special case\" of Bernoulli schemes. The isomorphism generally requires a complicated recoding. The isomorphism theorem is even a bit stronger: it states that \"any\" stationary stochastic process is isomorphic to a Bernoulli scheme; the Markov chain is just one such example.\nSubshift of finite type.\nWhen the Markov matrix is replaced by the adjacency matrix of a finite graph, the resulting shift is termed a topological Markov chain or a subshift of finite type. A Markov matrix that is compatible with the adjacency matrix can then provide a measure on the subshift. Many chaotic dynamical systems are isomorphic to topological Markov chains; examples include diffeomorphisms of closed manifolds, the Prouhet\u2013Thue\u2013Morse system, the Chacon system, sofic systems, context-free systems and block-coding systems.\nApplications.\nMarkov chains have been employed in a wide range of topics across the natural and social sciences, and in technological applications. They have been used for forecasting in several areas: for example, price trends, wind power, terrorism risk, and solar irradiance. The Markov chain forecasting models utilize a variety of settings, from discretizing the time series, to hidden Markov models combined with wavelets, and the Markov chain mixture distribution model (MCM).\nPhysics.\nMarkovian systems appear extensively in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, whenever probabilities are used to represent unknown or unmodelled details of the system, if it can be assumed that the dynamics are time-invariant, and that no relevant history need be considered which is not already included in the state description. For example, a thermodynamic state operates under a probability distribution that is difficult or expensive to acquire. Therefore, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method can be used to draw samples randomly from a black-box to approximate the probability distribution of attributes over a range of objects.\nMarkov chains are used in lattice QCD simulations.\nChemistry.\n&lt;chem&gt;{E} + \\underset{Substrate\\atop binding}{S &lt;=&gt; E}\\overset{Catalytic\\atop step}{S -&gt; E} + P&lt;/chem&gt; Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The enzyme (E) binds a substrate (S) and produces a product (P). Each reaction is a state transition in a Markov chain.A reaction network is a chemical system involving multiple reactions and chemical species. The simplest stochastic models of such networks treat the system as a continuous time Markov chain with the state being the number of molecules of each species and with reactions modeled as possible transitions of the chain. Markov chains and continuous-time Markov processes are useful in chemistry when physical systems closely approximate the Markov property. For example, imagine a large number \"n\" of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is \"n\" times the probability a given molecule is in that state.\nThe classical model of enzyme activity, Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics, can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step the reaction proceeds in some direction. While Michaelis-Menten is fairly straightforward, far more complicated reaction networks can also be modeled with Markov chains.\nAn algorithm based on a Markov chain was also used to focus the fragment-based growth of chemicals in silico towards a desired class of compounds such as drugs or natural products. As a molecule is grown, a fragment is selected from the nascent molecule as the \"current\" state. It is not aware of its past (that is, it is not aware of what is already bonded to it). It then transitions to the next state when a fragment is attached to it. The transition probabilities are trained on databases of authentic classes of compounds.\nAlso, the growth (and composition) of copolymers may be modeled using Markov chains. Based on the reactivity ratios of the monomers that make up the growing polymer chain, the chain's composition may be calculated (for example, whether monomers tend to add in alternating fashion or in long runs of the same monomer). Due to steric effects, second-order Markov effects may also play a role in the growth of some polymer chains.\nSimilarly, it has been suggested that the crystallization and growth of some epitaxial superlattice oxide materials can be accurately described by Markov chains.\nBiology.\nMarkov chains are used in various areas of biology. Notable examples include:\nTesting.\nSeveral theorists have proposed the idea of the Markov chain statistical test (MCST), a method of conjoining Markov chains to form a \"Markov blanket\", arranging these chains in several recursive layers (\"wafering\") and producing more efficient test sets\u2014samples\u2014as a replacement for exhaustive testing.\nSolar irradiance variability.\nSolar irradiance variability assessments are useful for solar power applications. Solar irradiance variability at any location over time is mainly a consequence of the deterministic variability of the sun's path across the sky dome and the variability in cloudiness. The variability of accessible solar irradiance on Earth's surface has been modeled using Markov chains, also including modeling the two states of clear and cloudiness as a two-state Markov chain.\nSpeech recognition.\nHidden Markov models have been used in automatic speech recognition systems.\nInformation theory.\nMarkov chains are used throughout information processing. Claude Shannon's famous 1948 paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\", which in a single step created the field of information theory, opens by introducing the concept of entropy by modeling texts in a natural language (such as English) as generated by an ergodic Markov process, where each letter may depend statistically on previous letters. Such idealized models can capture many of the statistical regularities of systems. Even without describing the full structure of the system perfectly, such signal models can make possible very effective data compression through entropy encoding techniques such as arithmetic coding. They also allow effective state estimation and pattern recognition. Markov chains also play an important role in reinforcement learning.\nMarkov chains are also the basis for hidden Markov models, which are an important tool in such diverse fields as telephone networks (which use the Viterbi algorithm for error correction), speech recognition and bioinformatics (such as in rearrangements detection).\nThe LZMA lossless data compression algorithm combines Markov chains with Lempel-Ziv compression to achieve very high compression ratios.\nQueueing theory.\nMarkov chains are the basis for the analytical treatment of queues (queueing theory). Agner Krarup Erlang initiated the subject in 1917. This makes them critical for optimizing the performance of telecommunications networks, where messages must often compete for limited resources (such as bandwidth).\nNumerous queueing models use continuous-time Markov chains. For example, an M/M/1 queue is a CTMC on the non-negative integers where upward transitions from \"i\" to \"i\"\u00a0+\u00a01 occur at rate \"\u03bb\" according to a Poisson process and describe job arrivals, while transitions from \"i\" to \"i\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a01 (for \"i\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a01) occur at rate \"\u03bc\" (job service times are exponentially distributed) and describe completed services (departures) from the queue.\nInternet applications.\nThe PageRank of a webpage as used by Google is defined by a Markov chain. It is the probability to be at page formula_153 in the stationary distribution on the following Markov chain on all (known) webpages. If formula_154 is the number of known webpages, and a page formula_153 has formula_156 links to it then it has transition probability formula_157 for all pages that are linked to and formula_158 for all pages that are not linked to. The parameter formula_159 is taken to be about 0.15.\nMarkov models have also been used to analyze web navigation behavior of users. A user's web link transition on a particular website can be modeled using first- or second-order Markov models and can be used to make predictions regarding future navigation and to personalize the web page for an individual user.\nStatistics.\nMarkov chain methods have also become very important for generating sequences of random numbers to accurately reflect very complicated desired probability distributions, via a process called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In recent years this has revolutionized the practicability of Bayesian inference methods, allowing a wide range of posterior distributions to be simulated and their parameters found numerically.\nConflict and combat.\nIn 1971 a Naval Postgraduate School Master's thesis proposed to model a variety of combat between adversaries as a Markov chain \"with states reflecting the control, maneuver, target acquisition, and target destruction actions of a weapons system\" and discussed the parallels between the resulting Markov chain and Lanchester's laws.\nIn 1975 Duncan and Siverson remarked that Markov chains could be used to model conflict between state actors, and thought that their analysis would help understand \"the behavior of social and political organizations in situations of conflict.\"\nEconomics and finance.\nMarkov chains are used in finance and economics to model a variety of different phenomena, including the distribution of income, the size distribution of firms, asset prices and market crashes. D. G. Champernowne built a Markov chain model of the distribution of income in 1953. Herbert A. Simon and co-author Charles Bonini used a Markov chain model to derive a stationary Yule distribution of firm sizes. Louis Bachelier was the first to observe that stock prices followed a random walk. The random walk was later seen as evidence in favor of the efficient-market hypothesis and random walk models were popular in the literature of the 1960s. Regime-switching models of business cycles were popularized by James D. Hamilton (1989), who used a Markov chain to model switches between periods of high and low GDP growth (or, alternatively, economic expansions and recessions). A more recent example is the Markov switching multifractal model of Laurent E. Calvet and Adlai J. Fisher, which builds upon the convenience of earlier regime-switching models. It uses an arbitrarily large Markov chain to drive the level of volatility of asset returns.\nDynamic macroeconomics makes heavy use of Markov chains. An example is using Markov chains to exogenously model prices of equity (stock) in a general equilibrium setting.\nCredit rating agencies produce annual tables of the transition probabilities for bonds of different credit ratings.\nSocial sciences.\nMarkov chains are generally used in describing path-dependent arguments, where current structural configurations condition future outcomes. An example is the reformulation of the idea, originally due to Karl Marx's , tying economic development to the rise of capitalism. In current research, it is common to use a Markov chain to model how once a country reaches a specific level of economic development, the configuration of structural factors, such as size of the middle class, the ratio of urban to rural residence, the rate of political mobilization, etc., will generate a higher probability of transitioning from authoritarian to democratic regime.\nMusic.\nMarkov chains are employed in algorithmic music composition, particularly in software such as Csound, Max, and SuperCollider. In a first-order chain, the states of the system become note or pitch values, and a probability vector for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be MIDI note values, frequency (Hz), or any other desirable metric.\nA second-order Markov chain can be introduced by considering the current state \"and\" also the previous state, as indicated in the second table. Higher, \"n\"th-order chains tend to \"group\" particular notes together, while 'breaking off' into other patterns and sequences occasionally. These higher-order chains tend to generate results with a sense of phrasal structure, rather than the 'aimless wandering' produced by a first-order system.\nMarkov chains can be used structurally, as in Xenakis's Analogique A and B. Markov chains are also used in systems which use a Markov model to react interactively to music input.\nUsually musical systems need to enforce specific control constraints on the finite-length sequences they generate, but control constraints are not compatible with Markov models, since they induce long-range dependencies that violate the Markov hypothesis of limited memory. In order to overcome this limitation, a new approach has been proposed.\nGames and sports.\nMarkov chains can be used to model many games of chance. The children's games Snakes and Ladders and \"Hi Ho! Cherry-O\", for example, are represented exactly by Markov chains. At each turn, the player starts in a given state (on a given square) and from there has fixed odds of moving to certain other states (squares).\nMarkov chain models have been used in advanced baseball analysis since 1960, although their use is still rare. Each half-inning of a baseball game fits the Markov chain state when the number of runners and outs are considered. During any at-bat, there are 24 possible combinations of number of outs and position of the runners. Mark Pankin shows that Markov chain models can be used to evaluate runs created for both individual players as well as a team.\nHe also discusses various kinds of strategies and play conditions: how Markov chain models have been used to analyze statistics for game situations such as bunting and base stealing and differences when playing on grass vs. AstroTurf.\nMarkov text generators.\nMarkov processes can also be used to generate superficially real-looking text given a sample document. Markov processes are used in a variety of recreational \"parody generator\" software (see dissociated press, Jeff Harrison, Mark V. Shaney, and Academias Neutronium). Several open-source text generation libraries using Markov chains exist.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cutting diamonds requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty.\nThe first guild of diamond cutters and polishers (Diamantaire) was formed in 1375 in Nuremberg, Germany, and led to the development of various types of \"cut\". This has two meanings in relation to diamonds. The first is the shape: square, oval, and so on. The second relates to the specific quality of cut within the shape, and the quality and price will vary greatly based on the cut quality. Since diamonds are one of the hardest materials, special diamond-coated surfaces are used to grind the diamond down. The first major development in diamond cutting came with the \"Point Cut\" during the later half of the 14th century: the Point Cut follows the natural shape of an octahedral rough diamond crystal, eliminating some waste in the cutting process.\nDiamond cutting, as well as overall processing, is concentrated in a few cities around the world. The main diamond trading centers are Antwerp, Tel Aviv, and Dubai from where roughs are sent to the main processing centers of India and China. Diamonds are cut and polished in Surat, India and the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen. India in recent years has held between 90% of the world market in polished diamonds and China has held the rest of the world market share in a recent year. Other important diamond centers are New York City and Amsterdam.\nDiamond cutting process.\nThe basic diamond cutting process includes these steps; \"planning\", \"cleaving\" or \"sawing\", \"bruting\", \"polishing\", and \"final inspection\". A simplified round brilliant cut process includes the following stages:\nThis is just one, although a fairly common way of creating a round brilliant cut. The actual process also includes many more stages depending on the size and quality of the rough stone. For example, bigger stones are first scanned to get the three-dimensional shape, which is then used to find the optimal usage. The scanning may be repeated after each stage and bruting may be done in several steps, each bringing the girdle closer to the final shape.\nIt is possible only because the hardness of diamond varies widely according to the direction in which one is trying to cut or grind.\nPlanning.\nDiamond manufacturers analyze diamond rough from an economic perspective, with two objectives steering decisions made about how a faceted diamond will be cut. The first objective is that of maximum return on investment for the piece of diamond rough. The second is how quickly the finished diamond can be sold. Scanning devices are used to get a 3-dimensional computer model of the rough stone. Also, inclusions are photographed and placed on the 3D model, which is then used to find an optimal way to cut the stone.\nMaximizing value.\nThe process of maximizing the value of finished diamonds, from a rough diamond into a polished gemstone, is both an art and a science. The choice of cut is influenced by many factors. Market factors include the exponential increase in value of diamonds as weight increases, referred to as \"weight retention\", and the popularity of certain shapes amongst consumers. Physical factors include the original shape of the rough stone, and location of the inclusions and flaws to be eliminated.\nWeight retention.\nThe weight retention analysis studies the diamond rough to find the best combination of finished stones as it relates to \"per carat\" value. For instance, a 2.20-carat (440\u00a0mg) octahedron may produce (i) either two half-carat (100\u00a0mg) diamonds whose combined value may be higher than that of (ii) a 0.80-carat (160\u00a0mg) diamond plus a 0.30-carat (60\u00a0mg) diamond that could be cut from the same rough diamond.\nThe round brilliant cut and square brilliant cuts are preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly shaped crystals, such as macles are more likely to be cut in a \"fancy cut\"\u2014that is, a cut other than the round brilliant\u2014which the particular crystal shape lends itself to.\nEven with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight, about 50%. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve the weight. Since the per-carat price of a diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat (200\u00a0mg) diamonds are the result of compromising \"cut quality\" for \"carat weight\".\nColor retention.\nIn colored diamonds, cutting can influence the color grade of the diamond, thereby raising its value. Certain cut shapes are used to intensify the color of the diamond. The radiant cut is an example of this type of cut.\nNatural green color diamonds most often have merely a surface coloration caused by natural irradiation, which does not extend through the stone. For this reason green diamonds are cut with significant portions of the original rough diamond's surface (\"naturals\") left on the finished gem. It is these \"naturals\" that provide the color to the diamond.\nTurnaround minimization.\nThe other consideration of diamond planning is how quickly a diamond will sell. This consideration is often unique to the type of manufacturer. While a certain cutting plan may yield a better value, a different plan may yield diamonds that will sell sooner, providing an earlier return on the investment.\nCleaving or sawing.\nCleaving is the separation of a piece of diamond rough into separate pieces, to be finished as separate gems. During the planning stage, diamond manufacturers identify cleavage planes, and use those planes to decide how to split the diamond. Diamond manufacturers make a groove in the diamond with a laser or saw or another diamond, and then split the diamond by placing a steel blade in the groove and giving a gentle tap. Cleavage can be along any of the four planes parallel to the faces of an octahedral diamond (i.e. perpendicular to body diagonals of the unit cell).\nSawing is the use of a diamond saw or laser to cut the diamond rough into separate pieces. Unlike cleaving, this step does not involve cleavage planes. This step gives diamonds their initial shape.\nBruting.\nBruting is the art of cutting a diamond to make the girdle round. In the modern era diamonds are rounded using either a laser, a diamond disk impregnated with diamonds, or spinning two diamonds so they cut against each other. Industrial diamonds can also be used for bruting a diamond round. Modern computer software measures the roundness of each diamond and \"ideal cut\" diamonds have to round within a tenth of a millimeter to qualify as an excellent cut diamond.\nDiamond polishing.\nDiamond polishing is the final polishing of the diamond. In a diamond factory, one would find a diamond \"crossworker\" who first places the main facets on a diamond (blocking the diamond). This is done to ensure maximum weight, clarity and best angles for the specific shape of diamond. After initial crossworking is complete, the diamond is finalized by smoothing the main facets by the crossworker, which is known as polishing the diamond. After the main facets have been polished by the crossworker, the final facets are polished onto the diamond by a \"brillianteer\". The facets added are the stars, top and bottom halves are also known as upper and lower girdle facets.\nFinal inspection.\nThe final stage involves thoroughly cleaning the diamond in acids, and examining the diamond to see whether it meets the quality standards of the manufacturer.\nRecutting.\nDue to changes in market desirability and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuates. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value at that time in the market and desirability. An example of this is the \"marquise\" cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or pear shape. The \"marquise\" can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5 to 10% in total weight. For example, a 1.10-carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a pear shape instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the pear shape.\nIn the 18th century there was a trend for recutting Indian diamonds to suit English tastes. The Koh-i-Noor's original cut weighed a little over 186.00 carats. When it was recut to an oval-shaped brilliant, almost 80 carats were lost.\nOther aspects are affected in recutting for value as well, such as the clarity. If an original shape contained inclusions on the tips, the recut would yield an increase in clarity since trimming down to a new shape would yield a cleaner overall finished diamond.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It premiered on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre on March 3, 1966, starring Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Eleanor. It was adapted by Goldman into an Academy Award-winning 1968 film of the same name, starring Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn. The play has been produced numerous times, including Broadway and West End revivals.\nSynopsis.\nSet during Christmas 1183 at Henry II of England's castle in Chinon, Anjou, Angevin Empire, the play opens with the arrival of Henry's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he has had imprisoned since 1173. The story concerns the gamesmanship between Henry, Eleanor, their three surviving sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, and their Christmas Court guest, the King of France, Philip II \"Augustus\" (), who was the son of Eleanor's ex-husband, Louis VII of France (by his third wife, Adelaide). Also involved is Philip's half-sister Alais (by Louis VII's second wife Constance), who has been at court since she was betrothed to Richard at age eight, but has since become Henry's mistress.\nProductions.\nThe play premiered at the Ambassador Theatre on March 3, 1966, playing for 92 performances and closing on May 21, 1966. Directed by Noel Willman, it starred Robert Preston as Henry, Rosemary Harris as Eleanor, James Rado as Richard, Christopher Walken as Philip, and Suzanne Grossman as Alais. Harris won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.\nScreen legend Joan Fontaine starred as Eleanor in a 1979 Vienna's English Theatre (VET) production, whose director Cyril Frankel had helmed Fontaine's 1966 vehicle \"The Witches\" (which would prove her cinematic swansong). Headlining an otherwise British cast, Fontaine spent a month rehearsing in London prior to the production's October premiere in Vienna for a projected run into the winter with further European engagements TBA, Fontaine hoping the production would afford her a London stage debut. In fact, after her second performance in Vienna, Fontaine would be sidelined by pneumonia: the actress would recall that the production was resultantly canceled although there are indications of further performances with VET regular stepping into the role of Eleanor. Fontaine had grown enamored of the role of Eleanor to the point of hoping to headline an American tour leading to a Broadway revival: however Fontaine would only be able to headline two regional theatrical productions of the play, firstly at the Fiesta Dinner Playhouse in San Antonio in May/June 1982 followed by a December 1980/January 1981 production at the Beverly Dinner Playhouse in New Orleans, the latter directed by Eric Berry and featuring Andrew Parks as Geoffrey. Nevertheless, in 2008 Fontaine, then aged 91, would advise \"Vanity Fair\" that \"Eleanor of Aquitaine...was my all-time favorite role\".\nVeteran screen actor George Peppard (\"The A-Team\") produced and starred in a 1992 production of \"The Lion in Winter\" which ran at the Walnut Street Theatre (Philadelphia) from January 11 to February 16; co-starring Susan Clark as Eleanor, the production encored March 24 to April 5 at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse (Palm Beach) and April 7 to April 26 at Parker Playhouse (Fort Lauderdale).\nThe play made its professional British debut in 1994 with a touring version with David McCallum as Henry and Si\u00e2n Phillips as Eleanor headlining a cast which included Victor McGuire as Richard, Stephen McGann as Geoffrey, and Christien Anholt as Philip. Subsequent to its January 25 to February 12 premiere engagement at the Churchill Theatre (Bromley), the production played engagements at the Richmond Theatre, affording the play its London area debut with a February 21 to 26 engagement, Darlington Civic Theatre, and New Victoria Theatre (Woking), before wrapping with an April 4 to 9 engagement at Theatre Royal, Bath. \"The Lion in Winter\" would not make its West End debut until 2011 when a production directed by Trevor Nunn and headlined by Robert Lindsay as Henry and Joanna Lumley as Eleanor opened at Theatre Royal Haymarket on November 15. Also featuring Tom Bateman as Richard, James Norton as Geoffrey, and Rory Fleck-Byrne as Philip, the production's limited run ended on January 28, 2012.\nIn 1999 Roundabout Theatre Company returned \"The Lion in Winter\" to Broadway for a limited (March 11 to May 30) run at the Olympia Theatre. Starring Laurence Fishburne as Henry and Stockard Channing as Eleanor, the latter earning a Tony nomination, the production was directed by Michael Mayer, and also featured Neal Huff as Geoffrey, Keith Nobbs as John, Roger Howarth as Philip, and Emily Bergl as Alais.\nDee Hoty played Eleanor opposite Randall Duk Kim as Henry at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts from August 14 to 26, 2000, Hoty stepping in when originally-cast Sharon Gless had a scheduling conflict. Hoty would again play Eleanor in a Two River Theater (Monmouth County NJ) production starring Michael Cumpsty as Henry which ran November 18 to December 4, 2016. The play was produced in 2002 by the Unseam'd Shakespeare Company.\nIn 2011 Stephanie Zimbalist and Eric Pierpoint starred as Eleanor and Henry in a Santa Barbara production which ran at the Alcehama Theater December 1 to 18, 2011: co-starring Rick Cosnett as Richard and Daniel David Stewart as John, the production was directed by Jenny Sullivan. The play formed part of the summer and fall 2012 seasons at the American Shakespeare Center's Blackfriars Playhouse, presented in complementary repertory with William Shakespeare's \"King John\". A 2014 production by the Colony Theater Company in Burbank, California starred Mariette Hartley as Eleanor and Ian Buchanan as Henry. Brendan Ford played Richard, and Hartley's daughter Justine as Alais, directed by Stephanie Vlahos.\nA 2016 Guthrie Theater (Minneapolis) production starring Laila Robins as Eleanor and Kevyn Morrow as Henry ran from November 19 to December 31. Veteran soap opera stars Robert Newman and Kim Zimmer - supercouple Josh Lewis and Reva Shayne on \"Guiding Light\" - played Henry and Eleanor in a 2017 production which ran July 25 to August 6 at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan. In 2018 Tom Butcher (\"The Bill\") starred as Henry in the English Theatre Frankfurt (August 31 to October 18) production of \"The Lion in Winter\". In 2019 Sheldon Epps directed the Laguna Playhouse (November 10 to 24) production which starred Gregory Harrison as Henry, Frances Fisher as Eleanor, and Burt Grinstead as Richard.\nJames Goldman\u2019s \"The Lion in Winter\" played at https://, Chicago, Illinois from November 3 to December 3, 2024.\u00a0 John Hoogenakker portrayed King Henry II.\u00a0 Rounding out the talented cast were Rebecca Spence, Kenneth La\u2019Ron Hamilton, Brandon Miller, Shane Kenyon, Netta Walker, and Anthony Baldasare.\nHistorical accuracy.\n\"The Lion in Winter\" is fictional, and none of the dialogue and actions is historical. There was not a Christmas Court at Chinon in 1183, but the events leading up to the story are generally accurate. There is no definitive evidence that Alais was Henry's mistress (although Richard later resisted marrying Alais on the basis of that claim). The real Henry had many mistresses (and several illegitimate children). Eleanor had persuaded their sons to rebel against Henry in 1173, and for her role in the rebellion, she was imprisoned by Henry until his death in 1189. While some historians have theorized that Richard was homosexual, historians remain divided on the question.\nDramatic adaptations.\nFilms.\nThe play was adapted into a 1968 film, with Peter O'Toole as Henry and Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor, and a 2003 television movie with Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close.\nPastiches and parodies.\nA radio parody of \"The Lion in Winter\" entitled \"The Leopard in Autumn\" by Neil Anthony was originally broadcast in BBC Radio 4 in 2001 and 2002 and re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011. Broadcast in two series, it starred David Swift as Prince Ludovico, the ambitious and henpecked ruler of Monte Guano (the smallest and most inconsequential city-state in Renaissance Italy), Si\u00e2n Phillips as his wife Princess Plethora, Graham Crowden as Francesco (Ludovico's perpetually drunken secretary), Saskia Wickham as Countess Rosalie (Ludovico's mistress [with Plethora's full knowledge and approval]), and as Ludovico's perpetually squabbling sons: Nick Romero as the excessively religious Salvatore (whose ambition is to become Pope some day), Paul Bigley as Allesandro (an eternally hopeful would-be artist and inventor) and Christopher Kellen as Guido (a fierce follower of Martin Luther).\nThe Fox TV drama \"Empire\" is explicitly based on \"The Lion in Winter\". It concerns a dysfunctional family that owns a record label named Empire, with all the members scheming and manipulating for power. There are numerous allusions to the play: the family is named Lyon, the father runs an empire while the mother, a very formidable woman, has been imprisoned for many years. Together, they have three sons: a serious, studious, master manipulator son; an intelligent, talented son, who is gay and the mother's favorite but rejected by the father; and a youngest son who is a favorite of the father, but who is spoiled and irresponsible. The recently freed mother schemes with the father and three sons for control of their empire, while at the same time slinging numerous verbal barbs at each other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60879", "revid": "50173065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60879", "title": "Electroluminescence", "text": "Optical and electrical phenomenon\nElectroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon, in which a material emits light in response to the passage of an electric current or to a strong electric field. This is distinct from black body light emission resulting from heat (incandescence), illumination by light (photoluminescence), chemical reactions (chemiluminescence), reactions in a liquid (electrochemiluminescence), sound (sonoluminescence), or other mechanical action (mechanoluminescence), or \norganic electroluminescence.\nMechanism.\nElectroluminescence is the result of radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a material, usually a semiconductor. The excited electrons release their energy as photons \u2013 light. Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by doping the material to form a p-n junction (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as light-emitting diodes) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the phosphors in electroluminescent displays).\nIt has been recently shown that as a solar cell improves its light-to-electricity efficiency (improved open-circuit voltage), it will also improve its electricity-to-light (EL) efficiency.\nCharacteristics.\nElectroluminescent technologies have rather low power consumption compared to competing lighting technologies, such as neon or fluorescent lamps. This, together with the thinness of the material, has made EL technology valuable to the advertising industry. Relevant advertising applications include electroluminescent billboards and signs. EL manufacturers can control precisely which areas of an electroluminescent sheet illuminate, and when. This has given advertisers the ability to create more dynamic advertising that is still compatible with traditional advertising spaces.\nAn EL film is a so-called Lambertian radiator: unlike with neon lamps, filament lamps, or LEDs, the brightness of the surface appears the same from all angles of view; electroluminescent light is not directional. The light emitted from the surface is perfectly homogeneous and is well-perceived by the eye. EL film produces single-frequency (monochromatic) light that has a very narrow bandwidth, is uniform and visible from a great distance.\nIn principle, EL lamps can be made in any color. However, the commonly used greenish color closely matches the peak sensitivity of human vision, producing the greatest apparent light output for the least electrical power input. Unlike neon and fluorescent lamps, EL lamps are not negative resistance devices so no extra circuitry is needed to regulate the amount of current flowing through them. A new technology now being used is based on multispectral phosphors that emit light from 600 to 400nm depending on the drive frequency; this is similar to the color-changing effect seen with aqua EL sheet but on a larger scale.\nExamples of electroluminescent materials.\nElectroluminescent devices are fabricated using either organic or inorganic electroluminescent materials. The active materials are generally semiconductors of wide enough bandwidth to allow the exit of the light.\nThe most typical inorganic thin-film EL (TFEL) is ZnS:Mn with yellow-orange emission. Examples of the range of EL material include:\nPractical implementations.\nThe most common electroluminescent (EL) devices are composed of either powder (primarily used in lighting applications) or thin films (for information displays.)\nLight-emitting capacitor (LEC).\n\"Light-emitting capacitor\", or LEC, is a term used since at least 1961 to describe electroluminescent panels. General Electric has patents dating to 1938 on flat electroluminescent panels that are still made as night lights and backlights for instrument panel displays. Electroluminescent panels are a capacitor where the dielectric between the outside plates is a phosphor that gives off photons when the capacitor is charged. By making one of the contacts transparent, the large area exposed emits light.\nElectroluminescent automotive instrument panel backlighting, with each gauge pointer also an individual light source, entered production on 1960 Chrysler and Imperial passenger cars, and was continued successfully on several Chrysler vehicles through 1967 and marketed as \"Panelescent Lighting\".\nNight lights.\nThe Sylvania Lighting Division in Salem and Danvers, Massachusetts, produced and marketed an EL night light, under the trade name \"Panelescent\" at roughly the same time that the Chrysler instrument panels entered production. These lamps have proven extremely reliable, with some samples known to be still functional after nearly 50 years of continuous operation.\nLater in the 1960s, Sylvania's Electronic Systems Division in Needham, Massachusetts developed and manufactured several instruments for the Apollo Lunar Module and Command Module using electroluminescent display panels manufactured by the Electronic Tube Division of Sylvania at Emporium, Pennsylvania. Raytheon in Sudbury, Massachusetts manufactured the Apollo Guidance Computer, which used a Sylvania electroluminescent display panel as part of its display-keyboard interface (DSKY).\nDisplay backlighting.\nPowder phosphor-based electroluminescent panels are frequently used as backlights for liquid crystal displays. They readily provide gentle, even illumination for the entire display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is common in the technological world.\nEL backlights require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts). For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a boost converter circuit within the device. This converter often makes a faintly audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. Line-voltage-operated devices may be activated directly from the power line; some electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.\nThin-film phosphor electroluminescence was first commercialized during the 1980s by Sharp Corporation in Japan, Finlux (Oy Lohja Ab) in Finland, and Planar Systems in the US. In these devices, bright, long-life light emission is achieved in thin-film yellow-emitting manganese-doped zinc sulfide material. Displays using this technology were manufactured for medical and vehicle applications where ruggedness and wide viewing angles were crucial, and liquid crystal displays were not well developed. In 1992, Timex introduced its Indiglo EL display on some watches.\nRecently, blue-, red-, and green-emitting thin film electroluminescent materials that offer the potential for long life and full-color electroluminescent displays have been developed.\nThe EL material must be enclosed between two electrodes and at least one electrode must be transparent to allow the escape of the produced light. Glass coated with indium tin oxide is commonly used as the front (transparent) electrode, while the back electrode is coated with reflective metal. Additionally, other transparent conducting materials, such as carbon nanotube coatings or PEDOT can be used as the front electrode.\nThe display applications are primarily passive (i.e., voltages are driven from the edge of the display cf. driven from a transistor on the display). Similar to LCD trends, there have also been Active Matrix EL (AMEL) displays demonstrated, where the circuitry is added to prolong voltages at each pixel. The solid-state nature of TFEL allows for a very rugged and high-resolution display fabricated even on silicon substrates. AMEL displays of 1280\u00d71024 at over 1000 lines per inch (LPI) have been demonstrated by a consortium including Planar Systems.\nThick-film dielectric electroluminescent technology.\nThick-film dielectric electroluminescent technology (TDEL) is a phosphor-based flat panel display technology developed by Canadian company iFire Technology Corp. TDEL is based on inorganic electroluminescent (IEL) technology that combines both thick-and thin-film processes. The TDEL structure is made with glass or other substrates, consisting of a thick-film dielectric layer and a thin-film phosphor layer sandwiched between two sets of electrodes to create a matrix of pixels. Inorganic phosphors within this matrix emit light in the presence of an alternating electric field.\nColor By Blue.\nColor By Blue (CBB) was developed in 2003. The Color By Blue process achieves higher luminance and better performance than the previous triple pattern process, with increased contrast, grayscale rendition, and color uniformity across the panel. Color By Blue is based on the physics of photoluminescence. High luminance inorganic blue phosphor is used in combination with specialized color conversion materials, which absorb the blue light and re-emit red or green light, to generate the other colors.\nNew applications.\nElectroluminescent lighting is now used as an application for public safety identification involving alphanumeric characters on the roof of vehicles for clear visibility from an aerial perspective.\nElectroluminescent lighting, especially electroluminescent wire (EL wire), has also made its way into clothing as many designers have brought this technology to the entertainment and nightlife industry. From 2006, t-shirts with an electroluminescent panel stylized as an audio equalizer, the T-Qualizer, saw a brief period of popularity.\nEngineers have developed an electroluminescent \"skin\" that can stretch more than six times its original size while still emitting light. This hyper-elastic light-emitting capacitor (HLEC) can endure more than twice the strain of previously tested stretchable displays. It consists of layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwiching an insulating elastomer sheet. The elastomer changes luminance and capacitance when stretched, rolled, and otherwise deformed. In addition to its ability to emit light under a strain of greater than 480% of its original size, the group's HLEC was shown to be capable of being integrated into a soft robotic system. Three six-layer HLEC panels were bound together to form a crawling soft robot, with the top four layers making up the light-up skin and the bottom two the pneumatic actuators. The discovery could lead to significant advances in health care, transportation, electronic communication and other areas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is designed to maintain a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or another type of bracelet, including metal bands or leather straps. A pocket watch is carried in a pocket, often attached to a chain. A stopwatch is a type of watch that measures intervals of time.\nDuring most of their history, beginning in the 16th century, watches were mechanical devices, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are known as \"mechanical watches\". In the 1960s the electronic \"quartz watch\" was invented, powered by a battery and keeping time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s it had taken over most of the watch market, in what became known as the quartz revolution (or the quartz crisis in Switzerland, whose renowned watch industry it decimated). In the 2010s, \"smartwatches\" emerged, small wrist-worn computers with touchscreens and with functions that go far beyond timekeeping.\nModern watches often display the day, date, month, and year. Mechanical watches may have extra features (\"complications\") such as moon-phase displays and different types of tourbillon. Quartz watches often include timers, chronographs, and alarm functions. Smartwatches and more complicated electronic watches may even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time.\nMost watches used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements. But expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, despite being less accurate and more expensive than their electronic counterparts. As of 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime for US$31.2 million.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe first timepieces to be worn were made in the 16th century in the German cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg, and these were transitional in size between clocks and watches. Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1485\u20131542) is often credited as the inventor of the watch. However, other German clockmakers were creating miniature timepieces during this period, and there is no evidence Henlein was the first.\nWatches were not widely worn in pockets until the 17th century. One account suggests that the word \"watch\" came from the Old English word \"woecce\" \u2013 which meant \"watchman\" \u2013 because town watchmen used the technology to keep track of their shifts at work. Another says that the term came from 17th-century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard \"watches\" (duty shifts).\nDevelopment.\nA rise in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the time and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. This innovation significantly improved the accuracy of watches, reducing errors from several hours a day to approximately 10 minutes per day, which led to the introduction of the minute hand on watch faces in Britain around 1680 and in France by 1700.\nThe increased accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by other parts of the movement, igniting a two-century wave of watchmaking innovation. The first thing to be improved was the escapement. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the cylinder escapement, invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and further developed by George Graham in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing \u2013 such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert Hooke \u2013 allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\nA major cause of error in balance-wheel timepieces, caused by changes in elasticity of the balance spring from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic temperature-compensated balance wheel invented in 1765 by Pierre Le Roy and improved by Thomas Earnshaw (1749\u20131829). The lever escapement, the single most important technological breakthrough, though invented by Thomas Mudge in 1754 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\nThe British predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the \u00e9lite. The British Watch Company modernized clock manufacture with mass-production techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery in 1843. In the United States, Aaron Lufkin Dennison started a factory in 1851 in Massachusetts that used interchangeable parts, and by 1861 a successful enterprise operated, incorporated as the Waltham Watch Company.\nKeyless (crown) winding.\nEfforts to eliminate the separate winding key led to multiple keyless (pendant/crown) systems in the 19th century. In Britain, Thomas Prest patented a mechanism to wind a watch by the pendant in 1820 (UK patent no. 4501). \nIn 1844 Adolphe Nicole patented a widely adopted keyless work in London (UK patent no. 10348); British Museum notes record that E. J. Dent &amp; Co. acquired rights to Nicole\u2019s system around 1846, and many mid-century keyless watches signed \u201cDent\u201d use the Nicole work. Early Dent keyless pieces from the 1840s are documented at auction. \nIn France and Switzerland, Jean-Adrien Philippe presented his crown-winding and setting mechanism in 1842 (patent 1845), and Charles-Antoine LeCoultre patented a keyless system with a rocking bar and side push-button in 1847.\nSee also: Dent (watchmaker), Edward John Dent.\nWristwatches.\nThe concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. In 1571, Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch, described as an \"armed watch\", from Robert Dudley. 17th century French mathematician Blaise Pascal is said to have worn a watch on his left-wrist. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a \"bracelet watch\") is one made in 1806, and given to Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais. From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women \u2013 men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century. In 1810, the watch-maker Abraham-Louis Breguet made a wristwatch for the Queen of Naples. The first Swiss wristwatch was made in the year 1868 by the Swiss watch-maker Patek Philippe for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary.\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, having increasingly recognized the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war without potentially revealing plans to the enemy through signaling. The Garstin Company of London patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but probably produced similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885. During the First Boer War of 1880\u20131881, the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin &amp; Webb began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the campaign in the Sudan in 1898 and accelerated production for the Second Boer War of 1899\u20131902 a few years later. In continental Europe, Girard-Perregaux and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Louis Cartier produced a wristwatch to allow his friend Alberto Santos-Dumont to check flight performance in his airship while keeping both hands on the controls as this proved difficult with a pocket watch. Cartier still markets a line of Santos-Dumont watches and sunglasses.\nIn 1905, Hans Wilsdorf moved to London, and set up his own business, Wilsdorf &amp; Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company became Rolex in 1915. Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.\nThe impact of the First World War of 1914\u20131918 dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the war were specially designed for the rigors of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The UK War Office began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917. By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch (or wristlet), and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British \"Horological Journal\" wrote in 1917, that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the wristwatch vastly exceeded the pocket watch in market share by a decisive ratio of 50:1.\nAutomatic watches.\nJohn Harwood invented the first successful self-winding system in 1923. In anticipation of Harwood's patent for self-winding mechanisms expiry in 1930, Glycine founder Eug\u00e8ne Meylan started development on a self-winding system as a separate module that could be used with almost any 8.75 ligne (19.74 millimeter) watch movement. Glycine incorporated this module into its watches in October 1930, and began mass-producing automatic watches.\nElectric watches.\nThe Elgin National Watch Company and the Hamilton Watch Company pioneered the first electric watch. The first electric movements used a battery as a power source to oscillate the balance wheel. During the 1950s, Elgin developed the model 725, while Hamilton released two models: the first, the Hamilton 500, released on 3 January 1957, was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning, and the watches returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505, an improvement on the 500, proved more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel. Similar designs from many other watch companies followed. Another type of electric watch was developed by the Bulova company that used a tuning-fork resonator instead of a traditional balance wheel to increase timekeeping accuracy, moving from a typical 2.5\u20134\u00a0Hz with a traditional balance wheel to 360\u00a0Hz with the tuning-fork design.\nQuartz watches.\nThe commercial introduction of the quartz watch in 1969 in the form of the Seiko Astron 35SQ, and in 1970 in the form of the Omega Beta 21 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel, which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, these devices used a quartz-crystal resonator, which vibrated at 8,192\u00a0Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. Most quartz-watch oscillators now operate at 32,768\u00a0Hz, though quartz movements have been designed with frequencies as high as 262\u00a0kHz. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\nSmart watches.\nThe Timex Datalink wristwatch was introduced in 1994. The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to receive data from a PC. Since then, many companies have released their own iterations of a smartwatch, such as the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and Huawei Watch.\nHybrid watches.\nA hybrid smartwatch is a fusion between a regular mechanical watch and a smartwatch.\nParts.\nThe movement and case are the basic parts of a watch. A watch band or bracelet is added to form a wristwatch; alternatively, a watch chain is added to form a pocket watch.\nThe case is the outer covering of the watch.\nThe case back is the back portion of the watch's case. Accessing the movement (such as during battery replacement) depends on the type of case back, which are generally categorized into four types:\nThe crystal, also called the window or watch glass, is the transparent part of the case that allows viewing the hands and the dial of the movement.\nModern wristwatches almost always use one of 4 materials:\nThe bezel is the ring holding the crystal in place.\nThe lugs are small metal projections at both ends of the wristwatch case where the watch band attaches to the watch case.\nThe case and the lugs are often machined from one solid piece of stainless steel.\nMovement.\nThe movement of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month, and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the watch face indicating the time.\nMechanical.\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day; are sensitive to position, temperature, and magnetism; are costly to produce; require regular maintenance and adjustments; and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, mechanical watches attract interest from consumers, particularly among watch collectors. Skeleton watches are designed to display the mechanism for aesthetic purposes.\nA mechanical movement uses an escapement mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. The movement also uses a balance wheel, together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring), to control the gear system's motion in a manner analogous to the pendulum of a pendulum clock. The tourbillon, an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, used to cancel out or reduce gravitational bias. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are expensive, and typically found in prestigious watches.\nThe pin-lever escapement (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, Georges Frederic Roskopf), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers, as well as by Timex, until it was replaced by quartz movements.\nIntroduced by Bulova in 1960, tuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement with a precise frequency (most often 360 Hz) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. Tuning-fork watches were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed.\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a mainspring as its power source that must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique pocket watches were wound by inserting a key into the back of the watch and turning it. While most modern watches are designed to run 40 hours on a winding, requiring winding daily, some run for several days; a few have 192-hour mainsprings, requiring once-weekly winding.\nAutomatic watches.\nA \"self-winding\" or \"automatic\" watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet, but the first \"self-winding\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named John Harwood in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\nIn April 2013, the Swatch Group launched the \"sistem51\" wristwatch. It has a mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including 19 jewels and a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. Ten years after its introduction, it is still the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line, including adjustment of the balance wheel and the escapement for accuracy by laser. The low parts count and the fully automated assembly make it an inexpensive automatic Swiss watch.\nElectronic.\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a quartz crystal which is made to vibrate by the piezoelectric effect. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an oscillator. It resonates at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\nIn 1959 Seiko placed an order with Epson (a subsidiary company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just portable quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192\u00a0Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967. In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the Omega Electroquartz as well as Patek Philippe, Rolex Oysterquartz and Piaget.\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the Seiko 35 SQ Astron, which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the Omega Marine Chronometer. Since the technology having been developed by contributions from Japanese, American and Swiss, nobody could patent the whole movement of the quartz wristwatch, thus allowing other manufacturers to participate in the rapid growth and development of the quartz watch market. This ended \u2013 in less than a decade \u2013 almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day \u2013 ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the Swatch Group of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture watch batteries (Renata), oscillators (Oscilloquartz, now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed EM Microelectronic-Marin). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\nSeiko's efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the Seiko Spring Drive, first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\nIn 2010, Miyota (Citizen Watch) of Japan introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for Bulova to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144\u00a0kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch that synchronizes (time transfers) its time with an external time source such as in atomic clocks, time signals from GPS navigation satellites, the German DCF77 signal in Europe, WWVB in the US, and others. Movements of this type may, among others, synchronize the time of day and the date, the leap-year status and the state of daylight saving time (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some solar-powered watches.\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's kinetic-powered quartz watches use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny generator to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\nSolar powered watches are powered by light. A photovoltaic cell on the face (dial) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a rechargeable battery or capacitor. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen Eco-Drive). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura, and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the Citizen Eco-Drive Thermo).\nDisplay.\nAnalog.\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. In quartz watches this second hand typically snaps to the next marker every second. In mechanical watches, the second hand may appear to glide continuously, though in fact it merely moves in smaller steps, typically one-fifth to one-tenth of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. With a \"duplex\" escapement, the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-second; this happens every four beats (two periods, 1 second), with a \"double duplex\" escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the \"tri-synchro regulator\" of Spring Drive watches. All three hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" simulated by a liquid-crystal display.\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.\nTactile.\nTissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, makes the Silen-T wristwatch with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates to help the user to tell time eyes-free. The bezel of the watch features raised bumps at each hour mark; after briefly touching the face of the watch, the wearer runs a finger around the bezel clockwise. When the finger reaches the bump indicating the hour, the watch vibrates continuously, and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute, the watch vibrates intermittently.\nEone Timepieces, a Washington D.C.\u2013based company, launched its first tactile analog wristwatch, the \"Bradley\", on 11 July 2013 on the \"Kickstarter\" website. The device is primarily designed for sight-impaired users, who can use the watch's two ball bearings to determine the time, but it is also suitable for general use. The watch features raised marks at each hour and two moving, magnetically attached ball bearings. One ball bearing, on the edge of the watch, indicates the hour, while the other, on the face, indicates the minute.\nDigital.\nA digital display shows the time as a number, e.g., 12:08 instead of a short hand pointing towards the number 12 and a long hand 8/60 of the way around the dial. The digits are usually shown as a seven-segment display.\nThe first digital mechanical pocket watches appeared in the late 19th century. In the 1920s, the first digital mechanical wristwatches appeared.\nThe first digital \"electronic\" watch, a Pulsar LED prototype in 1970, was developed jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess. John Bergey, the head of Hamilton's Pulsar division, said that he was inspired to make a digital timepiece by the then-futuristic digital clock that Hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film \"\". On 4 April 1972, the Pulsar was finally ready, made in an 18-carat gold case and sold for $2,100. It had a red light-emitting diode (LED) display.\nDigital LED watches were very expensive and out of reach to the common consumer until 1975, when Texas Instruments started to mass-produce LED watches inside a plastic case. These watches, which first retailed for only $20, reduced to $10 in 1976, saw Pulsar lose $6\u00a0million and the Pulsar brand sold to Seiko.\nAn early LED watch that was rather problematic was The Black Watch made and sold by British company Sinclair Radionics in 1975. This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and eliminating the need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button needed to be pressed to illuminate the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs and electroluminescent backlights.\nThe first LCD watch with a six-digit LCD was the 1973 Seiko 06LC, although various forms of early LCD watches with a four-digit display were marketed as early as 1972 including the 1972 Gruen Teletime LCD Watch, and the Cox Electronic Systems Quarza. The Quarza, introduced in 1972 had the first Field Effect LCD readable in direct sunlight and produced by the International Liquid Crystal Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio. In Switzerland, Ebauches Electronic SA presented a prototype eight-digit LCD wristwatch showing time and date at the MUBA Fair, Basel, in March 1973, using a twisted nematic LCD manufactured by Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, Switzerland, which became the supplier of LCDs to Casio for the \"CASIOTRON\" watch in 1974.\nA problem with LCDs is that they use polarized light. If, for example, the user is wearing polarized sunglasses, the watch may be difficult to read because the plane of polarization of the display is roughly perpendicular to that of the glasses. If the light that illuminates the display is polarized, for example if it comes from a blue sky, the display may be difficult or impossible to read.\nFrom the 1980s onward, digital watch technology vastly improved. In 1982, Seiko produced the Seiko TV Watch that had a television screen built-in, and Casio produced a digital watch with a thermometer (the TS-1000) as well as another that could translate 1,500 Japanese words into English. In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987, Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers (the DBA-800) and Citizen introduced one that would react to voice. In 1995, Timex released a watch that allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the Timex Datalink USB, feature dot matrix displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\nIlluminated.\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\nMechanical watches often have luminous paint on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. Radium was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous. Tritium was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive \u2013 it has to be made in a nuclear reactor \u2013 and it has a half-life of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (see Tritium illumination). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have electric illumination in their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\nIn some early digital watches, LED displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\nIn some types of watches, small incandescent lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination.\nOther watches use electroluminescent material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\nSpeech synthesis.\nTalking watches are available, intended for the blind or visually impaired. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-deaf that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\nHandedness.\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, chronographs. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\nFunctions.\nCustomarily, watches provide the time of day, giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include alarms. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate striking mechanisms or repeater functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary timepieces. This feature is available on most digital watches.\nA \"complicated watch\" has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a complication. Two popular complications are the \"chronograph\" complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a stopwatch, and the \"moonphase\" complication, which is a display of the lunar phase. Other more expensive complications include Tourbillon, Perpetual calendar, Minute repeater, and Equation of time. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see Calibre 89 from Patek Philippe for instance). Some watches aimed at Muslims can both indicate the direction of Mecca and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements. Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for UTC or GMT. A physicians watch was used for measuring pulse, administering medication or measuring anesthesia.\nThe similar-sounding terms \"chronograph\" and \"chronometer\" are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry-standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or activity tracking, address the general fitness market and have the potential for commercial success (Garmin Forerunner, Garmin Vivofit, Epson, announced model of Swatch Touch series).\nBraille watches have analog displays with raised bumps around the face to allow blind users to tell the time. Their digital equivalents use synthesised speech to speak the time on command.\nFashion.\nWristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as jewelry or as collectible works of art rather than just as timepieces. This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.\nTraditionally, dress watches appropriate for informal (business), semi-formal, and formal attire are gold, thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, complicated, or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire. Some dress watches have a cabochon on the crown or faceted gemstones on the face, bezel, or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted sapphire (corundum).\nMany fashions and department stores offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, \"costume\" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss Swatch company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.\nTrade in counterfeit watches, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated US$ market per year.\nSpace.\nThe zero-gravity environment and other extreme conditions encountered by astronauts in space require the use of specially tested watches.\nThe first-ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian \"Pobeda\" watch from the Petrodvorets Watch Factory. It was sent on a single orbit flight on the spaceship Korabl-Sputnik 4 on 9 March 1961. The watch had been attached without authorisation to the wrist of Chernuchka, a dog that successfully did exactly the same trip as Yuri Gagarin, with exactly the same rocket and equipment, just a month before Gagarin's flight.\nOn 12 April 1961, Gagarin wore a Shturmanskie (a transliteration of which actually means \"navigator's\") wristwatch during his historic first flight into space. The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the First Moscow Factory. Since 1964, the watches of the First Moscow Factory have been marked by the trademark \"\", transliterated as \"POLJOT\", which means \"flight\" in Russian and is a tribute to the many space trips its watches have accomplished. In the late 1970s, Poljot launched a new chrono movement, the 3133. With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the Swiss Valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s. Poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the arm of Valeriy Polyakov, a Poljot 3133 chronograph movement-based watch set a space record for the longest space flight in history.\nThrough the 1960s, a large range of watches was tested for durability and precision under extreme temperature changes and vibrations. The Omega Speedmaster Professional was selected by NASA, the U.S. space agency, and it is mostly known thanks to astronaut Buzz Aldrin who wore it during the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. Heuer became the first Swiss watch in space thanks to a Heuer Stopwatch, worn by John Glenn in 1962 when he piloted the \"Friendship 7\" on the first crewed U.S. orbital mission. The Breitling Navitimer Cosmonaute was designed with a 24-hour analog dial to avoid confusion between AM and PM, which are meaningless in space. It was first worn in space by U.S. astronaut Scott Carpenter on 24 May 1962 in the \"Aurora 7\" Mercury capsule.\nSince 1994 Fortis is the exclusive supplier for crewed space missions authorized by the Russian Federal Space Agency. China National Space Administration (CNSA) astronauts wear the Fiyta spacewatches. At BaselWorld, 2008, Seiko announced the creation of the first watch ever designed specifically for a space walk, Spring Drive Spacewalk. Timex Datalink is flight certified by NASA for space missions and is one of the watches qualified by NASA for space travel. The Casio G-Shock DW-5600C and 5600E, DW 6900, and DW 5900 are Flight-Qualified for NASA space travel.\nVarious Timex Datalink models were used both by cosmonauts and astronauts.\nScuba diving.\nWatch construction may be water-resistant. These watches are sometimes called diving watches when they are suitable for scuba diving or saturation diving. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued a standard for water-resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"waterproof\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted. In the United States, advertising a watch as waterproof has been illegal since 1968, per Federal Trade Commission regulations regarding the \"misrepresentation of protective features\".\nWater-resistance is achieved by the gaskets which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water-resistant.\nNone of the tests defined by ISO 2281 for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water-resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the ISO 6425 international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water-resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water-resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating, ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional ISO 6425 requirements have to be met.\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):\nSome watches use bar instead of meters, which may then be multiplied by 10, and then subtract 10 to be approximately equal to the rating based on metres. Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in atmospheres (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\nDosimeter.\nWatches with built-in geiger counters exist for contractors working in the nuclear industry and military personnel specializing in nuclear ordnance. The first known example was the Raketa Atom of 1954. A geiger counter watch was famously used in the 1965 James Bond movie \"Thunderball\" where Sean Connery's character uses a modified Breitling Top Time to find stolen nuclear warheads. Polimaster, Huatec, MTM Special Ops manufacture dosimeter watches.\nNavigation.\nThere is a traditional method by which an analog watch can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

To cause excitation, the light that strikes the semiconductor must have enough energy to raise electrons across the band gap, or to excite the impurities within the band gap. When a bias voltage and a load resistor are used in series with the semiconductor, a voltage drop across the load resistors can be measured when the change in electrical conductivity of the material varies the current through the circuit.\nClassic examples of photoconductive materials include:\nMolecular photoconductors include organic, inorganic, and \u2013 more rarely \u2013 coordination compounds.\nApplications.\nWhen a photoconductive material is connected as part of a circuit, it functions as a resistor whose resistance depends on the light intensity. In this context, the material is called a photoresistor (also called \"light-dependent resistor\" or \"photoconductor\"). The most common application of photoresistors is as photodetectors, i.e. devices that measure light intensity. Photoresistors are not the \"only\" type of photodetector\u2014other types include charge-coupled devices (CCDs), photodiodes and phototransistors\u2014but they are among the most common. Some photodetector applications in which photoresistors are often used include camera light meters, street lights, clock radios, infrared detectors, nanophotonic systems and low-dimensional photo-sensors devices.\nSensitization.\nSensitization is an important engineering procedure to amplify the response of photoconductive materials. The photoconductive gain is proportional to the lifetime of photo-excited carriers (either electrons or holes). Sensitization involves intentional impurity doping that saturates native recombination centers with a short characteristic lifetime, and replacing these centers with new recombination centers having a longer lifetime. This procedure, when done correctly, results in an increase in the photoconductive gain of several orders of magnitude and is used in the production of commercial photoconductive devices. The text by Albert Rose is the work of reference for sensitization.\nNegative photoconductivity.\nSome materials exhibit deterioration in photoconductivity upon exposure to illumination. One prominent example is hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in which a metastable reduction in photoconductivity is observable (see Staebler\u2013Wronski effect). Other materials that were reported to exhibit negative photoconductivity include ZnO nanowires, molybdenum disulfide, graphene, indium arsenide nanowires, decorated carbon nanotubes, and metal nanoparticles.\nUnder an applied AC voltage and upon UV illumination, ZnO nanowires exhibit a continuous transition from positive to negative photoconductivity as a function of the AC frequency. ZnO nanowires also display a frequency-driven metal-insulator transition at room temperature. The responsible mechanism for both transitions has been attributed to a competition between bulk conduction and surface conduction. The frequency-driven bulk-to-surface transition of conductivity is expected to be a generic character of semiconductor nanostructures with the large surface-to-volume ratio.\nMagnetic photoconductivity.\nIn 2016 it was demonstrated that in some photoconductive material a magnetic order can exist. One prominent example is CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3. In this material a light induced magnetization melting was also demonstrated thus could be used in magneto optical devices and data storage.\nPhotoconductivity spectroscopy.\nThe characterization technique called photoconductivity spectroscopy (also known as photocurrent spectroscopy) is widely used in studying optoelectronic properties of semiconductors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60886", "revid": "7852030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60886", "title": "Lev Yashin", "text": "Soviet footballer (1929\u20131990)\nLev Ivanovich Yashin (; 22 October 1929 \u2013 20 March 1990) was a Soviet professional footballer considered by many to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the sport. He was the first and only goalkeeper to win a Ballon d'Or. He was known for his athleticism, positioning, imposing presence in goal, and acrobatic reflex saves. He was also deputy chairman of the Football Federation of the Soviet Union.\nYashin earned status for revolutionising the goalkeeping position by imposing his authority on the entire defence. A vocal presence in goal, he shouted orders at his defenders, came off his line to intercept crosses and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers, done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action. His performances made an indelible impression on a global audience at the 1958 World Cup, the first to be broadcast internationally. He dressed head to toe in apparent black (in truth very dark blue), thus earning his nicknames \"the Black Spider\" or \"the Black Panther\", which enhanced his popularity. \nYashin appeared in three World Cups from 1958 to 1966 and was an unused squad member in 1970. In 2002, he was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 1994, he was chosen for the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team, and in 1998 was chosen as a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. According to FIFA, Yashin saved over 150 penalty kicks in professional football \u2014 more than any other goalkeeper. He also kept over 270 clean sheets in his career, winning a gold medal at the 1956 Olympic football tournament, and the 1960 European Championships.\nIn 1963, Yashin received the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the European player of the year, the only goalkeeper ever to receive the award. He was additionally named posthumously to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020, a greatest all-time XI, and was voted the best goalkeeper of the 20th century by the IFFHS. He was also named to the IFFHS All-time Men's Dream Team in 2021. He was named by \"France Football\" as the greatest goalkeeper of all time in 2020. In 2025, IFFHS crowned him as the greatest goalkeeper in football history. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Russia by the Russian Football Union as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. In 2019, \"France Football\" established the Yashin Trophy for the best performing goalkeeper, and is awarded alongside the Ballon D'Or.\nEarly life.\nYashin was born in Moscow, in a Russian family of industrial workers. When he was 12, World War II forced him to work in a factory to support the Soviet war effort. However his health at the age of 18 (after he suffered a nervous breakdown) meant he was unable to work. Thus, he was sent to work in a military factory in Moscow. After being spotted playing for the factory team he was invited to join the Dynamo Moscow youth team.\nClub career.\nYashin\u2019s debut for Dynamo Moscow came in 1950 in a friendly match. It was not the debut he would have hoped for, as he conceded a soft goal scored straight from a clearance by the opposing keeper. That year he played in only two league games, and did not appear in a senior match again until 1953. But he remained determined, and stayed at Dynamo in the reserves waiting for another opportunity. Yashin also played goalie for the Dynamo ice hockey team during those early years of trying to break into the senior squad. He managed to win a USSR ice hockey cup in 1953 and was third in the USSR ice hockey championship as goalkeeper.\nHe spent his entire professional football career with Dynamo Moscow, from 1950 to 1970, winning the USSR football championship five times and the Soviet Cup three times. Yashin's club teammate, rival and mentor was Alexei \"Tiger\" Khomich, the keeper of the Soviet national team, who had become famous for his role in Dynamo Moscow\u2019s British tour. He also internally rivalled goalkeeper Valter Sanaya, who left the club in 1953.\nInternational career.\nIn 1954, Yashin was called up to the Soviet national team, and would go on to gather 78 caps. With the national team he won the 1956 Summer Olympics as well as the first European championship, the 1960 European Nations' Cup. He also played in three World Cups, in 1958, 1962 and 1966. Yashin is credited with four clean sheets out of the 12 games he played in the World Cup finals.\nThe 1958 World Cup, played in Sweden, put Yashin on the map for his performances, with the Soviet Union advancing to the quarter-finals. In a group stage match against the eventual Cup winners Brazil, the Soviet team lost 2\u20130. Facing a Brazil team that featured Garrincha and a 17 year old Pel\u00e9 in attack, Yashin's performance prevented the score from becoming a rout.\nYashin was nominated for Ballon d'Or in 1960 and 1961 and placed fifth and fourth, respectively. In 1962, despite suffering two concussions during the tournament, he once again led the team to a quarter-final finish, before losing to host country Chile. That tournament showed that Yashin was all too human, having made some uncharacteristic mistakes. In the game against Colombia, which the Soviet Union was leading 4\u20131, Yashin let in a few soft goals, including a goal scored by Marcos Coll directly from a corner kick. It was the first and the only goal scored directly from a corner in FIFA World Cup history. The Soviet Union's game against Colombia finished in a 4\u20134 draw, which led the French newspaper \"L'\u00c9quipe\" to predict the end of Yashin's career. He did, however, make an outstanding save against Chile in the quarter-final. Despite this, the Soviet Union suffered a 2\u20131 defeat and were eliminated from the World Cup.\nDespite the disappointment of the 1962 World Cup, Yashin would bounce back to win the Ballon d'Or in December 1963. One of his best performances that year was the 1963 England v Rest of the World football match, where he made a number of spectacular saves. From that point onward he was known to the world as the \"Black Spider\" because he wore a distinctive all-black outfit and because it seemed as though he had eight arms to save almost everything. But to his fans, he was always the fearless \"Black Panther\". He often played wearing a cloth cap of burnt-brick colour. Yashin led the Soviet team to its best showing at the FIFA World Cup, a fourth-place finish in the 1966 World Cup held in England.\nAlways ready to give advice to his comrades, Yashin even made a fourth trip to the World Cup finals in 1970, held in Mexico, as the third-choice back-up and an assistant coach. The Soviet team again reached the quarter-finals. In 1971, in Moscow, he played his last match for Dynamo Moscow. Lev Yashin's FIFA testimonial match was held at the Lenin Stadium in Moscow with 100,000 fans attending and a host of football stars, including Pel\u00e9, Eus\u00e9bio and Franz Beckenbauer.\nPersonal life and health.\nAfter retiring from playing, Yashin spent almost 20 years in various administrative positions at Dynamo Moscow. He also spent much of his retirement indulging in what his wife called his second passion: fishing. A bronze statue of Lev Yashin was erected at the Dynamo Stadium in Moscow.\nIn 1986, following a thrombophlebitis contracted while he was in Budapest, Yashin underwent the amputation of one of his legs. He died in 1990 of stomach cancer, despite a surgical intervention in an attempt to save his life. He was given a state funeral as a Soviet Honoured Master of Sport.\nYashin was survived by wife Valentina Timofeyevna and daughters Irina and Elena; when Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Valentina was still living in the Moscow apartment that the Soviet state had given her husband in 1964. Yashin has a granddaughter and one surviving grandson; another grandson died in 2002 at age 14 from injuries suffered in a bicycle accident. The surviving grandson, Vasili Frolov, played as a goalkeeper in Dynamo's youth section and was on the books of the senior side, but never played a game with the senior side, retiring from play at age 23. He now runs a goalkeeper training school in Moscow near Spartak Moscow's current stadium.\nStyle of play and accolades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Lev Yashin was first-class, a real super goalkeeper. His positional play was excellent, but everything he did was top-class. He was the model for goalkeeping for the next 10 to 15 years, without a doubt. I visualised myself doing some of the things he was doing, even though I was already playing in the top division I used to learn from him.\"\n\u2014England legend Gordon Banks, voted the second greatest goalkeeper, behind Yashin, of the 20th Century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYashin was \"the peerless goalkeeper of the century\".\n\u2014Portugal legend Eus\u00e9bio.\nConsidered by many in the sport to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game, Yashin was an imposing presence in goal due to his tall stature, and was highly regarded for his athleticism, agility, positional sense, bravery, and exceptional reflexes, which enabled him to produce acrobatic and spectacular saves. Yashin remains the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d'Or, in 1963. He also stopped 151 penalty kicks during his career, more than any other goalkeeper in history, and kept over 270 clean sheets. For his outstanding service to the people and to his country, Yashin was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1967, the highest award of the USSR.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201cYashin revolutionised the role of goalkeeper like no other before him, by always being ready to act as an extra defender\u201d and by \u201cstarting dangerous counter-attacks with his positioning and quick throws\u201d.\u2014\u200a\nA vocal and authoritative figure between the posts, Yashin is known for revolutionising the goalkeeping position: he shouted orders at his defenders, came off his line to intercept crosses, and also ran out to meet onrushing attackers, done at a time when goalkeepers spent the 90 minutes standing in the goal waiting to be called into action. Yashin would always organise the defensive game of his team, often so fiercely that even his wife accused him of yelling too much on the pitch. He rarely captained his teams, as the later accepted custom of appointing a goalkeeper captain was virtually unheard-of in that era, but his leadership on the field was always evident. Yashin was one of the goalkeepers who began the practice of punching balls out in difficult situations instead of trying to catch them. Other novel practices he developed were the quick throw of the ball to begin a counterattack, coming out of the penalty area to anticipate danger, and the command and organisation of the defenders \u2013 practices now quite common among goalkeepers. When asked what his secret was, he would reply that the trick was \"to have a smoke to calm your nerves, then toss back a strong drink to tone your muscles.\"\nIn 1994, FIFA established the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper at the World Cup finals. FIFA polls named Yashin as the sole goalkeeper in World Team of the 20th Century. \"World Soccer\" magazine named him in their 100 Greatest Players of the 20th century. Many commentators consider Yashin the best goalkeeper in the history of football, which has resulted in him being chosen to be the goalkeeper in most of the world-all-time teams (including the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team and the FIFA Dream Team). In 2020 Yashin was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI.\nLegacy.\nThe following works are devoted to Yashin:\nIce hockey career.\nYashin also played ice hockey (also as a goalie) and he won the Soviet Cup in March 1953. He was even among the candidates for the country's ice hockey national team, but he stopped playing ice hockey in 1954 to concentrate on his football career.\nQuotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"What kind of a goalkeeper is the one who is not tormented by the goal he has allowed?

It was invented to solve the problem of cubic zirconia's melting-point being too high for even platinum crucibles.\nIn essence, by heating only the center of a volume of cubic zirconia, the material forms its own \"crucible\" from its cooler outer layers. The term \"skull\" refers to these outer layers forming a shell enclosing the molten volume. Zirconium oxide powder is heated then gradually allowed to cool. Heating is accomplished by radio frequency induction using a coil wrapped around the apparatus. The outside of the device is water-cooled in order to keep the radio frequency coil from melting and also to cool the outside of the zirconium oxide and thus maintain the shape of the zirconium powder.\nSince zirconium oxide in its solid state does not conduct electricity, a piece of zirconium metal is placed inside the gob of zirconium oxide. As the zirconium melts it oxidizes and blends with the now molten zirconium oxide, a conductor, and is heated by radio frequency induction.\nWhen the zirconium oxide is melted on the inside (but not completely, since the outside needs to remain solid) the amplitude of the RF induction coil is gradually reduced and crystals form as the material cools. Normally this would form a monoclinic crystal system of zirconium oxide.\nIn order to maintain a cubic crystal system a stabilizer is added, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide or yttrium oxide as well as any material to color the crystal. After the mixture cools the outer shell is broken off and the interior of the gob is then used to manufacture gemstones."}

These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for ownership, locations, such as the designated positions of structural components for construction or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.\nA professional in land surveying is called a land surveyor.\nSurveyors work with elements of geodesy, geometry, trigonometry, regression analysis, physics, engineering, metrology, programming languages, and the law. They use equipment, such as total stations, robotic total stations, theodolites, GNSS receivers, retroreflectors, 3D scanners, lidar sensors, radios, inclinometer, handheld tablets, optical and digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, GIS, and surveying software.\nSurveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. It is used in the planning and execution of most forms of construction. It is also used in transportation, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.\nDefinition.\nThe International Federation of Surveyors defines the function of surveying as follows:\nA surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nSurveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In ancient Egypt, a rope stretcher would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the Nile River. The almost perfect squareness and north\u2013south orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built c.\u20092700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. The \"groma\" instrument may have originated in Mesopotamia (early 1st millennium BC). The prehistoric monument at Stonehenge (c.\u20092500 BC) was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.\nThe mathematician Liu Hui described ways of measuring distant objects in his work \"Haidao Suanjing\" or \"The Sea Island Mathematical Manual\", published in 263 AD.\nThe Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD). Roman surveyors were known as \"Gromatici\".\nIn medieval Europe, beating the bounds maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.\nIn England, William the Conqueror commissioned the Domesday Book in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area's content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.\nModern era.\nAbel Foullon described a plane table in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.\nGunter's chain was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician Edmund Gunter. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.\nLeonard Digges described a theodolite that measured horizontal angles in his book \"A geometric practice named Pantometria\" (1571). Joshua Habermel (Erasmus Habermehl) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.\nIn the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. Jesse Ramsden introduced the first precision theodolite in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his great theodolite using an accurate dividing engine of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. William Gascoigne invented an instrument that used a telescope with an installed crosshair as a target device, in 1640. James Watt developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the parallactic angle from which the distance to a point could be deduced.\nDutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of triangulation. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Breda, approximately . He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the Earth. He also showed how to resect, or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, Jacques Cassini and his son C\u00e9sar undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the meridian arc, leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time triangulation methods were well established for local map-making.\nIt was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General William Roy's Ordnance Survey of Great Britain began the Principal Triangulation of Britain. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The Great Trigonometric Survey of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped Mount Everest and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out canals, roads and rail.\nIn the US, the Land Ordinance of 1785 created the Public Land Survey System. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.\nNapoleon Bonaparte founded continental Europe's first cadastre in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.\nRobert Torrens introduced the Torrens system in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.\nSurveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.\n20th century.\nAt the beginning of the century, surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but they still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. Trevor Lloyd Wadley developed the Tellurometer during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.\nDuring the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced electronic distance measurement (EDM) equipment. EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance. These instruments eliminated the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.\nAdvances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as total stations. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders and on-board calculation programs.\nThe first satellite positioning system was the US Navy TRANSIT system. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system's main purpose was to provide position information to Polaris missile submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.\nThe US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission, thus improving accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Later improvements to both satellites and receivers allowed for Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys provide high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.\n21st century.\nThe theodolite, total station and RTK GPS survey remain the primary methods in use.\nRemote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and lidar-based topographical surveys. UAV technology along with photogrammetric image processing is also appearing.\nEquipment.\nHardware.\nThe main surveying instruments in use around the world are the theodolite, measuring tape, total station, 3D scanners, GPS/GNSS, level and rod. Most instruments screw onto a tripod when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.\nThe theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate \"circles\", \"protractors\" or \"alidades\" to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.\nThe gyrotheodolite is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.\nThe total station is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.\nModern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to satellite positioning systems, such as Global Positioning System. Real Time Kinematic GPS systems have significantly increased the speed of surveying, and they are now horizontally accurate to within 1\u00a0cm \u00b1 1 ppm in real-time, while vertically it is currently about half of that to within 2\u00a0cm \u00b1 2 ppm.\nGPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate baseline that can be over 20\u00a0km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.\nSurveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys make them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place beacons on the ground (about apart). This method reaches precisions between 5\u201340\u00a0cm (depending on flight height).\nSurveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; PPE; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.\nSoftware.\nLand surveyors, construction professionals, geomatics engineers and civil engineers using total station, GPS, 3D scanners, and other collector data use land surveying software to increase efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.\nTypically, much if not all of the drafting and some of the designing for plans and plats of the surveyed property is done by the surveyor, and nearly everyone working in the area of drafting today (2021) utilizes CAD software and hardware both on PC, and more and more in newer generation data collectors in the field as well. Other computer platforms and tools commonly used today by surveyors are offered online by the U.S. Federal Government and other governments' survey agencies, such as the National Geodetic Survey and the CORS network, to get automated corrections and conversions for collected GPS data, and the data coordinate systems themselves.\nTechniques.\nSurveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.\nGPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.\nDistance measurement.\nBefore EDM (Electronic Distance Measurement) laser devices, distances were measured using a variety of means. In pre-colonial America Natives would use the \"bow shot\" as a distance reference (\"as far as an arrow can slung out of a bow\", or \"flights of a Cherokee long bow\"). Europeans used chains with links of a known length such as a Gunter's chain, or measuring tapes made of steel or invar. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to \"break\" (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. Perambulators, or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. Tacheometry is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.\nAngle measurement.\nHistorically, horizontal angles were measured by using a compass to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with reticles atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see theodolite). Levels and calibrated circles allowed the measurement of vertical angles. Verniers allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century transit.\nThe plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 Francis Ronalds invented a reflecting instrument for recording angles graphically by modifying the octant.\nBy observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180\u00b0 difference. This is called a \"close\". If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the \"angular misclose\". The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.\nLeveling.\nThe simplest method for measuring height is with an altimeter\u00a0using air pressure to find the height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the Global Positioning System (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually, GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.\nWhen using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. \"Turning\" is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To \"turn\" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun, which is why this method is referred to as \"differential levelling\". This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.\nDetermining position.\nThe primary way of determining one's position on the Earth's surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the Sun, Moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument's position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on Earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the Earth.\nReference networks.\nFew survey positions are derived from the first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previously measured points. This forms a reference or \"control\" network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.\nSurvey points are usually marked on the earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to large beacons that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments in this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.\n\"Triangulation\" is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for topographic maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the baseline. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements were repeated for increased accuracy. See also Triangulation in three dimensions.\n\"Offsetting\" is an alternate method of determining the position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.\n\"Traversing\" is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyors start from an old reference mark or known position and place a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.\nDatum and coordinate systems.\nMany surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the Earth, but instead, measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey's objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the Earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the Earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a 'datum' (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the Earth's curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.\nFor larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the Earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the Earth.\nErrors and accuracy.\nA basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error. There are three classes of survey errors:\nSurveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used, and errors can be detected by comparing the results of two or more measurements, thus utilizing redundancy.\nOnce the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in their work, it is adjusted. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the Bowditch method, also known as the compass rule, and the principle of least squares method.\nThe surveyor must be able to distinguish between accuracy and precision. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25\u00a0ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8\u00a0inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.\nTypes.\nLocal organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:\nPlane vs. geodetic surveying.\nBased on the considerations and true shape of the Earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.\n\"Plane surveying\" assumes the Earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the Earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the Earth's shape are too small to matter.\nIn \"geodetic surveying\" the curvature of the Earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic. In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.\nProfession.\nThe basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.\nSurveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, pipelines, retaining walls, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for \"geographical information systems\" (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.\nSurveyors must have a thorough knowledge of algebra, basic calculus, geometry, and trigonometry. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, real property, and contracts.\nMost jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:\nRelated professions include cartographers, hydrographers, geodesists, photogrammetrists, and topographers, as well as civil engineers and geomatics engineers.\nLicensing.\nLicensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a post nominal, which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.\nA licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.\nIn many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on survey monuments when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.\nSurveying institutions.\nMost countries' governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of geodetic networks. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.\nMost jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the International Federation of Surveyors (Abbreviated FIG, for ). They represent the survey industry worldwide.\nBuilding surveying.\nMost English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. A building surveyor can provide technical building advice on existing buildings, new buildings, design, compliance with regulations such as planning and building control. A building surveyor normally acts on behalf of their client ensuring that their vested interests remain protected. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is a world-recognised governing body for those working within the built environment.\nCadastral surveying.\nOne of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.\n\"Cadastral land surveyors\" are licensed by governments.\nThe cadastral survey branch of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States. They consult with Forest Service, National Park Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, and others. The BLM used to be known as the United States General Land Office (GLO).\nIn states organized per the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.\nCadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.\nQuantity surveying.\nQuantity surveying is a profession that deals with the \"costs and contracts\" of construction projects. A quantity surveyor is an expert in estimating the \"costs of materials, labor, and time\" needed for a project, as well as managing the \"financial and legal aspects\" of the project. A quantity surveyor can work for either the client or the contractor, and can be involved in different stages of the project, from planning to completion. Quantity surveyors are also known as \"Chartered Surveyors\" in the UK.\nNotable surveyors.\nSome U.S. Presidents were land surveyors. George Washington and Abraham Lincoln surveyed colonial or frontier territories early in their career, prior to serving in office.\nFerdinand Rudolph Hassler is considered the \"father\" of geodetic surveying in the U.S.\nDavid T. Abercrombie practiced land surveying before starting an outfitter store of excursion goods. The business would later turn into Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lifestyle clothing store.\nPercy Harrison Fawcett was a British surveyor who explored the jungles of South America attempting to find the Lost City of Z. His biography and expeditions were recounted in the book \"The Lost City of Z\" and were later adapted on film screen.\nIn\u014d Tadataka produced the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques starting in 1800, at the age of 55.\nSee also.\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Benson added in 1902.\nComposition.\nThe music to which the words of the refrain \"Land of Hope and Glory\" below are set is the 'trio' theme from Edward Elgar's \"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1\". The words were fitted to the melody on the suggestion of King Edward VII who told Elgar he thought the melody would make a great song. When Elgar was requested to write a work for the King's coronation, he worked the suggestion into his \"Coronation Ode\", for which he used words provided by the poet and essayist A. C. Benson. The first and last sections of the \"Ode\" use the march's melody.\nThe first five notes of the refrain are similar to the first two bars of \"God Save the King\" in an early version published in 1745.\nOwing to the King's illness, the coronation was postponed. Elgar created a separate song, which was first performed by Madame Clara Butt in June 1902. In fact, only the first of the seven stanzas of the Ode's final section was re-used, as the first four lines of the second stanza below. This stanza is the part which is popularly sung today.\nLyrics.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"1st Verse:\"\n Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crowned,\n God make thee mightier yet!\n On Sov'ran brows, beloved, renowned,\n Once more thy crown is set.\n Thine equal laws, by Freedom gained,\n Have ruled thee well and long;\n By Freedom gained, by Truth maintained,\n Thine Empire shall be strong.\n\"Chorus:\"\n Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,\n How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee?\n Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set;\n God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet,\n God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet!\n\"2nd Verse:\"\n Thy fame is ancient as the days,\n As Ocean large and wide:\n A pride that dares, and heeds not praise,\n A stern and silent pride;\n Not that false joy that dreams content\n With what our sires have won;\n The blood a hero sire hath spent\n Still nerves a hero son.\n\"Chorus\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nUsage.\nBBC Proms.\nThe Proms began in 1895; in 1901 Elgar's newly composed 'Pomp and Circumstance' March No. 1 was introduced as an orchestral piece (a year before the words were written), conducted by Henry Wood who later recollected \"little did I think then that the lovely broad melody of the trio would one day develop into our second national anthem\". It was played as \"Land of Hope and Glory\" in the last concert of the 1905 proms, and at the first and last concerts of the 1909 Proms, which also featured Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs. The two pieces were played one after another at the closing concerts in 1916, 1917 and 1918. From 1927, the BBC began supporting the Proms, with radio broadcasts bringing the music to an increasingly wide audience.\n\"Land of Hope and Glory\" featured in the final concerts for 1928, 1929, 1936 and 1939. By then, audience participation in the second half of the programme had become a ritual, and from 1947 a boisterous 'tradition' was created by the conductor Malcolm Sargent, making \"Land of Hope and Glory\" part of a standard programme for the event. The Last Night of the Proms was broadcast annually on television from 1953 onwards, and Promenaders began dressing up outrageously and waving flags and banners during the climax of the evening. In some years, \"Land of Hope and Glory\" and the other favourites were left out of the programme but reinstated after press and public outrage. In an exception, for the 2001 Last Night concert following the September 11 attacks, the conductor Leonard Slatkin substituted a more serious programme, featuring Samuel Barber's \"Adagio for Strings\", but despite the success of this occasion, the now traditional pieces returned the following year.\nIn 2020, the BBC announced a decision not to feature \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as well as \"Rule, Britannia!\" in the Last Night of the Proms running order. This break from tradition prompted outrage from some members of the public, the media and some politicians, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson who accused the BBC of \"cringing embarrassment about our history\". Further reporting hypothesised that the decision was made in light of renewed prominence for the Black Lives Matter movement, after the murder of George Floyd earlier in the summer, supporters of which accused the songs of glorifying colonialism and slavery. The BBC later reversed the decision, claiming the original move was due to the COVID-19 pandemic social-distancing measures, and that they would now be sung. Ultimately, both songs were featured albeit with a reduced-capacity choir and orchestra.\nSporting events.\nRugby.\nAt international rugby league matches, England often sang \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as their national anthem. Although their anthem changed to \"God Save the Queen\" after formation of the Great Britain side in 2007, it is still tradition for the team to use \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as their walk-out theme.\nFootball.\nSupporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club (the team Elgar supported) sing a version of the song with the lyrics changed to 'We will follow the Wanderers over land, sea, and water.' Their local rivals West Bromwich Albion sing 'We will follow the Albion over land, sea, and water.' Supporters of Huddersfield Town sing 'We're all following Huddersfield, over land and sea'. Derby County and Chelsea football club supporters sing 'We all follow Derby/Chelsea, over land and sea (and Leicester)', although supporters of Arsenal sang this first; similarly Blackburn Rovers fans sing 'We all follow the Rovers, over the land and sea (and Preston!)'.\nCommonwealth Games.\n\"Land of Hope and Glory\" was the England team's victory anthem at the Commonwealth Games until 2010, when the public rejected it in a poll in favour of \"Jerusalem\".\nProposed anthem for England.\nEngland currently has no agreed national anthem. However, there have been calls for this to be changed, with a 2006 survey conducted by the BBC suggesting that 55% of the English public would rather have \"Land of Hope and Glory\" than \"God Save the King\" as their national anthem.\nFilms and television.\n\"Land of Hope and Glory\" was sung by Jeanette MacDonald in the 1941 MGM film, \"Smilin' Through\".\nStanley Kubrick's 1971 film \"A Clockwork Orange\" uses Elgar's version to herald the arrival of the Minister of the Interior in Alex's story.\nAt the end of every episode of \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\", the character Muhammad (portrayed by Dino Shafeek) would sing the song while playing the sitar, before he was interrupted by Sergeant Major Williams (portrayed by Windsor Davies), yelling at him to \"shut up!\", which was Williams' catchphrase.\nThe song inspired the title of John Boorman's 1987 film of the same name, depicting World War II through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy.\nThe song is considered as the unofficial party anthem of the Conservative Party. In 1997, the Labour Party broadcast a 5 minute long television broadcast criticising the Conservatives and John Major as Prime Minister. The song was ironically used in the entirety of the broadcast.\nThe song is also used in the 2012 Japanese film \"Little Maestra\". It is set in a small fishing village in Shikamachi, Ishikawa Prefecture, who depend on the local amateur orchestra as their favourite source of entertainment. When the conductor dies unexpectedly, the townspeople recruit the man's granddaughter, a high school student with a talent for conducting. The song is heard three times throughout the film.\nIn the British television comedy \"The Goodies\", a recurring joke involves Tim Brooke-Taylor's character playing a recording of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" every time he makes a patriotic, motivational speech.\nIn \"\", Merlin activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing the guards and conspirators as heads explode around the world, to the tune of \"Land of Hope and Glory\".\nIt was used for the British postcard for the Eurovision Song Contest 1982 before the British entry.\n\"Land of Hope and Glory\" is featured at the very end of the end credits scene of https:// the finale film ending of the popular slice-of-life anime Kin'iro Mosaic from Japan featuring several British characters. The song is played in the context of a high school graduation ceremony after which characters https:// and https:// travel to England to enroll in university there. Characters https://, https:// and https:// remain in Japan to continue their studies at a girls' university. The song as sung in the show only features the chorus. \nGraduation ceremonies (United States, Canada and The Philippines).\nIn the United States, Canada and the Philippines, the instrumental version of this song is traditionally associated with high school and college (university) graduation ceremonies. It is played as a processional or recessional often omitting all but the movement of the song over which the chorus is traditionally sung. During ceremonies for larger schools this piece (or the truncated version, if it is being used) is played repeatedly. It may be played for as long as the graduates are marching or walking, which can be longer than some symphonies.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Regional fare is often served. Since the 1970s, many Greek immigrants have entered the business. Coffee, iced tea, and soft drinks are the typical beverages, as alcohol is usually not offered due to the prohibitive cost of a liquor license.

A British or Irish cafe will typically offer a \"full cooked breakfast\" all day.\nPopular culture.\nAlthough there are now far fewer establishments due to the dominance of corporate fast food restaurant chains, a certain nostalgia exists surrounding a greasy spoon. Evocative characteristics include \"counter service\", jukeboxes, and hearty comfort cuisine. The greasy spoon as a setting is a common trope in movies and TV shows.\nRestaurateur and television personality Guy Fieri, on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\", pays homage to such eateries across the United States.\nComic strips and humorous magazines have often lampooned the greasy spoon diner. \"The Better Half\" had Bert's Beanery, and Dagwood Bumstead continues to eat at Lou's Diner in \"Blondie\". The kitchen and mess hall in \"Beetle Bailey\" provide the military equivalent of a greasy spoon. The cartoon series \"Bob's Burgers\" takes place in a modern day greasy spoon.

{"id": "60900", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60900", "title": "Carp", "text": "Various species of cyprinid fishes\nThe term carp (pl.: carp) is a generic common name for numerous species of freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large clade of ray-finned fish mostly native to Eurasia. While carp are prized quarries and are valued (even commercially cultivated) as both food and ornamental fish in many parts of the Old World, they are considered trash fish and invasive pests in many parts of Africa, Australia and most of the United States.\nBiology.\nThe cypriniformes (family Cyprinidae) are traditionally grouped with the Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes to create the superorder Ostariophysi, since these groups share some common features. These features include being found predominantly in fresh water and possessing Weberian ossicles, an anatomical structure derived from the first five anterior-most vertebrae, and their corresponding ribs and neural crests.\nThe third anterior-most pair of ribs is in contact with the extension of the labyrinth and the posterior with the swim bladder. The function is poorly understood, but this structure is presumed to take part in the transmission of vibrations from the swim bladder to the labyrinth and in the perception of sound, which would explain why the Ostariophysi have such a great capacity for hearing.\nMost cypriniformes have scales and teeth on the inferior pharyngeal bones which may be modified in relation to the diet. \"Tribolodon\" is the only cyprinid genus which tolerates salt water. Several species move into brackish water but return to fresh water to spawn. All of the other cypriniformes live in continental waters and have a wide geographical range. Some consider all cyprinid fishes carp, and the family Cyprinidae itself is often known as the carp family.\nIn colloquial use, carp usually refers only to several larger cyprinid species such as \"Cyprinus carpio\" (common carp), \"Carassius carassius\" (crucian carp), \"Ctenopharyngodon idella\" (grass carp), \"Hypophthalmichthys molitrix\" (silver carp), and \"Hypophthalmichthys nobilis\" (bighead carp). Common carp are native to both Eastern Europe and Western Asia, so they are sometimes called a \"Eurasian\" carp.\nCarp have long been an important food fish to humans. Several species such as the various goldfish (\"Carassius auratus\") breeds and the domesticated common carp variety known as koi (\"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\" var. \"koi\") have been popular ornamental fishes. As a result, carp have been introduced to various locations, though with mixed results. Several species of carp are considered invasive species in the United States, and, worldwide, large sums of money are spent on carp control.\nAt least some species of carp are able to survive for months with practically no oxygen (for example under ice or in stagnant, scummy water) by metabolizing glycogen to form lactic acid which is then converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The ethanol diffuses into the surrounding water through the gills.\nRecreational fishing.\nIn 1653 Izaak Walton wrote in \"The Compleat Angler\", \"The Carp is the queen of rivers; a stately, a good, and a very subtle fish; that was not at first bred, nor hath been long in England, but is now naturalised.\"\nCarp are variable in terms of angling value.\nAquaculture.\nVarious species of carp have been domesticated and reared as food fish across Europe and Asia for thousands of years. These various species appear to have been domesticated independently, as the various domesticated carp species are native to different parts of Eurasia. Aquaculture has been pursued in China for at least 2,400 years. A tract by Fan Li in the fifth century BC details many of the ways carp were raised in ponds. The common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\") is originally from Central Europe. Several carp species (collectively known as Asian carp) were domesticated in East Asia. Carp that are originally from South Asia, for example catla (\"Gibelion catla\"), rohu (\"Labeo rohita\") and mrigal (\"Cirrhinus cirrhosus\"), are known as Indian carp. Their hardiness and adaptability have allowed domesticated species to be propagated all around the world.\nAlthough the carp was an important aquatic food item, as more fish species have become readily available for the table, the importance of carp culture in Western Europe has diminished. Demand has declined, partly due to the appearance of more desirable table fish such as trout and salmon through intensive farming, and environmental constraints. However, fish production in ponds is still a major form of aquaculture in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, where most of the production comes from low or intermediate-intensity ponds. In Asia, the farming of carp continues to surpass the total amount of farmed fish volume of intensively sea-farmed species, such as salmon and tuna.\nBreeding.\nSelective breeding programs for the common carp include improvement in growth, shape, and resistance to disease. Experiments carried out in the USSR used crossings of broodstocks to increase genetic diversity, and then selected the species for traits such as growth rate, exterior traits and viability, and/or adaptation to environmental conditions such as variations in temperature. Selected carp for fast growth and tolerance to cold, the Ropsha carp. The results showed a 30 to 77.4% improvement of cold tolerance, but did not provide any data for growth rate. An increase in growth rate was observed in the second generation in Vietnam, Moav and Wohlfarth (1976) showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared to selecting for faster growth. Schaperclaus (1962) showed resistance to the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality (11.5%) compared to unselected (57%).\nThe major carp species used traditionally in Chinese aquaculture are the black, grass, silver and bighead carp. In the 1950s, the Pearl River Fishery Research Institute in China made a technological breakthrough in the induced breeding of these carps, which has resulted in a rapid expansion of freshwater aquaculture in China. In the late 1990s, scientists at the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences developed a new variant of the common carp called the Jian carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\" var. \"Jian\"). This fish grows rapidly and has a high feed conversion rate. Over 50% of the total aquaculture production of carp in China has now converted to Jian carp.\nAs ornamental fish.\nCarp, along with many of their cyprinid relatives, are popular ornamental aquarium and pond fish.\nOrnamental goldfish were originally domesticated from their wild form, a dark greyish-brown carp native to Asia, but may have been influenced by \"Carassius carassius\" and \"Carassius gibelio\". They were first bred for color in China over a thousand years ago. Due to selective breeding, goldfish have been developed into many distinct breeds, and are found in various colors, color patterns, forms and sizes far different from those of the original carp. Goldfish were kept as ornamental fish in China for thousands of years before being introduced to Japan in 1603, and to Europe in 1611.\nNishikigoi, better known simply as koi, are a domesticated varieties of common carp and Amur carp (\"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\") that have been selectively bred for color. The common carp was introduced from China to Japan, where selective breeding in the 1820s in the Niigata region resulted in koi. In Japanese culture, koi are treated with affection, and seen as good luck. They are popular in other parts of the world as outdoor pond fish.\nCommon carp in culture.\nIn Chinese literature.\nA long tradition of common carp exists in Chinese culture and literature. A popular lyric circulating as early as 2,000 years ago in the late Han period includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp (), in which, when the wife opened the fish to cook, she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines: \"Eat well to keep fit, missing you and forget me not\".\nJumping carp the Chinese folk tale.\nAt the Yellow River at Henan () is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate. It is said that if certain carp called \"yulong\" can climb the cataract, they will transform into dragons. Every year in the third month of spring, they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls. It used to be said that only 71 could make the climb in any year. When the first succeeded, then the rains would begin to fall. This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god-emperor Yu, who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River. It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying, \"a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate.\"\nHenan is not the only place where this happens. Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province.\nThe fish's jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as \"\"Liyu\" (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate (),\" an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one's social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the imperial examination. It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance. This symbolic image, as well as the image of the carp itself, has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings, especially those of popular styles. The fish is usually colored in gold or pink, shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone. \nIn Japanese culture.\nThe modern Japanese Koi fish are a brightly colored species of the Amur carp that have been bred by rice farmers in Japan since the early 19th century. This subspecies of carp plays a significant role in Japanese art, often being depicted as symbols of luck, strength, and tenacity. For this reason, Koi fish are also presented as gifts in Japanese culture as symbols of love, gratitude, and peace. Their bright colors and unique patterns present a high degree of eloquence to the Japanese people, thus creating a level of respect and appreciation for the Koi.\nWith Koi fish being at the forefront of a lot of Japanese art, it is common to find modern depictions of Koi in paintings, home art, murals, and even tattoos.\nTo many people, Koi fish strongly represent Samurai warriors, as they are able to be seen swimming upwards against a rivers current, symbolizing a Samurai's bravery. One typical saying is the phrase \"koi no taki-nobori\", translating to \"Carp climbing the waterfalls\", a phrase that is used to describe a persons strength and perseverance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The marches were dedicated to his friends including composer Granville Bantock and organists George Robertson Sinclair, Ivor Atkins and Percy Hull.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOrigin of the name.\nElgar took the phrase \"Pomp and Circumstance\" from Act 3, Scene 3 of Shakespeare's \"Othello\":\n&lt;poem&gt;Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\nThe spirit-stirring drum, th'ear-piercing fife,\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\nPride, \"pomp, and circumstance\" of glorious war!&lt;/poem&gt;\nAdditionally, on the score of the first march, Elgar set as a motto for the whole set of marches a verse from Lord de Tabley's poem \"The March of Glory\", which (as quoted by Elgar's biographer Basil Maine) begins with:\n&lt;poem&gt;Like a proud music that draws men on to die\nMadly upon the spears in martial ecstasy,\nA measure that sets heaven in all their veins\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And iron in their hands.\nI hear the Nation march\nBeneath her ensign as an eagle's wing;\nO'er shield and sheeted targe\nThe banners of my faith most gaily swing;\nMoving to victory with solemn noise,\nWith worship and with conquest, and the voice of myriads.&lt;/poem&gt;\nShakespeare's words proclaim the \"shows of things\" (Maine's quotation marks): the na\u00efve assumption that the splendid show of military pageantry\u2014\"Pomp\"\u2014has no connection with the drabness and terror\u2014\"Circumstance\"\u2014of actual warfare. The first four marches were all written before the events of World War I shattered that belief, and the styles in which wars were written about spurned the false romance of the battle-song.\nMarches.\nThe \"Pomp and Circumstance\" marches are\nThe first five were all published by Boosey &amp; Co. as Elgar's Opus 39, and each of the marches is dedicated to a particular musical friend of Elgar's.\nEach march takes about five minutes to play.\nMarch No. 1 in D.\nDedication.\nMarch No. 1, was composed in 1901 and dedicated \"to my friend Alfred E. Rodewald and the members of the Liverpool Orchestral Society\".\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: two piccolos (2nd \"ad lib.\"), two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns in F, two trumpets in F, two cornets in A, three trombones, tuba, three timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, triangle, side drum, jingles, glockenspiel (ad. lib.) and tambourine (ad lib.)), two harps, organ, and strings.\nHistory.\nThe best-known of the six marches, \"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D\" had its premiere, along with March No. 2, in Liverpool on 19 October 1901, with Alfred Rodewald conducting the Liverpool Orchestral Society. Elgar and his wife attended, and it was a \"frantic\" success. Both marches were played two days later at a London Promenade Concert (which the Elgars unintentionally missed) in the Queen's Hall London, conducted by Henry Wood, with March No. 1 played second. Wood remembered that the audience \"...rose and yelled... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\"\nThe \"Trio\" contains the tune known as \"Land of Hope and Glory\". In 1902 the tune was re-used, in modified form, for the \"Land of Hope and Glory\" section of his \"Coronation Ode\" for King Edward VII. The words were further modified to fit the original tune. The result has since become a fixture at the Last Night of the Proms, and an English sporting anthem and general patriotic song.\nMarch No. 1 was the first piece in the recessional music for the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II, followed in both cases by March No. 4.\nIn Canada, the Philippines, and the United States, the \"Trio\" section \"Land of Hope and Glory\" of March No. 1 is often known simply as \"Pomp and Circumstance\" or as \"The Graduation March\" and is played as the at virtually all high school and most college graduation ceremonies. It was first played at such a ceremony on 28 June 1905, at Yale University, where the Professor of Music Samuel Sanford had invited his friend Elgar to attend commencement and receive an honorary doctorate of music. Elgar accepted, and Sanford made certain he was the star of the proceedings, engaging the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the College Choir, the Glee Club, the music faculty members, and New York musicians to perform two parts from Elgar's oratorio \"The Light of Life\" and, as the graduates and officials marched out, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" March No. 1. Elgar repaid the compliment by dedicating his \"Introduction and Allegro\" to Sanford later that year.\nDescription.\nMarch No. 1 opens with an introduction marked \"Allegro, con molto fuoco.\" The introduction leads to a new theme: strong pairs of beats alternating with short notes, and a bass which persistently clashes with the tune. The bass tuba and full brass is held back until the section is repeated by the full orchestra. A little rhythmic pattern is played by the strings, then repeated high and low in the orchestra before the section is concluded by a chromatic upward scale from the woodwind. The whole of this lively march section is repeated. The bridging section between this and the well-known \"Trio\" has rhythmic chords from the brass punctuating high held notes from the wind and strings, before a fanfare from trumpets and trombones leads into the theme with which the march started. There are a few single notes that quieten, ending with a single quiet tap from side drum and cymbal accompanied by all the bassoons. The famous, lyrical \"Land of Hope and Glory\" \"trio\" follows (in the subdominant key of G), played softly (by the first violins, four horns and two clarinets) and repeated by the full orchestra including two harps. What follows is a repetition of what has been heard before, including a fuller statement of the \"Trio\" (this time in the 'home' key of D) in which the orchestra is joined by organ as well as the two harps. The march ends, not with the big tune, but with a short section containing a brief reminder of the brisk opening march.\nMarch No. 2 in A minor.\nDedication.\nMarch No. 2 was composed in 1901 and dedicated \"To my friend Granville Bantock\".\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in F, 2 cornets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (2 side drums, triangle, glockenspiel &amp; jingles, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.\nHistory.\nIt was first performed, as was March No. 1, by the Liverpool Orchestral Society conducted by Alfred Rodewald, in Liverpool on 19 October 1901. Both marches were played two days later at a London Promenade Concert.\nDescription.\nThe second is the shortest and most simply constructed of the marches. The composer Charles Villiers Stanford is said to have preferred this march to the first, and thought this the finest of all the marches. After a loud call to attention from the brass, a simple \"staccato\" theme, tense and repetitive, is played quietly by the strings, being gradually joined by other instruments before building up to an abrupt climax. This section is repeated. The second theme, confidently played by horns and clarinets, with contrasting triple and duple rhythms, is one which was sketched by Elgar a few years before: this is developed and ends with flourishes from the strings and brass joined by the glockenspiel. The opening \"staccato\" theme returns, concluded by a quiet swirling bass passage, which leads into the \"Trio\" section (in the tonic major key of A) which consists of a delightfully simple tune in thirds played by the woodwind (flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons), answered conclusively by the strings and brass. This \"Trio\" section is repeated, and the march concluded with a brilliant little coda, which includes a drum roll on the snare drum, a shattering chord in A Minor, briefly played by horns, and followed by a final cadence.\nMarch No. 3 in C minor.\nDedication.\nMarch No. 3 was completed in November 1904 and published in 1905. It was dedicated \"To my friend Ivor Atkins\". It was first performed on 8 March 1905, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by the composer.\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B\u266d, bass clarinet in B\u266d, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in B\u266d, 2 cornets in B\u266d, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (tenor drum, side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.\nDescription.\nMarch No. 3 differs from the others in its opening mood, which is deliberately solemn. It begins with a dark subdued quick march led by low clarinets, three bassoons and the horns (with drum-beats inserted between the notes of the tune), before a vigorous theme (with brass alone at the first beats), erupts from the full orchestra. The dark theme re-appears, is then restarted boldly, then ended abruptly. The central section commences with a perky tune played by a solo clarinet with simple string accompaniment, which is followed by another of Elgar's noble tunes played by the strings of the orchestra. All the themes re-appear and there is the final section which ends abruptly.\nMarch No. 4 in G.\nMarch No. 4 is as upbeat and ceremonial as No. 1, containing another big tune in the central \"Trio\" section.\nDedication.\nMarch No. 4 was completed on 7 June 1907, and dedicated \"To my friend Dr. G. Robertson Sinclair, Hereford\". It was first performed on 24 August 1907, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by the composer.\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: piccolo (with 3rd flute), 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B\u266d, bass clarinet in B\u266d, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in A, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), 2 harps, and strings.\nHistory.\nThe \"Trio\" was used by Elgar in a song called \"The King's Way\" which he wrote, to his wife's words, in celebration of the opening of an important new London street called Kingsway in 1909.\nDuring World War II, No. 4 also acquired words: a patriotic poem by A. P. Herbert with the refrain beginning \"All men must be free\" was used as \"Song of Liberty\".\nDuring the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981, \"Pomp and Circumstance\" No. 4 served as the recessional. As Diana's veil was lifted and the couple bowed and curtsied to Queen Elizabeth II, the opening notes sounded and continued as they walked down the aisle of St Paul's Cathedral out to the portico and the waiting crowds.\nMarch No. 4 was the first piece in the recessional music for the coronation of Charles III on 6 May 2023.\nDescription.\nThe march has an opening section consisting mainly of two-bar rhythmic phrases which are repeated in various forms, and a lyrical \"Trio\" constructed like the famous \"Land of Hope and Glory\" trio of March No. 1.\nThe first eight bars of the march is played by the full orchestra with the melody played by the violas and upper woodwind. Both harps play from the beginning, while the cellos, double basses and timpani contribute a simple bass figure. The bass clarinet, contrabassoon, trombones and tuba are held \"in reserve\" for the repeat, when the first violins join the violas with the tune. There are subdued fanfares from the brass interrupted by little flourishes from the strings before the opening march is repeated. There is pause, then a little section which starts forcefully but quietens, leading into the \"Trio\". The \"Trio\" follows the pattern of March No. 1, with the melody (in the subdominant key of C) played by clarinet, horn and violins. The violins start the \"Trio\" tune on the lowest note they can play, an open G-string, which gives a recognisable \"twang\" to this one note, and they are directed to play the passage \"sul G\" on the same string, for the sake of the tone-colour, and the accompaniment is from the harps, low strings and bassoons. The grand tune is repeated, as we expect, by the full orchestra; the opening march section returns; the grand tune is repeated once more, in the \"home\" key of G major; and the last word is had by a re-statement of the opening rhythmic patterns. The march prepares the audience for its end as surely as a train pulling into a station, with the violins, violas, and cellos ending on their resonant open G.\nMarch No. 5 in C.\nDedication.\nMarch No. 5 was composed in 1930, much later than the others, and dedicated \"To my friend Dr. Percy C. Hull, Hereford\". Its first public performance was on 20 September 1930 in a Queen's Hall concert conducted by Sir Henry Wood, though it had been recorded two days earlier in the Kingsway Hall, London, conducted by Elgar himself in spite of his poor health.\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B\u266d, bass clarinet in B\u266d, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B\u266d, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (3), percussion (side drum, bass drum &amp; cymbals), and strings.\nDescription.\nWithout introduction, its opening episode is extended with enormous confidence and proceeds directly into the \"Trio\" section. The \"Trio\" starts quietly in a similar way to the introduction of his First Symphony: just a moving bass line and a tune, also in the same key (A\u266d). The tune is re-stated strongly, as we expect, then developed. The re-statement of the opening employs the same instruments of the orchestra, but is this time started as soft as possible for just four bars before a quick \"crescendo\" restores its spirit to as it was in the beginning. There is more development before a big return of the \"Trio\" theme, in the home key of C, and a triumphant ending which might bring to mind the conclusion of Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\".\nMarch No. 6 in G minor.\nHistory.\nElgar left sketches for a sixth \"Pomp and Circumstance\" march, to be the final work in the set.\nVersion orchestrated by Percy M. Young.\nIn 1956, Boosey &amp; Co. published a \"Military March No. 6\" in the key of B\u266d major, arranged and orchestrated by Percy M. Young. According to the introduction Young indicates that certain manuscripts were made available to him from the estate of the Grafton family (of Elgar's niece May Grafton), including a short score dated March 1924 and separate violin and cello parts. Elgar indicated details of orchestration and expression. From these sources Young orchestrated 117 bars for full orchestra including harp (but not organ). However it appears to be substantially \"The Empire March\" composed for the British Empire Exhibition of 1924, including the Trio section \"A Song of Union\".\nVersion completed by Anthony Payne.\nIn 2005, Elgar's sketches were sent by the lawyer for the Elgar Will Trust in a bundle to the English composer Anthony Payne. Also included was an article titled \"Circumstantial Evidence\" by the Elgar authority Christopher Kent from the August 1997 \"Musical Times\" explaining the sketches. One idea in the sketches was marked by the composer \"jolly good\". Kent believed that Elgar's compositional thoughts and time were by then engaged with the Third Symphony and \"The Spanish Lady\", and that the main theme for the march was \"unpromising\". Payne felt there was not enough in the sketches to complete the march, but three pages of score in Elgar's handwriting were discovered at the Royal School of Church Music Colles Library marked \"P&amp;C 6\". In 2006, the score and sketches were turned into a performing version. Payne observed in the programme notes that \"Nowhere else in the Pomp and Circumstance marches does Elgar combine compound and duple metres in this way\". Payne concluded the piece with a brief allusion to the first Pomp and Circumstance March. The world premiere of Payne's version was on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms at Royal Albert Hall. The first recording was by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Richard Hickox.\nInstrumentation.\nThe instrumentation is: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B\u266d, bass clarinet in B\u266d, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B\u266d, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani (4), percussion (side drum, cymbals, bass drum, jingles, glockenspiel), and strings.\nArrangements.\nFor piano solo: The first four marches were arranged by Adolf Schmid and March No. 5 by Victor Hely-Hutchinson.\nFor piano duo: Marches Nos. 1 &amp; 2 were arranged by Adolf Schmid.\nFor organ: March No. 1 was arranged by Edwin H. Lemare and March No. 4 was arranged by G. R. Sinclair. Marches 1\u20135 have been arranged in simplified and abbreviated form by William McVicker; concert transcriptions of Marches 2, 3, and 5, matching the Lemare and Sinclair arrangements, have been made by Michael Brough for use at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, but have not yet been published.\nFor military band: The first four marches were arranged by M. Retford and March No. 5 by Thomas Conway Brown.\nFor brass band: March No. 1 was arranged (transposed to B\u266d) by J. Ord Hume.\nAn arrangement by Peter Schickele featuring melodies from Marches 1 through 4 was used in Disney's \"Fantasia 2000\" to accompany a retelling of the story of Noah's Ark featuring Donald and Daisy Duck. This version was performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and features a choral accompaniment from the Chicago Symphony Chorus with soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. James Levine, who conducts for this recording, introduces the segment, all the while Mickey, having just completed the previous segment from the original film, searches for Donald to remind him that the segment is starting up.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "60902", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60902", "title": "FAT filesystem and Linux", "text": "Widely used Linux filesystem format\nLinux has several filesystem drivers for the File Allocation Table (FAT) filesystem format. These are commonly known by the names used in the codice_1 command to invoke particular drivers in the kernel: \"msdos\", \"vfat\", and \"umsdos\".\nHistory and support.\nMost of the major Linux distributions, including RedHat, SuSE, and Debian, do not employ \"umsdos\" to permit installation of Linux on a FAT disc volume. A few distributions do, however. These include distributions such as Phat Linux, which installs in codice_2 on DOS by unpacking a ZIP file and is booted by running a COMMAND.COM script named codice_3, and ZipSlack.\nThe UMSDOS project was started in 1992 by Jacques Gelinas and made available to the net in January 1994 as a patch. It was included in the standard distribution starting with kernel 1.1.36. UMSDOS was removed from the Linux 2.6.11 kernel for lack of maintenance. UVFAT, an extension of UMSDOS to use the Windows data structures for long filenames instead of its own, was discontinued before release. They should work in 2.4.x kernels.\nEarlier Linux distributions which used UMSDOS are MuLinux, Monkey Linux and Winlinux 2000.\nFeature comparison.\nAll of the Linux filesystem drivers support all three FAT types, namely FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. Where they differ is in the provision of support for long filenames, beyond the 8.3 filename structure of the original FAT filesystem format, and in the provision of Unix file semantics that do not exist as standard in the FAT filesystem format such as file permissions. The filesystem drivers are mutually exclusive. Only one can be used to mount any given disk volume at any given time. Thus the choice among them is determined by what long filenames and Unix semantics they support and what use one wants to make of the disk volume.\nmsdos.\nThe \"msdos\" filesystem driver provides no extra Unix file semantics and no long filename support. If a FAT disk filesystem is mounted using this driver, only 8.3 filenames will be visible, no long filenames will be accessible, nor will any long filename data structures of any kind on the disk volume be maintained. The \"vfat\" filesystem driver provides long filename support using the same disk data structures that Microsoft Windows uses for VFAT long filename support on FAT format volumes, but it does not support any extra Unix file semantics. The \"umsdos\" filesystem driver provides long filename support, and extra Unix file semantics. However, it does so using on-disk data structures that are not recognized by any filesystem drivers for any operating systems other than Linux.\numsdos.\nThe key advantage to \"umsdos\" out of the three is that it provides full Unix file semantics. Therefore, it can be used in situations where it is desirable to install Linux on and run it from a FAT disk volume, which require such semantics to be available. However, Linux installed on and running from such a disk volume is slower than Linux installed on and running from a disk volume formatted with, for example, the ext2 filesystem format. Further, unless a utility program is regularly run every time that one switches from running Windows to running Linux, certain changes made to files and directories on the disk by Windows will cause error messages about inaccessible files in Linux.\nvfat.\n\"vfat\", although lacking full Unix file semantics and lacking the ability to have Linux installed on and running from a FAT disk volume, does not have the aforementioned disadvantages of \"umsdos\" when it comes to simply sharing data on a FAT disk volume between Linux and other operating systems such as Windows. Its data structures are the same as those used by Windows for VFAT long filenames, and it does not require running a synchronization utility in order to prevent Windows and Linux data structures from becoming disjointed. For this reason, it is the most appropriate of Linux's FAT filesystem drivers to use in the majority of situations.\nCommonalities.\nAs mentioned previously, all of the Linux filesystem drivers support all of the three File Allocation Table sizes, 12-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. Other common features that they all support are various Linux mounting options (specified with the codice_4 option to the codice_1 command):\numsdos.\nData structure.\nThe \"umsdos\" FAT filesystem driver stores all of the extra information relating to Unix file semantics in what, to another FAT filesystem driver, appears to be just a normal file in each directory and subdirectory, named codice_18.\nIn the absence of this file in any given directory, and thus by default, the \"umsdos\" filesystem driver provides the same semantics as the \"msdos\" filesystem driver does for the directory: only 8.3 filenames and no extra Unix file semantics. To enable the \"umsdos\" driver's extra abilities, it is necessary to create that file in the directory and synchronize its internal data with the normal FAT data for any existing entries already in the directory. This is done with a tool called codice_19.\nThis is the utility program that is run, across every directory on the disc volume, every time that one switches from running Windows to running Linux, in order for the \"umsdos\" filesystem driver to incorporate any changes made to files and directories by Windows into its private data structures in its codice_18 file. By default, the codice_19 tool creates codice_18 files in directories if they do not already exist, resulting in such a file in every directory in the disc volume. When switching between Windows and Linux this behaviour is not often considered desirable. Therefore, the normal mode of operation when invoking codice_19 after switching from Windows to Linux (which is usually done by running the tool at Linux boot time from a startup script) is to employ the codice_24 option to the command, which prevents the creation of any new codice_18 files in directories that do not already possess them.\nInstalling Linux on FAT.\nAs mentioned, \"umsdos\" permits installing Linux on, and then bootstrapping and running it from, a FAT format disc volume. The advantage of this is that it permits the use of Linux on a computer where DOS is already installed, without requiring that the hard disc be repartitioned. Linux is not bootstrapped directly from a Volume Boot Record in such a scenario. Instead DOS is first bootstrapped, and loadlin or linld is used to then bootstrap Linux from DOS.\nThe convention for such an installation is for the Linux root directory to be a subdirectory of the root directory of the DOS boot volume, e.g. codice_26 . The various Linux top-level directories are thus, to DOS, directories such as codice_27 (for codice_28), codice_29 (for codice_30), codice_31 (for codice_32), and so forth. The \"umsdos\" filesystem driver automatically prepends the codice_33 to all pathnames. The location of the Linux root directory is supplied to the \"umsdos\" filesystem driver in the first place via an option to the codice_34 command. So, for example, codice_34 would be invoked with a command line such as codice_36 .\nThe installation of Linux into such a directory in the first place simply involves unpacking files from an archive into that directory and its subdirectories. Such an installation also generally requires the use of a swap file rather than a swap partition for Linux, however this is related to the desire not to repartition the hard disc and unrelated to the \"umsdos\" filesystem driver per se.\nAccessing FAT formatted volumes without kernel support.\nAlthough the filesystem drivers in the kernel make it possible to access files and directories on FAT formatted volumes in the normal manner, it is also possible to do so without kernel driver support, using the utility programs that form the mtools utility suite. Like the \"vfat\" FAT filesystem driver, mountlo provides long filename support using the same disc data structures that Microsoft Windows uses.\nAlternately, one of the FUSE filesystem drivers may be used\u2014FatFuse, FuseFat or mountlo.\nPOSIX overlay filesystem.\nA modern equivalent of UMSDOS is POSIX Overlay Filesystem (posixovl). It works in FUSE.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Page is a centibillionaire and among the richest people in the world.\nPage was chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 when he stepped down in favor of Eric Schmidt, and then again from April 2011 until July 2015 when he became CEO of its newly formed parent organization Alphabet Inc. He held that post until December 4, 2019, when he and Brin stepped down from all executive positions and day-to-day roles within the company. He remains an Alphabet board member, employee, and controlling shareholder.\nPage is the co-creator and namesake of PageRank, a search ranking algorithm for Google for which he received the Marconi Prize in 2004 along with co-writer Brin.\nEarly life.\nLawrence Edward Page was born on March 26, 1973, in Lansing, Michigan. His mother is Jewish; his maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel, though Page's household while growing up was secular. His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan. BBC reporter Will Smale described him as a \"pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence\". Page's paternal grandparents came from a Protestant background. Page's father was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and his mother Gloria was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at the same institution. Larry's parents divorced when he was eight years old, but he maintained a good relationship both with his mother Gloria and his father's long-term partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal.ch. 2\nWhen Larry Page was six years old, in 1979, his father brought home an Exidy Sorcerer computer, which Larry soon mastered and began using for schoolwork.\nDuring an interview, Page recalled his childhood home \"was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and \"Popular Science\" magazines all over the place\", an environment in which he immersed himself. Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: \"I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines\". According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents \"fostered creativity and invention\". Page also played instruments and studied music composition while growing up. His parents sent him to music summer camp\u2014Interlochen Arts Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, and Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. \"In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me\". In an interview Page said that \"In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing\" and that \"If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second\".\nPage was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to \"play with the stuff lying around\"\u2014first-generation personal computers\u2014that had been left by his mother and father. He became the \"first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor\". His older brother Carl Victor Page Jr.ch. 2 also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking \"everything in his house apart to see how it worked\". He said that \"from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually.\"\nEducation.\nPage attended Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from ages two to seven (1975 to 1979). He attended East Lansing High School, graduating in 1991. In summer school, he attended Interlochen Center for the Arts at Interlochen, Michigan, playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summers.\nPage received a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a major in Computer Engineering with honors from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master of Science in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1998.\nWhile at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges\u2014Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge and built the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu honor society, and was a member of the 1993 \"Maize &amp; Blue\" University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid-transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.\nPhD studies and research.\nAfter enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received. He also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPage focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research. Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub.\" Together, the pair authored a research paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.\nJohn Battelle, co-founder of \"Wired\" magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that:\n[the] entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation\u2014after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it \"the Web would become a more valuable place.\"\nBattelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:\nAt the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. \"I talked to lots of research groups\" around the school, Brin recalls, \"and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry.\"\nSearch engine development.\nTo convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.\nCombining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.\nPage and Brin used the former's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.\nBy early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Some Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996)\nTotal indexable HTML URLs: 75.2306 Million\nTotal content downloaded: 207.022 gigabytes\nBackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of a disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.\"\nBackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: \"We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.\" Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: \"Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is real.\"\nPage and Brin's vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:\nIn 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts \u2013 originally replicated by hand \u2013 to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance [...] Google has done a similar job.\nThe comparison was also noted by the authors of \"The Google Story\": \"Not since Gutenberg [...] has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.\" Also, not long after the two \"cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web\" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.\nGoogle.\n1998\u20132000.\nFounding.\nMark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story:Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park. [Soon after], Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 cheque to \"Google, Inc.\" The only problem was, \"Google, Inc.\" did not yet exist\u2014the company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc. with the initial domain name of \"Googol\", derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Using the garage in their friend Susan Wojcicki's Menlo Park home for $1,700 a month, Page and Brin were able to successfully build the Google search engine. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, was Google's president. Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:The pair's mission was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.\nBy June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that \"there are more than 1 billion web pages online today\", with Google \"providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.\"\nEarly management style.\nDuring his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google's engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him\u2014Page explained that he did not like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge. Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:\nEven though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction. Page also believed that the faster Google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineers\u2014from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers\u2014to think about lag times. He also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the page load faster.\n2001\u20132011.\nChanges in management and expansion.\nBefore Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a \"world-class management team.\" Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including Steve Jobs and Intel's Andrew Grove. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the president of products role.\nUnder Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004. He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.\nPage led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.\nAssumption of CEO position at Google.\nFollowing a January 2011 announcement, Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman. By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees. Reporter Max Nisen described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as Page's \"lost decade\" saying that while he exerted significant influence at Google via product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.\nSchmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, jokingly tweeting on Twitter: \"Adult-supervision no longer needed.\"\n2011\u20132013.\nAs Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Then Page also formed what the media called the \"L-Team\", a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked near his office for a portion of the working week. Additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including YouTube, AdWords, and Google Search.\nFollowing a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new \"zero tolerance for fighting\" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually concluded that ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.\nChanges and consolidation process.\nAt least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified. Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, \"Project Kennedy\", based on Page's use of the term \"moonshots\" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 \"Wired\" interview. An initiative named \"Kanna\" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when \"Kennedy\" started, explained in 2013 that \"Google passionately cares about design.\" Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a \"cohesive vision\" of Google might look like.\nThe eventual results of \"Kennedy\" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon \"refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.\" The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can \"move fast\", and \"Kennedy\" was called a \"design revolution\" by Duarte. Page's \"UXA\" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the \"Kennedy\" project, tasked with \"designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Google's application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users.\" Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that \"Kennedy\" became an \"institution.\"\nAcquisition strategy and new products.\nWhen acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question \"Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?\". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.\nWith Facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, Google+, in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra, Google's then senior vice president of social.\nIn August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility. The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc. Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011, that \"companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to 'protect competition and innovation in the open source software community' [...] Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies\". In 2014, Page sold Motorola Mobility for $2.9 billion to Personal Computer maker, Lenovo which represented a loss in value of $9.5 billion over two years.\nPage also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, ChromeOS.\n2013\u20132015.\nIn January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with \"Wired\", in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's \"10X\" mentality\u2014Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors\u2014in the introductory blurb. Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to Levy that 10X is \"just core to who he [Page] is\", while Page's \"focus is on where the next 10X will come from.\" In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of \"crazy\" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: \"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things.\" Page also stated he was \"very happy\" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced:\"I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their peril.\"At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said \"We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity [...] Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist\" and that he was \"sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be\", citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause. In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility\u2014he referred to Microsoft's practice as \"milking off\". During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised\u2014it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.\nIn September 2013, Page launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&amp;D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: \"Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives.\"\nPage participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.\nPage responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a \"bad rap\", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing \"50 or 20 years ago\". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceX:\"He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That's a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and make it better [...] I'd like for us to help out more than we are.\"Page also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercialization:\"Invention is not enough. [Nikola] Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things []... invention and innovation focus, plus [...] a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.\"Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including Google X initiatives; access and energy, including Google Fiber; smart-home automation through Nest Labs; and biotechnology innovations under Calico. Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial \"chief product officer\". Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page.\nIn a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his \"deep knowledge\" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. About his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: \"I think my job as CEO\u2014I feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead.\"\nOn August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc. In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:\"Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. [...] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related.\"As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:\"We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha\u2011bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!\"Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable.\" He also wrote that there was a desire to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.\nPage has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" termed the reorganization into Alphabet a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a \"futurist\", highly detached from day-to-day business dealings, and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are \"akin to a royal visit\".\n2019.\nOn December 3, 2019, Larry Page announced that he would step down from the position of Alphabet CEO and be replaced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai also continued as Google CEO. Page and Google co-founder and Alphabet president Sergey Brin announced the change in a joint blog post, \"With Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it's the natural time to simplify our management structure. We\u2019ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President.\"\nOther interests.\nPage is an investor in Tesla Motors co-founded by friend and fellow billionaire Elon Musk. He has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars and other alternative energy investments. He also was a strategic backer in the Opener and Kitty Hawk startups, developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel. The company has ceased all activities. It was merged into the Wisk Aero joint venture with Boeing in September 2022. Page founded Dynatomics, a Palo Alto-based startup established in 2023, that uses artificial intelligence to optimize product manufacturing processes.\nPage is interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in ), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.\nPage helped to set up Singularity University, a transhumanist think-tank.\nPersonal life.\nIn the early 2000s, Page briefly dated Marissa Mayer, American business leader and former CEO of Yahoo!, who was a Google employee at that time.\nOn February 18, 2005, Page bought a Spanish Colonial Revival architecture house in Palo Alto, California, designed by American artistic polymath Pedro Joseph de Lemos, a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of US$7.95 million. A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos's family's castle in Spain. The Pedro de Lemos House was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de Lemos. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn 2007, Page married Lucinda Southworth on Necker Island, the Caribbean island owned by Richard Branson. Southworth is a research scientist and the sister of American actress and model Carrie Southworth. Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011 respectively.\nIn 2009, Page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in Palo Alto to make room for a large ecohouse. The existing buildings were \"deconstructed\" and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to \"minimize the impact on the environment.\" Page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC (volatile organic compound) materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. The house's exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. The house also observes other green home design features such as organic architecture building materials and low volatile organic compound paint.\nIn 2011, Page bought the $45-million superyacht \"Senses\". Later on, Page announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999, and that the doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. The Google+ post also revealed that Page had made a large donation to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in Boston. An anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20 million. In October 2013, \"Business Insider\" reported that Page's paralysis were caused by an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and prevented him from undertaking Google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.\nIn November 2014, Page's family foundation, the Carl Victor Page Memorial Fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15 million to aid the effort against the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Page wrote on his Google+ page that \"My wife and I just donated $15 million [...] Our hearts go out to everyone affected.\"\nIn August 2021 it was revealed that Page holds a New Zealand resident's visa and had traveled to the country on a medivac flight from Fiji for his son's treatment in New Zealand. The flight took place on January 12, 2021. Page had been living in Fiji with his family during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2023, the US Virgin Islands tried several times to serve Page a subpoena in the lawsuit over JPMorgan Chase's links to Jeffrey Epstein.\nPage has purchased multiple private islands across the Caribbean and South Pacific, including the Hans Lollik Island in 2014, Eustatia Island, Cayo Norte in 2018, and Tavarua in 2020.\nIn popular culture.\nA fictionalized version of Larry Page portrayed by actor Ben Feldman appeared in the Showtime drama series \"Super Pumped\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the president of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., until stepping down from the role on December 3, 2019. He and Page remain at Alphabet as co-founders, controlling shareholders, and board members. Brin is a centibillionaire and among the richest people in the world.\nBrin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science. After graduation, in September 1993, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and he discontinued his PhD studies to start Google in Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park.\nIn December 2023, he came out of retirement to contribute to AI research at Alphabet Inc..\nEarly life and education.\nSergey Mikhailovich Brin was born into a Jewish family on August 21, 1973, in the Russian city of Moscow. Russia was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union at the time of his birth. Both of Brin's parents, Mikhail and Eugenia Brin (1948\u20132024), had graduated from Moscow State University (MSU). His father is a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother was a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother. In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced because of anti-Semitism in Soviet Union, that it was time for the family to emigrate. They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result, his father was \"promptly fired\". For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.\nThe Brin family lived in Vienna and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the University of Maryland with help from Anatole Katok. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.\nHe attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and high honors in mathematics at the age of 19. In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica. \nBrin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation, receiving an M.S. in computer science in 1995. As of 2008[ [update]], he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.\nSearch engine development.\nDuring an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met Larry Page. The two men seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together they \"became intellectual soul-mates and close friends.\" Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was on extending \"the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers\". Together, they authored a paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\".\nTo convert the backlink data gathered by Backrub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to those existing at the time. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, they began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.\nAfter filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.\nPage and Brin used Page's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available on the Stanford Web site.\nBy early 1997, the Backrub page described the state as follows:\nSome Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996)\nTotal indexable HTML urls: 75.2306\u00a0Million\nTotal content downloaded: 207.022\u00a0gigabytes\nBackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.\n- Larry Page pagecs.stanford.edu\nBackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: \"We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.\" Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: \"Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real.\"\nSome compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe comparison was also noted by the authors of \"The Google Story\": \"Not since Gutenberg... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.\" Also, not long after the two \"cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web,\" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.\nOther interests.\nIn June 2008, Brin invested $4.5\u00a0million in Space Adventures, a Virginia-based space tourism company.\nBrin and Page jointly own a customized Boeing 767\u2013200 and a Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, and pay $1.3\u00a0million a year to house them and two Gulfstream V jets owned by Google executives at Moffett Federal Airfield. The aircraft has scientific equipment installed by NASA to allow experimental data to be collected in flight.\nBrin is a backer of LTA Research &amp; Exploration LLC, an airship maker company. In October 2023, LTA's 124-meter long flagship, Pathfinder 1, became the largest airship since the \"Hindenburg\" to receive clearance for flight testing, permitted over the boundaries of Moffett Field and neighboring Palo Alto Airport's airspaces, at a height of up to 460 meters.\nPersonal life.\nBrin was raised Jewish, but is not religious.\nIn May 2007, Brin married biotech analyst and entrepreneur Anne Wojcicki in the Bahamas. They had a son in late 2008 and a daughter in late 2011. In August 2013, it was announced that Brin and his wife were living separately after Brin had an extramarital affair with a Google Glass colleague. In June 2015, Brin and Wojcicki finalized their divorce.\nOn November 7, 2018, he married Nicole Shanahan, a legal tech founder. They have a daughter, born in late 2018. Brin and Shanahan separated on December 15, 2021, and Brin filed for divorce on January 4, 2022. In summer 2023, the divorce was finalized. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that a reason for the breakup was a \"brief affair\" in 2021 between Shanahan and Elon Musk. \nBrin's mother, Eugenia, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In 2008, he decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where his mother has received treatment. According to \"Forbes\", Brin has donated over $1\u00a0billion to fund research on the disease.\nBrin and Wojcicki, although separated, jointly ran The Brin Wojcicki Foundation until 2014. Since then, Brin has used the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and a donor-advised fund for his philanthropic giving. They donated extensively to The Michael J. Fox Foundation and in 2009 gave $1\u00a0million to support the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.\nBrin is a donor to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, having donated $5,000 to Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and $30,800 to the DNC. Brin attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump, sitting alongside Donald Trump supporters and other tech moguls.\nNotes and references.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formed in 1946 through a forced merger of the East German branches of the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the SED aimed to consolidate working-class politics under a common platform of Marxism\u2013Leninism. The SED played a central role in the building of East Germany's socialist institutions, economy and governance, steering the country's development in line with a planned economy and collective social welfare. \nThe SED was structured according to democratic centralism, with authority flowing from the Party Congress through the Central Committee to the Politburo. Though the Party Congress formally held supreme authority, the Politburo and the Secretariat carried out decision-making between congresses. The SED's General Secretary wielded absolute power, often serving concurrently in key state roles. Walter Ulbricht, the party's leading figure from the early 1950s until 1971, oversaw the construction of East Germany's socialist economy and institutions, but was eventually deposed for a series of failed economic reforms aimed at raising the GDR's competitiveness, as well as a worsening relationship with the Soviets. His successor, Erich Honecker, presided over a period of increasing economic stagnation until 1989. The SED promoted universal education and healthcare, the collectivisation of agriculture and the nationalisation of industry, while placing emphasis on ideological training, including mandatory instruction in Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Russian language in schools and universities. Near the end of the Cold War, it remained skeptical of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, viewing these as destabilising for the socialist project. This position eventually contributed to East Germany's political isolation and the rapid transformation that followed in 1989.\nIn the wake of the Peaceful Revolution and the reunification of Germany, the SED's reformist elements moved swiftly to reposition the party within a pluralist system. In December 1989, it reconstituted itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), formally abandoning Marxism\u2013Leninism and endorsing democratic socialism. The PDS achieved significant electoral support in eastern Germany during the 1990s, securing 16.4% of the vote in the 1990 East German general election. In 2007, it merged with Labour and Social Justice (WASG) to form The Left (\"Die Linke\"), which remains a parliamentary force in the Bundestag, continuing to represent the legacy of East German socialism within a democratic framework in a reunified Germany.\nEarly history.\nThe SED was founded on 21 April 1946 by a merger of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) which was based in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin. Official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties. However, there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than commonly portrayed. By all accounts, the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's eastern branch to merge with the KPD. The newly merged party, with the help of the Soviet authorities, swept to victory in the 1946 elections for local and regional assemblies held in the Soviet zone. However, these elections were held under less-than-secret conditions, thus setting the tone for the next four decades. Conversely, in the Berlin City Council elections held that same year, the merger fared more poorly. In that contest, the SED received less than half the votes of the SPD. The bulk of the Berlin SPD remained aloof from the merger, even though Berlin was deep inside the Soviet zone.\nThe Soviet Military Administration in Germany (Russian initials: SVAG) directly governed the eastern areas of Germany following World War II, and their intelligence operations carefully monitored all political activities. An early intelligence report from SVAG Propaganda Administration director Lieutenant Colonel Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov indicates that the former KPD and SPD members created different factions within the SED and remained mutually quite antagonistic for some time after the formation of the new party. The report also noted considerable difficulty in convincing the masses that the SED was an authentic German political party and not merely a tool of the Soviet occupation force.\nAccording to Tiulpanov, many former members of the KPD expressed the sentiment that they had \"forfeited [their] revolutionary positions, that [the KPD] alone would have succeeded much better had there been no SED, and that the Social Democrats are not to be trusted\" (Tiulpanov, 1946). Tiulpanov also indicated that there was a marked \"political passivity\" among former SPD members, who felt they were being treated unfairly and as second-class party members by the new SED administration. As a result, the early SED party apparatus frequently became effectively immobilised as former KPD members began discussing any proposal, however small, at great length with former SPD members, so as to achieve consensus and avoid offending them. Soviet intelligence claimed to have a list of names of an SPD group within the SED that was covertly forging links with the SPD in the West and even with the Western Allied occupation authorities.\nA problem for the Soviets that they identified with the early SED was its potential to develop into a nationalist party. At large party meetings, members applauded speakers who talked of nationalism much more than when they spoke of solving social problems and gender equality. Some even proposed the idea of establishing an independent German socialist state free of both Soviet and Western influence, and of soon regaining the formerly German land that the Yalta Conference, and ultimately the Potsdam Conference, had allocated to Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia. The SED began to integrate former members of the Nazi Party at its founding. However, the strategy was controversial within the party. The SED therefore set up the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD) in 1948 as satellite party that could serve as a pool for former Nazis and Wehrmacht officers. Nonetheless, the SED continued to absorb former Nazi Party members. By 1954, 27 percent of all members of the SED and 32.2 percent of all public service employees were former members of the Nazi Party.\nSoviet negotiators reported that SED politicians frequently went beyond the boundaries of the political statements which had been approved by the Soviet monitors, and there was some initial difficulty making regional SED officials realize that they should think carefully before opposing the political positions decided upon by the Central Committee in Berlin.\nA monopoly of power.\nAlthough the SED was nominally the product of a merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the eastern Social Democratic Party (SPD), it quickly became dominated by Communist leaders. From its foundation in 1946, Soviet occupation authorities and Communist cadres marginalised and purged dissenting Social Democrats, and by the time of the GDR\u2019s formal establishment in 1949, the SED had effectively become a continuation of the KPD under a new name, adhering to strict Marxist\u2013Leninist principles and following the model of Soviet-aligned parties.\nThough other parties continued to exist, they were compelled by Soviet authorities to participate in the National Front, a coalition effectively controlled by the SED. By ensuring Communist dominance on the National Front\u2019s candidate lists, the SED predetermined legislative representation in both the Soviet zone and the post\u20111949 GDR. Over the decades, it became known as one of the most ideologically rigid parties in the Eastern Bloc. When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced reforms such as \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" in the 1980s, the SED rejected them, reinforcing its image as a hardline communist force.\nOrganisation.\nBasic organisation.\nThe party organisation was based on, and co-located with, the institutions of the German Democratic Republic. Its influence stood behind and shaped every facet of public life. The party required every member to live by the mantra \"Where there is a comrade, the party is there too\" (\"Wo ein Genosse ist, da ist die Partei\"). This meant that the party organisation was at work in publicly owned industrial and quasi-commercial enterprises, machine and tractor stations, publicly owned farms and in the larger agricultural cooperatives, expressly mandated to monitor and regulate the operational management of each institution.\nThe smallest organisational unit in the party was the Party Group. Group members elected one of their number Party Group Organiser (PGO), to take responsibility for Party Work. There were also a Treasurer, an Agitator, and according to the size of the group other associated members included in the Party Group leadership. If there were several Party Groups operating in a single place they would be combined in a Departmental Party Organisation (APO / \"Abteilungsparteiorganisation\") which in turn would have its own leadership and an APO Party Secretariat.\nParty conference.\nThe Party conference was formally the party's leading institution.\nIncreasingly, party conferences were planned with military-level precision. Their choreography was carefully undertaken to ensure that they were understood as high-profile society events. They were very much more than mere political functions. Delegates were selected from the regional and sectional party organisations according to criteria determined by the Party Central Committee. Care was taken over the proportions of women, of youth representatives, of members from approved Mass organisations and of \"exemplary\" workers.\nParty Secretaries.\nParty secretaries existed at different levels within the party. They usually held their offices on an unsalaried basis, often combining their party secretarial duties with a salaried function. Where a basic administrative unit grew beyond certain size tension tended to arise between the party secretary and fellow committee members, and at this point a full-time salaried party secretary would be appointed. Party secretaries in very large industrial combines and other economically important institutions would combine their party secretarial roles with membership of a more powerful body, applying a structural element maintained right up to the level of the Party Central Committee. The task of the Party Secretaries was the organisation of political work. They prepared the party meetings and organised political training in partnership with the party leaderships. They ensured implementation of and compliance with party decisions and undertook general reporting and leadership duties. They were also required to provide a monthly report on \"Morale and Opinions\" (\"Stimmungen und Meinungen\") concerning the people covered by their party secretarial duties.\nWhere work on occasion attracted criticism, there were many ways on which changes could be passed on. This fact lay behind the burgeoning bureaucratization of the party apparatus and the presence of Stalinist tendencies. Party secretaries underwent a special monthly political process that included instructive guidance and verification by representatives from higher level party committees. Along with their party responsibilities, party secretaries were members of the state administration, and they secured the leadership role that the SED claimed for itself in businesses and offices. Managerial decisions were discussed and ultimately decided in party committees. This meant that a manager, provided he was a party member, was committed to implementing those decisions.\nSectional directorates.\nThe basic organisional unit in an organisation or department was placed under the control of the party's sectional leadership team (\"SED-Kreisleitung\"). There were in total 262 of these sectional leadership teams, including one each for the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Trade Union Federation (FDGB), the Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Trade Ministry, the State Railway organisation, the military branches of the Interior Ministry, the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), the National People's Army, each of which had its own integrated political-administrative structure.\nRegional directorates.\nThe party's regional structure started with the country's fifteen regions. Regional level government structure changed dramatically with the abolition of regional assemblies in 1952, but each administrative structure always had a party secretary, applying a structure also replicated in administrative structures at local levels.\nThe regional party leadership team (\"SED Bezirksleitung\"/ BL) was an elected body analogous to the Central Committee, membership of which was unpaid. It worked alongside the administrative body of paid officials who were occasionally also members of the party leadership team.\nAt a regional level the SED leadership team was headed by a Secretariat. The Secretariats always had a First Secretary (also responsible for Security Affairs) and a Second Secretary (also responsible for Cadre Affairs), and secretaries responsible for \"Agitation and propaganda\", Economy, Science, Culture and Agriculture. There were also regional teams to shadow the regional teams of national institutions such as the FDJ, the FDGB and the Planning Commission. The First Secretaries of the regional FDJ and chairmen of the regional FDGB and Planning Commission were always Secretariat members too.\nFirst Secretaries of regional party organisations held significant power in their respective regions, with some First Secretaries such as Hans-Joachim B\u00f6hme or Hans Albrecht being described as despotic, sometimes dictatorial. First Secretaries were always full members of the Central Committee and sometimes even candidate or full members (always the First Secretary in East Berlin) of the Politburo. First Secretaries of Bezirke that had a significant border with West Germany usually also served on the National Defence Council.\nCentral Committee.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen the Party Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the party's leading element. Power was centred on the Committee Secretariat, which was chaired by a General Secretary, named First Secretary from 1953 to 1976. This function was combined with chairmanship of the Politburo. The General Secretary until 1971 was Walter Ulbricht: he was deposed by Erich Honecker, who in turn was deposed by Egon Krenz. Unlike in the Soviet Union, the SED only had \"Second Secretaries\" on the local and regional levels, but not in the Central Committee. That being said, some Politburo members and secretaries held an unofficial number two spot, most notably Karl Schirdewan and then Honecker during the tenure of Walter Ulbricht and Paul Verner, then Egon Krenz during the tenure of Honecker.\nIn the political hierarchy of the GDR, members of the Central Committee ranked above government ministers.\nIn July 1950, at the third Party Conference, the SED's Central Committee was elected on the Soviet model, which at this time employed a single list electoral system: most members of the serving party executive were replaced. It was striking that more than 62% of the new Central Committee members had been members of the Communist Party (KPD) before the party merger of 1946. Four years on, there was little sign of the KPD/SPD parity that had been invoked when the SED was created.\nBy 1989, membership of the Central Committee had increased to 165: there were also 57 people listed as candidates for membership. All the high ranking party functionaries were represented in it along with other senior government officials (provided they were already party members). Beyond the professional functionaries and politicians the Committee also included the chiefs of the country's leading institutions and industrial combines, the president of the country's Writers' Association, top military officers and party veterans.\nThe Party Central Committee, reflecting the country's overall power structure, was overwhelmingly male: the proportion of women never rose above 15%.\nCentral Party Control Commission.\nThe Central Party Control Commission (ZPKK) was the supreme disciplinary body of the SED operating under and elected by the SED Central Committee. Its role was enforcing conformity and eliminating perceived opposition within the party ranks, closely working with the Stasi and Volkspolizei. It had corresponding bodies at all levels of the party in the form of Bezirk (BPKK) and district Party Control Commissions (KPKK). Notable ZPKK victims include Robert Havemann and Rudolf Herrnstadt.\nThere also existed a Central Auditing Commission (ZRK) to inspect the party finances analogous to the CPSU Central Auditing Commission, though due to its limited jurisdiction, its practical significance was minor compared to the ZPKK.\nPolitburo of the Central Committee.\nThe most important day-to-day work of the Central Committee was undertaken by the Politburo, a small circle of senior party officers, comprising between 15 and 25 full members, along with approximately 10 candidate (non-voting) members. The politburo members included approximately ten Central Committee Secretaries. The General Secretary of the Central Committee also held the Chairmanship of the Politburo (along with all his other functions). The country's government, formally headed by the Council of Ministers, served largely to implement the Politburo's decisions. This meant that while the Council of Ministers was nominally the highest executive authority in the GDR, in reality it was under the permanent control of the Party Committees, a structure that ensured the \"leading role\" of the SED. This status was spelled out expressly after the constitutional changes introduced in 1968, which defined East Germany as a \"socialist state\" led by \"the working class and its Marxist\u2013Leninist party.\" The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the president of the National legislature \"(\"Volkskammer\")\" were also members of the Politburo.\nThe meetings of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED usually took place every Tuesday in the conference room on the 2nd floor of the Central Committee building on Werderscher Markt, starting at 10 a.m. The meetings usually lasted only 2 hours and included up to 10 to 20 items on the agenda. According to former Politburo members Egon Krenz and G\u00fcnter Schabowski, most Politburo members had little to say, much less dissent.\nSecretariat of the Central Committee.\nThe Central Committee Secretariat met each Wednesday to implement decisions finalised by the Politburo the previous day and to prepare the agenda for the Central Committee's next weekly meeting. The Secretariat comprised the Central Committee Party Secretaries. The Secretariat played a decisive role in selecting the Nomenklatura of the Central Committee. Nomenklatura members were the holders of the top 300 or so positions in the party and the state: changes to the Nomenklatura membership list required the approval of the Central Committee Secretariat.\nThe Secretariat was the connecting element between the Politburo and the Central Committee Departments. These departments, whose heads were always full members of the Central Committee, formulated policy for the party and thus the country, with most departments mirroring ministries of the GDR (for example, there was a Ministry of Light Industry and a Ministry of District-led and foodstuffs industry). Department could de facto issue binding orders to the respective ministries, though de jure this was only possible for the secretaries. A notable exception was the Ministry of People's Education, which was not under supervision of the People's Education Department, but directly under the General Secretary, as Minister Margot Honecker was the General Secretary's wife. Secretaries were usually assigned to multiple departments, for example, throughout the GDR's existence, there was one Economy Secretary.\nThe party newspaper \"Neues Deutschland\" was organised as a department, its Editor-in-chief having department head rank. Similarly, the Party Academy and the Institute for Marxism\u2013Leninism were organised as departments, their directors having department head rank.\nParty Congresses.\nThe 1st Congress.\nThe 1st Party Congress \"(Vereinigungsparteitag)\", which convened on 21 April 1946, was the unification congress. This congress elected two co-chairmen to lead the party: Wilhelm Pieck, former leader of the eastern KPD, and Otto Grotewohl, former leader of the eastern SPD. The union was initially intended to apply to the whole of occupied Germany. The union was rejected consistently in the three western occupation zones, where both parties remained independent. The union of the two parties was thus effective only in the Soviet zone. The SED was modeled after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\nThe 2nd Congress.\nThe 2nd Party Congress convened from 20 to 24 July 1947. It adopted a fresh party statute and transformed the party executive committee into a central committee \"(Zentralkomitee\" or \"ZK\").\nThe 3rd Congress.\nThe 3rd Party Congress convened in July 1950 and emphasized industrial progress. The industrial sector, employing 40% of the working population, was subjected to further nationalization, which resulted in the formation of \"people's enterprises\" (German: \"Volkseigener Betrieb\", VEB). These enterprises incorporated 75% of the industrial sector. At the same time, the party completed its transformation into a more orthodox Soviet-style party with the election of Walter Ulbricht as the party's general secretary.\nThe 6th Congress.\nThe 6th Party Congress convened from 15 to 21 January 1963. The congress approved a new party program and a new party membership statute. Walter Ulbricht was re-elected as the party's First Secretary. A new economic policy was introduced, more strongly centralized \u2013 the \"New Economic System\".\nThe 7th Congress.\nFirst Secretary Walter Ulbricht announced the \"ten requirements of the socialist moral and ethics\". During his report at the 7th Party Congress in 1967, Erich Honecker had called for a return to an orthodox Socialist economic system, away from the recently instituted New Economic System. But the about-face in economic policy that year cannot be attributed to Honecker's advancement alone. During the previous two winters, the GDR had been plagued with power shortages and traffic breakdowns.\nThe 8th Congress.\nFrom 1971 onwards, congresses were held every five years. The last was the 11th Party Congress in April 1986. In theory, the party congresses set policy and elected the leadership, provided a forum for discussing the leadership's policies, and undertook activities that served to legitimize the party as a mass movement. They were formally empowered to pass both the party program and the statutes, to establish the general party line, to elect the members of the Central Committee and the members of the Central Auditing Commission, and to approve the Central Committee's report. Between congresses the Central Committee could convene a party conference to resolve policy and personnel issues.\nIn the spring of 1971, the 8th Congress rolled back some of the programs associated with the Ulbricht era and emphasized short-term social and economic problems. The SED used the occasion to announce its willingness to cooperate with West Germany and the Soviet Union in helping to solve a variety of international problems, particularly the future political status of Berlin. Another major development initiated at the congress was a strengthening of the Council of Ministers at the expense of the Council of State; this shift subsequently played an important role in administering the \"Main Task\" program. The SED further proclaimed that greater emphasis would be devoted to the development of a \"socialist national culture\" in which the role of artists and writers would be increasingly important. Honecker was more specific about the SED's position toward the intelligentsia at the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee, where he stated: \"As long as one proceeds from the firm position of socialism, there can in my opinion be no taboos in the field of art and literature. This applies to questions of content as well as of style, in short to those questions which constitute what one calls artistic mastery.\"\nThe 9th Congress.\nThe 9th Party Congress in May 1976 can be viewed as a midpoint in the development of SED policy and programs. Most of the social and economic goals announced at the 7th Congress had been reached; however, the absence of a definitive statement on further efforts to improve the working and living conditions of the population proved to be a source of concern. The SED sought to redress these issues by announcing, along with the Council of Ministers and the leadership of the FDGB, a specific program to raise living standards. The 9th Congress initiated a hard line in the cultural sphere, which contrasted with the policy of openness and tolerance enunciated at the previous congress. Six months after the 9th Congress, for example, the GDR government withdrew permission for the singer Wolf Biermann to live in East Germany. The congress also highlighted the fact that East Germany had achieved international recognition in the intervening years. East Germany's growing involvement in both the East European economic system and the global economy reflected its new international status. This international status and the country's improved diplomatic and political standing were the major areas stressed by this congress. The 9th Party Congress also served as a forum for examining the future challenges facing the party in domestic and foreign policy. On the foreign policy front, the major events were various speeches delivered by representatives of West European Marxist\u2013Leninist parties, particularly the Italian, Spanish, and French, all of which expressed in varying ways ideological differences with the Soviet Union. At the same time, although allowing different views to be heard, the SED rejected many of these criticisms in light of its effort to maintain the special relationship with the Soviet Union emphasized by Honecker. Another major point of emphasis at the congress was the issue of inter-German d\u00e9tente. On the East German side, the benefits were mixed. The GDR regime considered economic benefits as a major advantage, but the party viewed with misgivings the rapid increase in travel by West Germans to and through the GDR. Additional problems growing out of the expanding relationship with West Germany included conflict between Bonn and East Berlin on the rights and privileges of West German news correspondents in East Germany; the social unrest generated by the \"two-currency\" system, in which East German citizens who possessed West German D-marks were given the privilege of purchasing scarce luxury goods at special currency stores (Intershops); and the ongoing arguments over the issue of separate citizenship for the two German states, which the SED proclaimed but which the West German government refused to recognize as late as 1987.\nDuring the 9th Congress, the SED also responded to some of the public excitement and unrest that had emerged in the aftermath of the signing of the Helsinki Accords, the human rights documents issued at the meetings in 1975 of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Before the congress was convened, the SED had conducted a \"People's Discussion\" in order openly to air public concerns related to East Germany's responsibility in honoring the final document of the Helsinki conference.\nThe 10th Congress.\nThe 10th Congress, which took place in April 1981, celebrated the status quo; the meeting unanimously re-elected Honecker to the office of general secretary, and there were no electoral surprises, as all incumbents except the ailing 76-year-old Albert Norden were returned to the \"Politb\u00fcro\" and the Secretariat. The congress highlighted the importance of policies that had been introduced or stressed at the two previous congresses and that had dominated East German life during the 1970s. As in the past, Honecker stressed the importance of the ties to the Soviet Union. In his closing remarks, he stated: \"Our party, the SED, is linked forever with the party of Lenin, [the CPSU].\" A delegation led by chief party ideologue Mikhail Suslov, a member of the CPSU \"Politburo\", represented the CPSU at the SED congress. Honecker reiterated earlier positions on the relationship between the two German states, stressing that they were two sovereign states that had developed along different lines since World War II, and that their differences had to be respected by both sides as they continued efforts toward peaceful coexistence despite membership in antagonistic alliances. In his speeches, Honecker, along with other SED officials, devoted greater attention to Third World countries than he had done in the past. Honecker mentioned the continually increasing numbers of young people from African, Asian, and Latin American countries who received their higher education in East Germany, and he referred to many thousands of people in those countries who had been trained as apprentices, skilled workers, and instructors by teams from East Germany.\nThe bulk of the Central Committee report delivered at the opening session of the congress by the general secretary discussed the economic and social progress made during the five years since the 9th Congress. Honecker detailed the increased agricultural and industrial production of the period and the resultant social progress as, in his words, the country continued \"on the path to socialism and communism.\" Honecker called for even greater productivity in the next five years, and he sought to spur individual initiative and productivity by recommending a labor policy that would reward the most meritorious and productive members of society.\nThe 11th Congress.\nThe 11th Congress, held 17\u201321 April 1986, unequivocally endorsed the SED and Honecker, whom it confirmed for another term as party head. The SED celebrated its achievements as the \"most successful party on German soil\", praised East Germany as a \"politically stable and economically efficient socialist state\", and declared its intention to maintain its present policy course. East Germany's successes, presented as a personal triumph for Honecker, marked a crowning point in his political career. Mikhail Gorbachev's presence at the congress endorsed Honecker's policy course, which was also strengthened by some reshuffling of the party leadership. Overall, the 11th Congress exhibited confidence in East Germany's role as the strongest economy and the most stable country in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev praised the East German experience as proof that central planning could be effective and workable in the 1980s.\nOfficial statements on the subject of foreign policy were mixed, particularly with respect to East Germany's relations with West Germany and the rest of Western Europe. Honecker's defense of his policy of \"constructive dialogue\" appeared in tune with Gorbachev's own calls for disarmament and d\u00e9tente in Europe. However, the SED leadership made it unequivocally clear that its foreign policy, including relations with West Germany, would remain closely coordinated with Moscow's. Although Honecker's criticism of West Germany was low key, Gorbachev's was sharp, attacking Bonn's participation in the United States Strategic Defense Initiative and the alleged \"revanchism\" in West Germany. However, after a final round of talks with Gorbachev, Honecker signed a hard-line communiqu\u00e9 that openly attacked the policies of the West German government. Overall, Gorbachev's statements suggested that the foreign policy emphasis would be on a common foreign policy adhered to by all members of the Warsaw Pact under Soviet direction. Until the 11th Party Congress, East German leaders had maintained that small and medium states had a significant role to play in international affairs. As a result of Soviet pressure, such statements disappeared from East German commentary on foreign policy.\nFinal days: collapse of the SED.\nOn the day of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, 7 October 1989, the old Social Democratic Party was illegally refounded. The rest of October saw widespread protests across the country, including in East Berlin and Leipzig. At a special \"Politb\u00fcro\" meeting on 18 October, Honecker was voted out as general secretary and replaced by Egon Krenz, the party's number-two leader. Krenz tried to portray himself as a reformer, but few believed him. He was almost as detested as Honecker himself, and most of the populace remembered that only four months earlier, he had gone to China to thank the regime there for the suppression in Tiananmen Square. Krenz made some attempts to adjust state policy. However, he could not (or would not) satisfy the growing demands of the people for increased freedom.\nOne of the regime's efforts to stem the tide ended up being its death knell. On 9 November the SED \"Politb\u00fcro\" drafted new travel regulations allowing anyone who wanted to visit West Germany to do so by crossing East Germany's borders with official permission. However, no one told the party's unofficial spokesman, East Berlin party boss G\u00fcnter Schabowski, that the regulations were to take effect the next afternoon. When a reporter asked him when the regulations were to be in place, Schabowski assumed they were already in effect and replied, \"As far as I know\u2014effective immediately, without delay.\" This was widely interpreted as a decision to open the Berlin Wall. Thousands of East Berliners crowded at the Wall, demanding to be let through. Unprepared and unwilling to use force, the guards were quickly overwhelmed and let them through the gates to West Berlin.\nThe fall of the Wall destroyed the SED politically. On 1 December 1989, the GDR parliament \"(Volkskammer)\" rescinded the clause in the GDR Constitution which defined the country as a socialist state under the leadership of the SED, thus formally ending Communist rule in East Germany. On 3 December 1989, the entire Central Committee and \"Politb\u00fcro\"\u2014including Krenz\u2014resigned.\nRebirth as the PDS.\nSome younger members of the SED had been receptive to Gorbachev's reforms, but had more or less been silenced until the events of 1989. Soon after the SED abandoned power, Gregor Gysi, a reformist, was elected to the new post of party chairman. In his first speech, Gysi admitted that the SED was responsible for the country's economic problems\u2014thus repudiating everything the party had done since 1949. He also declared that the party needed to adopt a new form of socialism. As December wore on, most of the party's hardliners\u2014including Honecker, Krenz and others\u2014were pushed out as the party made a desperate attempt to change its image. By the time of a special 16 December congress, the SED was no longer a Marxist\u2013Leninist party. To distance itself from its repressive past, the party added \"Party of Democratic Socialism\" (PDS) to its name. On 4 February 1990, what remained of the party was renamed solely as the PDS. On 18 March 1990, the PDS was roundly defeated in the first\u2014and as it turned out, only\u2014free election in the GDR; the Alliance for Germany coalition, led by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), won on a platform of speedy reunification with the West.\nThe SED had sequestered money overseas in secret accounts, including some which turned up in Liechtenstein in 2008. This was returned to the German government, as the PDS had rejected claims to overseas SED assets in 1990. The vast majority of domestic SED assets were transferred to the GDR government before unification. Legal issues over back taxes possibly owed by the PDS on former SED assets were eventually settled in 1995, when an agreement between the PDS and the Independent Commission on Property of Political Parties and Mass Organizations of the GDR was confirmed by the Berlin Administrative Court.\nThe PDS survived the reunification of Germany. It was represented in the Bundestag without interruption until 2007, and eventually began growing again. It has remained influential in former eastern Germany, especially at the state and local levels. It has been important in addressing East-German issues and addressing social problems. In 2007 the PDS merged with the western-based Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative (WASG) to create the new party The Left (\"Die Linke\"), which has resulted in a higher acceptance in western states, the party now also being represented in the parliaments of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Hesse and Hamburg.\nAttempts to influence West German politics.\nThe SED had two West German affiliates, which it controlled via the Central Committee's Department for International Politics and Economics (mostly named \"West Department\" until May 1984): the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and, after its 1957 ban, the German Communist Party (DKP) as well as the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin (SEW). The SED funded its West German affiliates to the tune of millions every year through the Central Committee's Trafficking Department, the SEW received about 15 million DM yearly, the DKP 70 million DM.\nThe SED initially had a branch in West Berlin, but after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, that branch became a separate party. The party changed its name to Socialist Initiative (\"Sozialistische Initiative\") in April 1990, then dissolved in June 1991, part of its members subsequently joining the Party of Democratic Socialism.\nElectoral history.\nGDR Volkskammer elections.\nThere were effective constitutional structures in place to ensure that the ruling SED was able to control the Volkskammer because of the extent to which it controlled other parties and mass organisations which also received predetermined fixed quotas of Volkskammer seats.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known as the host of various editions of the American television game show \"Match Game\" for over two decades.\nEarly life.\nRayburn was born in Christopher, Illinois, the younger of two children of Croatian immigrants Mary A. Hikec (August 14, 1897 \u2013 April 29, 1985) and Peter Pero Jeljeni\u0107 (January 17, 1887 \u2013 December 26, 1918). In an episode of \"Match Game \u201874\", Rayburn spoke Serbo-Croatian with a contestant and mentioned that his parents were born in what was then Yugoslavia. His father died when Rayburn was an infant. Mary moved her family to Chicago; it was there she met Milan Rubessa. She married Rubessa on November 10, 1919, and gave her son the name Eugene Rubessa (). He had an elder brother, Alfred, who was killed when Rayburn was a child and a younger half-brother, Milan Rubessa Jr.\nRayburn graduated from Lindblom Technical High School and attended Knox College. He was senior class president at Lindblom and acted in the plays \"Robert of Sicily\" and \"Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch\".\nAn aspiring actor and opera singer, Rayburn moved to New York City but was unable to find stage work. He found a job as a page and tour guide at NBC studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza instead. After three years in that position, Rayburn began announcing at various radio stations, eventually landing back in New York at WNEW. He enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served in World War II. Gene chose the stage name \"Rayburn\" by randomly sticking his finger in the phone book.\nCareer.\nRadio career.\nBefore appearing in television, Rayburn was an actor and radio performer. He had a morning drive time radio show in New York City, first with Jack Lescoulie (\"Anything Goes\") and later with Dee Finch (\"Rayburn &amp; Finch\") on WNEW. Rayburn's pairings with Lescoulie and Finch helped to popularize the now-familiar morning drive radio format. At WNEW, he lobbied for playing of certain songs, resulting in chart popularity (e.g. \"Music! Music! Music!\" (recorded by Teresa Brewer)) and co-authored the lyrics of the song \"Hop-Scotch Polka\" with Carl Sigman (both 1949). When Rayburn left WNEW, Dee Finch continued the format with Gene Klavan.\nStage career.\nRayburn took the lead role in the Broadway musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\" when Dick Van Dyke left the production to star in \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\". At one point in his stage career, Rayburn's stand-in was future \"Match Game\" panelist Charles Nelson Reilly.\nTelevision career.\nBreaking into television as the original announcer on Steve Allen's \"Tonight\", Rayburn began a long association with game show producers Mark Goodson and Bill Todman in 1953. He first appeared on Robert Q. Lewis's \"The Name's the Same\"; Rayburn frequently sat in for regular panelist Carl Reiner. In 1955, he took over as host of the summer replacement game show \"Make the Connection\" from original host Jim McKay (and appearing with his WNEW morning show successor Gene Klavan). From there he hosted shows such as \"Choose Up Sides\", \"Dough Re Mi\", \"Play Your Hunch\", and the daytime version of \"Tic Tac Dough\". On radio, Rayburn became one of the many hosts of the NBC program \"Monitor\" in 1961 and remained with the show until 1973.\nIn an uncredited role (he reportedly did not want his name to appear), Rayburn played a TV interviewer in the movie \"It Happened to Jane\" (1959) starring Doris Day. Rayburn was also a frequent panelist in the 1960s and 1970s on \"What's My Line?\" and \"To Tell the Truth\".\n\"Match Game\".\nFrom 1962 to 1969, Rayburn hosted \"The Match Game\". In the original version, which aired from New York on NBC, Rayburn read questions to two panels, each consisting of a celebrity and two audience members. The questions in the original game were ordinary, like \"Name a kind of muffin,\" or \"John loves his ____________.\" Rayburn usually played it straight, though he would make jokes as the situation warranted. Very few episodes have been preserved; only four are known to exist. The show was canceled in 1969 to make room for the topical, short-lived game show \"Letters to Laugh-In\".\nGoodson-Todman revived \"Match Game\" in 1973 for CBS, this time as a California-based game show. Rayburn returned as host and introduced a new format in which two contestants tried to match the responses of six celebrities. Writer Dick DeBartolo, a veteran of the original show, created funnier and often risqu\u00e9 questions (\"The big bad wolf said: I just came from a house where this old lady had the biggest ____________s I ever saw.\")(\"After it was run over by a steamroller, Norman was able to slide his ____________ under the door.\") Rayburn reveled in this freewheeling new approach and often indulged in funny voices, banter with the celebrities, and mock arguments with the technical crew. It soon became the highest-rated show on daytime television.\nFrom 1973 to 1977, \"Match Game\" was number one among all daytime network game shows\u2014three of those years it was the highest rated of all daytime shows. The daytime revival of \"Match Game\", which featured regular panelists Richard Dawson, Brett Somers, and Charles Nelson Reilly, ran until 1979 on CBS and another three years in first-run syndication. A concurrent nighttime version, \"Match Game PM\", aired in syndication from 1975 to 1981. Rayburn was nominated three times for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host.\nDuring the years when \"Match Game\" was taped in Los Angeles (1973\u20131982), Rayburn lived in Osterville, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. He commuted to California every two weeks to tape 12 shows over the course of a weekend (five daytime shows and one nighttime show per taping day).\nIn 1983, a year after the syndicated \"Match Game\" ended, the show was revived as part of the \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\". Rayburn hosted the \"Match Game\" and \"Super Match\" segments and sat on the panel for the \"Hollywood Squares\" segment, which was hosted by Jon Bauman. This show lasted nine months on NBC. Rayburn, by most accounts, was disappointed with how the show turned out.\nOther game shows and television appearances.\nDuring and between his \"Match Game\" years, Rayburn served as guest panelist on two other Goodson-Todman shows: \"What's My Line?\" and \"To Tell the Truth\". Also during the run of the 1970s \"Match Game\", Rayburn and his wife Helen appeared on the game show \"Tattletales\", hosted by Bert Convy. Rayburn also hosted some episodes of \"Tattletales\". Three years after the original \"Match Game\" was canceled, Rayburn hosted the short-lived Heatter-Quigley Productions show \"The Amateur's Guide to Love\". In 1983, he hosted a pilot for Reg Grundy Productions titled \"Party Line\", which later became \"Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak\".\nIn 1980, Rayburn was a guest star on the television show \"The Love Boat\". Rayburn appeared as a contestant during a tournament of game show hosts on the original version of \"Card Sharks\" in 1980 and was a celebrity guest on \"Password Plus\" several times between 1980 and 1982. He appeared on \"Fantasy Island\" as a game show host\u2014he and another host, played by Jan Murray, were game show rivals who vied to win the woman they both loved by creating the ultimate game show, with life-or-death consequences. He once hosted a local New York City show on WNEW-TV, \"Helluva Town\", and between game show stints in 1982\u20131983, he returned to WNEW-TV as host of a weekly talk and lifestyles show titled \"Saturday Morning Live\". He ended his brief tenure to return as co-host of \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\".\nRayburn's last game show hosting duties were on 1985's \"Break the Bank\" (he was replaced by Joe Farago after 13 weeks), and \"The Movie Masters\", an AMC game show that ran from 1989 to 1990. Just before production was to begin on a new Rayburn-emceed \"Match Game\" revival in 1987, an \"Entertainment Tonight\" reporter publicly disclosed that Rayburn was 69 years old, much older than many believed. Rayburn had trouble finding jobs after that, blaming the reporter for revealing his age and subjecting him to age discrimination. His daughter Lynne blamed this and the subsequent lack of work he received for sending him into a downward spiral.\nRayburn portrayed himself on a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch in 1990, which featured Susan Lucci (as her character from \"All My Children\", Erica Kane). He returned as one of Kane's many previous husbands, to stop another marriage (officiated by his old \"Choose Up Sides\" co-star Don Pardo) with the host of a game show portrayed by Phil Hartman. He also continued to make appearances on talk shows throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, usually to discuss classic game shows, including appearances on \"Vicki!\" and \"The Maury Povich Show\" and \"The Late Show with Ross Shafer\" (Shafer hosted the 1990 \"Match Game\" revival). In 1992, Rayburn also made an appearance on New York shock jock Howard Stern's late-night TV variety show as one of the stars of his \"Hollywood Squares\" parody, \"Homeless Howiewood Squares\", in which homeless people were supposedly the contestants.\nRayburn co-hosted\u2014with his wife and Peter Emmons\u2014the Drum Corps International finals of the DCI Championship for two years, which were telecast on PBS from Philadelphia's Franklin Field in 1976 and Denver's original Mile High Stadium in 1977.\nPersonal life and death.\nRayburn was married to Helen Ticknor from 1940 until her death in October 1996. They had one child, daughter Lynne.\nOne of Rayburn's last TV appearances was a 1998 interview with \"Access Hollywood\" that was intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of \"Match Game '73\". Portions of the interview have been rebroadcast on Game Show Network which, in 2001, showed portions of another previously unaired interview during the first airing of its \"Match Game Blankathon\".\nRayburn identified as a liberal politically and was a supporter of Planned Parenthood. Rayburn was also concerned that human overpopulation would become a problem in the 21st century and that it would become more difficult to supply resources, such as food, if the population grew too large. He expressed these concerns when he appeared on Game Show Hosts week on \"Card Sharks\" in 1980, where he played for Planned Parenthood as his favorite charity.\nRayburn enjoyed needlepoint and did it regularly on his many flights to and from California. He took it up when he knitted socks as a gag on \"Rayburn and Finch.\" Mark Goodson presented him with a needlepoint kit on the air as a gift when \"Match Game\" became the number one show on daytime television.\nThough in poor health and suffering from dementia, Rayburn appeared in person to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. A month later, on November 29, 1999, he died of heart failure at his daughter's home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, at age 81. He was cremated and his ashes spread in the garden of his daughter's home.\nRayburn's final TV appearance was in an interview for the \"A&amp;E Biography\" episode profiling the life of his longtime boss Mark Goodson. Though taped in late 1999, the episode did not air until June 4, 2000, over six months after Rayburn had died.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the species has also been domesticated and introduced (see aquaculture) into environments worldwide, and is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. It gives its name to the carp family, Cyprinidae.\nTaxonomy.\nThe type subspecies is \"Cyprinus carpio carpio\", native to much of Europe (notably the Danube and Volga Rivers).\nThe subspecies \"Cyprinus carpio haematopterus\" (Amur carp), native to eastern Asia, was recognized in the past, but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name \"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\". The common carp and various Asian relatives in their pure forms can be separated by meristics and also differ in genetics, but they are able to interbreed. Common carp can also interbreed with the goldfish (\"Carassius auratus\"); the result is called Kollar carp. Another artificial hybrid is ghost carp, which is bred between common carp and Japanese Purachina koi. The large variations of colours produced make ghost carp a popular commercial species.\nHistory.\nThe common carp is native to Europe and Asia, and has been introduced to every part of the world except the poles. They are the third-most frequently introduced fish species worldwide, and their history as a farmed fish dates back to Roman times. Carp are used as food in many areas, but are also regarded as a pest in several regions due to their ability to out-compete native fish stocks. The original common carp was found in the inland delta of the Danube River about 2000 years ago and was torpedo-shaped and golden-yellow in colour. It had two pairs of barbels and a mesh-like scale pattern. Although this fish was initially kept as an exploited captive, it was later maintained in large, specially built ponds by the Romans in south-central Europe (verified by the discovery of common carp remains in excavated settlements in the Danube Delta area). As aquaculture became a profitable branch of agriculture, efforts were made to farm the animals, and the culture systems soon included spawning and growing ponds. The common carp's native range also extends to the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Aral Sea.\nBoth European and Asian subspecies have been domesticated. In Europe, domestication of carp as food fish was spread by monks between the 13th and 16th centuries. The wild forms of carp had already reached the delta of the Rhine in the 12th century, probably with some human help. Variants that have arisen with domestication include the mirror carp, with large, mirror-like scales (linear mirror \u2013 scaleless except for a row of large scales that run along the lateral line; originating in Germany), the leather carp (virtually unscaled except near dorsal fin), and the fully scaled carp. Koi carp (\u9326\u9bc9 (\"nishikigoi\") in Japanese, \u9bc9\u9b5a (pinyin: \"l\u012d y\u00fa\") in Chinese) is a domesticated ornamental variety that originated in the Niigata region of Japan in the 1820s, but its parent species is likely the East Asian carp, possibly \"C. rubrofuscus\".\nPhysiology and life history.\nThe carp has a robust build, with a dark gold sheen that is most prominent on its head. Its body is adorned with large, conspicuous scales that are very shiny. It has large pectoral fins and a tapering dorsal fin running down the last two-thirds of its body, getting progressively higher as it nears the carp's head. Its caudal and anal fins may either be a dark bronze or washed with a rubbery orange hue. Two or three spines are on the anal fin, the first being serrated, and the dorsal fin has three or four anterior spines, the first of which is also serrated. The mouth of the carp is downward-turned, with two pairs of barbels, one pair at the corners of the upper lip, and the other on the lower. Wild common carp are typically slimmer than domesticated forms, with body length about four times body height, red flesh, and a forward-protruding mouth. Common carp can grow to very large sizes if given adequate space and nutrients. Their average growth rate by weight is about half the growth rate of domesticated carp. They do not reach the lengths and weights of domesticated carp, which (range, 3.2\u20134.8 times) can grow to a maximum length of , a maximum weight of over . The longest-lived common carp documented was of wild-origin (in non-native habitat of North America), and was 64 years of age. The largest recorded carp, caught by British angler, Colin Smith, in 2013 at Etang La Saussaie Fishery, France, weighed . The average size of the common carp is around and .\nHabitat.\nAlthough tolerant of most conditions, common carp prefer large bodies of slow or standing water and soft, vegetative sediments. As schooling fish, they prefer to be in groups of five or more. They naturally live in temperate climates in fresh or slightly brackish water with a pH of 6.5\u20139.0 and salinity up to about 0.5%, and temperatures of . The ideal temperature is , with spawning beginning at ; they easily survive winter in a frozen-over pond, as long as some free water remains below the ice. Carp are able to tolerate water with very low oxygen levels, by gulping air at the surface.\nDiet.\nCommon carp are omnivorous. They can eat a herbivorous diet of aquatic plants, plant tubers, and seeds, but prefer to scavenge the bottom for insects, crustaceans (including zooplankton and crawfish), molluscs, benthic worms, fish eggs, and fish remains. Common carp feed throughout the day, with the most intensive feeding at night and around sunrise.\nFeeding mechanisms.\nCommon carp are benthic feeders and root in sediment for food items. Their barbels may help to feel for food embedded in the sediment, like plant tubers or annelids. Carp pick up sediment by generating suction and mouth the content to identify and select food items by taste and size. Gill rakers form a branchial sieve that may aid in food separation, but the carp is also able to clamp down on food items it detects using a muscular palatal pad and inferior postlingual organ. The sediment is passed back and forth between the mouth and pharynx repeatedly as food is found. The carp may end up spitting out sediment, which contributes to water turbidity.\nWhile common carp have no oral teeth, 10 pharyngeal teeth are used for crushing or grinding food. The carp has no stomach, and the intestinal length can vary based partially on dietary composition in early life.\nReproduction.\nAn egg-layer, a typical adult female can lay 300,000 eggs in a single spawn. Although carp typically spawn in the spring, in response to rising water temperatures and rainfall, carp can spawn multiple times in a season. In commercial operations, spawning is often stimulated using a process called hypophysation, where lyophilized pituitary extract is injected into the fish. The pituitary extract contains gonadotropic hormones, which stimulate gonad maturation and sex steroid production, ultimately promoting reproduction.\nPredation.\nA single carp can lay over a million eggs in a year. Eggs and fry often fall victim to bacteria, fungi, and the vast array of tiny predators in the pond environment. Carp that survive to the juvenile stage are preyed upon by other fish such as the northern pike and largemouth bass, and several birds (including cormorants, herons, goosanders, and ospreys) and mammals (including otter and mink).\nSalinity.\nCommon carp are quite salt tolerant compared to other types of freshwater fish, research studies showed that they can withstand salinity of at least 12 g/L (12 ppt).\nMirror carp.\nMirror carp, regionally known as Israeli carp, are a type of domesticated fish commonly found in Europe but widely introduced or cultivated elsewhere. They are a variety of the common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\") developed through selective breeding. The name \"mirror carp\" originates from their scales' resemblance to mirrors.\nGenetics.\nThe most striking difference between mirror and common carp is the presence of large, mirror-like scales on the former. The mirror-scale phenotype is caused by a genetic mutation present at one of two scale trait loci, denoted by their S and N alleles, respectively. The genotype that produces a mirror scale phenotype is \"ssnn\" (all recessive), while wild-type carp may have either SSnn or Ssnn genotype. The \"S\" locus has been identified as containing the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor Fgfr1A1, which was duplicated during the course of carp evolution and consequently does not typically produce lethal phenotypes when only one locus is mutated. The \"N\" locus has not been identified, but is hypothesized to have bearing on the development of embryonic mesenchyme.\nContrary to popular belief, a leather carp is not always a mirror carp without scales. Similar to mirror carp, leather, or \"nude\" carp, are homozygous recessive at the \"S\" locus, but unlike mirror carp, true leather carp are heterozygous for a dominant mutant allele at the \"N\" locus (ssNn genotype). Leather carp also have reduced numbers of red blood cells and slower growth rates than scaled carp. Mirror carp from Hungarian and Asian stocks have been observed to have fewer pharyngeal teeth than scaled carp, while nude carp had fewer still.\nA population of mirror carp in Madagascar (there an invasive species) was found to have reverted to full scale cover after being introduced from France in the early twentieth century. The feral Malagasy carp still possessed large scales due to their mirror phenotype, but had increased scale coverage approaching that of wild-type carp. Hubert et al. (2016) found that the recessive allele at the \"S\" locus was still fixed in the population. They believe that the phenotypic reversion was due to compensation by quantitative trait loci as a result of a selective disadvantage for partial scaling in the wild, perhaps related to an impairment in parasite resistance.\nIntroduction into other habitats.\nCommon carp have been introduced to most continents and some 59 countries. In absence of natural predators or commercial fishing, they may extensively alter their environments due to their reproductive rate and their feeding habit of grubbing through bottom sediments for food. In feeding, they may destroy, uproot, disturb and eat submerged vegetation, causing serious damage to food sources and habitats of native duck (such as canvasbacks) and fish populations.\nIn 2020, scientists demonstrated that a small proportion of fertilized common carp eggs ingested by waterfowl survive passing through the digestive tract and hatch after being retrieved from the feces. Birds exhibit strong preference for fish eggs, while cyprinids produce hundreds of thousands of eggs at a single spawning event. These data indicate that despite the low proportion of eggs surviving the digestive tract of birds, endozoochory might provide a potentially overlooked dispersal mechanism of invasive cyprinid fish. If proven under natural circumstances, endozoochorous dispersal of invasive fish could be a strong conservation concern for freshwater biodiversity.\nAustralia.\nCarp were introduced to Australia over 150 years ago but were not seen as a recognised pest species until the \"Boolarra\" strain appeared in the 1960s. After spreading massively through the Murray\u2013Darling basin, aided by massive flooding in 1974, they have established themselves in every Australian territory except for the Northern Territory. In Victoria, the common carp has been declared a noxious fish species, and the quantity a fisherman can take is unlimited. In South Australia, it is an offence for this species to be released back to the wild. An Australian company produces plant fertilizer from carp.\nEfforts to eradicate a small colony from Lake Crescent in Tasmania, without using chemicals, have been successful, but the long-term, expensive and intensive undertaking is an example of both the possibility and difficulty of safely removing the species once it is established. One proposal, regarded as environmentally questionable, is to control common carp numbers by deliberately exposing them to the carp-specific koi herpes virus with its high mortality rate. In 2016, the Australian Government announced plans to release this virus into the Murray\u2013Darling basin in an attempt to reduce the number of invasive common carp in the water system. However, in 2020, this plan was found to be unlikely to work. The CSIRO has also developed a technique for genetically modifying carp so that they only produce male offspring. This daughterless carp method shows promise for totally eradicating carp from Australia's waterways.\nNorth America.\nCommon carp were brought to the United States in 1831. In the late 19th century, they were distributed widely throughout the country by the government as a food fish, but they are now rarely eaten in the United States, where they are generally considered pests. As in Australia, their introduction has been shown to have negative environmental consequences.\nIn Utah, the common carp's population in Utah Lake is expected to be reduced by 75 percent by using nets to catch millions of them, and either giving them to people who will eat them or processing them into fertilizer. This, in turn, will give the declining population of the native June sucker a chance to recover. Another method of control is to trap them with seine nets in tributaries they use to spawn, and exposing them to the piscicide rotenone. This method has been shown to reduce their impact within 24 hours and greatly increase native vegetation and desirable fish species. It also allows native fish to prey more easily on young carp.\nCommon carp are thought to have been introduced into the Canadian province of British Columbia from the neighboring Washington state. They were first noted in the Okanagan Valley in 1912, as was their rapid growth in population. Carp are currently distributed in the lower Columbia (Arrow Lakes), lower Kootenay, Kettle (Christina Lake), and throughout the Okanagan system.\nCommon carp aquaculture.\nCommon carp contributed around 4.67 million tons on a global scale during 2015\u20132016, roughly accounting for 7.4% of the total global inland fisheries production. In Europe, common carp contributed 1.8% (0.17 Mt) of the total inland fisheries production (9.42 Mt) during 2015\u20132016. It is a major farmed species in European freshwater aquaculture with production localized in central and eastern European countries. The Russian Federation (0.06 Mt) followed by Poland (0.02 Mt), Czech Republic (0.02 Mt), Hungary (0.01 Mt) and Ukraine (0.01 Mt) represents about 70% of carp production in Europe during 2016. In fact, the land\u2010locked central European countries rely heavily on common carp aquaculture in fishponds. The average productivity of carp culture systems in central European countries ranges between 0.3 and 1 ton ha\u22121. The European common carp production, in terms of volume, reached its peak (0.18 Mt) during 2009\u20132010 and has been declining since. Carp farming is often criticized as an anthropogenic driver of eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies - especially in the Central Eastern European Region (CEER). There has been some debate between environmentalists and carp farmers concerning eutrophication of water bodies, manifested into lobbying at ministry levels surrounding fishpond legislations. European carp aquaculture in fish ponds most likely has a lower nutrient burden to the environment than most food production sectors in the European Union.\nAs food and sport.\nBreeding and fishing.\nThe Romans farmed carp and this pond culture continued through the monasteries of Europe and to this day. In China, Korea, and Japan, carp farming took place as early as the Yayoi period (c. 300 BC \u2013 AD 300).\nThe annual tonnage of common carp produced in China alone, not to mention the other cyprinids, exceeds the weight of all other fish, such as trout and salmon, produced by aquaculture worldwide. Roughly three million tonnes are produced annually, accounting for 14% of all farmed freshwater fish in 2002. China is by far the largest commercial producer, accounting for about 70% of carp production. Carp is eaten in many parts of the world both when caught from the wild and raised in aquaculture.\nCommon carp are extremely popular with anglers in many parts of Europe, and their popularity as quarry is slowly increasing among anglers in the United States (though they are still generally considered pests and destroyed in most areas of the U.S.), and southern Canada. Carp are also popular with spear, bow, and fly fishermen.\nFood culture.\nIn Central Europe, it is a traditional part of a Christmas Eve dinner. Hungarian fisherman's soup, a specially prepared fish soup of carp alone or mixed with other freshwater fish, is part of the traditional meal for Christmas Eve in Hungary along with stuffed cabbage and poppy seed roll and walnut roll. A traditional Czech Christmas Eve dinner is a thick soup of carp's head and offal, fried carp meat (sometimes the meat is skinned and baked instead) with potato salad or boiled carp in black sauce. A Slovak Christmas Eve dinner is quite similar, with soup varying according to the region and fried carp as the main dish. Also in Austria, parts of Germany, and Poland, a fried carp is one of the traditional dishes on Christmas Eve. Carp are mixed with other common fish to make gefilte fish, popular in Jewish cuisine. \nIn Western Europe, the carp is cultivated more commonly as a sport fish, although there is a small market for it as a food fish. \nIn the United States, carp is mostly ignored as a food fish. Almost all U.S. shoppers bypass carp, due to a preference for filleted fish as opposed to cooking whole. Carp have smaller intramuscular bones called y-bones, which makes them a whole fish species for cooking.\nWhen Eurasian Carp was introduced to Lake Toba in Sumatra, it was adapted to be used for the traditional dish Arsik.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The game features contestants trying to match answers given by celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank questions. Beginning with the CBS run of the 1970s, the questions are often formed as humorous double entendres.\n\"The Match Game\" in its original version ran on NBC's daytime lineup from 1962 until 1969. The show returned with a significantly changed format in 1973 on CBS (also in daytime) and became a major success, with an expanded panel, larger cash payouts, and emphasis on humor. The CBS series, referred to on-air as \"Match Game 73\" to start\u00a0\u2013 with its title updated every new year, ran until 1979 on CBS, at which point it moved to first-run syndication (without the year attached to the title, as \"Match Game\") and ran for three more seasons, ending in 1982. Concurrently with the weekday run, from 1975 to 1981, a once-a-week fringe time version, \"Match Game PM\", was also offered in syndication for airing just before prime time hours.\nThe 1973 format would be used, with varying modifications, for all future revivals. \"Match Game\" returned to NBC in 1983 as part of \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\", then had a daytime run on ABC in 1990 and another for syndication in 1998; each of these series lasted one season. It returned to ABC in a weekly prime time edition on June 26, 2016, running as an off-season replacement series. Production ended in 2019 (with some episodes held to 2020 and 2021), but ABC again revived the show in 2025.\nAll versions of the series were hosted by Gene Rayburn from 1963 until 1984. The 2025 version is presented by Martin Short.\nThe series was a production of Mark Goodson/Bill Todman Productions, along with its successor companies, and has been franchised around the world, notably as \"Blankety Blank\" in the UK and \"Blankety Blanks\" in Australia.\nIn 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked the 1973\u201379 CBS version of \"Match Game\" as No. 4 on its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever. It was twice nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show, in 1976 and 1977.\n1962\u201369, NBC.\n\"The Match Game\" premiered on December 31, 1962. Gene Rayburn was the host, and Johnny Olson served as announcer, for the series premiere, Arlene Francis and Skitch Henderson were the two celebrity panelists. The show was taped in Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, NBC's largest New York studio, which since 1975 has housed \"Saturday Night Live\", among other shows. The show originally aired in black and white and moved to color on June 24, 1963.\nBoth teams were given a question and each player privately wrote down their response, raising their hand when done. Then each player was asked individually to reveal their response. A team scored 25 points if two teammates matched answers or 50 points if all three contestants matched. The first team to score 100 points won $100 and played the audience match, which featured three survey questions (some of which, especially after 1963, featured a numeric-answer format, e.g., \"we surveyed 50 women and asked them how much they should spend on a hat,\" a format similar to the one that was later used on \"Family Feud\" and \"Card Sharks\"). Each contestant who agreed with the most popular answer to a question earned the team $50, for a possible total of $450.\nThe questions used in the game were pedestrian in nature to begin: \"Name a kind of muffin,\" \"Write down one of the words to 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat' other than 'Row,' 'Your,' or 'Boat,'\" or \"John loves his _____.\" The humor in the original series came largely from the panelists' reactions to the other answers (especially on the occasional all-star episodes). In 1963, NBC canceled the series with six weeks left to be recorded. Question writer Dick DeBartolo came up with a funnier set of questions, like \"Mary likes to pour gravy all over John's _____,\" and submitted it to Mark Goodson. With the knowledge that the show could not be canceled again, Goodson gave the go-ahead for the more risqu\u00e9-sounding questions, a decision that caused a significant boost in ratings and an \"un-cancellation\" by NBC.\n\"The Match Game\" consistently won its time slot from 1963 to 1966 and again from April 1967 to July 1968, with its ratings allowing it to finish third among all network daytime TV game shows for the 1963\u201364 and 1967\u201368 seasons (by the latter season, NBC was the dominant network in the game show genre, ABC was not as successful and CBS had mostly dropped out of the genre). NBC also occasionally used special episodes of the series as a gap-filling program in prime time if one of its movies had an irregular time slot. Although the series still did well in the ratings (despite the popularity of ABC's horror-themed soap opera \"Dark Shadows\"), it was canceled in 1969 along with other game shows in a major daytime programming overhaul, being replaced by \"Letters to Laugh-In\" which, although a spin-off of the popular primetime series \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\", ended in just three months, on December 26.\n\"The Match Game\" continued through September 26, 1969, on NBC for 1,760 episodes, airing at 4:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern (3:00\u00a0p.m. Central), running 25 minutes due to a five-minute newscast slot. Since Olson split time between New York and Miami to announce \"The Jackie Gleason Show\", one of the network's New York staff announcers (such as Don Pardo or Wayne Howell) filled in for Olson when he could not attend a broadcast.\nOn February 27, 1967, the show added a \"telephone match\" game, in which a home viewer and a studio audience member attempted to match a simple fill-in-the-blank question, similar to the 1970s' \"head-to-head match\". A successful match won a jackpot, which started at $500 and increased by $100 per day until won.\nVery few episodes of the 1960s \"The Match Game\" survive (see episode status below).\n\"Match Game 73\u201379\" (1973\u201379, CBS).\nIn the early 1970s, CBS vice president Fred Silverman began overhauling the network's programming as part of what has colloquially become known as the rural purge. As part of this overhaul, the network reintroduced game shows, beginning in 1972. One of the first new offerings was \"The New Price Is Right\", a radically overhauled version of the 1950s game show \"The Price Is Right\". The success of \"The New Price Is Right\" prompted Silverman to commission more game shows. In the summer of 1973, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman took a similar approach in adapting \"The Match Game\" by reworking the show, moving it to Los Angeles, adding more celebrities, and increasing the amount of prize money that could be won. It was this show (along with the Bob Stewart game shows \"The $10,000 Pyramid\", \"Three on a Match\", \"Jackpot\", and the Heatter-Quigley show \"Gambit\") that reintroduced five-figure payouts for the first time since the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s.\nThe new version had Rayburn returning as the host and Olson returning as the announcer. The gameplay for this version had two solo contestants attempting to match the answers given by a six-celebrity panel. Richard Dawson was the first regular panelist. CBS News coverage of the Watergate hearings delayed the premiere one week from its slated date of June 25 to July 2.\nThe first week's panelists were Dawson, Michael Landon, Vicki Lawrence, Jack Klugman, Jo Ann Pflug, and Anita Gillette. Rayburn reassured viewers of the first week of CBS shows that \"This is your old favorite, updated with more action, more money, and, as you can see, more celebrities.\" The first few weeks of the show were somewhat different from the rest of the run. At first, many of the questions fit into the more bland and innocuous mold of the earlier seasons of the original series. In addition, many of the frequent panelists on the early episodes were not regulars later in the series but had appeared on the 1960s version, including Klugman, Arlene Francis, and Bert Convy.\nHowever, the double entendre in the question \"Johnny always put butter on his _____\" marked a turning point in the questions on the show. Soon, the tone of Rayburn's questions changed notably, leaving behind the staid topics that \"The Match Game\" had first disposed of in 1963 for more risqu\u00e9 humor. Celebrity panelists Brett Somers (Klugman's wife at the time) and Charles Nelson Reilly began as guest panelists on the program, with Somers brought in at the request of Klugman, who felt she would make a nice fit on the program. The chemistry between Somers and Reilly prompted Goodson\u2013Todman and CBS to hire them as regular panelists, Somers remained on the show until 1982, while Reilly continued appearing through the 1983\u201384 and 1990\u201391 revivals, with a brief break in 1974\u201375 when Gary Burghoff, Nipsey Russell, and Rip Taylor substituted for him. Burghoff and Russell continued to appear as semi-regular panelists afterward.\nCelebrity panelists appeared in week-long blocks, due to the show's production schedule. A number of celebrities, including Betty White, Dick Martin, Marcia Wallace, Bill Daily, Fannie Flagg, Elaine Joyce, Sarah Kennedy, Patti Deutsch, Mary Wickes, Bill Anderson, and Joyce Bulifant, were semi-regular panelists, usually appearing several times a year. Celebrity panelists also included personalities from other Goodson\u2013Todman-produced game shows, such as \"The Price Is Right\"'s Bob Barker, Anitra Ford, Janice Pennington, and Holly Hallstrom and \"Password\"'s Allen Ludden. The panelists were all seated in a strict order: The male guest panelist of the week, Somers, and Reilly usually sat in the top row from the viewer's left to right (occasionally a recurring panelist sat in for Somers or Reilly), and the female guest panelist of the week, Dawson (after 1978, a semi-regular male panelist), and a semi-regular female panelist (most frequently White, Flagg, Deutsch, Bulifant, or Wallace) occupied the bottom row.\nFormat.\nTwo contestants competed on each episode. On the CBS version, the champion was seated in the upstage (red circle) seat and the challenger (opponent) was seated in the downstage (green triangle) seat. On the syndicated versions, which had no returning champions, positions were determined by a backstage coin toss. The object was to match the answers of the six celebrity panelists to fill-in-the-blank statements.\nThe main game was played in two rounds (three on \"Match Game PM\" after the first season). The opponent was given a choice of two statements labeled either \"A\" or \"B\". Rayburn read the statement, and the six celebrities wrote their answers on index cards. After they finished, the contestant verbally gave an answer. Rayburn then asked the celebrities, one at a time beginning in the upper left-hand corner of the panel, to respond with their answers.\nWhile early questions were similar to those from the NBC version (e.g., \"Every morning, John puts [blank] on his cereal\"), the questions quickly became more humorous and risqu\u00e9. Comedy writer Dick DeBartolo (who stayed in New York), who had participated in the 1960s \"Match Game\", contributed broader and saucier questions. Frequently, the statements were written with bawdy, double entendre answers in mind. One example was, \"Did you catch a glimpse of that girl on the corner? She has the world's biggest [blank].\"\nFrequently, the audience responded appropriately as Rayburn critiqued the contestant's answer. For the \"world's biggest\" question, Rayburn might show disdain to an answer such as \"fingers\" or \"bag\" and compliment an answer such as \"rear end\" or \"boobs\", often also commenting on the audience's approving or disapproving response. The audience usually groaned or booed when a contestant or celebrity gave a bad or inappropriate answer, whereas they cheered and applauded in approval of a good answer. Sometimes, they howled at a risqu\u00e9 answer. At other times, their reaction was deliberately inappropriate, such as howling at a good answer or applauding a risqu\u00e9 answer, to perverse effect.\nThe contestant earned one point for each celebrity who wrote down the same answer (or a reasonably similar one as determined by the judges; for example, \"rear end\" matched \"bottom\" or a similar euphemism), up to six points for matching everyone on the celebrity panel. After one contestant played, the second contestant played the other question.\nA handful of potential answers were prohibited, the most notable being any synonym for genitalia. In instances where a celebrity gave the censorable answer, the word \"Oops!\" was superimposed over the index card and the celebrity's mouth, accompanied by a slide whistle masking the spoken response.\nPopular questions featured a character named \"Dumb Dora\" or \"Dumb Donald.\" These questions often began, \"Dumb Dora/Donald is \"so\" dumb...\" To this, in a routine taken from \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" the audience responded en masse, \"How dumb \"is\" she/he?\" This expanded to the generalized question form \"[adjective]-[alliterative-name] is \"SO\" [adjective]...\" To this, the audience responded, \"How [adjective] \"is\" he/she?\" Rayburn finished the question or, occasionally, praised the audience or derided the audience's lack of union and made them try the response again. Other common subjects of questions were Superman/Lois Lane, King Kong/Fay Wray, Tarzan/Jane, The Lone Ranger/Tonto, panelists on the show (most commonly Brett Somers), politicians, and Howard Cosell. Questions also often featured characters such as \"Ugly Edna\" (later \"Ugly Ulfrea\"), \"Unlucky Louie/Louise,\" \"Horrible Hannah/Hank,\" \"Rodney Rotten,\" and occasionally \"Voluptuous Velma\".\nSome questions dealt with the fictitious (and often sleazy) country of \"Nerdocrumbesia\" or the world's greatest salesman, who could sell anything to anyone. Other questions, usually given in the second round (or third round in \"Match Game PM\") to allow trailing contestants to catch up quickly, hinted at more obvious answers based on the context of the question. One such question was \"James Bond went to an all-night restaurant. When the waitress told him they were out of coffee, he ordered a [blank].\" Because James Bond's signature drink is a martini, shaken, not stirred, the panelists and contestants were expected to choose that answer. In the most extreme cases, the questions were puns with only one answer that made sense. \"Did you hear about the religious group of dentists? They call themselves the Holy [blank]\" was written so that only \"Molars\" made sense.\nRayburn always played the action for laughs and frequently tried to read certain questions in character, such as \"Old Man Periwinkle\" or \"Old Mrs. Pervis\". He also did the same with Confucius and Count Dracula. Regular panelist Charles Nelson Reilly, a Broadway director, often responded with comments such as \"I like it when you act\" and \"That character was really very good. Along with the other two that you do,\" to the amusement of the audience.\nIn the second round, the contestants attempted to match the celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars, in which case the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had answered only one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their question in the previous round made the selection in the tiebreaker round.\nOn \"Match Game PM\", the third round was added after the first season as games proved to be too short to fill the half-hour. Again, the only celebrities who played were those who did not match that contestant in previous rounds. On \"Match Game PM\", the questions with the most obvious answers were typically used in the third round.\nIf the contestants had the same score at the end of the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker question each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. Tiebreaker rounds were repeated until a winner was determined. On \"Match Game PM\", or on the syndicated daytime show if time was running short, a time-saving variant of the tiebreaker that reversed the gameplay was used. The contestants wrote their answers first on cards in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly, and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tiebreaker went on until there was a clear winner. If it came to the sudden-death tiebreaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.\nThe CBS daytime version had returning champions, and the gameplay \"straddled\" between episodes, meaning episodes often began and ended with games in progress. In this version, champions stayed until they were defeated or had won $25,000, whichever occurred first. Originally, this amount was the network's winnings limit. Anything above that amount was forfeited, but the rule was later changed so that although champions retired after winning $25,000, they kept any winnings up to $35,000. During the six-year run of \"Match Game\" on CBS, only one champion, Carolyn Raisner, retired undefeated with $32,600, the highest total ever won on \"Match Game\".\nOn the daily 1979\u201382 syndicated version, two contestants competed against each other in two games, with two new contestants replacing them afterward. The show was timed so that two new contestants appeared each Monday. This was necessary as the tapes of the show were shipped between stations, and weeks could not be aired in any discernible order. This was a common syndication practice at the time, known as \"bicycling\". Usually, three pairs of contestants competed in a total of six games over the five episodes for each week.\nOn Friday episodes that ran short, during the first season, a game was played with audience members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank was asked of Somers, and she wrote it down on her card. Rayburn then circulated amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, they won $50. Rayburn continued picking audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game was played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess.\nEpisodes of \"Match Game PM\" were self-contained, with two new contestants appearing each week.\nSuper Match.\nThe contestant who matched more celebrities than the other contestant at the end of the game won the game and went on to play the Super Match, which consisted of the audience match and the head-to-head match segments, for additional money. On the CBS version, the winner of the main game won $100.\nAudience Match.\nThe contestant was shown a short fill-in-the-blank phrase (example: \"Tell it to ______\"), for which the members of a previous studio audience had provided responses. The three most popular responses were hidden on the board, and the contestant attempted to match one of them. The contestant chose any three celebrities to offer suggestions, and could either use one of their ideas or give a different one. Matching one of the three responses on the board awarded $500, $250, or $100 in descending order of popularity. If the contestant failed to match any of them, the round ended immediately and the contestant won nothing. The premise for \"Family Feud\" (which Dawson began hosting in 1976) was derived from the audience match.\nTwo audience matches were played on \"Match Game PM\", allowing the contestant to win up to $1,000 in this half of the Super Match. If a contestant failed to win any money in either audience match, Rayburn then read a question similar to those in the main game. The contestant earned $100 per celebrity matched, for a maximum of $600. However, on the first occasion this happened, the contestant ended up with nothing and the remaining time was spent with Dawson reading a funny letter.\nHead-to-Head Match.\nA contestant who won money in the audience match then had the opportunity to win an additional 10 times that amount (therefore, $5,000, $2,500, or $1,000) by exactly matching another fill-in-the-blank response with one celebrity panelist. Originally, the contestant chose the celebrity. Later, the celebrity who played this match was determined by spinning a wheel (see \"Star Wheel\" below). At the very start of the 1970s series, Rayburn read the question before the celebrity was chosen, but this was changed after the first two episodes. The format of these matches was much shorter and non-humorous, typically requiring the contestant and celebrity to choose from a number of similar familiar phrases, such as for \"Baseball _____\" (baseball game, baseball diamond, etc.). The contestant was instructed that their response must be an exact match, although singular/plural matches were usually accepted, whereas synonyms, derivatives, and partial word phrases were not.\nThe panelist chosen most often by contestants to play the head-to-head match was Richard Dawson, who usually matched with the contestants who chose him. Dawson, in fact, was such a popular choice for the second half of the Super Match that the producers instituted a rule in 1975 that forbade contestants from choosing the same panelist for consecutive head-to-head matches in an effort to give the other celebrities a chance to play. After four weeks, the rule was rescinded.\nStar Wheel.\nOn June 29, 1978, the producers made a second attempt to ensure that each celebrity received a chance to play the head-to-head match. Instead of simply choosing a celebrity, the contestant spun a wheel that was divided into six sections, each marked with a different celebrity's name. Once the wheel stopped, the contestant attempted to match with the indicated celebrity. If the wheel did not make at least one complete revolution, the contestant was required to spin again.\nThe introduction of the star wheel also brought about a change in the bonus payout structure. Each section included several gold stars, which doubled the stakes if the wheel stopped on one of them. The maximum prize was $10,000 on the daytime series and $20,000 on \"Match Game PM\".\nWhen the star wheel was introduced, each section contained five stars in a continuous white border, and the prize was doubled if the wheel stopped with its pointer anywhere in that area. Beginning with the premiere of the 1979 syndicated version, the wheel was re-designed so that each section had three stars in separate, evenly spaced squares. The pointer now had to be on a square in order to double the money.\nIronically, the wheel stopped on Dawson the first time it was used, inspiring four of the panelists (Somers, Reilly, guest panelist Mary Wickes, and Dawson himself) to stand up from their places and leave the set momentarily out of disbelief, leaving recurring panelist Scoey Mitchell and guest panelist Sharon Farrell behind. As the others returned, Wickes said to host Rayburn, \"Do you know what that wheel costs us? And it's right back to Richard!\"\nAt the time, Dawson was becoming weary as a regular panelist on \"Match Game\" as he had concurrently been hosting \"Family Feud\", which by then was producing 10 shows a week between its daytime run on ABC and a separate syndicated version. Dawson was tired from appearing on both shows regularly and wished to focus solely on the latter. The addition of the Star Wheel ended what effectively was Dawson's \"spotlight\" feature on the show, which distressed him further, and he left the panel of \"Match Game\" permanently a few weeks later.\nThe subsequent 1990\u201391 version of the show used a redesigned version of the star wheel. The wheel itself was stationary, and the contestant spun the pointer on a concentric ring to determine which celebrity he or she had to match. The prize was doubled if the pointer stopped on either of two circles within each section.\nStaffing and ratings.\nThe 1973\u201382 versions were produced by veteran Goodson\u2013Todman producer Ira Skutch, who also wrote some questions and acted as the on-stage judge. Marc Breslow directed while Robert Sherman was associate producer and head writer.\nWhen CBS revamped \"Match Game\" in 1973 with more of a focus on risqu\u00e9 humor, ratings more than doubled in comparison with the NBC incarnation. Within three months, \"Match Game '73\" was the most-watched program on daytime television. By summer 1974, it grew into an absolute phenomenon with high school students and housewives, scoring remarkable ratings among the 12\u201334 age demographic. The best ratings this version of \"Match Game\" saw were in the 1975\u201376 season when it drew a 12.5 rating with a 35 share, higher numbers than that of some prime-time series. It surpassed records as the most popular daytime program ever with a record 11 million daily viewers, one that held until the \"Luke and Laura\" supercouple storyline gripped viewers on ABC's \"General Hospital\" some years later.\nEvery New Year's Eve, when the two-digit year designation in the \"Match Game\" sign was updated, there was a New Year's party with the cast and studio audience. Up to and including the 1977\u201378 changeover, a new sign was built each year. Coinciding with a redesign of the set, a new sign was built with interchangeable digits that could be swapped as the years changed. Additionally, this sign allowed for a \"PM\" logo to be attached for tapings of the syndicated program instead of using an entirely different sign. Charles Nelson Reilly swapped out the \"78\" portion of the sign and installed the new \"79\" on-air, to the playing of \"Auld Lang Syne\" and wished the audience a happy new year.\nIn 1976, the show's success, and celebrity panelist Richard Dawson's popularity, prompted Goodson\u2013Todman to develop a new show for ABC, titled \"Family Feud,\" with Dawson hosting. This show became a major hit in its own right, eventually surpassing the parent program. \"Family Feud\" was said to be based on Dawson's expertise in the audience match segment of \"Match Game\".\nMeanwhile, \"Match Game\" kept its high standing in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show's time slot. Taking note of a ratings boon that resulted when \"The Price Is Right\" and \"Match Game\" were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that \"The Price Is Right\" had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved \"Match Game\" to 11:00\u00a0a.m., immediately following \"The Price Is Right\" at 10:00\u00a0a.m. However, because much of \"Match Game\"'s audience was composed of students who were in school at that time of day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; many of these students did not return. As a result, \"Family Feud\" quickly supplanted \"Match Game\" as television's highest-rated game show.\nCBS attempted to correct the problem on December 12, 1977, with a scheduling shuffle among \"Match,\" \"Price,\" and \"Tattletales.\" However, in a move that turned out to do even more damage, the network moved \"Match Game\" to its 1960s time slot of 4:00\u00a0p.m., a time slot which, by this point, many local stations were preempting in favor of local or syndicated programming. As a result, \"Match Game\" was unable to get the audience it once did in the 1960s at 4:00.\n1978 changes and cancellation.\nOn July 19, 1978, a new \"Match Game\" set was built by CBS, changed from the original bright orange to a new set with blue and white colors, as well as revamping the logo. The newly designed \"Match Game\" sign meant that a whole new sign no longer had to be built each year as had been done previously. An attachment designating the year was simply taken off the end of the revamped \"Match Game '78\" sign and replaced with a new one numbered '79 on New Year's Eve of 1978, which actually aired January 2, 1979, becoming \"Match Game '79.\" (An alternate attachment was used for \"Match Game PM.\")\nAt 4:00\u00a0p.m., the show trailed \"Family Feud\", \"The Price Is Right\", and NBC's \"Wheel of Fortune\", and it fell out of the top three game shows in 1979 for the first time in the CBS run (as opposed to a solid and twice top-3 hit in the 1960s). The 1,439th and final CBS episode aired on April 20, 1979. The Tom Kennedy-hosted game show \"Whew!\" replaced \"Match Game\" on the schedule when it premiered in the 10:30\u00a0a.m. time slot on April 23, 1979.\n\"Match Game PM\" (1975\u201381, weekly syndication).\nOn September 8, 1975, the first syndicated version, a weekly nighttime series dubbed \"Match Game PM\" premiered. The series, sold to many ABC affiliates (including the network's owned and operated stations such as WABC-TV in New York), was produced by Goodson\u2013Todman and distributed by Jim Victory Television, G-T's syndication partner for \"Concentration.\"\n\"Match Game PM\" was the first version of the game with self-contained episodes. The front game was originally played the same way as the daytime \"Match Game\" with two rounds of questions, but in the second season, the third round of questioning was added to fill time in the half-hour. The maximum score a contestant could achieve remained six points, with matched celebrities not playing subsequent questions.\nBeginning with the second season, tiebreakers were conducted differently from the daytime version. A \"Super Match\"-style question was asked, and the contestants wrote their answers, then called on celebrities for a match. Originally, only Somers, Reilly and Dawson played in the tiebreaker, but after Dawson's departure in 1978, all six celebrities played.\n\"Match Game PM's\" Super Match used two audience matches, with the answer values combined and multiplied by ten for the head-to-head match, with a maximum of $10,000 available. When the star wheel was introduced, that potential payout grew to $20,000 if a contestant spun a double.\n\"Match Game PM\" ran until the end of the 1980\u201381 TV season. For its last two seasons, the show's affiliate count went down significantly due in large part to a daily syndicated version that debuted in September 1979, although some markets kept both shows on the air\u2013in New York, WCBS-TV ran the daily syndicated version as WABC-TV continued to air episodes of \"Match Game PM\" into its final season. The show aired 230 episodes over six seasons, and remains the longest-running version to air in syndication.\nLater revivals.\n1979\u201382, daily syndication.\nAfter the cancellation of \"Match Game 79\", there was still enough interest in the series for Goodson\u2013Todman and Jim Victory Television to consider a continuation of the daily series in syndication as the weekly \"Match Game PM\" was still airing and had not stopped production. The consideration eventually came to fruition as a daily syndicated \"Match Game\", without a year attached and often referred to on-air as \"The Match Game\", debuted on September 10, 1979.\nThe rules and gameplay were the same as before, including the star wheel bonus, but the format was altered slightly. Each contestant on this version of \"Match Game\" played a two-game match against another contestant, and the Super Match was played after each game. As is the case with \"Match Game PM\", a contestant did not win any money for winning the game. There were also no returning champions on the daily syndicated series, as two new contestants began each match. The star wheel reduced the golden star sections to three, making it more difficult to double the winnings in the head-to-head match.\nThe maximum payout for a contestant was $21,000 (two $500 audience matches and two $10,000 head-to-head match wins), the same its syndicated sister series \"Match Game PM\" was offering during this time.\nFor the first two seasons Bill Daily, Dick Martin, Richard Paul, and Bob Barker were among the male semi-regulars who filled Dawson's old spot on the panel. McLean Stevenson, who appeared once in September 1978 and twice near the end of the second year of this version, appeared in nearly all of the third season (1981\u201382) and became a regular from the eleventh taped week through the end of the season.\nThe syndicated \"Match Game\" helped exacerbate the perception of the 4:00\u00a0p.m. time slot being a \"death slot\" for network programming. After CBS canceled \"Match Game 79\", the network moved the long-running soap opera \"Love of Life\" into the vacant time slot. Although the syndicated \"Match Game\" was not a direct cause of the ratings problems \"Love of Life\" faced\u2014the 4:00\u00a0p.m. time slot, the last network daytime slot, had been a problem for all three networks for years and \"Love of Life\" had seen a precipitous drop in ratings since the April 1979 move to the late afternoon\u2014many stations ran the syndicated \"Match Game\" against the veteran soap opera, and several more stations, including many CBS-owned stations and affiliates, dropped \"Love of Life\" in favor of the new \"Match Game\". (\"Love of Life\" aired its final episode on February 1, 1980, five months after the debut of the new \"Match Game\".) The daytime syndicated show produced 525 episodes, running until September 10, 1982 \u2013 exactly three years after its debut.\n\"Match Game\"'s 1973\u201382 run was taped in Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, except for one week of shows in 1974 in which it was shot in Studio 41.\n\"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" (1983\u201384, NBC).\nIn 1983, producer Mark Goodson teamed up with Orion Television (who had recently acquired the rights to \"Hollywood Squares\") and NBC to create \"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\". Rayburn, after a year as a morning show host in New York, agreed to return as host. However, few of the regular \"Squares\" cast appeared on this version. Jon Bauman (Sha Na Na) was tapped to host the \"Hollywood Squares\" segment of the game and he and Rayburn swapped seats while the other hosted his portion of the show. The primary announcer was Gene Wood, with Johnny Olson, Bob Hilton, and Rich Jeffries substituting.\nThese rules were roughly the same as those of \"Match Game PM\" with both contestants given three chances apiece to match each panelist once. The lone noticeable difference was in the tie-breaker. Played similarly to the Super Match, four answers to a statement were secretly shown to the contestants (e.g., \"_____, New Jersey\", with the choices of \"Atlantic City\", \"Hoboken\", \"Newark\" and \"Trenton\"). They each chose one by number. Then, as was the case in \"Match Game PM\", the host polled the celebrities for verbal responses, and the first panelist to give an answer selected by one of the contestants won the game for that contestant. The winner of the \"Match Game\" segment played the returning champion in the \"Hollywood Squares\" segment with the eventual winner of \"Squares\" playing the Super Match.\nIn the Super Match, the audience match featured payoffs of $1,000, $500, and $250. If a contestant did not make an audience match, the game did not end, but the contestant was given $100 and the game continued to the head-to-head match.\nFor the head-to-head match, the game reverted to the contestant picking the celebrity, and each celebrity had a hidden multiplier (10, 20, 30). The audience match winnings were multiplied by the hidden number to determine the Super Match jackpot for the head-to-head match, with the maximum amount available being $30,000. Champions remained on the program for up to five days unless defeated.\n\"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" ran from October 31, 1983, to July 27, 1984. Several music cues from the program were used as background music during prize descriptions on \"The Price Is Right\".\n1990\u201391, ABC Daytime.\nIn 1989, ABC, which had not carried a daytime game show since \"Bargain Hunters\" in 1987, ordered a revival of \"Match Game\" for its lineup. A week's worth of pilot episodes were commissioned with Bert Convy as host, who was also hosting \"3rd Degree\" for his own production company at the time. The network agreed to pick up the revival for a summer 1990 premiere making it the first Mark Goodson-produced game show to run on the network since \"Family Feud\" was cancelled in June 1985.\nJust before the new series was to begin, producers were forced to find a new host when Convy was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor in April 1990. Although original host Gene Rayburn expressed interest in returning, the producers declined, with Rayburn suspecting that public knowledge of his age (72 at the time) led to his being snubbed. Ross Shafer, the former host of Fox's \"The Late Show\" and the USA Network dating series \"Love Me, Love Me Not\", took over as host. Charles Nelson Reilly returned as a regular panelist and Brett Somers appeared as a guest panelist for several weeks. Vicki Lawrence, Sally Struthers, Brad Garrett, Bill Kirchenbauer, and Ronn Lucas were among the semi-regulars for this version of the show. Gene Wood returned as an announcer, with Bob Hilton filling in for two weeks. Marcia Wallace, Betty White, Dick Martin, Dolly Martin, Jo Anne Worley, Edie McClurg &amp; Jimmie Walker were among other panelists who also appeared on earlier versions of the show.\nGameplay.\nFor this edition of \"Match Game\", two contestants competed, with one usually a returning champion. Instead of attempting to match as many of the six panelists as possible over the course of two rounds, the two contestants won money by making matches, with the high scorer becoming champion at the end of the game. Two rounds of fill-in-the-blank questions were played, with each match paying off at $50.\nAfter both contestants played a question of their own, each separately played a speed round of Super Match-style questions called \"Match-Up\" with a celebrity partner of their choice. The contestant was presented with a question with two possible answers and secretly selected one, after which the panelist was told the choices and then tried to match the contestant's choice by giving a verbal response. Each contestant had 30 seconds to make as many matches as possible as $50 per match. Gameplay began with the trailing contestant, who chose from any of the six panelists. The leading contestant chose from the remaining five panelists for their match-up round.\nFollowing Match-Up, another traditional question round was played with all six celebrities for $50 per match with all six panelists. After round two, contestants then played Final Match-Up (each choosing from the remaining panelists) for 45 seconds, with matches paying off at $100 each. The contestant ahead at the end of Final Match-Up won the game and kept any money earned.\nIf the game ended in a tie, one tie breaking Match-Up phrase was shown to both contestants along with three choices. The champion chose an answer first and the challenger chose one of the remaining two answers. After the choices were made, the last celebrity who played Final Match-Up was told which answers the contestants selected and was then asked to choose one of them. The contestant whose chosen answer matched the answer said by that celebrity won an additional $100 and the game.\nThe Super Match was played similar to the 1978\u201382 version of the round, beginning with the audience match. Initially, the payouts were the same as in the 1970s series, with the top answer worth $500, the second $250, and the third $100, failing to match any of the top three answers awarded $50. After three weeks, the payouts for the second- and third-place answers were increased to $300 and $200, respectively, and the consolation amount was doubled to $100.\nFollowing the audience match, the contestant spun the Star Wheel to choose a celebrity for the head-to-head match and set the stakes. The wheel was fixed in place, and each celebrity's section contained two large red dots. The contestant spun a pointer attached to the rim of the wheel and played for 20 times the audience match value if it stopped on a dot, or 10 times the value otherwise. The contestant had to match the chosen celebrity's response exactly in order to win. The maximum somebody could win in the Super Match was $10,000.\nChampions could stay for up to five days or until they were defeated, and kept all their winnings. This version of \"Match Game\" was the first not to have a network-imposed winnings limit; ABC had previously set a $20,000 limit on its game shows, but dropped the practice by 1990.\nABC aired the show at 12:00\u00a0p.m. because many of its stations in major Eastern Time markets carried local news at that timeslot, which was a major problem among the three networks throughout the 1970s and 1980s; the show was mostly seen in smaller markets and on independent stations in some larger markets without network clearances (which had affected the previous occupier of the time slot, soap opera \"Ryan's Hope\"), and was canceled after one season. The show's final episode aired on June 21, 1991; Ross Shafer announced the show would be moving to \"another channel, another time, very shortly\" on the finale, but this never materialized. On July 15, 1991, \"Home\" temporarily expanded to 90 minutes to fill the show's timeslot, until ABC returned the half-hour to its affiliates in September 1992. \"Match Game\" was ABC's last daytime game show to date.\n1998\u201399, daily syndication.\nIn 1996, a pilot was produced for a new revival of the show as \"MG2: The Match Game\", just five years after the previous incarnation had left the air, with Charlene Tilton as host (who had previously been a panelist herself on the PM version). While that version (which did not air) had a much greater departure from the game's original format, the producers significantly retooled the format to create a somewhat more faithful remake of the program, which was picked up in syndication and began in fall 1998.\nMichael Burger hosted this revived version of the show, with Paul Boland announcing. The only celebrity guests who had appeared on previous versions of the show were Vicki Lawrence (who appeared on two weeks of the 1970s version and regularly on the 1990\u201391 version) and Nell Carter (who had appeared on the final week in 1991). The regular panelists on this version were Carter, Lawrence, and Judy Tenuta, and semi-regulars were George Hamilton, John Salley, Coolio, and Rondell Sheridan (the only panelist from \"MG2\" to carry over to the regular series). Production returned to Studio 33 at Television City Studios on this version.\nThis incarnation of \"Match Game\" was played with rules similar to that of the 1973\u201382 versions. However, the show featured a panel of only five celebrities instead of the usual six. Questions in this version were not labeled A or B, instead, titles with puns were a clue as to the content. As on the 1990\u201391 version, all five panelists played each round regardless of whether they matched a contestant on the first question. Correct matches in the first round were worth one point while those in the second were worth two.\nAfter two rounds, the higher scorer played the Super Match, which was played similar to its 1973\u201378 incarnation (with the exception of the 1983 rule change, $50 in this version, for an unsuccessful match), including the $5,000 top prize and in the head to head match the contestant faced the celebrity which was never allowed on any other version and the celebrity stood at a podium to write their answer instead of writing the answer at their seat.\nThis version was placed in many late night slots due to the celebrities giving answers that were inappropriate and otherwise risqu\u00e9 jokes about body parts and genitals (including some of the answers not being censored including one episode in which Coolio's risque answer was not censored); this is likely the reason why this version only lasted one season, running from September 21, 1998, to May 21, 1999, with repeats airing until September 17, 1999.\n\"Gameshow Marathon\" (2006, CBS).\nOn June 22, 2006, \"Match Game\" was the sixth of seven classic game shows featured in CBS's month-long \"Gameshow Marathon\" hosted by Ricki Lake and announced by Rich Fields, and the second of two \"semi-final\" games in the tournament. The contestants were Kathy Najimy and Lance Bass with Betty White, George Foreman, Kathy Griffin, Bruce Vilanch, Adam Carolla, and Adrianne Curry as the panel. White retained her normal sixth-seat position and was the only one from the original series to appear for this segment of \"Gameshow Marathon\".\nLake used the same signature long-thin Sony ECM-51 telescoping microphone Rayburn used during the CBS version, and the set was rebuilt to be almost an exact match of that used from 1973 to 1978. Najimy won the game, scoring five matches to Bass's three.\nThe format was that of \"Match Game PM\", except that in the Super Match the head-to-head match was played for 50 times the amount won in the two audience matches ($50,000), which was won.\n\"Match Game\" (Canada).\nA Canadian revival of \"Match Game\" debuted on March 5, 2010, as \",\" a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois version on V, with Alexandre Barrette as host and produced by Zone 3, in association with FremantleMedia North America. A coinciding English-language version debuted on The Comedy Network October 15, 2012 and was hosted by Darrin Rose, with Se\u00e1n Cullen and Debra DiGiovanni as permanent panelists. On April 4, 2013, it was announced that due to high ratings, the show returned for a 60-episode second season, which premiered on September 2.\nThe first English-language season shared studios with the French-language version in Montreal, with production of the English version moving to Showline Studios in Toronto for season 2.\nGameplay is similar to the 1990 U.S. revival, two rounds are played, with all six celebrities participating in both rounds, and each match is worth 50 points (100 points starting in season 2). The third round is called match-up!, with each contestant given 45 seconds to match/his her chosen celebrity partner, and successful matches are again worth 50 points (100 starting in season 2). The contestant with more points at the end of this round wins the game and receives the cash equivalent of their score (for example, if the champion's final score was 450 points, the payoff would be $450). If there is a tie after Match-Up, one tiebreaking Match-up is shown with three choices. Both contestants secretly chose their picks and the celebrity that last played Match-Up gets to break the tie with his/her verbal response.\nUnlike any previous version, the audience match portion of the Super Match is not played for a payoff, but simply to determine the value of the head-to-head match. The potential payoffs are $2,500\u2013$2,000\u2013$1,500, or $1,000 for an unsuccessful match. If the champion manages a lucky star wheel spin, as in earlier versions, the value is doubled for a payoff of up to $5,000. Originally, in season 1 the payoffs were $2,000\u2013$1,500\u2013$1,000, or $500 for an unsuccessful match, with a potential top payoff of $4,000 for a lucky star wheel spin.\nFirst ABC revival (2016\u201321).\nThe first of ten 60-minute episodes of another revival of \"Match Game\" premiered on ABC (which had previously aired the 1990 version) on June 26, 2016. Alec Baldwin served as host and executive producer. The show aired as part of ABC's \"Sunday Fun and Games\" block alongside the returning \"Celebrity Family Feud\" and \"The $100,000 Pyramid\". It also marked the series' return to New York, having taped there during the 1960s. On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed \"Match Game\" for a second season.\nGameplay was similar to the 1973\u201379 version, featuring two full games, each with two new contestants. Each game is self-contained, with two questions per contestant, the winner advances to the Super Match. If the score was tied after two rounds, a tiebreaker round with all stars was played, if the tie persisted, a sudden-death tiebreaker was played. Values for the audience match portion of the bonus game were $5,000, $3,000, and $2,000, with $1,000 awarded for not matching any of the top three answers. The contestant then selected a celebrity for the head-to-head match, which multiplied the audience match winnings by five if successful, for a potential top prize of $25,000.\nOn many episodes, answers deemed inappropriate for broadcast were edited out with comical effects, including a slide whistle sound effect dubbed over the audible answer in place of the usual bleep censor. In addition, the answer card and celebrity's mouth could be blurred or pixelated.\nThe show was picked up to fill ABC's winter programming schedule on January 4, 2017.\nOn April 2, 2017, the show began to be used as a mid-season replacement on Sunday evenings with newly produced episodes filling in for three weeks to replace the canceled period drama/sci-fi series \"Time After Time\" before the start of May sweeps, when extended season finales and awards ceremonies fill out the remainder of the season.\nOn August 6, 2017, ABC announced that \"Match Game\" was renewed for a third season, which later premiered on January 9, 2018. Season four of the show debuted in June 2019. On November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on May 31, 2020. After the last series of episodes aired over summer 2020 and July 2021, ABC confirmed in April 2022 that the series had been cancelled; the decision was made before Baldwin was involved in an accidental shooting of a crew member on the set of the film \"Rust\" in October 2021.\nSecond ABC revival (2025).\nOn April 29, 2025, ABC announced that it would premiere a second prime time revival of \"Match Game\", hosted by Canadian comedian and actor Martin Short, and filmed in Montreal, Quebec. Short also serves as an executive producer. The revival premiered on July 23, 2025.\nEpisode status.\nOnly 11 episodes of the 1962\u201369 series are known to survive\u2014the pilot and 10 kinescope recordings, all of which are archived at the Paley Center for Media. Nine of these are black-and-white kinescopes and one is a color episode (from 1969 and on videotape). The pilot has since fallen into the public domain.\nReruns.\nThe 1973\u201382 incarnations are shown in reruns daily on Buzzr and GSN.\nVirtually all episodes of this version are still extant, although some are reportedly not shown due to celebrities' refusals of clearances, while others have been banned for various reasons (usually for answers from either celebrities or contestants that are now deemed to no longer be politically correct) or pulled from reruns due to tape damage. The 1990\u201391 ABC version has also had runs on GSN until 2005. On December 25, 2012, an episode of the 1998 version along with a Bert Convy pilot aired on GSN for the first time as part of a \"Match Game\" marathon.\nBuzzr also airs reruns of the 1970s Match Game incarnation. Buzzr added the \"Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" episodes to its lineup in February 2019, initially with the first week of episodes; more episodes were eventually added in September after the network updated the show's archive for 21st-century broadcasting standards. Those episodes had not been seen on television since their original broadcasts.\n\"The Real Match Game Story: Behind the Blank\".\nOn November 26, 2006, GSN aired an hour-long documentary titled \"The Real Match Game Story: Behind The Blank\", narrated by Jamie Farr. The documentary features rarely seen footage of the 1960s version, many odd or memorable moments from the main 1973\u201382 runs, and interviews with Rayburn (including the final interview before his death in 1999), Somers, Dawson, DeBartolo, producer Ira Skutch, and others involved in the show's production.\nMusic.\n\"Match Game\" featured several theme songs throughout its various runs. From 1962 to 1967, Bert Kaempfert's instrumental \"A Swingin' Safari\" was used as the theme. Kaempfert's commercial single, recorded in Europe, was used for the pilot, an American cover version by the Billy Vaughn orchestra was used through 1967. From 1967 to 1969, a new theme composed by Score Productions was used.\nWhen the program returned in 1973, Goodson\u2013Todman once again turned to Score Productions for a music package. A new theme, performed by The Midnight Four, was composed by Score staff composer Ken Bichel with a memorable \"funk\" guitar intro, and similar elements and instruments from this theme were also featured in the numerous \"think cues\" heard when the panel wrote down their answers. Alternate think cues were extracted from the music packages for \"Tattletales\" and \"The Money Maze\". In keeping with the zany atmosphere, the music supervisors also used other notable musical works to add to humorous situations. Among the non-Score Productions music heard on occasion was the \"burlesque\" music titled \"The Stripper\", and a version of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" (usually humorously played in response to Rayburn's call for \"belly dancing\" music).\nThe music for \"The Match Game\u2013Hollywood Squares Hour\" was composed by Edd Kalehoff. None of the music used from the 1970s version was used in this version. The main theme song and several of its cue variations were used on \"The Price Is Right\".\nIn 1990, Bichel re-orchestrated his 1970s theme with more modern instruments with new think cues (with the classic intro/think cue re-orchestrated). The 1998 version again used music from Score Productions. The 2016 revival utilizes Bichel's original 1973 theme and think cues.\nMerchandise.\nHome games.\nSeveral home game versions based on the 1960s and 1970s American television version were published by Milton Bradley from 1963 through 1978, in multiple editions.\n\"The Match Game\" (1963\u201369).\nStarting in 1963, Milton Bradley made six editions of the NBC version. Each game contained crayons, wipe-off papers, 100 perforated cards with six questions per card, a plastic scoreboard tray with colored pegs and chips, and 6 \"scribble boards\". After the first edition, the vinyl scribble boards and crayons were replaced with six \"magic slates\" and wooden styli.\nThe main object of the game is for a contestant to try to write answers to questions that will match the answers of their partner. The rules for a six-contestant game are the same as on the TV show (with similar scoring, such as receiving points for matching two answers and more points for matching all three answers), but the home game also has variations for fewer than six contestants. No bonus game is included.\nMilton Bradley also created a Fine Edition and a Collector's Edition with more questions. The magic slates came enclosed in a gold folder, plus a dial to keep score instead of the pegboard. The scoring and point values were just like the TV show. The only difference between the Fine Edition and the Collector's Edition is that instead of being packaged in a normal cardboard box, it came in a leatherette case with buttons on the front apron.\n\"Match Game\" (1974\u201378).\nStarting in 1974, Milton Bradley created three more editions based on the most famous CBS version. Each edition contained a game board with a plastic stand, two game booklets (one with instructions) with material for 92 complete games (368 Main Game Questions and 92 audience match and head-to-head match questions), two magic slates and styli (only of the head-to-head match portion), and play money.\nAs in the 1970s version, two contestants have two chances to match as many of the six celebrities as possible. Celebrity answers are printed in the booklets, and after the contestant gives an answer, the M.C. reads the celebrity responses one by one, marking correct answers on the game board. A contestant can get up to six matches in one game. The contestant with the most matches plays the Super Match round (the MC reads the question and the responses) for a chance to win money (with an audience match and a head-to-head match similar to the TV show) of up to $5,000.\nInteractive online versions.\nAfter much success with its online version of \"Family Feud\", Uproar.com released a single-contestant version of \"Match Game\" in 2001. However, as of September 30, 2006, the website has been temporarily shut down, no longer offering any game show-based games of any kind.\nGSN offered a version called \"Match Game: Interactive\" on its own website that allowed users to play along with the show while watching. However, as of January 1, 2007, only those shows airing between 7:00pm and 10:00pm were interactive as \"Match Game\" itself was not one of them.\nSlot machine.\nA five reels video slot machine based on the 1973\u201382 version was released at various US casinos by WMS Gaming in 2004. The game features caricatures of Jimmie Walker, Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, Morgan Fairchild (even though she has never appeared on any incarnations of the show itself), Rip Taylor and Vicki Lawrence as the panel and Gene Rayburn as the host. The slot machine's bonus round stays faithful to the original game format where round one is adapted from the main game while round two features the Super Match bonus round.\nHome media.\nA DVD set called \"The Best of Match Game\" featuring a collection of more than 30 episodes of the 1970s version including the original 1962 pilot episode (which was originally called \"The Match Game\") was released in 2006. An eight-episode collection, called \"The Best of \"Match Game\": Dumb Dora Is So Dumb Edition!\", was released later on in 2007 by BCI Eclipse Company LLC (under license from FremantleMedia Enterprises), which contained 8 original episodes, uncut and unedited, and digitally restored, re-mastered and transferred from the original 2-inch videotape recording masters for optimum video quality.\nIn 2007, Endless Games released a DVD game featuring questions and clips from the 1970s version. Its gameplay was similar to that of the 1970s version; however, it allowed up to six contestants rather than two. Scoring for the game was also slightly different as well, as every match in round one was worth $50 each while in round two, every match was worth $100. Also, the Super Match round was played differently. The audience match portion was played after round one by the leading contestants, and the head-to-head match by the winning contestants, with a correct match doubling the winnings of the contestant's scores.\nIn popular culture.\nThe success of \"Match Game\" led to its portrayal in other media. In the Howard Stern biopic \"Private Parts\", the radio host and his crew play a version of the game with more inappropriate answers (Longtime sidekick Robin Quivers, parodying Somers, responded to the question \"[Blank] Willow\" with an answer about female genitalia).\n\"Saturday Night Live\", the current occupant of \"Match Game\"'s former New York studio, featured a parody in a Season 33 episode under the title \"It's a Match\", with fictitious names given to panelists (Amy Poehler and Fred Armisen played characters similar to Somers and Reilly).\nSince 2010, Match Game has been parodied by drag artist RuPaul in the cable reality competition series \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" as \"Snatch Game\": a regular challenge in the series where the contestants each impersonate a different celebrity for comedic effect.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The character first appeared in the television series ' in 1988 and went on to appear in the films \"Star Trek Generations\" and ' as well as the television series \". She was also played as a child by Isis Carmen Jones in the episode \" and a younger version of the character by Ito Aghayere in \"Picard\".\nGuinan is a bartender in the Ten-Forward lounge aboard the starship USS \"Enterprise\"-D. The character first appears in the second-season opening episode \"\", and makes recurring appearances during the next four seasons. Guinan was partly inspired by the \"Star Wars\" character Yoda, and is said to be hundreds of years old with corresponding wisdom and insight which she often uses to defuse difficult situations or comfort other characters.\nHistory.\nFollowing the departure of Denise Crosby from the role of Tasha Yar during the of ', established actress Whoopi Goldberg believed there was a vacancy for a female actress on the series. She had been a lifelong fan of \"Star Trek\", having been inspired to become an actress by Nichelle Nichols' appearances as Uhura in '. Goldberg later recalled that she first saw an episode of the series in her youth and after Uhura appeared on-screen, she went running through her house shouting \"Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!\" Goldberg approached her friend LeVar Burton, who played Geordi La Forge in \"The Next Generation\", but the producers of the series ignored her, by one account believing they were being pranked until Goldberg telephoned the production office directly. However, executive producer Rick Berman later recalled it was Goldberg's manager who made the call, inviting him and series creator Gene Roddenberry out to lunch with Goldberg to discuss her appearing on the series.\nAt the time, plans were already underway to add a lounge set to the series. Named Ten-Forward, it was created to have a setting where the crew of the USS \"Enterprise\"-D could be shown interacting with each other as well as various aliens in a more casual setting. At the lunch between Berman, Roddenberry and Goldberg, she explained that \"Star Trek\" was the only futuristic science fiction series at the time she knew of that featured black people prominently. She asked whether they had already cast the new Doctor, following the firing of Gates McFadden from the role of Beverly Crusher. Roddenberry and Berman instead suggested the creation of a new character specifically for Goldberg. Goldberg was unable to commit to appearing as a permanent member of the cast, which fit in with plans for Ten-Forward as they were not expecting the lounge to appear in every episode.\nThe character of Guinan was based on Mary Louise Cecilia \"Texas\" Guinan, a prohibition-era emcee and owner of the 300 Club in New York City. While the name was adopted, the characterization was changed to a worldly mystic, in line with Yoda from the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of \"Star Trek\", had envisaged the character Guinan as extremely old, leading Goldberg to suggest that she could be the ancestor of some of the other characters on the series.\nWhen Goldberg made her first appearance as Guinan, in the episode \"\", she was credited as a \"Special Guest Star\" alongside Diana Muldaur who appeared throughout the as Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Guinan-centric episodes were scheduled throughout the rest of the run of \"The Next Generation\" to coincide with the availability of Goldberg, who at the time was continuing to appear in films and other work. In one instance, for \"\", Guinan was written in at short notice, taking lines intended for other characters after Goldberg became available at short notice unexpectedly.\nThere were plans to introduce a son of Guinan at some point in \"The Next Generation\", but this never occurred. The idea was resurrected during the writing process of the \" episode \", with the character of Martus Mazur intended to be Guinan's son. After Goldberg was unable to make a guest appearance, the relationship between the two characters was written out. However, the first time that the El-Aurian species was mentioned by name was in this episode, but this may have been inspired by the scripts for \"Star Trek Generations\" which the writing team would have seen by that point in the production of the series.\nGoldberg became intrinsically linked to \"Star Trek\", and she became a personal friend of creator Gene Roddenberry, subsequently being one of the eulogists at his funeral in 1991. During the initial production of \"\", she met with director Nicholas Meyer to discuss appearing as a Klingon in the film. This was vetoed by actor Leonard Nimoy, who had taken the lead on arrangements for the film, as with Christian Slater already set to appear in the film he did not want to be overwhelmed with celebrity cameos. She later described Guinan as a combination of Yoda, herself and Andrei Sakharov, adding that she was \"more grateful for \"Star Trek\" now as a mother and grandmother\" and described the prospect of \"Star Trek\", saying \"We all need to believe there is a good, positive future for us.\"\nGoldberg stated at her first \"Star Trek\" convention in 2016 that she wishes to return to the franchise and appear on \"\" in the future since the character was specifically designed to be able to appear at any point in the timeline. Returning actor-character combinations are famous in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, and popular also; \"TNG\"'s \"\" (1991) episodes featuring Leonard Nimoy as Spock in Part II brought in the highest Nielsen ratings (15.4) of that season, and the highest for \"TNG\" except for the pilot and finale (see also \"Star Trek\" crossovers). During a January 22, 2020, appearance on \"The View\", the talk show of which Goldberg is a co-host, Patrick Stewart helped realize Goldberg's wish, inviting her to appear as Guinan during the second season of \",\" which she ultimately did.\nFilms.\nThe decision was made to feature Goldberg prominently in the first feature film based on \"The Next Generation\", \"Star Trek Generations\". This was due in part to her being far more well known to the general public than the majority of the main cast, having won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 for her role in the film \"Ghost\". During the course of the film, the character is revealed to be an El-Aurian for the first time. Upon arriving on the first day of production of \"Generations\", Goldberg began looking around the set for Nichols, having expected her to be there since it was a cross-over film between \"The Original Series\" and \"The Next Generation\". It was later reported by Walter Koenig that Goldberg was annoyed as she saw that the fans wanted a scene with Guinan and Uhura together. Nichols did not appear in \"Generations\".\nProduction.\nProducer Rick Berman was noted as being \"extremely sensitive\" about who interacted with Goldberg on the set, according to the book \"The Making of Yesterday's Enterprise\" by Eric A. Stillwell. In one instance where a co-writer of \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" talked with Goldberg, Berman found out about it and said he did not want this kind of interaction which was oriented towards the production office.\nAppearances.\nIn \"Rascals\", Guinan's younger self is played by Isis Carmen Jones, who also played Goldberg's character as a child in the film \"Sister Act\" (1992). Guinan works in Ten-Forward and often appears in episodes to converse with characters to help them resolve their issue at hand. She most commonly interacts with long-time friend Picard, but is known to help others as well. \nGuinan made her first appearance in the opening episode \"\" on November 21, 1988, on first-run syndicated television. During the course of the episode, she gives advice to Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) about whether he should leave the ship to join his mother when she transferred to Starfleet Medical on Earth. In this episode, she refers to meeting Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) for the first time when she came on board the \"Enterprise\"-D, something which was later ignored and discounted. She made further appearances in the second season, including in \"The Outrageous Okona\" where she advises Data to use the holodeck to help him better understand comedy, and again in the Data-centric episode \", as well as \" where she and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) attempt to explain flirting to Wesley Crusher.\nThe first revelation of Guinan being something more than a simple barkeeper came later that season in the episode \"Q Who\". After Q (John de Lancie) sends the \"Enterprise\"-D across the galaxy, causing them to encounter the Borg, she trades barbs with the omnipotent being who reveals that he knows Guinan from past encounters and suggests she may have been known by other names in the past. Q attempts to remove Guinan from the Enterprise, only to have her hold up her hands to him in response implying she possessed the power to do battle with him or at the very least to defend herself. She also informs Picard that the Borg drove her species into near extinction over a century earlier. She returned once more in the second episode of the , \", in which she explains she has many children, and later in the season in \" where she reveals that she finds the heads of bald men attractive. She once again comes face to face with Q in \"Deja Q\". Guinan is central to the plot of \"Yesterday's Enterprise\", when the timeline is changed after the USS \"Enterprise\"-C appears from a spatial rift. Guinan is the only member of the crew who is aware that something has changed, and believes that Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) should not be on the ship. The timeline is restored when the \"Enterprise\"-C re-enters the rift.\nGuinan appears in part one of \"\", where she and Captain Picard mull over his tactics defending the ship from a Borg vessel, contemplating the potential end of human civilization.

His list of moments consisted of the one in \"The Measure of a Man\" where Guinan explains slavery to Picard; the time that she stabbed Q with a fork in \"Deja Q\"; the discussion she has with Commander Riker in \"The Best of Both Worlds\" and her lack of sympathy for the Borg in \"I, Borg\". Morgan did state that her favourite moment came in the second part of \"Time's Arrow\" where she and Picard are trapped in the cave and the sexual tension between the pair, comparing the relationship between that of River Song and The Doctor in \"Doctor Who\" whereby they meet each other for the first time but out of sequence.\nTerry Erdmann and Paula Block state in their 2008 book \"Star Trek 101\" that the key Guinan episode is \"Yesterday's Enterprise\".

In 2017, IndieWire rated Guinan as the third-best character on \"The Next Generation\", noting her as a \"fascinating character\". In the summer of 2019, \"Screen Rant\" suggested that Guinan could get her own series more easily, due to the character being hundreds of years old there would be many, many stories to tell. In 2018, CBR ranked Guinan the 8th best recurring character of all \"Star Trek\".\nIn 2018, \"Screen Rant\" ranked Guinan as one of the top eight most powerful characters of \"Star Trek\", remarking \"Guinan is one of \"Star Trek\"'s greatest enigmas.\" In July 2019, \"Screen Rant\" ranked Guinan the 7th smartest character of \"Star Trek\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60911", "revid": "736168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60911", "title": "Press Your Luck", "text": "American game show\nPress Your Luck is an American television game show created by Bill Carruthers and Jan McCormack. Contestants answer trivia questions to earn \"spins\" on a randomly cycling game board. The board's spaces display cash, prizes, extra spins, special items, or the show's mascot, a cartoon creature known as the Whammy. Landing on a Whammy eliminates any cash and prizes accumulated while also displaying a short comedic animation. Its format is a revival of an earlier Carruthers production, \"Second Chance\", which was hosted by Jim Peck and aired on ABC in 1977. The original version of \"Press Your Luck\" aired on CBS between 1983 and 1986. This version featured Peter Tomarken as host, Rod Roddy as announcer, and Carruthers as both director and voice of the Whammy. The original incarnation of the show gained significant media attention in 1984 for contestant Michael Larson, who won over $100,000 after memorizing the original pattern of the game board.\nFollowing the show's cancellation by CBS in 1986, it aired frequently in reruns, first on USA Network and then on Game Show Network. \"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\", a revival of the series, aired from 2002 to 2003 also on Game Show Network with Todd Newton as host and Gary Kroeger as announcer. A weekly primetime version (reverting to the name \"Press Your Luck\") began airing on ABC in 2019, with Elizabeth Banks as host. Neil Ross served as both announcer and voice of the Whammy until 2023, when he was replaced in both capacities by Chris Ahearn (also of \"Let's Make a Deal\"). Adaptations of \"Press Your Luck\" have also aired in other countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany, while an adaptation of \"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\" also aired in the Philippines. The show has also been adapted into a number of video games for computers and video game consoles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGameplay.\nThree contestants compete on each episode. Gameplay consists of four rounds: two question rounds and two \"big board\" rounds.\nIn a question round, contestants earn spins by correctly answering a series of trivia questions asked by the host. Each question is initially presented as a toss-up open to all; after a contestant buzzes in and answers, the host reads that response and two more to the opponents as a multiple choice selection. Contestants earn three spins for buzzing in and giving the correct answer, and one for choosing it from the three options. If no one buzzes in, the host reads three answers and each contestant can earn one spin by choosing the correct one. There is no penalty for an incorrect answer at any time. However, if a contestant buzzes in and fails to respond, they are frozen out of the question and the host reads three answers to the opponents.\nAfter the question round is completed, the \"big board\" round begins, with the contestants using their accumulated spins in an attempt to win cash and prizes. The game board consists of 18 spaces laid out in a rectangular loop that is six spaces wide and five high. Each space cycles through two or more items, which can include cash amounts (sometimes with an extra spin), prizes, spaces which offer a change in direction or alteration to score, and the show's mascot, a mischievous red cartoon creature known as the Whammy. A light randomly flashes around the board, encircling one space at a time, and the contestant in control uses a spin by hitting their buzzer to freeze the board and collect whatever is lit at that moment. Landing on a cash or prize space adds its value to the contestant's total, while landing on a Whammy resets the total to zero and plays a short animation involving the Whammy for the viewing audience. Any contestant who lands on the Whammy a total of four times (known as \"Whammying out\") is immediately eliminated from the game and forfeits all remaining spins. When a prize is hit, a new one is put on the board to replace it.\nSpecialty spaces on the board include:\nExcept for Money or Lose a Whammy, Big Bucks and Pick a Corner (original and revival), all of these spaces are removed from play after being hit once.\nFor the first \"big board\" round, initial control is awarded to the contestant who has earned the fewest spins in the question round (or is seated farthest away from the host in the event of a tie). If the contestant in control has any spins remaining after stopping the board, they may choose to either spin again or pass those spins to the opponent with the higher score (or the opponent of that contestant's choice in the event of a tie). Passed spins must be played by their recipient, but are converted to earned spins in the event of hitting a Whammy. Play during the \"big board\" round ends when all accumulated spins have been exhausted or forfeited.\nThe second half of the game also consists of a question round followed by a \"big board\" round. Initial control for the latter is given to the contestant with the lowest score, and the cash and prize values are higher than in the first round. Once all spins have been exhausted, the contestant with the highest score becomes the champion and keeps everything they have accumulated, while the other two receive parting gifts. The 1983 version of the program allowed the champion to return for the next day's episode; champions retired after appearing on five consecutive episodes or reaching/exceeding CBS's winnings limit (originally $15,000 before being raised to $25,000, then $50,000, later $75,000 and finally raised to the highest total of $100,000), whichever came first. The 2019 version does not feature returning champions, but allows the day's champion to play a bonus game.\nIf two contestants Whammy out and the third one has any spins remaining, that contestant may play one spin at a time and stop at any point if desired. The game ends when the remaining contestant uses up all spins, chooses to stop voluntarily, or hits a fourth Whammy.\nBonus game.\nThe 2019 revival features a bonus game not present in the original, in which the day's champion plays the \"big board\" for a chance to win up to $1,000,000. The champion plays through five rounds, taking a set number of spins in each round: five in the first, four in the second, and three in all others. The board displays cash, prizes, directional/specialty spaces, and Whammys as in the main game, and cash/prize values increase from one round to the next. Some prizes are tailored to the champion's particular interests. Landing on a Whammy eliminates all winnings within the bonus round, but main-game winnings are not affected. If the champion ends a round with a bank total greater than zero, they may either end the bonus game at that point and keep all winnings, or continue into the next round with any personalized prizes lost to a Whammy being returned to the board. The game ends immediately upon collecting a fourth Whammy. The champion wins the entire bank for completing all rounds; however, if the bank reaches or exceeds $500,000 at any point, the game ends and cash is added to increase the bank to $1,000,000. Beginning in Season 4, a \"Prize-a-Palooza\" space appears on the board during the final round, awarding every currently displayed prize if hit.\nHistory.\n\"Press Your Luck\" is a revival of an earlier game show format created by producer Bill Carruthers, known as \"Second Chance\". This show was hosted by Jim Peck and aired on ABC in 1977. Like \"Press Your Luck\", it also featured contestants answering trivia questions to assume control of a board with cash and prizes. This game board also featured spaces labeled with a devil, who would take away all cash and prizes if the contestant landed on one. Carruthers and Jan McCormack began developing \"Press Your Luck\" in 1983.\nPeter Tomarken, prior to working in television, was an editor for \"Women's Wear Daily\" magazine. His first major television role came earlier in 1983 on the NBC game show \"Hit Man\", and he was chosen to host \"Press Your Luck\" after the former was canceled. \"Press Your Luck\" began both tapings and airings in September 1983. The show premiered on September 19, 1983, on CBS at 10:30a.m. ET (9:30 CT/MT/PT), replacing \"Child's Play\". Serving as announcer on the show was Rod Roddy, with whom Tomarken had previously worked on \"Hit Man\", and who later became known for announcing on \"The Price Is Right\". John Harlan and Charlie O'Donnell filled in on a few episodes when Roddy was unavailable. In addition to creating the show, Carruthers served as both director and the voice of the Whammy. The animations featuring this character were created by animator Savage Steve Holland; Carruthers personally selected Holland to design the character and immediately liked Holland's first concept, which Holland had sketched out on a napkin. Holland animated the character via computer software, thus making \"Press Your Luck\" one of the first game shows to use computer-designed graphics. Author David Baber noted that the Whammy animations were \"popular with the viewers\". Some of the animations featured the Whammy taunting the contestant and becoming injured or harmed in a manner which Baber compared to a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. Others featured satires of then-contemporary pop culture figures such as Boy George or Tina Turner. Ed Flesh designed the show's set, and Lee Ringuette composed the show's music.\nOn January 6, 1986, CBS moved \"Press Your Luck\" to a different timeslot in order to make room for a Bob Eubanks-hosted revival of \"Card Sharks\". \"Press Your Luck\" replaced \"Body Language\" in the network's 4:00p.m. afternoon time slot. Tomarken stated that by the end of 1985, the contract for \"The Price Is Right\" was up for renewal, but CBS was unable to pay Mark Goodson Productions the kind of money they wanted to continue that show on their network. Goodson came up with the solution of taking over the 10:30a.m. timeslot. The last episode of the CBS version aired on September 26, 1986. The final tapings took place in August of that same year, when its cancellation was first announced. Following the cancellation, Tomarken went on to host other game shows including the syndicated show \"Wipeout\" in 1988-89, as well as a number of infomercials. He and his wife both died in 2006 when a private plane he was piloting crashed in Santa Monica Bay.\nMichael Larson.\n\"Press Your Luck\" gained media attention in 1984 for the winnings of a contestant named Michael Larson. A self-described unemployed ice cream truck driver from Lebanon, Ohio, he applied to be on the show that year. By recording episodes at home on a videocassette recorder and playing them back frame-by-frame, Larson discovered that the presumed random patterns of the game board were not actually random and he was able to memorize the sequences. On the single game in which he appeared, an initially tentative Larson spun a Whammy on his very first turn, but then went 45 consecutive spins without hitting another one. The majority of his spins landed on the highest-valued spaces, which offered $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000, all with an extra spin. The game ran for so long that CBS aired the episode in two parts, on June 8 and 11, 1984. In the end, Larson earned a total of $110,237 in cash and prizes.\nAfter an investigation, CBS executives concluded that Larson's memorization of the board patterns did not constitute cheating and allowed him to keep his winnings. The board was then reprogrammed with over 30 new patterns to prevent subsequent contestants from duplicating his feat. In 1994, \"TV Guide\" magazine interviewed Larson and revealed the background of this episode including his decision to pass his remaining spins after he lost concentration and missed his target squares. The story was featured in a two-hour documentary on Game Show Network titled \"Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal\" in March 2003, which Tomarken hosted. In July 2010, Michael's brother James, and his former wife at the time of winning, were interviewed for PRI's \"This American Life\" for the episode \"Million Dollar Idea\". His story was also featured on the first episode of Game Show Network's documentary series \"Cover Story\" in 2018.\nPaul Walter Hauser played Larson in the 2024 film \"The Luckiest Man in America\".\nRebroadcasts, syndication, and digital television networks.\nIn early 1987, 130 episodes of the show were packaged by Republic Pictures for off-network syndication to a handful of local stations. These episodes originally aired on CBS from February 25 to August 23, 1985, and were also the first to be shown on USA Network from September 14, 1987 to December 30, 1988. \"Press Your Luck\" remained on its schedule until October 13, 1995, when USA dropped its game show block altogether.\nGame Show Network aired the show from September 2001 to March 2009, airing episodes from February 1984 to November 1985. Game Show Network resumed airing the show in 2012, airing episodes from the September 1983 premiere to February 1984. From 2014 to 2016, Game Show Network aired episodes 561 to 696, which originally ran from November 1985 to May 1986; after this, Game Show Network aired episodes from 1984 to February 1985 until the show was removed from Game Show Network's schedule again in May 2017. From December 2017 to February 2018, Game Show Network aired episodes from 1984 as part of a Saturday night game show block. On July 2, 2018, reruns of \"Press Your Luck\" started airing on GameTV in Canada. Reruns of Press Your Luck are currently airing in the U.S. on Buzzr.\n\"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\".\nOn April 15, 2002, Game Show Network debuted a revival titled \"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\" (sometimes abbreviated to just \"Whammy!\"), with Todd Newton as host and Gary Kroeger as announcer, although Tomarken hosted a pilot episode. This incarnation of the show featured similar gameplay to the original, and was described by Game Show Network executives as being a modern incarnation of the show. One feature unique to this revival was the addition of a \"Double Whammy\", which would not only remove all cash and prizes accumulated by the contestant, but also subject the contestant to a physical stunt such as having objects drop from the ceiling. \"Whammy!\" aired in first-run from April 2002 to December 2003.\n2019 revival.\nOn February 21, 2019, a casting announcement was released by Fremantle for a new version of \"Press Your Luck\", advertising opportunities for potential contestants to apply. ABC confirmed in early 2019 that the network was partnering with Fremantle to reboot the series, with pre-production on new hour-long episodes of \"Press Your Luck\" and \"Card Sharks\" already underway and taping slated to begin sometime in the first portion of the year. John Quinn (a producer on \"Celebrity Name Game\") is the executive producer. Actress Elizabeth Banks was selected to host. Neil Ross was the announcer and the voice of the Whammy for the first four seasons of the ABC version, with Chris Ahearn (also known as the \"Money Fairy\" on the current version of \"Let's Make a Deal\") assuming both roles beginning in season five, while the Whammy animations featuring Ross continue to be used.\nThe series premiered on June 12, 2019 following an early premiere the day before. The first season featured eight weekly hour-long episodes. ABC confirmed in mid-2023 that, despite the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, the show's fifth season would premiere in late 2023 as intended. A sixth season was announced in May 2024, which premiered on July 18. On April 30, 2025, it was announced that new episodes from the sixth season would premiere on July 10, 2025.\nInternational versions.\nSince its inception, \"Press Your Luck\" has also been adapted internationally. An Australian version, with Ian Turpie as host and John Deeks as announcer, aired on Seven Network from 1987 to 1988. Grundy Worldwide packaged this version, with Bill Mason as executive producer. A German version entitled \"\" (\"Good Luck on the Trigger\") aired on RTLplus in 1992 with Al Munteanu as host. It had an animated vulture named \"Raffi\" steal cash and prizes from contestants instead of Whammys. Another remake, \"Dr\u00fcck Dein Gl\u00fcck\" (\"Push Your Luck\"), aired daily in 1999 on RTL II with Guido Kellerman as host; this show's mascot was an animated shark. In the United Kingdom, an ITV version ran in the HTV West region, with Paul Coia as host. \"Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck\" was also adapted in the Philippines as \"Whammy! Push Your Luck\" on GMA Network from 2007 to 2008. It was hosted by Paolo Bediones and Rufa Mae Quinto.\nMerchandise.\nIn 1988, GameTek released a home computer game of \"Press Your Luck\" for IBM PC compatibles and the Commodore 64. Ludia Inc. (now part of RTL Group, which owns the show franchise) along with Ubisoft released an adaptation called \"Press Your Luck: 2010 Edition\" on October 27, 2009 for PC, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Nintendo DS, and Wii. Prior to this, on August 24, 2010, the game was released for the PlayStation 3 (via PSN) as part of the \"Game Show Party\" bundle pack (PS3 only) that also included \"Family Feud: 2010 Edition\" and \"The Price Is Right: 2010 Edition\", and on PlayStation 3's PSN download service from August 24, 2010.\nA video game adaption of the show titled \"Press Your Luck 2010 Edition\" was released in the U.S. on multiple home consoles and with a PC version. Actor Terry McGovern is the off-screen host. In January 2012, an app developed by former Fremantle subsidiary Ludia and based on \"Press Your Luck\" debuted on Facebook. Ten contestants compete in a single-question round together, all answering the same multiple-choice questions. There are six questions in total, each worth between $500 and $1,000, or a Whammy. A correct answer earns the question's value multiplied by the number of contestants who answered incorrectly or ran out of time (e.g., answering the $500 question correctly with three other contestants answering incorrectly earns $1,500). Bonus cash is given to the three contestants who answer the questions correctly in the shortest amount of time. Answering the Whammy question incorrectly causes the contestant to lose any money accumulated to that point. In September 2012, Ludia released \"Press Your Luck Slots\" on Facebook.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Q is the head of Q Branch (later Q Division), the fictional research and development division of the British Secret Service charged with oversight of top secret field technologies.\nQ (standing for quartermaster), like M, is a job title rather than a name. The use of letters as pseudonyms for senior officers in the British Secret Service was started by its first director, Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming (1859\u20131923), who signed himself with a C written in green ink.\nQ has appeared in 22 of the 25 Eon Productions James Bond films, the exceptions being \"Live and Let Die\" (1973), \"Casino Royale\" (2006) and \"Quantum of Solace\" (2008). Q also featured in both non-Eon Bond films, \"Casino Royale\" (1967) and \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983). Between 1963 and 1999, Q was portrayed in the Eon films by Desmond Llewelyn until his death in late 1999. His successor, initially given the joking nickname of \u201cR\u201c by Bond, was played by John Cleese. In the Daniel Craig films, which rebooted the continuity to some extent, Q was played by Ben Whishaw, but it is unclear whether he is meant to be Major Boothroyd or a new character.\nNovels.\nThe character Q never appears in the novels by the author Ian Fleming, where Q and the Q Branch are only mentioned; however, Q does appear in the novelisations by Christopher Wood as well as the later novels by John Gardner and Raymond Benson, who adopted Eon's decision to combine the character with Major Boothroyd, the armourer from \"Dr. No\".\nIn John Gardner's novels, the post of Q is taken over by Ann Reilly (called Q'ute by her colleagues). She also forms a relationship with James Bond. It is supposed that she held the post for a short while only, because Raymond Benson's novels return Boothroyd to the post without explanation. Jeffrey Deaver's \"Carte Blanche\" introduces the character Sanu Hirani, who is referred to as 'Q' in that novel.\nCharles Fraser-Smith is widely credited as the inspiration for Q due to the spy gadgets he built for the Special Operations Executive. These were called Q-devices, after the Royal Navy's World War I Q-ships. In the Fleming novels there are frequent references to Q and Q Branch with phrases like \"see Q for any equipment you need\" (\"Casino Royale\") and \"Q Branch would handle all of that\" (\"Diamonds Are Forever\"), with a reference to \"Q's craftsmen\" in \"From Russia, with Love\".\nMajor Boothroyd.\nIn the sixth novel, \"Dr. No\", the service armourer Major Boothroyd appears for the first time. Fleming named the character after Geoffrey Boothroyd, a firearms expert who lived in Glasgow, who had written to the novelist suggesting that Bond was not using the best firearms available.\nAnn Reilly.\nBoothroyd is also referenced occasionally in the Bond novels of John Gardner, but the author preferred instead to focus on a new character, Ann Reilly, who is introduced in the first Gardner novel, \"Licence Renewed\", and promptly dubbed \"Q'ute\" by Bond.\nKim Sherwood novels.\nQ is a quantum computer in the \"Double 00 Trilogy\" by Kim Sherwood.\nFilms.\nMajor Boothroyd appears in \"Dr. No\" played by Peter Burton and in the script of \"From Russia with Love\". Desmond Llewelyn stated that, although he was credited as playing \"Major Boothroyd\" in the latter film, his name as said by M (Bernard Lee) was replaced with \"the equipment officer\", as director Terence Young stated that Boothroyd was a different character.\nBeginning in Guy Hamilton's \"Goldfinger\" and in each film thereafter Major Boothroyd is most often referred to as Q; however, in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977) he is referred to once again as Major Boothroyd in dialogue.\nIn most films in which Q appears, he is restricted to a \"behind the scenes\" involvement, either based in London or in secret bases out in the field. Two notable exceptions in which Q becomes directly involved in Bond's missions occur in \"Octopussy\", in which Q actually participates in field work\u2014including the final battle against the villain Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan)'s henchmen\u2014and \"Licence to Kill\" in which he joins Bond (Timothy Dalton) in the field after 007 goes rogue.\nEon Productions.\nPeter Burton: 1962 (as \"Major Boothroyd\").\nIn the first film, \"Dr. No\", Boothroyd is played by Peter Burton in only one scene, in which he replaces Bond (Sean Connery)'s .25 ACP Beretta 418 (on-screen portrayed by a .32 Beretta 35) pistol with the signature .32 Walther PPK handgun. He is referred to by M as \"the armourer,\" and later as Major Boothroyd. Scheduling conflicts prevented Burton from reprising the role in \"From Russia with Love\", although he made two later uncredited appearances in Bond films, first as an RAF officer in \"Thunderball\" (1965) and later as a secret agent in the satirical \"Casino Royale\" (1967).\nDesmond Llewelyn: 1963\u20131999.\nBeginning with \"From Russia with Love\", Desmond Llewelyn portrayed the character in every official film except \"Live and Let Die\" until his death in 1999. In the 1977 film \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", as Q delivered the submersible Lotus, Major Anya Amasova / Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) greets Q as \"Major Boothroyd\".\nStarting with \"Goldfinger\", the notion that Bond and Q would have an often strained relationship with each other was introduced by Guy Hamilton; it continued in the series thereafter. While briefing Bond on the gadgets that he is going to use on his mission, Q often expresses irritation and impatience at Bond's short attention span, often telling him to \"pay attention, 007\", and Bond's playful lack of respect for his equipment, telling the agent, \"I \"never\" joke about my work, 007\". In \"Thunderball\", Bond can be heard muttering \"Oh no\" when Q joins him in the Bahamas. A running gag appeared in later films where Q's prized gadget would be destroyed in a mishap often caused by necessity or Bond's recklessness \u2013 examples include the Glastron jet boat in \"Moonraker\" when Bond (Roger Moore) sends it over the Iguazu Falls to escape pursuit by Jaws (Richard Kiel), the Aston Martin Vantage in \"The Living Daylights\" when Bond (Timothy Dalton) is forced to prime its self-destruct device in order to evade the Czech police forces, and the BMW Z8 in \"The World Is Not Enough\" \u2013 which is cut in half by a helicopter buzz-saw.\nHowever, on occasion, Q has shown a warm and fatherly concern for 007's welfare, such as at Bond (George Lazenby)'s wedding to Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", when he assures Bond that he is available if Bond ever requires his help. Q has also assisted Bond in a more active role in his missions in \"Octopussy\", remaining to aid Bond in person even after another ally Vijay (Vijay Amritaj) is killed, and \"Licence to Kill\" saw him travel to assist Bond while he is officially on leave from MI6 even after Bond has resigned from MI6 to pursue his own vendetta. He frequently refers to Bond as \"007\", rather than by his name. In \"GoldenEye\", Q shares a joke with Bond (Pierce Brosnan) for the first time, and in \"The World Is Not Enough\" Bond is saddened at the prospect of Q's impending retirement. Q signs off with \"Now pay attention, 007,\" and then offers some words of advice:\nQ: \"I've always tried to teach you two things: First, never let them see you bleed.\"\nBond: \"And the second?\"Q: \"Always have an escape plan.\"\u00a0\u2013 before he is lowered out of view.\nThis was the final film appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q in the James Bond series, although he would revive the role once again as Q in a Heineken commercial, a TV cross-promotion for \"The World Is Not Enough\". Llewelyn died in a car crash just weeks after the film's release. Between films he also starred as Q in various commercials for a diversity of products and companies. These included Bond collectable merchandise, Hyundai motorcars, LG video recorders, Highland Superstores, Visa credit cards, and Reach electric toothbrushes, the latter of which featured Q briefing himself in the mirror.\nFeatured in\nFilms:\nVideo games:\nLlewelyn also portrays Q in the Eon Productions-produced 1967 TV special \"Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond\", as well as portraying Q in the documentary \"Highly Classified: The World of 007\", which is included on the \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" Ultimate Edition DVD. Llewelyn's likeness was also used to portray the Q character in 2005's video game \"James Bond 007: From Russia with Love\", though the voice of Q was portrayed by Phil Proctor. Llewelyn has appeared in more Bond films \u2014 seventeen \u2014 than any other actor to date.\nJohn Cleese: 1999 (as \"R\"), 2002 (as Q).\nIn \"The World Is Not Enough\" an assistant to Q was introduced, played by John Cleese. His real name was never revealed, but he was initially credited as \"R\" in \"The World Is Not Enough\", stemming from a joke in which Bond asks the elder Q, \"If you're Q, does that make him R?\"\nBetween films, Cleese was still referred to as \"R\" in the video games ' (2000), \"007 Racing\" (2000) and \"Agent Under Fire\" (2001). He was officially referred to as \"Q\" in \"Die Another Day\" (2002) following Llewelyn's death in 1999. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game '.\nMuch like his predecessor, R is a consummate professional who is frequently annoyed by Bond's cavalier attitude. In \"Die Another Day\", Bond at first refers to R as \"Quartermaster\" but, silently impressed by the gadgets he is given, calls him \"Q\" at the end of their meeting. (The \"Die Another Day\" DVD reveals that Bond initially saw R as an 'interloper', only awarding the proper title of 'Q' after R has proven himself.)\nAccording to an interview on the \"Die Another Day\" DVD, Pierce Brosnan was very glad to rename Cleese's character 'Q', rather than 'R', because his native Irish accent made it difficult to pronounce 'R' with a convincing English accent.\nIn the 007 video game, \"James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing\", Cleese's Q has an assistant, Miss Nagai, portrayed by Misaki Ito.\nFeatured in\nFilms:\nVideo games;\nBen Whishaw: 2012\u2013present.\nThe character of Q did not appear in 2006's \"Casino Royale\" or its sequel, \"Quantum of Solace\" (2008). Bond actor Daniel Craig expressed concern over the character's absence, and expressed his hope that Q would return in \"Skyfall\". In November 2011, it was announced that British actor Ben Whishaw had been cast in the role. Bond first meets Q in front of the painting \"The Fighting Temeraire\" at the National Gallery in London, where he at first expresses disbelief at the relative youth of his new quartermaster, but the two quickly earn each other's respect. In \"Skyfall\", Q's gadgets were comparatively simple, consisting of a miniaturized radio and a gun coded to Bond's palmprint so only Bond can fire it. When Bond appears disappointed, Q says, \"Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that anymore,\" in reference to a miniature grenade featured in \"GoldenEye\". Q is demonstrated to be highly knowledgeable on the subject of computer security to the point where he designed some of the most sophisticated security protocols in existence. As with Llewelyn's Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond's knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets \u2013 at the end of \"Skyfall\" the Aston Martin DB5 is burned out in the final showdown with Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem).\nIn \"Spectre\", Q injects Bond with \"smart blood\" which will allow MI6 to track him at all times. He then shows off an Aston Martin DB10 to Bond only to disappoint him by revealing it was reassigned to 009. He provides Bond with a new watch, while hinting the alarm is \"rather loud\" (eventually revealed to be explosive in the film's climax). He also oversees the restoration of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 after the events of \"Skyfall\". Bond asks Q to help him disappear during his downtime; despite initial reluctance, Q agrees and helps Bond. Bond later steals (and ultimately destroys) the DB10, much to Q's dismay, although he still covers for him when M (Ralph Fiennes) asks Q where Bond has gone. Similar to Q's assistance to Bond in 1989's \"Licence to Kill\", Q travels to Austria to help him in the field independent of MI6. While there, he outruns SPECTRE agents after a ring he eventually decodes, revealing the organisation's existence. Q returns to London to assist Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and M in foiling corrupt MI6 bureaucrat Max Denbeigh (Andrew Scott)'s launch of the Nine Eyes intelligence network. At the end he provides Bond with his remodeled Aston Martin DB5.\nIn \"No Time to Die\", it is implied that Q is gay when Bond and Moneypenny interrupt him preparing a romantic dinner for another man. He provides Bond and 00 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch) with a watch that generates an electromagnetic pulse and a portable radar mapping device, and instructs them on how to operate the \"stealthy bird\", a small submersible jet aircraft, before they infiltrate villain Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek)'s hideout. Q keeps in contact with Bond during the mission, and patches him through to his love interest Madeleine Swann (L\u00e9a Seydoux) after he decides to sacrifice his life to keep Swann and their daughter Mathilde safe. Q later joins M, Moneypenny, Nomi, and Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear) in a toast to Bond's memory at the end of the film.\nFeatured in\nNon-Eon films.\nGeoffrey Bayldon: 1967.\nIn the 1967 version of \"Casino Royale\", Q is portrayed by Geoffrey Bayldon, but instead of outfitting James Bond, he provides gadgets for Evelyn Tremble (who is portrayed by Peter Sellers). In the film, Q is assisted by Fordyce (John Wells). The sequence parodies the regular series' outfitting, and features Q presenting Tremble with an elaborate bullet-proof vest, laden with preposterous features (\"a Beretta in the buttonhole, and a cute little mini-gun in the gusset\").\nFeatured in\nAlec McCowen: 1983.\nIn the 1983 film \"Never Say Never Again\", Bond received his gadgets from a man (played by Alec McCowen) he referred to as Algernon and Algy. His opening line is \"Nice to know old Q can still surprise you 00s\". In sharp contrast to the personality of Q in Eon film series, Algy hopes to hear about \"lots of sex and violence\" from James Bond following his mission. In the closing credits, he is named as \"Q\" Algy. Q Branch itself is depicted as underfunded and ramshackle compared to the high-tech surroundings of the Eon films.\nFeatured in\nLegacy.\nThe real MI6's head of technology is one of the agency's four directors-general, reporting directly to Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. While the Chief of SIS is called \"C\" and not \"M\", the head of technology is named \"Q\" after the Bond character, and the department's ethos is known as \"Q culture\".\nAston Martin refers to their in-house customisation service for the most demanding clients as \"Q Branch\" in reference to James Bonds iconic connection to the brand.\nIn June 2025, it was announced that Blaise Metreweli, currently the real-life Director-General of Technology and Innovation (\"Q\") at MI6, will become the Chief of the SIS (\"C\") in autumn 2025. She will become the first female head of the service.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an individual action stimulates the performance of a succeeding action by the same or different agent. Agents that respond to traces in the environment receive positive fitness benefits, reinforcing the likelihood of these behaviors becoming fixed within a population over time.\nStigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who may lack memory or individual awareness of each other.\nHistory.\nThe term \"stigmergy\" was introduced by French biologist Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 in 1959 to refer to termite behavior. He defined it as: \"Stimulation of workers by the performance they have achieved.\" It is derived from the Greek words \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \"stigma\" \"mark, sign\" and \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \"ergon\" \"work, action\", and captures the notion that an agent\u2019s actions leave signs in the environment, signs that it and other agents sense and that determine and incite their subsequent actions.\nLater on, a distinction was made between the stigmergic phenomenon, which is specific to the guidance of additional work, and the more general, non-work specific incitation, for which the term \"sematectonic\" communication was coined by E. O. Wilson, from the Greek words \u03c3\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1 \"sema\" \"sign, token\", and \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \"tecton\" \"craftsman, builder\": \"There is a need for a more general, somewhat less clumsy expression to denote the evocation of any form of behavior or physiological change by the evidences of work performed by other animals, including the special case of the guidance of additional work.\"\nStigmergy is now one of the key concepts in the field of swarm intelligence.\nStigmergic behavior in non-human organisms.\nStigmergy was first observed in social insects. For example, ants exchange information by laying down pheromones (the trace) on their way back to the nest when they have found food. In that way, they collectively develop a complex network of trails, connecting the nest in an efficient way to various food sources. When ants come out of the nest searching for food, they are stimulated by the pheromone to follow the trail towards the food source. The network of trails functions as a shared external memory for the ant colony.\nIn computer science, this general method has been applied in a variety of techniques called ant colony optimization, which search for solutions to complex problems by depositing \"virtual pheromones\" along paths that appear promising. In the field of artificial neural networks, stigmergy can be used as a computational memory. Federico Galatolo showed that a stigmergic memory can achieve the same performances of more complex and well established neural networks architectures like LSTM.\nOther eusocial creatures, such as termites, use pheromones to build their complex nests by following a simple decentralized rule set. Each insect scoops up a 'mudball' or similar material from its environment, infuses the ball with pheromones, and deposits it on the ground, initially in a random spot. However, termites are attracted to their nestmates' pheromones and are therefore more likely to drop their own mudballs on top of their neighbors'. The larger the heap of mud becomes, the more attractive it is, and therefore the more mud will be added to it (positive feedback). Over time this leads to the construction of pillars, arches, tunnels and chambers.\nStigmergy has been observed in bacteria, various species of which differentiate into distinct cell types and which participate in group behaviors that are guided by sophisticated temporal and spatial control systems. Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the myxobacteria. Myxobacteria travel in \"swarms\" containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Most myxobacteria are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into \"fruiting bodies\", within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls. The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the cellular slime molds. The best known of the myxobacteria, \"Myxococcus xanthus\" and \"Stigmatella aurantiaca\", are studied in various laboratories as prokaryotic models of development.\nAnalysis of human behavior.\nStigmergy studied in eusocial creatures and physical systems, has been proposed as a model of analyzing some robotics systems, multi-agent systems, communication in computer networks, and online communities.\nOn the Internet there are many collective projects where users interact only by modifying local parts of their shared virtual environment. Wikipedia is an example of this. The massive structure of information available in a wiki, or an open source software project such as the FreeBSD kernel could be compared to a termite nest; one initial user leaves a seed of an idea (a mudball) which attracts other users who then build upon and modify this initial concept, eventually constructing an elaborate structure of connected thoughts.\nIn addition the concept of stigmergy has also been used to describe how cooperative work such as building design may be integrated. Designing a large contemporary building involves a large and diverse network of actors (e.g. architects, building engineers, static engineers, building services engineers). Their distributed activities may be partly integrated through practices of stigmergy.\nAnalysis of human social movements.\nThe rise of open source software in the 21st century has disrupted the business models of some proprietary software providers, and open content projects like Wikipedia have threatened the business models of companies like \"Britannica\". Researchers have studied collaborative open source projects, arguing they provide insights into the emergence of large-scale peer production and the growth of gift economy.\nStigmergic society.\nHeather Marsh, associated with the Occupy Movement, Wikileaks, and Anonymous, has proposed a new social system where competition as a driving force would be replaced with a more collaborative society. This proposed society would not use representative democracy but new forms of idea and action based governance and collaborative methods including stigmergy. \"With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project.\"\nSome at the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement in 2014 were quoted recommending stigmergy as a way forward.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Barker", "text": "Linguist, scholar, author and game designer (1929\u20132012)\nMuhammad Abd-al-Rahman Barker (born Phillip Barker; November 2, 1929\u00a0\u2013 March 16, 2012) was an American linguist who was professor of Urdu and South Asian Studies and created one of the first roleplaying games, \"Empire of the Petal Throne\". He wrote several fantasy/science fantasy novels based in his associated world setting of T\u00e9kumel.\nBetween 1990 and 2002, he was a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the \"Journal of Historical Review\", which advocated Holocaust denial. In 1991 he published a neo-Nazi novel, \"Serpent's Walk\", under the pseudonym Randolph D. Calverhall.\nEarly life.\nBarker was born Phillip Barker in Spokane, Washington, on November 2, 1929. Barker's childhood was spent in Idaho. He grew up with an interest in science fiction, fantasy, and ancient Egyptian and ancient Mayan cultures. At the age of 10, he first imagined what was later to become his fantasy setting of T\u00e9kumel.\nAcademic life and creative networking.\nBarker began studying linguistics and culture at the University of Washington. In and just before 1950, while Barker was studying at the University of Washington under Melville Jacobs, he became involved with science fiction fanzines, writing articles, short stories and contributing reviews to Portland-based \"Fanscient\" and to the local clubzine \"Sinisterra\", the latter of which contained his review of, and content from, Jack Vance relating to his recently published book, \"The Dying Earth\". \nHe graduated from the University of Washington in 1951. That year, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study the languages of India, and on his first trip to India, converted to Islam. Gary Fine wrote that Barker would attribute his conversion to \"purely theological reasons [and that] it seemed like a more logical religion\", though Barker himself admitted at the time to an \"[unimaginable] feeling of awe and religious ecstasy\" upon hearing the recitations of the 99 Names of Allah at the Taj Mahal. While in India, he studied at the University of Lucknow.\nLater academic studies and career.\nBarker attended the University of California, Berkeley for graduate studies, writing a dissertation on Klamath language, collecting traditional myths, legends, tales, and oral histories and later publishing a grammar and dictionary on the language.\nHe taught at the Institute of Islamic Studies at McGill University from around 1958/59 until 1972 and became active in the development of Urdu and Baluchi instruction materials for English-speaking students following a period of two years from 1960 when he was attached to the University of the Punjab. Some of these were still recommended university course study materials as of 2010. From 1972 he moved to teach at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where he chaired the Department of South Asian studies until his retirement in the early 1990s; a few years after, the department was disbanded due to reduced funding.\nT\u00e9kumel.\nWhile at Berkeley, Barker had not set aside his world creation project. Indeed, despite stepping back from an active role in science fiction fandom, he had commenced \"proto-gaming\" with a group of like-minded science fiction fans including fellow linguist Bill Shipley and Victor Golla, producing elaborate documents to support the exploration of that shared world.\nHaving watched the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" games started by Mike Mornard, one of the original testers for D&amp;D, when Mornard moved to Minneapolis from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, Barker resolved to create his own ruleset based on his own created world and the game mechanics from D&amp;D. After six weeks, this was self-published in August 1974 as \"Empire of the Petal Throne\" and play commenced forthwith, including such occasional members as Dave Arneson \u2013 who singled out Barker and T\u00e9kumel as being his favorite Dungeon Master and roleplaying game, respectively \u2013 from early days.\nOnce Gary Gygax's attention had been drawn to Barker's work, it was decided that TSR would publish a revised version of the game mechanics along with a condensed version of his campaign setting. \"Empire of the Petal Throne\" was published by TSR in August 1975 for Gen Con VIII, making it the third role-playing game from TSR. In a December 1976 editorial for \"The Dragon\" magazine, editor Tim Kask drew comparisons between the world of T\u00e9kumel and J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth not in terms of literature created, nor that his work was derivative of Tolkien's, but rather regarding the in-depth detail in the setting, mythos and linguistic backgrounds and concluded that \"In terms of development of detail, I think EPT [Empire of the Petal Throne] has it over Middle Earth in the matters that most concern gamers\".\nBarker disliked the limited support TSR gave to the setting, and after 1977 he took his T\u00e9kumel setting back from TSR and ultimately brought it from one publisher to another: Imperium Publishing (1978), Adventure Games (1981), Gamescience (1983\u20131984), T\u00e9kumel Games (1983\u20131986), Different Worlds Publications (1987\u20131988), TOME (1991\u20131994), Tita's House of Games (1997\u20132002), Zottola Publishing (2002\u20132003), and Guardians of Order (2005). Barker had a personal friendship with Dave Arneson, which led to Arnesons's company Adventures Games releasing several books for T\u00e9kumel, such as army lists, maps and reference material. DAW published the novel \"The Man of Gold\" (July 1984) by Barker, which took place in T\u00e9kumel. His second novel, \"Flamesong\" (1985), was also published by DAW.\nDespite having had a head start on other in-depth campaign settings and seeing his game released no less than four times with various supplements and magazine articles, many of which he contributed to, and having authored five books using the same setting, Barker's T\u00e9kumel in both roleplaying and literary domains is still well known to only a relatively small audience, leading German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" in 2009 to publish an article on Barker's life entitled \"\" (\"The forgotten Tolkien\"). The article quotes friends and acquaintances who posit that this may be, at least in part, due to the unfamiliarity of the setting compared with Western society, echoing Fine's observations from 1983, and possibly even that T\u00e9kumel was released to the gaming world too early on, when players had only just started to experiment with their own invented worlds rather than fitting their play into preconfigured, non-literary domains with novel backgrounds.\nIn 2008, Barker founded the T\u00e9kumel Foundation along with many of his long-time players \"to support and protect the literary works and all related products and activities surrounding [his] world of T\u00e9kumel and the Empire of the Petal Throne.\" The Foundation acts as his literary executor.\n\"Serpent's Walk\" and Holocaust denial.\nBarker wrote a sixth novel, \"Serpent's Walk\", under the pseudonym Randolph D. Calverhall, an allusion to one of Barker's ancestors. \"Serpent's Walk\" is a science fiction story, presenting an alternate history in which SS soldiers begin an underground resistance after the end of World War II. A hundred years later, their descendants take over the United States of America. The book's protagonist becomes the and worldwide dictator of the Fourth Reich. The book espouses the belief in an international Jewish conspiracy, suggests the solution to the \"Jewish question\" is genocide, and extensively quotes \"Mein Kampf\". The novel was published in 1991 by National Vanguard Books, the book publishing division of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance, which published white supremacist and neo-Nazi material including \"The Turner Diaries\". \nBetween 1990 and 2002, Barker also served as a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee of the \"Journal of Historical Review\", a journal that advocates Holocaust denial and revisionist pseudohistory. In March 2022, the T\u00e9kumel Foundation confirmed Barker's authorship of \"Serpent's Walk\" and association with the \"Journal of Historical Review\". The Foundation repudiated Barker's views in the novel, from which it does not receive royalties, and apologized for not acknowledging its authorship earlier.\nDeath.\nBarker died in home hospice on March 16, 2012. He was survived by his wife, Ambereen.\nPartial bibliography.\nLanguage texts.\nBarker studied various languages academically and helped author and co-author various publications relating to some of those, including the following:\nPublished by the University of California Press:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublished by the McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRoleplaying.\nT\u00e9kumel has spawned five professionally published roleplaying games over the course of the years.

{"id": "60917", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60917", "title": "Lola Ridge", "text": "Irish-American poet (1873\u20131941)\nLola Ridge (born Rose Emily Ridge; 12 December 1873 \u2013 19 May 1941) was an Irish-born New Zealand-American anarchist and modernist poet, and an influential editor of avant-garde, feminist, and Marxist publications. She is best known for her long poems and poetic sequences, published in numerous magazines and collected in five books of poetry.\nAlong with other political poets of the early Modernist period, Ridge has received renewed critical attention since the late 20th century and has been lauded by contemporary poets for her choice and ability to write about urban spaces in her poems. A selection of her poetry was published in 2007, and a biography, \"Anything That Burns You: A Portrait of Lola Ridge, Radical Poet\" (by Terese Svoboda) was published in 2016.\nEarly life.\nRose Emily Ridge was born in 1873 in Dublin, Ireland, to Emma Ridge (n\u00e9e Reilly) and Joseph Henry. She was her parents' only surviving child. John Henry died when Ridge was three-years-old, and Ridge and her mother subsequently emigrated to Hokitika, New Zealand, when she was six-years-old. In 1895, she married Peter Webster, the manager of a Hokitika gold mine. In 1903 she left Webster and moved to Sydney, Australia with their three-year-old son Keith to attend Trinity College and study painting at the Sydney Art School with Julian Ashton.\nAfter her mother died, Ridge emigrated to the United States in 1907 and reinvented herself as Lola Ridge, a poet and painter. She settled in San Francisco and published in \"Overland Monthly\". Ridge placed her son in a Californian orphanage and moved to New York City's Greenwich Village. Working as a model for artists, in a factory and as a poet and illustrator, she became involved in working class politics and protests, and worked with Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger. Her first book of poetry was published in 1918. On 22 October 1919, Ridge married David Lawson, a fellow radical.\nLiterary career.\nRidge sent a collection of her poems entitled \"Verses\" (1905) inspired by her childhood in Hokitika to A.G. Stephens at the \"Sydney Bulletin,\" but he declined to publish the collection. In 1918, Ridge gained considerable notice with her long poem, \"The Ghetto\", first published in \"The New Republic\". It was included in her first book, \"The Ghetto and Other Poems,\" published that year. The title poem portrays the Jewish immigrant community of Hester Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Ridge lived for a time. It explores the effects of capitalism, gender, and generational conflict in ways that bear comparison to the works of Charles Reznikoff. In addition, Ridge gave an empathetic portrayal of America's urban masses and immigrant communities. The book was a critical success.\nThis recognition led to opportunities for Ridge; she became involved with and edited new \"avant-garde\" magazines such as \"\" in 1919, and \"Broom,\" founded in 1921 by Harold Loeb, for which she was the American editor from 1922 to 1923, while he published in Rome. While working with Loeb, she had an apartment next to the basement office of \"Broom\" in the townhouse of his estranged wife Marjorie Content. As part of her work at \"Others\", Ridge gave a lecture tour in 1919 on \"Women and the Creative Will,\" arguing that traditional gender roles were a form of patriarchal control used to suppress female creativity.\nRidge published 61 poems from 1908 to 1937 in such leading magazines as \"Poetry,\" \"New Republic,\" \"The Saturday Review of Literature\" and \"Mother Earth\". She was a contributing editor to \"The New Masses.\"\nShe wrote and published four more books of poetry through 1935, and single poems into 1937. Her collections include \"The Ghetto, and Other Poems\" (1918), \"Sun-up, and Other Poems\" (1920), \"Red Flag\" (1927), \"Firehead\" (1930), and \"Dance of Fire\" (1935). Her work was also collected in anthologies. Her third book, \"Red Flag\" (1927) collected much of her political poetry.\nIn 1929, Ridge was accepted for a residency at the writers colony of Yaddo. That year she published \"Firehead\", a long poem that was a radical retelling of Jesus' crucifixion. It and her last book, published in 1935 were more philosophical compared to her earlier work.\nShe was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935. She received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America in 1934 and 1935. Publishing until 1937, she died in Brooklyn in 1941 of pulmonary tuberculosis.\nPolitical activities.\nRidge did not join any political party, but was active in radical causes. She protested against the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927, and was among those arrested that day. In the 1930s, she supported the defence of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings, who had been framed for a 1916 bombing at the Preparedness Day Parade in San Francisco.\nHer actions during the demonstration in front of the prison on the day Sacco and Vanzetti were executed were described by Katherine Anne Porter in her long essay, \"The Never Ending Wrong.\" She wrote, \"One tall, thin figure of a woman stepped out alone, a good distance into the empty square, and when the police came down at her and the horse's hoofs beat over her head, she did not move, but stood with her shoulders slightly bowed, entirely still. The charge was repeated again and again, but she was not to be driven away. A man near me said in horror, suddenly recognizing her, 'That's Lola Ridge!' and dashed into the empty space toward her. Without any words or a moment's pause, he simply seized her by the shoulders and walked her in front of him back to the edge of the crowd, where she stood as if she were half-conscious. I came near her and said, 'Oh no, don't let them hurt you! They've done enough damage already.' And she said, 'This is the beginning of the end \u2013 we have lost something we shan't find again.' I remember her bitter hot breath and her deathlike face.\"\nPeter Quartermain described her in the \"Dictionary of Literary Biography\" as \"the nearest prototype in her time of the proletarian poet of class conflict, voicing social protest or revolutionary idealism.\"\nRenewed scholarly interest.\nWith renewed scholarly interest in Ridge's work since the late 20th century, selections from her first three books of poetry were published posthumously as, \"Light in Hand: Selected Early Poems\" (2007), edited and with an introduction by Daniel Tobin. Tobin notes that Ridge was, \"part of the confluence of politics, culture and the burgeoning of women's voices at the advent of modernism to the start of World War II.\" Furthermore, Tobin highlights the importance of Ridge's depiction of urban settings in contrast to other modernist writers like Ezra Pound or T.S. Eliot. For Ridge, the modern city becomes a \"community shaped by ritual and mutual need rather than an expos\u00e9 of modern angst and alienation and dissipation.\"\nRobert Pinsky, former Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote that contemporary readers need, \"to appreciate the magnitude and freshness of her enterprise: to make poetry out of the actual city.\" Pinsky likens Ridge to 18th-century British poet William Blake in her ability to express the perspective of children, evoking, \"innocence and experience in a way that blurs the ambiguous boundary between them.\" Pinsky also notes that Ridge preceded American Hart Crane, known for his long poem \"The Bridge\" about the Brooklyn Bridge, in her assigning \"ecstatic, high language of the past, especially of the Elizabethans, to the squalid and the sublime realities of the actual, 20th-century American city.\"\nMy doll Janie has no waist\nand her body is like a tub with feet on it.\nSometimes I beat her\nbut I always kiss her afterwards.\nWhen I have kissed all the paint off her body\nI shall tie a ribbon about it\nso she shan't look shabby.\nBut it must be blue \u2013\nit mustn't be pink \u2013\npink shows the dirt on her face\nthat won't wash off.\nI beat Janie\nand beat her...\nbut still she smiled...\nso I scratched her between the eyes with a pin.\nNow she doesn't love me any more...\nshe scowls... and scowls...\nthough I've begged her to forgive me\nand poured sugar in the hole at the back of her head.\n-- from \"Sun-Up and Other Poems\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL was the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League.\nThe SFL was associated with a title sponsor from the 1985\u201386 season. As this sponsor changed over the years the league was known in turn as the Fine Fare League, B&amp;Q League, Bell's Scottish Football League and finally as the Irn-Bru Scottish Football League. The SFL also organised two knock-out cup competitions, the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nOrganised football in Scotland began in 1873 with the formation of the Scottish Football Association (SFA). During the next 15 years or so, clubs would play friendly matches, Scottish Cup ties and local cup (e.g. Glasgow Cup or East of Scotland Shield) ties. The Football League, initially containing clubs from the North West and Midlands of England, was formed in 1888. This had been done in response to the professionalisation of football in England in 1885, with the regular diet of league fixtures replacing the haphazard arrangement of friendlies. Many Scottish players, known as the Scotch Professors, moved to the English league clubs to receive the relatively high salaries on offer.\nThis prompted Scottish clubs into thinking about forming their own league. In March 1890, the secretary of Renton wrote to thirteen other clubs inviting them to discuss the organisation of a league. All of the clubs accepted the invitation, except Queen's Park and Clyde. Amateur club Queen's Park, who were the oldest organised club in Scotland and had played a key role in the development of football, were opposed to the league because it would lead to professionalism and eliminate many of the smaller clubs. These concerns were to prove well-founded, as six of the founder members would leave the league before 1900.\nThe Scottish Football League (SFL) was inaugurated on 30 April 1890. The first season of competition, 1890\u201391, commenced with 11 clubs because St Bernard's were not elected. The eleven original clubs in membership were Abercorn, Cambuslang, Celtic, Cowlairs, Dumbarton, Heart of Midlothian, Rangers, Renton, St Mirren, Third Lanark and Vale of Leven. Renton were expelled after five games of the 1890\u201391 season for playing against St Bernard's, who had been found guilty of concealed professionalism. Renton raised an action against the SFA in the Court of Session and won, which meant that their SFA and SFL memberships were restored.\nIn the 1890\u201391 season, Rangers and Dumbarton were level at the top of the league on 29 points. The teams drew 2\u20132 in a play-off match, but no further thought had been given to separating teams by another method and the championship was shared. Goal average was introduced for the 1921\u201322 season and replaced by goal difference for the 1971\u201372 season.\nSplit into divisions.\nThe league proved to be highly successful, and in 1893, a second tier was formed by the inclusion of a number of clubs previously in the Scottish Football Alliance. Promotion was initially based on a ballot of clubs; automatic promotion was not introduced until 1922.\nThe onset of World War I saw Division Two but not Division One being suspended, not restarting again until 1921 when the Central Football League was absorbed as a new division with automatic promotion.\nNote: in contemporary sources the divisions were often referred to as 'First' and 'Second' rather than 'One' and 'Two'; the latter format has been used throughout the site to avoid confusion with the league's First and Second Division, each one tier lower than their predecessor, introduced in the 1970s (see below).\nDivision Three.\nIn 1923, the League decided to introduce a third tier. The Western League was used as its backbone but the new set-up lasted only three years before it collapsed under heavy financial losses. From 1926 until 1946, the League reverted to two divisions with many of the third tier clubs joining the second iteration of Scottish Football Alliance.\nPost-World War II reforms saw the League resume with three divisions, renamed 'A', 'B' and 'C' with the last section also including reserve sides. In 1947, league championship trophies were introduced for the first time for the top two divisions, until then only flags had been presented to the winners. The new trophies were engraved with the names of all previous winners. \nIn 1949, the 'C' Division was expanded to two sections\u00a0\u2013 South-East (North-East from 1950) and South-West. The withdrawal of the reserves from 'C' Division in 1955 saw a return to two divisions with the 5 first teams in Division C being given automatic promotion. There were then 18 clubs in Division A and 19 in Division B. In 1956 the divisions were renamed Division 1 and Division 2.\nClydebank were elected to Division Two as the 20th club in 1966, but following the demise of Third Lanark in 1967, Division Two kept operating with just 19 clubs; the situation would not be corrected until the next change of format, which happened in 1975.\nThis change of structure split the league into three divisions, Premier, First, and Second Divisions. This permitted more frequent fixtures between the top clubs; the expectation was that meant greater revenue for them, and it was hoped it would stimulate greater interest, at a time when attendance at league matches had dropped alarmingly. One year before the restructuring, a new club entered the league, Meadowbank Thistle (which would eventually become Livingston). This three-divisional structure of 38 clubs continued until 1994.\nFour-division period and SPL split.\nAfter a couple of decades, in 1994 the league again reorganised (following an attempted 'Super League' breakaway by the top clubs in 1992) with four divisions of 10 teams, as Highland League clubs Inverness Caledonian Thistle (a merger of two existing clubs in the city) and Ross County were elected to round out the league. At the same time, the SFL adopted the system of three points for a win. In 1998 the Premier Division clubs split from the league to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The remaining leagues, of ten clubs each, kept their names and the Premier Division was not reconstituted, leaving First, Second and Third Divisions. Part of the agreement was that the SPL would expand to 12 clubs in 2000. The SFL then took in two new members to replace the two clubs lost to the SPL; Highland League clubs Elgin City and Peterhead were admitted, increasing the total number of clubs in the Scottish football league system to 42.\nFrom 2005, the SFL determined a promotion and relegation place between each division according to playoffs between four clubs. The playoffs were contested between the ninth placed (second bottom) club in the higher division and the second, third and fourth placed clubs in the lower division. It was therefore possible for a team finishing fourth in the Second Division or Third Division to be promoted, rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings. It was also possible for the ninth placed club to retain their position in the higher division.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"In March 2007, a self-conducted review found the league to be three times more expensive to run than equivalent leagues in England, with a report stating the league structure was \"outdated\": the report found that the Football Conference had four employees looking after 68 clubs, while the SFL had 14 people running leagues with just 30 clubs.\nMerger.\nNo clubs were relegated from the bottom end of the Scottish Football League, although there were changes of membership due to clubs going out of business. The Scottish Football Association were keen for a pyramid system to be instituted. SFL First Division clubs wanted to gain a greater share of the media revenue generated by the SPL. In 2013, both the SPL and SFL voted in favour of merging to form the new Scottish Professional Football League. The number of divisions and clubs in each division remained the same, but there were changes to the financial distribution model. The first club to be promoted to the SPFL from the new Lowland League via playoffs was Edinburgh City in 2016 at the expense of East Stirlingshire, while in 2019 Cove Rangers were the first Highland League champions to go up, replacing Berwick Rangers.\nCup competitions.\nThe Scottish Football League organised two knock-out cup competitions: the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup. The League Cup was established in 1946, succeeding the wartime Southern League Cup. Unlike the Scottish Cup, organised by the Scottish Football Association, the League Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs. Scottish Premier League clubs continued to participate in the League Cup after the top tier clubs broke away in 1998. Until the mid-1990s, the competition winner was eligible to participate in the UEFA Cup, but this was discontinued due to a loss of European places.\nThe Scottish Challenge Cup was instituted in 1990, to celebrate the League's centenary. The Challenge Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs outside the top division of the Scottish football league system. From 2011, two Highland Football League clubs were allowed to participate each year in the Challenge Cup, to give a round number of 32 clubs participating. Both the League Cup and the Challenge Cup continued under the auspices of the Scottish Professional Football League.\nLeague sponsorship and media rights.\nFrom 1985, the League accepted sponsorships for its main competition. Below is a list of sponsors and the League's name under their sponsorship:\nThe League's cup competitions have had different sponsors, with the Scottish League Cup first attracting sponsorship in 1979. The competition was revamped in 1984, adopting a straight knock-out format, when Skol Lager began its sponsorship. The Co-operative Insurance company sponsored the League Cup for 12 seasons, until the 2010\u201311 competition. It has since been sponsored by the Scottish Government, under the name of the \"Scottish Communities League Cup\". The Scottish Challenge Cup was created by League sponsor B&amp;Q in 1990, but it was cancelled in 1998\u201399 due to a lack of sponsorship. Since 2008, the Challenge Cup has attracted its own sponsor, with BBC Alba and Ramsdens providing support.\nBefore 1979, the major source of revenue to Scottish Football League clubs, apart from their attendances, was from the football pools. In the year ended 31 March 1983, the pools generated \u00a31.08 million out of a total of \u00a31.46 million. By 1990, this source of income had been overtaken by revenue from sponsorships and television rights. As of 1990, 75% of these central revenues were split equally between the 38 member clubs, with the remaining 25% allocated according to each club's position in the league ladder. During the 1970s and 1980s, the main terrestrial television companies (STV and BBC Scotland) produced shows (\"Scotsport\" and \"Sportscene\" respectively) containing highlights of league matches. The revenues from these broadcasts were relatively small, with the companies paying less than \u00a31000 per match in the mid-1970s. BBC Radio Scotland had exclusive rights for live radio coverage of matches at this time, with independent stations such as Radio Clyde providing coverage via score updates and analysis.\nThe first live television broadcast of a Scottish league match was not until April 1986. Earlier in the 1985\u201386 season, there had been no television coverage at all due to a dispute between the League and the broadcasters. The birth of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting (Sky TV) changed the situation significantly. As ITV had an exclusive contract for live coverage of games in the English league, the first match shown on Sky was a Scottish Premier Division match between Rangers and Dundee United in April 1991. A year later, the top division English clubs formed a breakaway Premier League, signing an exclusive television contract with Sky. Live Scottish Premier Division games were shown on STV during the 1990s, but the top division clubs formed the breakaway Scottish Premier League in 1998 and signed an exclusive broadcast contract with Sky.\nThis left the remaining Scottish Football League clubs without live coverage, although STV continued to show highlights of First Division games in their \"Football First\" show. Scots Gaelic channel BBC Alba provided coverage of Scottish Football League games, including the Challenge Cup, from its launch in 2008. Live coverage on English language channels returned to Scottish Football League games in the 2012\u201313 season, as Sky and ESPN agreed contracts to show Third Division matches involving Rangers. These arrangements secured revenues that had been under threat due to the financial collapse of Rangers.\nMember clubs.\nOf the original SFL clubs, Celtic, Heart of Midlothian, St Mirren and Dumbarton are the only clubs today playing in the successor Scottish Professional Football League. Every other club is either defunct or out of the League.\nPast winners.\nWhen the Scottish Football League was established in 1890, all of the clubs played in just one division. In 1893 the Scottish Football League absorbed many clubs from the Scottish Football Alliance and had enough clubs to form another division. The existing division was renamed Division One and the new division was called Division Two. Nevertheless, promotion and relegation between the top two divisions was not automatic until 1921\u201322 when Division Two was brought back after a hiatus provoked by World War I which affected only that division; hence some teams of the era winning Division Two twice in a row before being promoted, and some Division Two winners being never promoted at all.\nA third tier of Scottish league football was first established in the 1923\u201324 season, but it only lasted for two full seasons due to financial difficulties. A third tier league (called Division C) was reintroduced in 1946\u201347. Division C, which also included reserve teams of higher division clubs, operated as a national competition for the first three seasons but thereafter it was split into two regional sections. During this period only full-strength clubs (not reserve teams) were promoted if they finished as champions. The two-division tier was abolished after the 1954\u201355 season.\nSince the 1975\u201376 season there has been a third tier, known as the Second Division. The top tier became the Premier Division and the second tier became known as the First Division. A fourth tier, known as the Third Division, was introduced in 1994. The last major change within the Scottish football league system was in 1998\u201399, when the Premier Division clubs broke away from the Scottish Football League to form the Scottish Premier League. The remaining Scottish Football League divisions continued as before.\nScottish Football League XI.\nThe SFL was the organising body of the Scottish Football League XI, a select side which represented the SFL in matches against other leagues, including the English Football League, the League of Ireland, the Northern Irish league and the Italian Serie A. These matches began in 1892, soon after the foundation of the SFL. Before the Second World War, inter-league matches were only second in importance to Scotland international matches. After the war, however, the inter-league matches became less important as European club football was instituted and clubs withdrew players due to fixture congestion. The last inter-league match was played in 1980, while a Scottish Football League XI was last selected in 1990 for a match against the Scotland national team to mark the centenary of the SFL.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The university was established by royal charter in 1836 as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London, King's College London, and \"other such institutions, corporate or unincorporated, as shall be established for the purpose of Education, whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom\". It is one of three institutions to have claimed the title of the third-oldest university in England. It moved to a federal structure with constituent colleges in 1900. It is now incorporated by its fourth (1863) royal charter and governed by the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii).\nThe university consists of 17 member institutions and three central academic bodies. It has around 48,000 distance learning external students and around 205,400 campus-based internal students, making it the largest university by number of students in the United Kingdom. For most practical purposes, ranging from admissions to funding, the member institutions operate on an independent basis, with many conferring their own degrees whilst remaining in the federal university.\nUnder the 2018 act, member institutions ceased to be termed colleges and gained the right to seek university status without having to leave the federal university: Birkbeck, City, Goldsmiths, King's College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, Royal Veterinary College, School of Oriental and African Studies, St George's, and University College London have all indicated that they intend to do so.\nAs of 2015, there are around 2 million University of London alumni across the world, including at least 14 monarchs or royalty, more than 60 presidents or prime ministers (including five prime ministers of the United Kingdom), two Cabinet Secretaries of the UK, 98 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medallists, four Turing Award winners, six Grammy winners, two Oscar winners, three Olympic gold medalists and the \"Father of the Nation\" of several countries. The university owns the University of London Press.\nHistory.\n19th century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nUniversity College London (UCL) was founded under the name \"London University\" (but without recognition by the state) in 1826 as a secular alternative to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which limited their degrees to members of the established Church of England. As a result of the controversy surrounding UCL's establishment, King's College London was founded as an Anglican college by royal charter in 1829.\nIn 1830, UCL applied for a royal charter as a university so that it could confer degrees. This was rejected, but renewed in 1834. In response to this, opposition to \"exclusive\" rights grew among the London medical schools. The idea of a general degree awarding body for the schools was discussed in the medical press and in evidence taken by the Select Committee on Medical Education. However, the blocking of a bill to open up Oxford and Cambridge degrees to dissenters led to renewed pressure on the Government to grant degree awarding powers to an institution that would not apply religious tests, particularly as the degrees of the new University of Durham were also to be closed to non-Anglicans.\nIn 1835, the government announced the response to UCL's petition for a charter. Two charters would be issued, one to UCL incorporating it as a college rather than a university, without degree awarding powers, and a second \"establishing a Metropolitan University, with power to grant academical degrees to those who should study at the London University College, or at any similar institution which his Majesty might please hereafter to name\".\nFollowing the issuing of its charter on 28 November 1836, the new University of London started drawing up regulations for degrees in March 1837. The death of William IV in June, however, resulted in a problem\u00a0\u2013 the charter had been granted \"during our Royal will and pleasure\", meaning it was annulled by the king's death. Queen Victoria issued a second charter on 5 December 1837, reincorporating the university. The university awarded its first degrees in 1839, all to students from UCL and King's College.\nThe university established by the charters of 1836 and 1837 was essentially an examining board with the right to award degrees in arts, laws and medicine. However, the university did not have the authority to grant degrees in theology, considered the senior faculty in the other three English universities. In medicine, the university was given the right to determine which medical schools provided sufficient medical training. In arts and law, by contrast, it would examine students from UCL, King's College, or any other institution granted a royal warrant, effectively giving the government control of which institutions could submit students for examination by the university. Beyond this right to submit students for examination, there was no other connection between the colleges and the university.\nIn 1849 the university held its first graduation ceremony at Somerset House following a petition to the senate from the graduates, who had previously received their degrees without any ceremony. About 250 students graduated at this ceremony. The London academic robes of this period were distinguished by their \"rich velvet facings\".\nThe list of institutions whose students could enter University of London examinations grew rapidly by 1858, including all other British universities as well as more than 30 other schools and colleges outside of London. In that year, a new charter opened up the examinations to everyone, effectively abolishing the weak link between the university and the colleges. This led the Earl of Kimberley, a member of the university's senate, to tell the House of Lords in 1888 \"that there were no Colleges affiliated to the University of London, though there were some many years ago\". The reforms of 1858 also incorporated the graduates of the university into a convocation, similar to those of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, and authorised the granting of degrees in science, the first BSc being awarded in 1860.\nThe expanded role meant the university needed more space, particularly with the growing number of students at the provincial university colleges. Between 1867 and 1870 a new headquarters was built at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the university with exam halls and offices.\nIn 1863, via a fourth charter, the university gained the right to grant degrees in surgery. This 1863 charter remains the authority under which the university is incorporated, although all its other provisions were abolished under the University of London Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 62).\nIn 1878, the university set another first when it became the first university in the UK to admit women to degrees, via the grant of a supplemental charter. Four female students obtained Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in 1881, again the first in the country.\nIn the late 19th century, the university came under criticism for merely serving as a centre for the administration of tests, and there were calls for a \"teaching university\" for London. UCL and KCL considered separating from the university to form a separate university, variously known as the Albert University, Gresham University and Westminster University. Following two royal commissions the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;University of London Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 62) was passed, reforming the university and giving it a federal structure with responsibility for monitoring course content and academic standards within its institutions. This was implemented in 1900 with the approval of new statutes for the university.\n20th century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nThe reforms initiated by the 1898 act came into force with the approval of the new federal statutes in 1900. Many of the colleges in London became schools of the university, including UCL, King's College, Bedford College, Royal Holloway and the London School of Economics. Regent's Park College, which had affiliated in 1841, became an official divinity school of the university in 1901 (the new statutes having given London the right to award degrees in theology) and Richmond (Theological) College followed as a divinity school of the university in 1902; Goldsmiths College joined in 1904; Imperial College was founded in 1907; Queen Mary College joined in 1915; the School of Oriental and African Studies was founded in 1916; and Birkbeck College, which was founded in 1823, joined in 1920.\nThe previous provision for colleges outside London was not abandoned on federation, instead London offered two routes to degrees: \"internal\" degrees offered by schools of the university and \"external\" degrees offered at other colleges (now the University of London flexible and distance learning programmes).\nUCL and King's College, whose campaign for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university's reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL's merger, under the University College London (Transfer) Act 1905 (5 Edw. 7. c. xci), happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL's property became the University of London's. King's College followed in 1910 under the King's College London (Transfer) Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. xxxix). This was a slightly more complicated case, as the theological department of the college (founded in 1846) did not merge into the university but maintained a separate legal existence under King's College's 1829 charter.\nThe expansion of the university's role meant that the Burlington Garden premises were insufficient, and in March 1900 it moved to the Imperial Institute in South Kensington. However, its continued rapid expansion meant that it had outgrown its new premises by the 1920s, requiring yet another move. A large parcel of land in Bloomsbury near the British Museum was acquired from the Duke of Bedford and Charles Holden was appointed architect with the instruction to create a building \"not to suggest a passing fashion inappropriate to buildings which will house an institution of so permanent a character as a University.\" This unusual remit may have been inspired by the fact that William Beveridge, having just become director of LSE, upon asking a taxi driver to take him to the University of London was met with the response \"Oh, you mean the place near the Royal School of Needlework\". Holden responded by designing Senate House, the current headquarters of the university, and at the time of completion the second largest building in London.\nThe University of London contingent of the Officers' Training Corps (OTC) was formed in 1908 and had enrolled 950 students by autumn 1914. During the First World War, the OTC supplied 500 officers to the British Army between August 1914 and March 1915. Some 665 officers associated with the university died during the First World War and 245 officers in the Second World War. As of 2004[ [update]] the London University Officers' Training Corps (UOTC), drawn from 52 universities and colleges in the London area (not just the University of London), was the largest UOTC in the country, with about 400 officer cadets. It has been based at Yeomanry House in Handel Street, London since 1992. In 2011, Canterbury Company was founded to recruit officer cadets from universities in Kent.\nDuring the Second World War, the colleges of the university (with the exception of Birkbeck) and their students left London for safer parts of the UK, while Senate House was used by the Ministry of Information, with its roof becoming an observation point for the Royal Observer Corps. Though the building was hit by bombs several times, it emerged from the war largely unscathed; rumour at the time had it that the reason the building had fared so well was that Adolf Hitler had planned to use it as his headquarters in London.\nThe latter half of the last century was less eventful. In 1948, Athlone Press was founded as the publishing house for the university, and sold to the Bemrose Corporation in 1979, subsequent to which it was acquired by Continuum publishing. However, the post-WWII period was mostly characterised by expansion and consolidation within the university, such as the acquisition as a constituent body of the Jesuit theological institution Heythrop College on its move from Oxfordshire in 1969.`\nThe University of London Act 1978 (c. ii) saw the university defined as a federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation that would lead to a marked transference of academic and financial power in this period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporated in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited the main body of the college with the corporation formed in 1829. In 1992 centralised graduation ceremonies at the Royal Albert Hall were replaced by individual ceremonies at the colleges. One of the largest shifts in power of this period came in 1993, when HEFCE (now the Office for Students, OfS) switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the university.\nThere was also a tendency in the late 20th century for smaller colleges to be amalgamated into larger \"super-colleges\". Some of the larger colleges (most notably UCL, King's College, LSE and Imperial) periodically put forward the possibility of their departure from the university, although no steps were taken to actually putting this into action until the early 21st century.\n21st century.\nIn 2002, Imperial College and UCL mooted the possibility of a merger, raising the question of the future of the University of London and the smaller colleges within it. Subsequently, considerable opposition from academic staff of both UCL and Imperial led to a rejection of the merger.\nDespite this failure, the trend of decentralising power continued. A significant development in this process was the closing down of the Convocation of all the university's alumni in October 2003; this recognised that individual college alumni associations were now increasingly the centre of focus for alumni. However, the university continued to grow even as it moved to a looser federation, and, in 2005, admitted the Central School of Speech and Drama.\nOn 9 December 2005, Imperial College became the second constituent body (after Regent's Park College) to make a formal decision to leave the university. Its council announced that it was beginning negotiations to withdraw from the university in time for its own centenary celebrations, and in order to be able to award its own degrees. On 5 October 2006, the University of London accepted Imperial's formal request to withdraw from it. Imperial became fully independent on 9 July 2007, as part of the celebrations of the college's centenary.\nThe \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" announced in February 2007 that the London School of Economics, University College London and King's College London all planned to start awarding their own degrees, rather than degrees from the federal University of London as they had done previously, from the start of the academic year starting in Autumn 2007. Although this plan to award their own degrees did not amount to a decision to leave the University of London, the \"THES\" suggested that this \"rais[ed] new doubts about the future of the federal University of London\".\nThe School of Pharmacy, University of London, merged with UCL on 1 January 2012, becoming the UCL School of Pharmacy within the Faculty of Life Sciences. This was followed on 2 December 2014 by the Institute of Education also merging with UCL, becoming the UCL Institute of Education.\nSince 2010, the university has been outsourcing support services such as cleaning and portering. This has prompted industrial action by the largely Latin American workforce under the \"3Cosas\" campaign (the 3Cosas \u2013 \"3 things\" \u2013 being sick pay, holiday pay, and pensions for outsourced workers on parity with staff employed directly by the university). The 3Cosas campaigners were members of the UNISON trade union. However, documents leaked in 2014 revealed that UNISON representatives tried to counter the 3Cosas campaign in meetings with university management. The 3Cosas workers subsequently transferred to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain.\nFollowing good results in the Research Excellence Framework in December 2014, City University London said that they were exploring the possibility of joining the University of London. It was subsequently announced in July 2015 that City would join the University of London in August 2016. It will cease to be an independent university and become a college as \"City, University of London\".\nIn 2016 reforms were proposed that would see the colleges become member institutions and be allowed to legally become universities in their own right. A bill to amend the university's statutes was introduced into the House of Lords in late 2016. The bill was held up by procedural matters in the House of Commons, with MP Christopher Chope objecting to it receiving a second reading without debate and no time having been scheduled for such debate. Twelve of the colleges, including UCL and King's, said that they would seek university status once the bill was passed. The bill was debated and passed its second reading on 16 October 2018. It received royal assent on 20 December 2018, becoming the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii) The twelve colleges (namely, all except The Courtauld, ICR, LBS, RAM and RCSSD) subsequently applied for university status, although stating they did not intend to change their names, with notice being given in the London Gazette on 4 February 2019.\nIn 2018, Heythrop College became the first major British higher education institution to close since the medieval University of Northampton in 1265. Its library of more than 250,000 volumes was moved to Senate House Library.\nIn 2019, the University of London Press, founded in 1910, was relaunched as a fully open-access publisher specializing in \"distinctive scholarship at the forefront of the Humanities\".\nCampuses.\nThe university owns a considerable central London estate of 12 hectares of freehold land in Bloomsbury, near Russell Square tube station.\nSome of the university's colleges have their main buildings on the estate. The Bloomsbury Campus also contains eight Halls of Residence and Senate House, which houses Senate House Library, the chancellor's official residence and previously housed the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, now part of University College London (UCL) and housed in its own new building. Almost all of the School of Advanced Study is housed in Senate House and neighbouring Stewart House.\nThe university also owns many of the squares that formed part of the Bedford Estate, including Gordon Square, Tavistock Square, Torrington Square and Woburn Square, as well as several properties outside Bloomsbury, with many of the university's colleges and institutes occupying their own estates across London:\nThe university also has several properties outside London, including a number of residential and catering units further afield and the premises of the University of London Institute in Paris, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in French and historical studies.\nOrganisation and administration.\nThe university's board of trustees, the governing and executive body of the university, comprises eleven appointed independent persons \u2013 all of whom are non-executive; the vice-chancellor, the deputy vice chancellor and four heads of member institutions, appointed by the Collegiate Council.\nThe board of trustees is supported by the Collegiate Council, which comprises the heads of the member institutions of the university, the deputy vice-chancellor, the dean and chief executive of the School of Advanced Study, the chief executive of the University of London Worldwide and the Collegiate Council's chair, the vice-chancellor.\nChancellors.\nThe chancellors of the University of London since its founding are as follows:\nMember institutions.\nFor most practical purposes, ranging from admission of students to negotiating funding from the government, the 17 member institutions are treated as individual universities. Legally speaking they are known as \"Recognised Bodies\", with the authority to examine students and award them degrees of the university. Some member institutions also have the power to award their own degrees instead of those of the university; those which exercise that power include:\nMost decisions affecting the member institutions and institutes of the University of London are made at the level of the member institutions or institutes themselves. The University of London does retain its own decision-making structure, however, with the Collegiate Council and board of trustees, responsible for matters of academic policy. The Collegiate Council is made up of the heads of member institutions of the university.\nThe 12 institutes, or \"Listed Bodies\", within the University of London offer courses leading to degrees that are both examined and awarded by the University of London. Additionally, twelve universities in England, several in Canada and many in other Commonwealth countries (notably in East Africa) began life as associate colleges of the university offering such degrees. By the 1970s, almost all of these colleges had achieved independence from the University of London. An increasing number of overseas and UK-based academic institutes offer courses to support students registered for the University of London flexible and distance learning diplomas and degrees and the Teaching Institutions Recognition Framework enables the recognition of these institutions.\nMember Institutions.\nUnder the University of London Act 2018 (c. iii), a member institution is defined as \"an educational, academic or research institution which is a constituent member of the University and has for the time being\u2015(a) the status of a college under the statutes; or (b) the status of a university\". As of February 2019, 12 of the colleges of the university have said they are seeking university status. This does not affect their status as member institution of the university or the degrees they award. The member institutions of the University of London (as of September 2018) are:\nFormer colleges and schools.\nSome colleges and schools of the University of London have been amalgamated into larger colleges, closed or left the University of London. Those amalgamated with larger colleges include (listed by current parent institution):\nInstitutions that have closed or left the university include:\nUniversity colleges in the external degree programme.\nA number of major universities originated as university colleges teaching external degrees of the University of London. These include:\nA number of other colleges had degrees validated and awarded by the University of London.\nColleges in special relation.\nBetween 1946 and 1970, the university entered into 'schemes of special relation' with university colleges in the Commonwealth of Nations. These schemes encouraged the development of independent universities by offering a relationship with the University of London. University colleges in these countries were granted a royal charter. An academic board of the university college negotiated with the University of London over the entrance requirements for the admission of students, syllabuses, examination procedures and other academic matters. During the period of the special relationship, graduates of the colleges were awarded University of London degrees.\nSome of the colleges which were in special relation are listed below, along with the year in which their special relation was established.\nIn 1970, the 'Schemes of Special Relation' were phased out.\nCoat of arms.\nThe University of London received a grant of arms in April 1838. The arms depict a cross of St George upon which there is a Tudor rose surrounded by detailing and surmounted by a crown. Above all of this there is a blue field with an open book upon it.\nThe arms are described in the grant as:\nAcademic dress.\nThe University of London had established a rudimentary code for academic dress by 1844. The university was the first to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours, an innovation that was subsequently followed by many other universities.\nColleges that award their own degrees have their own academic dress for those degrees.\nStudent life.\nIn 2023/24, approximately 5% of all UK students attended one of the University of London's affiliated schools. Additionally, more than 50,000 students are part of University of London Worldwide.\nThe ULU building on Malet Street (close to Senate House) was home to the University of London Union, which acted as the student union for all University of London students alongside the individual college and institution unions. The building was briefly rebranded as \"Student Central, London\" from 2010 to 2022, offering full membership to current University of London students, and associate membership to students at other universities, and other groups. The union previously owned \"London Student,\" the largest student newspaper in Europe, which now runs as a digital news organisation However, since 2022, the ULU building was acquired by Birkbeck and converted into an extension of its campus, meaning the UoL no longer has a formal space for its federal student members.\nSports, clubs and traditions.\nThough most sports teams are organised at the college level, ULU ran several sports clubs of its own, some of which (for example the rowing team) compete in BUCS leagues. The union also organised leagues for college teams to participate in. These leagues and sports clubs are supported by Friends of University of London Sport which aims to promote them.\nIn addition to these, ULU catered for sports not covered by the individual colleges through clubs such as the University of London Union Lifesaving Club, which helps students gain awards and learn new skills in lifesaving as well as sending teams to compete throughout the country in the BULSCA league.\nULU also organised several societies, ranging from Ballroom and Latin American Dance to Shaolin Kung Fu, and from the University of London Big Band to the Breakdancing Society. Affiliated to the university is the University of London Society of Change Ringers, a society for bellringers at all London universities.\nThe university runs the University of London Boat Club.\nStudent housing.\nThe university operates eight intercollegiate halls of residence, which accommodate students from most of its colleges and member institutions:\nNotable people.\nAlumni.\nA large number of famous individuals have passed through the University of London, either as staff or students, including at least 12 monarchs or royalty, 52 presidents or prime ministers, 84 Nobel laureates, 6 Grammy winners, 2 Oscar winners, 1 Ekushey Padak winner and 3 Olympic gold medalists. The collegiate research university has also produced Father of the Nation for several countries, including several members of Colonial Service and Imperial Civil Service during the British Raj and the British Empire.\nStaff and students of the university, past and present, have contributed to a number of important scientific advances, including the discovery of vaccines by Edward Jenner and Henry Gray (author of \"Gray's Anatomy\"). Additional vital progress was made by University of London people in the following fields: the discovery of the structure of DNA (Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin); the invention of modern electronic computers (Tommy Flowers); the discovery of penicillin (Alexander Fleming and Ernest Chain); the development of X-ray technology (William Henry Bragg and Charles Glover Barkla); discoveries on the mechanism of action of Interleukin 10 (Anne O'Garra); the formulation of the theory of electromagnetism (James Clerk Maxwell); the determination of the speed of light (Louis Essen); the development of antiseptics (Joseph Lister); the development of fibre optics (Charles K. Kao); and the invention of the telephone (Alexander Graham Bell).\nNotable political figures who have passed through the university include Billy Strachan, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, Romano Prodi, Junichiro Koizumi, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ramsay MacDonald, Desmond Tutu, Basdeo Panday, Taro Aso, Walter Rodney, Nelson Mandela, B. R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi. 35th President of the United States John F. Kennedy filed an application and paid fees for a year's study at the LSE, but later fell ill and left the university without taking a single class.\nAcademic staff.\nIn the arts, culture and literature the university has produced many notable figures. Writers include novelists Malcolm Bradbury, G. K. Chesterton, H. G. Wells, Thomas Hardy, Arthur C. Clarke and J. G. Ballard. Futurologist Donald Prell. Artists associated with the university include Jonathan Myles-Lea, and several of the leading figures in the Young British Artists movement (including Ian Davenport, Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst). Outstanding musicians across a wide range include the conductor Sir Simon Rattle, the soprano Felicity Lott and both members of Gilbert and Sullivan, to Mick Jagger, Elton John, Dido, Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan (known in South Asia as the \"Queen of Pop\"), and Hong Kong singer Karen Mok, composer Florence Margaret Spencer Palmer, and members of the bands Coldplay, Keane, Suede, the Velvet Underground, Blur, Iron Maiden, Placebo, the Libertines, and Queen.\nThe university has also played host to film directors (Christopher Nolan, Derek Jarman), philosophers (Karl Popper, Roger Scruton), explorers (David Livingstone), international academics (Sam Karunaratne), Riccarton High School Head of Commerce, Tom Neumann and leading businessmen (Michael Cowpland, George Soros).\nHonorary alumni.\nThe University of London presented its first honorary degrees in June 1903. This accolade has been bestowed on several monarchs of the United Kingdom, many members of British royal family and a wide range of distinguished individuals from both the academic and non-academic worlds. Honorary degrees are approved by the Collegiate Council, part of the university's governance structure. \nControversy.\nIn recent years the University of London has seen much controversy surrounding its treatment of staff and students.\nIn 2012, outsourced cleaning staff ran the \"3 Cosas\" campaign, fighting for improvements in three areas \u2013 sick pay, holiday and pensions. After over a year of high-profile strikes, protests and occupations, concessions were made by the university in terms of sick pay and holidays; however, these improvements were nowhere near to the extent of what was being demanded by the campaign.\nIn 2013, after a student occupation in favour of ten demands, including fair pay for workers, a halt to privatisation of the university and an end to plans to shut down the university's student union ULU, police were called, resulting in the violent eviction and arrests of more than 60 students, as well as police violence towards students outside supporting the occupation. After these events, a high-profile \"Cops Off Campus\" demonstration was held against the university's security policies, with thousands in attendance.\nIn 2018, an article was published by Vice that reported on concerns over the university's security arrangements at Senate House, where more than 25 extra private security staff had been brought in. Students who had been involved in an occupation of Senate House were barred from using university facilities, and there were numerous allegations of students being verbally, physically and sexually assaulted by the temporary security staff.\nIn December 2018, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain called for a boycott of events at the university's central administration buildings, including Senate House, with the aim of putting pressure on the University of London to bring outsourced cleaning, catering and security staff in-house by targeting a revenue stream worth around \u00a340 million per year.\nIn May 2019, the congress of the University and College Union voted to boycott the University of London's central administration buildings including Senate House, raising the pressure on the University of London. Dion Georgiou, an academic supporting the boycott and a member of UCU, wrote a comment piece for \"The Guardian\" shortly before the vote, urging the congress to approve the motion and claiming that \"[outsourced workers] face an intransigent university management, whose response has frequently blended short-termism with heavy-handedness\". The motion was passed two days later.\nIn May 2025, the incumbent Vice Chancellor, Prof. Wendy Thomson, was suspended pending further inquiries on allegations of bullying and poor leadership. On May 27, 2025, Prof. David Latchman assumed the position in an acting capacity.\nThe federal model elsewhere.\nIn 1850, Queen's University of Ireland was created as a federal university to provide degrees for students from the colleges established at Belfast, Cork and Galway. This was succeeded in 1879 by the Royal University of Ireland, an examining university along the model of the University of London, which was in turn succeeded by the federal National University of Ireland in 1908. When the University of New Zealand was constituted in 1874, it was a federal university modelled on the University of London, functioning principally as an examining body, as was the University of the Cape of Good Hope when it was constituted in 1875 and authorised to be responsible for examinations throughout South Africa. In Canada, similar structures were adopted, but on a regional basis. The University of Toronto acted as an examining and degree awarding body for the province of Ontario from 1853 to 1887, by utilising an operating model based on that of University of London.\nIn India, to satisfy the urge for higher education and learning, three universities were set up at three presidency towns in 1857 on the model of University of London as affiliating universities, viz., University of Calcutta, University of Mumbai and University of Madras.\nThe University of Wales was established in 1893 on a federal model incorporating (originally) colleges in Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff. A decision to dissolve the University of Wales was made in 2017.\nLiterature and popular culture.\nLiterature.\nDr. Watson, a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, studied at St Bart's Hospital Medical School (now part of QMUL), receiving his medical degree from the University London, and met Sherlock Holmes in the chemical laboratory there. Jim Hacker, a fictional character in the 1980s British sitcom \"Yes Minister\" and its sequel \"Yes, Prime Minister\", received his degree, a third, from the university (LSE).\nThe use of Senate House by the Ministry of Information during the Second World War inspired books two noted English writers: Graham Greene set his novel \"The Ministry of Fear\" (1943) and its film adaptation \"Ministry of Fear\" by Fritz Lang (1944) in Bloomsbury. George Orwell's wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired the description of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1949 novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\nFilms and others.\nA lecturer at the university (SOAS) named William McGovern was one of the real-life inspirations of the film character Indiana Jones.\nSenate House and the constituent colleges of the University of London have been featured in Hollywood and British films.\nIn 1916, Alfred Hitchcock enrolled at the University of London and took evening courses and drawing and design classes, which later in 1920 helped land him a spot designing title cards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60920", "revid": "48297426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60920", "title": "Tetrahydrocannabinol", "text": "Psychoactive component of cannabis\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Infobox drug/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid found in cannabis. It is the principal psychoactive constituent of \"Cannabis\" and one of at least 113 total cannabinoids identified on the plant. Although the chemical formula for THC (C21H30O2) describes multiple isomers, the term \"THC\" usually refers to the delta-9-THC isomer with chemical name (\u2212)-\"trans\"-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol. It is a colorless oil.\nTHC, also known pharmaceutically as dronabinol, is used medically to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea, HIV/AIDS-related anorexia, and symptoms of multiple sclerosis, including neuropathic pain and spasticity. It acts as a partial agonist at CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. \nTHC can be administered orally, inhaled, or transdermally, with bioavailability and onset varying by route, and is extensively metabolized in the liver to active and inactive metabolites before being excreted in feces and urine. Side effects include red eyes, dry mouth, drowsiness, memory impairment, anxiety, and, with chronic use, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. While human overdose is rare, THC can interact with other drugs and has a complex pharmacokinetic profile. \nTHC is classified variably under international and US law, with medical use approved in multiple countries. Research supports its effectiveness for spasticity, central pain, and some multiple sclerosis symptoms, though evidence for other neurological disorders is limited, and long-term high-dose exposure may carry uncertain toxicity risks.\nMedical uses.\nTHC, referred to as dronabinol in the pharmaceutical context, is approved in the United States as a capsule or solution to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and HIV/AIDS-induced anorexia.\nTHC is an active ingredient in nabiximols, a specific extract of \"Cannabis\" that was approved as a botanical drug in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray for people with multiple sclerosis to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms. Nabiximols (as Sativex) is available as a prescription drug in Canada. In 2021, nabiximols was approved for medical use in Ukraine.\nSide effects.\nSide effects of THC include red eyes, dry mouth, drowsiness, short-term memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, ataxia, increased appetite, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis (i.e., hallucinations, delusions), decreased motivation, and time dilation, among others.\nChronic usage of THC may result in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a condition characterized by cyclic nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that may persist for months to years after discontinuation.\nOverdose.\nThe median lethal dose of THC in humans is not fully known as there is conflicting evidence. A 1972 study gave up to 90\u00a0mg/kg of THC to dogs and monkeys without any lethal effects. Some rats died within 72 hours after a dose of up to 36\u00a0mg/kg. A 2014 case study based on the toxicology reports and relative testimony in two separate cases gave the median lethal dose in humans at 30\u00a0mg/kg (2.1 grams THC for a person who weighs 70\u00a0kg; 154 lb; 11 stone), observing cardiovascular death in the one otherwise healthy subject of the two cases studied. A different 1972 study gave the median lethal dose for intravenous THC in mice and rats at 30\u201340\u00a0mg/kg. A 2020 fact sheet published by the US Drug Enforcement Administration stated that \"[n]o deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported.\"\nInteractions.\nFormal drug\u2013drug interaction studies with THC have not been conducted and are limited. The elimination half-life of the barbiturate pentobarbital has been found to increase by four hours when concomitantly administered with oral THC.\nPharmacology.\nMechanism of action.\nThe actions of \u03949-THC result from its partial agonist activity at the cannabinoid receptor CB1 (Ki = 40.7 nM), located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor (Ki = 36 nM), mainly expressed in cells of the immune system. The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of (mostly G-coupled) cannabinoid receptors, which result in a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The presence of these specialized cannabinoid receptors in the brain led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG).\nTHC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat). THC, as well as other cannabinoids that contain a phenol group, possess mild antioxidant activity sufficient to protect neurons against oxidative stress, such as that produced by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.\nTHC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor affinity. THC is also limited in its efficacy compared to other cannabinoids due to its partial agonistic activity, as THC appears to result in greater downregulation of cannabinoid receptors than endocannabinoids. Furthermore, in populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may even act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. However while THC's pharmacodynamic tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that this tolerance mitigates undesirable effects, thus enhancing the drug's therapeutic window.\nRecently, it has been shown that THC is also a partial autotaxin inhibitor, with an apparent IC50 of 407 \u00b1 67 nM for the ATX-gamma isoform. THC was also co-crystallized with autotaxin, deciphering the binding interface of the complex. These results might explain some of the effects of THC on inflammation and neurological diseases, since autotaxin is responsible of LPA generation, a key lipid mediator involved in numerous diseases and physiological processes. However, clinical trials need to be performed in order to assess the importance of ATX inhibition by THC during medicinal cannabis consumption.\nPharmacokinetics.\nAbsorption.\nWith oral administration of a single dose, THC is almost completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to first-pass metabolism in the liver and the high lipid solubility of THC, only about 5 to 20% reaches circulation. Following oral administration, concentrations of THC and its major active metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) peak after 0.5 to 4hours, with median time to peak of 1.0 to 2.5hours at different doses. In some cases, peak levels may not occur for as long as 6hours. Concentrations of THC and 11-hydroxy-THC in the circulation are approximately equal with oral administration. There is a slight increase in dose proportionality in terms of peak and area-under-the-curve levels of THC with increasing oral doses over a range of 2.5 to 10mg. A high-fat meal delays time to peak concentrations of oral THC by 4hours on average and increases area-under-the-curve exposure by 2.9-fold, but peak concentrations are not significantly altered. A high-fat meal additionally increases absorption of THC via the lymphatic system and allows it to bypass first-pass metabolism. Consequently, a high-fat meal increases levels of 11-hydroxy-THC by only 25% and most of the increase in bioavailability is due to increased levels of THC.\nThe bioavailability of THC when smoking or inhaling is approximately 25%, with a range of 2% to 56% (although most commonly between 10 and 35%). The large range and marked variability between individuals is due to variation in factors including product matrix, ignition temperature, and inhalational dynamics (e.g., number, duration, and intervals of inhalations, breath hold time, depth and volume of inhalations, size of inhaled particles, deposition site in the lungs). THC is detectable within seconds with inhalation and peak levels of THC occur after 3 to 10minutes. Smoking or inhaling THC results in greater blood levels of THC and its metabolites and a much faster onset of action than oral administration of THC. Inhalation of THC bypasses the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral administration. The bioavailability of THC with inhalation is increased in heavy users.\nTransdermal administration of THC is limited by its extreme water insolubility. Efficient skin transport can only be obtained with permeation enhancement. Transdermal administration of THC, as with inhalation, avoids the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral administration.\nDistribution.\nThe volume of distribution of THC is large and is approximately 10L/kg (range 4\u201314L/kg), which is due to its high lipid solubility. The plasma protein binding of THC and its metabolites is approximately 95 to 99%, with THC bound mainly to lipoproteins and to a lesser extent albumin. THC is rapidly distributed into well-vascularized organs such as lung, heart, brain, and liver, and is subsequently equilibrated into less vascularized tissue. It is extensively distributed into and sequestered by fat tissue due to its high lipid solubility, from which it is slowly released. THC is able to cross the placenta and is excreted in human breast milk.\nMetabolism.\nThe metabolism of THC occurs mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes involving in metabolizing THC. Pharmacogenomic research has found that oral THC exposure is 2- to 3-fold greater in people with genetic variants associated with reduced CYP2C9 function. When taken orally, THC undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily via hydroxylation. The principal active metabolite of THC is 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC), which is formed by CYP2C9 and is psychoactive similarly to THC. This metabolite is further oxidized to 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). In animals, more than 100 metabolites of THC could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the predominant metabolites.\nElimination.\nMore than 55% of THC is excreted in the feces and approximately 20% in the urine. The main metabolite in urine is the ester of glucuronic acid and 11-OH-THC and free THC-COOH. In the feces, mainly 11-OH-THC was detected.\nEstimates of the elimination half-life of THC are variable. THC was reported to have a fast initial half-life of 6minutes and a long terminal half-life of 22hours in a population pharmacokinetic study. Conversely, the Food and Drug Administration label for dronabinol reports an initial half-life of 4hours and a terminal half-life of 25 to 36hours. Many studies report an elimination half-life of THC in the range of 20 to 30hours. 11-Hydroxy-THC appears to have a similar terminal half-life to that of THC, for instance 12 to 36hours relative to 25 to 36hours in one study. The elimination half-life of THC is longer in heavy users. This may be due to slow redistribution from deep compartments such as fatty tissues, where THC accumulates with regular use.\nChemistry.\nTHC is a molecule that combines polyketides (derived from acetyl CoA) and terpenoids (derived from isoprenylpyrophosphate). It is hydrophobic with very low solubility in water, but good solubility in many organic solvents. As a phytochemical, THC is assumed to be involved in the plant's evolutionary adaptation against insect predation, ultraviolet light, and environmental stress.\nThe preparation of THC was reported in 1965. that procedure called for the intramolecular alkyl lithium attack on a starting carbonyl to form the fused rings, and a tosyl chloride mediated formation of the ether.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn the \"Cannabis\" plant, THC occurs mainly as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, 2-COOH-THC). Geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid react, catalysed by an enzyme to produce cannabigerolic acid, which is cyclized by the enzyme THC acid synthase to give THCA. Over time, or when heated, THCA is decarboxylated, producing THC. The pathway for THCA biosynthesis is similar to that which produces the bitter acid humulone in hops. It can also be produced in genetically modified yeast.\nHistory.\nCannabidiol was isolated and identified from \"Cannabis sativa\" in 1940 by Roger Adams who was also the first to document the synthesis of THC (both Delta-9-THC and Delta-8-THC) from the acid-based cyclization of CBD in 1942. THC was first isolated from Cannabis by Raphael Mechoulam and Yehiel Gaoni in 1964.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1021/ja01062a046\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nSociety and culture.\nComparisons with medical cannabis.\nFemale cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis, and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis.\nDrug testing.\nTHC and its 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH metabolites can be detected and quantified in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using a combination of immunoassay and chromatographic techniques as part of a drug use testing program or in a forensic investigation. There is ongoing research to create devices capable of detecting THC in breath.\nRegulation.\nTHC, along with its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers, is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act for having \"no accepted medical use\" and \"lack of accepted safety\". However, dronabinol, a pharmaceutical form of THC, has been approved by the FDA as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an antiemetic for people receiving chemotherapy under the trade names Marinol and Syndros.\nIn 2003, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring THC to Schedule IV of the convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse and addiction potential. In 2019, the Committee recommended transferring \u03949-THC to Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, but its recommendations were rejected by the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs.\nIn the United States.\nAs of 2023, 38 states, four territories, and the District of Columbia allow medical use of cannabis (in which THC is the primary psychoactive component), with the exception of Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. As of 2022, the federal government maintains cannabis as a schedule I controlled substance, while dronabinol is classified as Schedule III in capsule form (Marinol) and Schedule II in liquid oral form (Syndros).\nIn Canada.\nAs of October 2018 when recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada, some 220 dietary supplements and 19 veterinary health products containing not more than 10 parts per million of THC extract were approved with general health claims for treating minor conditions.\nResearch.\nIn April 2014, the American Academy of Neurology found evidence supporting the effectiveness of the cannabis extracts in treating certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis and pain, but there was insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness for treating several other neurological diseases. A 2015 review confirmed that medical marijuana was effective for treating spasticity and chronic pain, but caused numerous short-lasting adverse events, such as dizziness.\nPotential for toxicity.\nPreliminary research indicates that prolonged exposure to high doses of THC may interfere with chromosomal stability, which may be hereditary as a factor affecting cell instability and cancer risk. The carcinogenicity of THC in the studied populations of so-called \"heavy users\" remains dubious due to various confounding variables, most significantly concurrent tobacco use.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the river Somme in France. The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies. More than three million men fought in the battle, of whom more than one million were either wounded or killed, making it one of the deadliest battles in human history.\nThe French and British had planned an offensive on the Somme during the Chantilly Conference in December 1915. The Allies agreed upon a strategy of combined offensives against the Central Powers in 1916 by the French, Russian, British and Italian armies, with the Somme offensive as the Franco-British contribution. The French army was to undertake the main part of the Somme offensive, supported on the northern flank by the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). When the Imperial German Army began the Battle of Verdun on the Meuse on 21 February 1916, French commanders diverted many of the divisions intended for the Somme and the \"supporting\" attack by the British became the principal effort. British forces comprised a mixture of wartime volunteers from the Territorial Force and Kitchener's Army with the remains of the pre-war army.\nOn the first day on the Somme (1 July) the German 2nd Army suffered a serious defeat opposite the French Sixth Army, from Foucaucourt-en-Santerre south of the Somme to Maricourt on the north bank and by the Fourth Army from Maricourt to the vicinity of the Albert\u2013Bapaume road. The 57,470 casualties suffered by the British, including 19,240 killed, were the worst in the history of the British Army. Most of the British casualties were suffered on the front between the Albert\u2013Bapaume road and Gommecourt to the north, which was the area where the principal German defensive effort () was made. The battle became notable for the importance of air power and the first use of the tank in September but these were a product of new technology and proved unreliable.\nAt the end of the battle, British and French forces had penetrated into German-occupied territory along the majority of the front, their largest territorial gain since the First Battle of the Marne in 1914. The operational objectives of the Anglo-French armies were not achieved, as they failed to capture P\u00e9ronne and Bapaume, where the German armies maintained their positions over the winter. British attacks in the Ancre valley resumed in January 1917 and forced the Germans into local withdrawals in February before the strategic retreat by about in Operation Alberich to the (Hindenburg Line) in March 1917. Debate continues over the necessity, significance and effect of the battle.\nStrategic developments.\nAllied war strategy for 1916 was decided at the Chantilly Conference from 6 to 8 December 1915. Simultaneous offensives on the Eastern Front by the Russian army, on the Italian Front by the Italian army and on the Western Front by the Franco-British armies were to be carried out to deny time for the Central Powers to move troops between fronts during lulls. In December 1915, General Sir Douglas Haig replaced Field Marshal Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Haig favoured a British offensive in Flanders, close to BEF supply routes, to drive the Germans from the Belgian coast and end the U-boat threat from Belgian waters. Haig was not formally subordinate to Marshal Joseph Joffre but the British played a lesser role on the Western Front and complied with French strategy.\nIn January 1916, Joffre had agreed to the BEF making its main effort in Flanders but in February 1916 it was decided to mount a combined offensive where the French and British armies met, astride the Somme River in Picardy before the British offensive in Flanders. A week later the Germans began the Battle of Verdun against the French army. The costly defence of Verdun forced the army to divert divisions intended for the Somme offensive, eventually reducing the French contribution to 13 divisions in the Sixth Army, against 20 British divisions. By 31 May, the ambitious Franco-British plan for a decisive victory had been reduced to a limited offensive to relieve pressure on the French at Verdun and inflict attrition on the German armies in the west.\nThe Chief of the German General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn, intended to end the war by splitting the Anglo-French Entente in 1916, before its material superiority became unbeatable. Falkenhayn planned to defeat the large number of reserves which the Entente could move into the path of a breakthrough, by threatening a sensitive point close to the existing front line and provoking the French into counter-attacking German positions. Falkenhayn chose to attack towards Verdun to take the Meuse heights and make Verdun untenable. The French would have to conduct a counter-offensive on ground dominated by the German army and ringed with masses of heavy artillery, leading to huge losses and bringing the French army close to collapse. The British would mount a hasty relief offensive and suffer similar losses. Falkenhayn expected the relief offensive to fall south of Arras against the 6th Army and be destroyed. Despite the certainty by mid-June of an Anglo-French attack on the Somme against the 2nd Army, Falkenhayn sent only four divisions, keeping eight in the western strategic reserve.\nNo divisions were taken from the Sixth Army, despite it holding a shorter line with &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;17+1\u20442 divisions and three of the divisions in OHL reserve behind the 6th Army. The maintenance of the strength of the 6th Army, at the expense of the 2nd Army on the Somme, indicated that Falkenhayn intended the counter-offensive against the British to be made north of the Somme front, once the British offensive had been shattered. If such Franco-British defeats were not enough, Germany would attack the remnants of both armies and end the western alliance for good. The unexpected length of the Verdun offensive, and the need to replace many drained units at Verdun, depleted the German strategic reserve placed behind the 6th Army, which held the Western Front from Hannescamps, south-west of Arras to St Eloi, south of Ypres and reduced the German counter-offensive strategy north of the Somme to one of passive and unyielding defence.\nBattle of Verdun.\nThe Battle of Verdun (21 February \u2013 16 December 1916) began a week after Joffre and Haig agreed to mount an offensive on the Somme. The German offensive at Verdun was intended to threaten the capture of the city and induce the French to fight an attrition battle, in which German advantages of terrain and firepower would cause the French disproportionate casualties. The battle changed the nature of the offensive on the Somme, as French divisions were diverted to Verdun, and the main effort by the French diminished to a supporting attack for the British. German overestimation of the cost of Verdun to the French contributed to the concentration of German infantry and guns on the north bank of the Somme. By May, Joffre and Haig had changed their expectations of an offensive on the Somme, from a decisive battle to a hope that it would relieve Verdun and keep German divisions in France, which would assist the Russian armies conducting the Brusilov Offensive. The German offensive at Verdun was suspended in July, and troops, guns, and ammunition were transferred to Picardy, leading to a similar transfer of the French Tenth Army to the Somme front. Later in the year, the Franco-British were able to attack on the Somme and at Verdun sequentially and the French recovered much of the ground lost on the east bank of the Meuse in October and December.\nBrusilov offensive.\nThe Brusilov offensive (4 June \u2013 20 September) on the Eastern Front absorbed the extra forces that had been requested on 2 June by Fritz von Below, commanding the German Second Army, for a spoiling attack on the Somme. On 4 June, Russian armies attacked on a front, from the Romanian frontier to Pinsk and eventually advanced , reaching the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, against German and Austro-Hungarian troops of and . During the offensive the Russians inflicted c.\u20091,500,000 losses including c.\u2009407,000 prisoners. Three divisions were ordered from France to the Eastern Front on 9 June and the spoiling attack on the Somme was abandoned. Only four more divisions were sent to the Somme front before the Anglo-French offensive began, bringing the total to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;10+1\u20442 divisions. Falkenhayn and then Hindenburg and Ludendorff, were forced to send divisions to Russia throughout the summer to prevent a collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army and then to conduct a counter-offensive against Romania, which declared war against the Central Powers on 27 August. In July there were 112 German divisions on the Western Front and 52 divisions in Russia and in November there were 121 divisions in the west and 76 divisions in the east.\nTactical developments.\nThe original British Expeditionary Force (BEF) of six divisions and the Cavalry Division, had lost most of the British pre-war regulars in the battles of 1914 and 1915. The bulk of the army was made up of volunteers of the Territorial Force and Kitchener's Army, which had begun forming in August 1914. Rapid expansion created many vacancies for senior commands and specialist functions, which led to many appointments of retired officers and inexperienced newcomers. In 1914, Douglas Haig had been a lieutenant-general in command of I Corps and was promoted to command the First Army in early 1915 and then the BEF in December, which eventually comprised five armies with sixty divisions. The swift increase in the size of the army reduced the average level of experience within it and created an acute equipment shortage. Many officers resorted to directive command to avoid delegating to novice subordinates, although divisional commanders were given great latitude in training and planning for the attack of 1 July, since the heterogeneous nature of the 1916 army made it impossible for corps and army commanders to know the capacity of each division.\nDespite considerable debate among German staff officers, Erich von Falkenhayn continued the policy of unyielding defence in 1916. Falkenhayn implied after the war that the psychology of German soldiers, shortage of manpower and lack of reserves made the policy inescapable, as the troops necessary to seal off breakthroughs did not exist. High losses incurred in holding ground by a policy of no retreat were preferable to higher losses, voluntary withdrawals and the effect of a belief that soldiers had discretion to avoid battle. When a more flexible policy was substituted later, decisions about withdrawal were still reserved to army commanders. On the Somme front, Falkenhayn's construction plan of January 1915 had been completed. Barbed wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two, wide and about apart. Double and triple thickness wire was used and laid high. The front line had been increased from one trench line to a position of three lines apart, the first trench () occupied by sentry groups, the second () for the bulk of the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for 25 men. An intermediate line of strongpoints (the ) about behind the front line was also built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second position, which was as well-built and wired as the first position. The second position was beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the position.\nPrelude.\nAnglo-French plan of attack.\nFrench losses at Verdun reduced the contribution available for the offensive on the Somme and increased the urgency for the commencement of operations on the Somme. The principal role in the offensive devolved to the British and on 16 June, Haig defined the objectives of the offensive as the relief of pressure on the French at Verdun and the infliction of losses on the Germans. After a five-day artillery bombardment, the British Fourth Army was to capture of the German first line, from Montauban to Serre and the Third Army was to mount a diversion at Gommecourt. In a second phase, the Fourth Army was to take the German second position, from Pozi\u00e8res to the Ancre and then the second position south of the Albert\u2013Bapaume Road, ready for an attack on the German third position south of the road towards Flers, when the Reserve Army which included three cavalry divisions, would exploit the success to advance east and then north towards Arras. The French Sixth Army, with one corps on the north bank from Maricourt to the Somme and two corps on the south bank southwards to Foucaucourt, would make a subsidiary attack to guard the right flank of the main attack being made by the British.\nBetrayal of British plans.\nResearch in German archives revealed in 2016 that the date and location of the British offensive had been betrayed to German interrogators by two politically disgruntled soldiers several weeks in advance. The German military accordingly undertook significant defensive preparatory work on the British section of the Somme offensive. Other intelligence which warned the Germans included POW reports, interception of Rawlinson's message to his troops and early detonation of a mine. Thus alerted, the Germans were waiting in their trenches when the British troops went over the top.\nGerman defences on the Somme.\nAfter the Autumn Battles () of 1915, a third defensive position another back from the (Support line) begun in February 1916 and was almost complete on the Somme front when the battle began. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors); each officer was expected to know the batteries covering his section of the front line and the batteries ready to engage fleeting targets. A telephone system was built, with lines buried deep for behind the front line, to connect the front line to the artillery. The Somme defences had two inherent weaknesses that the rebuilding had not remedied. The front trenches were on a forward slope, lined by white chalk from the subsoil and easily seen by ground observers. The defences were crowded towards the front trench with a regiment having two battalions near the front-trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second position, all within of no man's land and most troops within of the front line, accommodated in the new deep dugouts. The concentration of troops at the front line on a forward slope guaranteed that it would face the bulk of an artillery bombardment, directed by ground observers on clearly marked lines.\nBattles of the Somme, 1916.\nFirst phase: 1\u201317 July 1916.\nBattle of Albert, 1\u201313 July.\nThe Battle of Albert was the first two weeks of Anglo-French offensive operations in the Battle of the Somme. The Allied preparatory artillery bombardment began on 24 June and the Anglo-French infantry attacked on 1 July, on the south bank from Foucaucourt to the Somme and from the Somme north to Gommecourt, beyond Serre. The French Sixth Army and the right wing of the British Fourth Army inflicted a considerable defeat on the German Second Army, but from the Albert\u2013Bapaume road to Gommecourt the British attack was a disaster where most of the c.\u200960,000 British casualties were incurred. Against Joffre's wishes, Haig abandoned the offensive north of the road, to reinforce the success in the south, where the Anglo-French forces pressed forward towards the German second line, preparatory to a general attack on 14 July.\nFirst day.\nThe Battle of the Somme lasted 141 days beginning with the opening day of the Battle of Albert. The attack was made by five divisions of the French Sixth Army on the east side of the Somme, eleven British divisions of the Fourth Army north of the Somme to Serre and two divisions of the Third Army opposite Gommecourt, against the German Second Army of General Fritz von Below. The German defence south of the Albert\u2013Bapaume road mostly collapsed and the French had \"complete success\" on both banks of the Somme, as did the British from the army boundary at Maricourt to the Albert\u2013Bapaume road. On the south bank the German defence was made incapable of resisting another attack and a substantial retreat began; on the north bank the abandonment of Fricourt was ordered. The defenders on the commanding ground north of the road inflicted a huge defeat on the British infantry, who took an unprecedented number of casualties. Several truces were negotiated to recover wounded from no man's land north of the road. The Fourth Army took 57,470 casualties, of which 19,240 men were killed. The French Sixth Army had 1,590 casualties, and the 2nd German Army had 10,000\u201312,000 losses.\nBattle of Bazentin Ridge, 14\u201317 July.\nThe Fourth Army attacked the German second defensive position from the Somme past Guillemont and Ginchy, north-west along the crest of the ridge to Pozi\u00e8res on the Albert\u2013Bapaume road. The objectives of the attack were the villages of Bazentin le Petit, Bazentin le Grand and Longueval which was adjacent to Delville Wood, with High Wood on the ridge beyond. The attack was made by four divisions on a front of at 3:25 a.m. after a five-minute hurricane artillery bombardment. Field artillery fired a creeping barrage and the attacking waves pushed up close behind it in no man's land, leaving them only a short distance to cross when the barrage lifted from the German front trench. Most of the objective was captured and the German defence south of the Albert\u2013Bapaume road put under great strain but the attack was not followed up due to British communication failures, casualties and disorganisation.\nBattle of Fromelles, 19\u201320 July.\nThe Battle of Fromelles was a subsidiary attack to support the Fourth Army on the Somme to the south, to exploit any weakening of the German defences opposite. Preparations for the attack were rushed, the troops involved lacked experience in trench warfare and the power of the German defence was \"gravely\" underestimated, the attackers being outnumbered 2:1. On 19 July, von Falkenhayn had judged the British attack to be the anticipated offensive against the 6th Army. Next day, Falkenhayn ordered the Guard Reserve Corps to be withdrawn to reinforce the Somme front. The Battle of Fromelles had inflicted some losses on the German defenders but gained no ground and deflected few German troops bound for the Somme. The attack was the debut of the Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front and, according to McMullin, \"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history\". Of 7,080 BEF casualties, 5,533 losses were incurred by the 5th Australian Division; German losses were 1,600\u20132,000, with 150 taken prisoner.\nSecond phase: July\u2013September 1916.\nBattle of Delville Wood, 14 July \u2013 15 September.\nThe Battle of Delville Wood was an operation to secure the British right flank, while the centre advanced to capture the higher-lying areas of High Wood and Pozi\u00e8res. After the Battle of Albert the offensive had evolved to the capture of fortified villages, woods, and other terrain that offered observation for artillery fire, jumping-off points for more attacks, and other tactical advantages. The mutually costly fighting at Delville Wood eventually secured the British right flank and marked the Western Front debut of the South African 1st Infantry Brigade (incorporating a Southern Rhodesian contingent), which held the wood from 15 to 20 July. When relieved, the brigade had lost 2,536 men, similar to the casualties of many brigades on 1 July.\nBattle of Pozi\u00e8res, 23 July \u2013 7 August.\nThe Battle of Pozi\u00e8res began with the capture of the village by the 1st Australian Division (Australian Imperial Force) of the Reserve Army, the only British success in the Allied fiasco of 22/23 July, when a general attack combined with the French further south, degenerated into a series of separate attacks due to communication failures, supply failures and poor weather. German bombardments and counter-attacks began on 23 July and continued until 7 August. The fighting ended with the Reserve Army taking the plateau north and east of the village, overlooking the fortified village of Thiepval from the rear.\nBattle of Guillemont, 3\u20136 September.\nThe Battle of Guillemont was an attack on the village which was captured by the Fourth Army on the first day. Guillemont was on the right flank of the British sector, near the boundary with the French Sixth Army. German defences ringed the British salient at Delville Wood to the north and had observation over the French Sixth Army area to the south towards the Somme river. The German defence in the area was based on the second line and numerous fortified villages and farms north from Maurepas at Combles, Guillemont, Falfemont Farm, Delville Wood and High Wood, which were mutually supporting. The battle for Guillemont was considered by some observers to be the supreme effort of the German army during the battle. Numerous meetings were held by Joffre, Haig, Foch, General Sir Henry Rawlinson (commander of the British Fourth Army) and Fayolle to co-ordinate joint attacks by the four armies, all of which broke down. A pause in Anglo-French attacks at the end of August, coincided with the largest counter-attack by the German army in the Battle of the Somme.\nBattle of Ginchy, 9 September.\nIn the Battle of Ginchy the 16th Division captured the German-held village. Ginchy was north-east of Guillemont, at the junction of six roads on a rise overlooking Combles, to the south-east. After the end of the Battle of Guillemont, British troops were required to advance to positions which would give observation over the German third position, ready for a general attack in mid-September. British attacks from Leuze Wood northwards to Ginchy had begun on 3 September, when the 7th Division captured the village and was then forced out by a German counter-attack. The capture of Ginchy and the success of the French Sixth Army on 12 September, in its biggest attack of the battle of the Somme, enabled both armies to make much bigger attacks, sequenced with the Tenth and Reserve armies, which captured much more ground and inflicted c.\u2009130,000 casualties on the German defenders during the month.\nThird phase: September\u2013November 1916.\nBattle of Flers\u2013Courcelette, 15\u201322 September.\nThe Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette was the third and final general offensive mounted by the British Army, which attacked an intermediate line and the German third line to take Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt, which was combined with a French attack on Fr\u00e9gicourt and Rancourt to encircle Combles and a supporting attack on the south bank of the Somme. The strategic objective of a breakthrough was not achieved but the tactical gains were considerable, the front line being advanced by and many casualties were inflicted on the German defenders. The battle was the debut of the Canadian Corps, the New Zealand Division and tanks of the Heavy Branch of the Machine Gun Corps on the Somme.\nBattle of Morval, 25\u201328 September.\nThe Battle of Morval was an attack by the Fourth Army on Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette (15\u201322 September). The attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on Combles, south of Morval and because of rain. The combined attack was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west, near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. Combles, Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt were captured and a small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon. Many casualties were inflicted on the Germans but the French made slower progress. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a Salients, re-entrants and pockets salient near Combles. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.\nBattle of Thiepval Ridge, 26\u201328 September.\nThe Battle of Thiepval Ridge was the first large offensive mounted by the Reserve Army of Lieutenant General Hubert Gough and was intended to benefit from the Fourth Army attack at Morval by starting 24 hours afterwards. Thiepval Ridge was well fortified and the German defenders fought with great determination, while the British co-ordination of infantry and artillery declined after the first day, due to confused fighting in the maze of trenches, dug-outs and shell-craters. The final British objectives were not reached until the Battle of the Ancre Heights (1 October \u2013 11 November). Organisational difficulties and deteriorating weather frustrated Joffre's intention to proceed by vigorous co-ordinated attacks by the Anglo-French armies, which became disjointed and declined in effectiveness during late September, at the same time as a revival occurred in the German defence. The British experimented with new techniques in gas warfare, machine-gun bombardment and tank\u2013infantry co-operation, as the Germans struggled to withstand the preponderance of men and material fielded by the Anglo-French, despite reorganisation and substantial reinforcements of troops, artillery and aircraft from Verdun. September became the worst month for casualties for the Germans.\nBattle of Le Transloy, 1 October \u2013 11 November.\nThe Battle of Le Transloy began in good weather and Le Sars was captured on 7 October. Pauses were made from 8\u201311 October due to rain and 13\u201318 October to allow time for a methodical bombardment, when it became clear that the German defence had recovered from earlier defeats. Haig consulted with the army commanders and on 17 October reduced the scope of operations by cancelling the Third Army plans and reducing the Reserve Army and Fourth Army attacks to limited operations, in co-operation with the French Sixth Army. Another pause followed before operations resumed on 23 October on the northern flank of the Fourth Army, with a delay during more bad weather on the right flank of the Fourth Army and on the French Sixth Army front, until 5 November. Next day, the Fourth Army ceased offensive operations, except for small attacks intended to improve positions and divert German attention from attacks being made by the Reserve/Fifth Army. Larger operations resumed in January 1917.\nBattle of the Ancre Heights, 1 October \u2013 11 November.\nThe Battle of the Ancre Heights was fought after Haig made plans for the Third Army to take the area east of Gommecourt, the Reserve Army to attack north from Thiepval Ridge and east from Beaumont Hamel\u2013H\u00e9buterne and for the Fourth Army to reach the P\u00e9ronne\u2013Bapaume road around Le Transloy and Beaulencourt\u2013Thilloy\u2013Loupart Wood, north of the Albert\u2013Bapaume road. The Reserve Army attacked to complete the capture of Regina Trench/Stuff Trench, north of Courcelette to the west end of Bazentin Ridge around and Stuff Redoubts, during which bad weather caused great hardship and delay. The Marine Brigade from Flanders and fresh German divisions brought from quiet fronts counter-attacked frequently and the British objectives were not secured until 11 November.\nBattle of the Ancre, 13\u201318 November.\nThe Battle of the Ancre was the last big British operation of the year. The Fifth (formerly Reserve) Army attacked into the Ancre valley to exploit German exhaustion after the Battle of the Ancre Heights and gain ground ready for a resumption of the offensive in 1917. Political calculation, concern for Allied morale and Joffre's pressure for a continuation of attacks in France, to prevent German troop transfers to Russia and Italy also influenced Haig. The battle began with another mine being detonated beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The attack on Serre failed, although a brigade of the 31st Division, which had attacked in the disaster of 1 July, took its objectives before being withdrawn later. South of Serre, Beaumont Hamel and Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre were captured. South of the Ancre, St. Pierre Division was captured, the outskirts of Grandcourt reached and the Canadian 4th Division captured Regina Trench north of Courcelette, then took Desire Support Trench on 18 November. Until January 1917 a lull set in, as both sides concentrated on enduring the weather.\nSubsequent operations.\nAncre, January\u2013March 1917.\nAfter the Battle of the Ancre (13\u201318 November 1916), British attacks on the Somme front were stopped by the weather and military operations by both sides were mostly restricted to survival in the rain, snow, fog, mud fields, waterlogged trenches and shell-holes. As preparations for the offensive at Arras continued, the British attempted to keep German attention on the Somme front. British operations on the Ancre from 10 January \u2013 22 February 1917, forced the Germans back on a front, ahead of the schedule of the Alberich Bewegung ( Manoeuvre/Operation Alberich) and eventually took 5,284 prisoners. On 22/23 February, the Germans fell back another on a front. The Germans then withdrew from much of the to the on 11 March, forestalling a British attack, which was not noticed by the British until dark on 12 March; the main German withdrawal from the Noyon salient to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) commenced on schedule on 16 March.\nHindenburg Line.\nVon Falkenhayn was sacked and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff at the end of August 1916. At a conference at Cambrai on 5 September, a decision was taken to build a new defensive line well behind the Somme front. The was to be built from Arras to St. Quentin, La F\u00e8re and Cond\u00e9, with another new line between Verdun and Pont-\u00e0-Mousson. These lines were intended to limit any Allied breakthrough and to allow the German army to withdraw if attacked; work began on the (Hindenburg Line) at the end of September. Withdrawing to the new line was not an easy decision and the German high command struggled over it during the winter of 1916\u20131917. Some members wanted to take a shorter step back to a line between Arras and Sailly, while the 1st and 2nd army commanders wanted to stay on the Somme. \"Generalleutnant\" von Fuchs on 20 January 1917 said that,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Enemy superiority is so great that we are not in a position either to fix their forces in position or to prevent them from launching an offensive elsewhere. We just do not have the troops... We cannot prevail in a second battle of the Somme with our men; they cannot achieve that any more. (20 January 1917)\u2014\u200a\nand that half measures were futile, retreating to the was unavoidable. After the loss of a considerable amount of ground around the Ancre valley to the British Fifth Army in February 1917, the German armies on the Somme were ordered on 14 February, to withdraw to reserve lines closer to Bapaume. A further retirement to the Hindenburg Line () in Operation Alberich began on 16 March 1917, despite the new line being unfinished and poorly sited in some places.\nDefensive positions held by the German army on the Somme after November 1916 were in poor condition; the garrisons were exhausted and censors of correspondence reported tiredness and low morale in front-line soldiers. The situation left the German command doubtful that the army could withstand a resumption of the battle. The German defence of the Ancre began to collapse under British attacks, which on 28 January 1917 caused Rupprecht to urge that the retirement to the (Hindenburg Line) begin. Ludendorff rejected the proposal the next day, but British attacks on the First Army \u2013 particularly the action of Miraumont (also known as the Battle of Boom Ravine, 17\u201318 February) \u2013 caused Rupprecht on the night of 22 February to order a preliminary withdrawal of c. to the (R. I Position). On 24 February the Germans withdrew, protected by rear guards, over roads in relatively good condition, which were then destroyed. The German withdrawal was helped by a thaw, which turned roads behind the British front into bogs and by disruption, to the railways, which supplied the Somme front. On the night of 12 March, the Germans withdrew from the between Bapaume and Achiet le Petit and the British reached the (R. II Position) on 13 March. The withdrawal took place from 16\u201320 March, with a retirement of about , giving up more French territory than that gained by the Allies from September 1914 until the beginning of the operation.\nAnalysis.\nAt the start of 1916, most of the British Army was an inexperienced and patchily trained mass of volunteers. The Somme was a great test for Kitchener's Army, created by Kitchener's call for recruits at the start of the war. The British volunteers were often the fittest, most enthusiastic and best-educated citizens but were inexperienced and it has been claimed that their loss was of lesser military significance than the losses of the remaining peacetime-trained officers and men of the Imperial German Army. British casualties on the first day were the worst in the history of the British Army, with 57,470 casualties, 19,240 of whom were killed.\nBritish survivors of the battle had gained experience and the BEF learned how to conduct the mass industrial warfare which the continental armies had been fighting since 1914. The European powers had begun the war with trained armies of regulars and reservists, which were wasting assets. Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria wrote, \"What remained of the old first-class peace-trained German infantry had been expended on the battlefield\". A war of attrition was a logical strategy for Britain against Germany, which was also at war with France and Russia. A school of thought holds that the Battle of the Somme placed unprecedented strain on the German army and that after the battle it was unable to replace casualties like-for-like, which reduced it to a militia. Philpott argues that the German army was exhausted by the end of 1916, with loss of morale and the cumulative effects of attrition and frequent defeats causing it to collapse in 1918, a process which began on the Somme, echoing Churchill's argument that the German soldiery was never the same again.\nThe destruction of German units in battle was made worse by lack of rest. British and French aircraft and long-range guns reached well behind the front line, where trench-digging and other work meant that troops returned to the line exhausted. Despite the strategic predicament of the German army, it survived the battle, withstood the pressure of the Brusilov Offensive and conquered almost all of Romania. In 1917, the German army in the west survived the large British and French offensives of the Nivelle Offensive and the Third Battle of Ypres, though at great cost.\nThe British and French had advanced about on the Somme, on a front of at a cost of 419,654 to 432,000 British and about 200,000 French casualties, against 465,181 to 500,000 or perhaps 600,000 German casualties. Until the 1930s the dominant view of the battle in English-language writing was that the battle was a hard-fought victory against a brave, experienced and well-led opponent. Winston Churchill had objected to the way the battle was being fought in August 1916, and Prime Minister David Lloyd George criticised attrition warfare frequently and condemned the battle in his post-war memoirs. In the 1930s a new orthodoxy of \"mud, blood and futility\" emerged and gained more emphasis in the 1960s when the 50th anniversaries of the Great War battles were commemorated.\nTransport.\nUntil 1916, transport arrangements for the BEF were based on an assumption that the war of movement would soon resume and make it pointless to build infrastructure, since it would be left behind. The British relied on motor transport from railheads which was insufficient where large masses of men and guns were concentrated. When the Fourth Army advance resumed in August, the wisdom of not building light railways which would be left behind was argued by some, in favour of building standard gauge lines. Experience of crossing the beaten zone showed that such lines or metalled roads could not be built quickly enough to sustain an advance, and that pausing while communications caught up allowed the defenders to recover. On the Somme the daily carry during attacks on a front was and a few wood roads and rail lines were inadequate for the number of lorries and roads. A comprehensive system of transport was needed, which required a much greater diversion of personnel and equipment than had been expected.\nCasualties.\nThe Battle of the Somme was one of the costliest battles of World War I. The original Allied estimate of casualties on the Somme, made at the Chantilly Conference on 15 November 1916, was that the Germans suffered 630,000 casualties, exceeding the 485,000 suffered by the British and French. As one German officer wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Somme. The whole history of the world cannot contain a\nmore ghastly word.\nHowever, Churchill wrote that Allied casualties had exceeded German losses. In \"The World Crisis\" (first published in the early 1920s, reprinted in 1938), he quoted the German \"Reichsarchiv\" data, showing that on the Western Front between February and June 1916, the Germans had suffered 270,000 casualties against the French and 390,000 between July and the end of the year (Appendix J); he wrote that the Germans suffered 278,000 casualties at Verdun and that around one eighth of their casualties were suffered on \"quiet\" sectors. According to the tables, between July and October 1916, German forces on the Western Front suffered 537,919 casualties, 288,011 inflicted by the French and 249,908by the British; German forces inflicted 794,238 casualties on the Entente.\nIn 1931, Hermann Wendt published a comparison of German and British\u2013French casualties which showed an average of 30 per cent more Allied casualties than German losses on the Somme. In the first 1916 volume of the British Official History (1932), J. E. Edmonds wrote that comparisons of casualties were inexact, because of different methods of calculation by the belligerents but that British casualties were 419,654, from total British casualties in France in the period of 498,054. French Somme casualties were 194,451 and German casualties were c.\u2009445,322, to which should be added 27 per cent for woundings, which would have been counted as casualties using British criteria; Anglo-French casualties on the Somme were over 600,000 and German casualties were under 600,000. In the second 1916 volume of the British Official History (1938), Wilfrid Miles wrote that German casualties were 660,000\u2013680,000 and Anglo-French casualties were just under 630,000, using \"fresh data\" from the French and German official accounts.\nThe addition by Edmonds of c.\u200930 per cent to German figures, supposedly to make them comparable to British criteria, was criticised as \"spurious\" by M. J. Williams in 1964. McRandle and Quirk in 2006 cast doubt on the Edmonds calculations but counted 729,000 German casualties on the Western Front from July to December against 631,000 by Churchill, concluding that there had been fewer German losses than Anglo-French casualties but that the ability of the German army to inflict disproportionate losses had been eroded by attrition. In 2003 British historian Gary Sheffield wrote that the calculation by Edmonds of Anglo-French casualties was correct but the one for German casualties was \"discredited\", quoting the official German figure of 500,000 casualties.\nDoughty wrote that French losses on the Somme were \"surprisingly high\" at 202,567 men, 54 per cent of the 377,231 casualties at Verdun. Prior and Wilson used Churchill's research and wrote that the British suffered 420,000 casualties from 1 July to mid-November (c.\u20093,600 per day) in inflicting c.\u2009280,000 German casualties and offer no figures for French casualties or the losses they inflicted on the Germans. Sheldon wrote that the British lost \"over 400,000\" casualties. Harris wrote that British losses were c.\u2009420,000, French casualties were over 200,000 men and German losses were c.\u2009500,000, according to the \"best\" German sources. Sheffield wrote that the losses were \"appalling\", with 419,000 British casualties, c.\u2009204,000 French and \"perhaps\" 600,000 German casualties.\nIn a commentary on the debate about Somme casualties, Philpott used Miles's figures of 419,654 British casualties and the French official figures of 154,446 Sixth Army losses and 48,131 Tenth Army casualties. Philpott described German losses as \"disputed\", with estimates ranging from 400,000 to 680,000. The high Allied casualties of July 1916 are not representative of the way attrition turned in the Allies' favour in September, although this was not sustained as the weather deteriorated. Philpott quoted Robin Prior (in \"Churchill's World Crisis As History\" [1983]) that the \"blood test\" is a crude measure compared to manpower reserves, industrial capacity, farm productivity and financial resources and that intangible factors were more influential on the course of the war, which the Allies won despite \"losing\" the purely quantitative test.\nCommemoration.\nIn the United Kingdom and Newfoundland, the Battle of the Somme became the central memory of World War I. The Royal British Legion with the British Embassy in Paris and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission commemorate the battle on 1 July each year, at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. For their efforts on the first day of the battle, the 1st Newfoundland Regiment was given the name \"The Royal Newfoundland Regiment\" by George V on 28 November 1917. The first day of the Battle of the Somme is commemorated in Newfoundland, remembering the \"Best of the Best\" at 11am on the Sunday nearest to 1 July. The Somme is remembered in Northern Ireland due to the participation of the 36th (Ulster) Division and commemorated by veterans' groups and by unionist/Protestant groups such as the Orange Order. The British Legion and others commemorate the battle on 1 July.\nOn 1 July 2016, at 7:28\u00a0a.m. British Summer Time, the UK observed a two minute silence to mark the start of the battle which began 100 years earlier. A special ceremony was broadcast on BBC1 and all BBC radio stations participated in the silence. At the start of the silence, the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a gun every four seconds for one hundred seconds and a whistle was blown to end it. Just like a Remembrance Sunday silence, a bugler played The Last Post after the silence. The silence was announced during a speech by the prime minister David Cameron who said, \"There will be a national two-minute silence on Friday morning. I will be attending a service at the Thiepval Memorial near the battlefield and it's right that the whole country pauses to remember the sacrifices of all those who fought and lost their lives in that conflict.\" On 1 July 2016, a ceremony was held in Heaton Park in north Manchester in England, which was the site of a large army training camp during the war, and the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales suggested that churches conduct a Requiem Mass for the dead of the battle on the same day.\nIn Britain on 1 July 2016, 1,400 actors dressed in replica Great War British Army uniforms, walked about in streets and public open areas, from 7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. Each took on temporarily the identity of a British soldier who died on the first day of the Somme and handed out information cards about that soldier. They did not talk, except for occasionally singing \"We're here because we're here\" to the tune of \"Auld Lang Syne\". This event was called \"Ghost Soldiers\".\nHistories of the battle.\nThe Battle of the Somme has been called the beginning of modern all-arms warfare, during which Kitchener's Army learned to fight the mass-industrial war in which the continental armies had been engaged for two years. This view sees the British contribution to the battle as part of a coalition war and part of a process, which took the strategic initiative from the German Army and caused it irreparable damage, leading to its collapse in late 1918.\nHaig and General Rawlinson have been criticised ever since 1916 for the human cost of the battle and for failing to achieve their territorial objectives. On 1 August 1916, Churchill, then out of ministerial office, criticised the British Army's conduct of the offensive to the British Cabinet, claiming that though the battle had forced the Germans to end their offensive at Verdun, attrition was damaging the British armies more than the German armies. Though Churchill was unable to suggest an alternative, a critical view of the British on the Somme has been influential in English-language writing ever since. In 2016, historian Peter Barton argued in a series of three television programmes that the Battle of the Somme should be regarded as a German defensive victory.\nJohn Terraine, Gary Sheffield, Christopher Duffy, Roger Chickering, Holger Herwig, William Philpott \"et al.\" wrote that there was no strategic alternative for the British in 1916 and that an understandable horror at British losses is insular, given the millions of casualties borne by the French and Russian armies since 1914. This school of thought sets the battle in a context of a general Allied offensive in 1916 and notes that German and French writing on the battle puts it in a continental perspective. Little German and French writing on this topic has been translated, leaving much of their historical perspective and detail of German and French military operations inaccessible to the English-speaking world.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWebsites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is most commonly applied to placing a warship in active duty with its country's military forces. The ceremonies involved are often rooted in centuries-old naval tradition.\nShip naming and launching endow a ship hull with her identity, but many milestones remain before it is completed and considered ready to be designated a commissioned ship. The engineering plant, weapon and electronic systems, galley, and other equipment required to transform the new hull into an operating and habitable warship are installed and tested. The prospective commanding officer, ship's officers, the petty officers, and seamen who will form the crew report for training and familiarization with their new ship.\nBefore commissioning, the new ship undergoes sea trials to identify any deficiencies needing correction. The preparation and readiness time between christening-launching and commissioning may be as much as three years for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to as brief as twenty days for a World War II landing ship. USS \"Monitor\", of American Civil War fame, was commissioned less than three weeks after launch.\nPre-commissioning.\nRegardless of the type of ship in question, a vessel's journey towards commissioning in its nation's navy begins with a process known as sea trials. Sea trials usually take place some years after a vessel was laid down, and mark the interim step between the completion of a ship's construction and its official acceptance for service with its nation's navy.\nSea trials begin when the ship is floated out of its dry dock (or more rarely, moved by a vehicle to the sea from its construction hangar, as was the case with the submarine ), at which time the initial crew for a ship (usually a skeleton crew composed of yard workers and naval personnel; in the modern era of increasingly complex ships the crew will include technical representatives of the ship builder and major system subcontractors) will assume command of the vessel in question. The ship is then sailed in littoral waters to test the design, equipment, and other ship specific systems to ensure that they work properly and can handle the equipment that they will be using in the future. Tests during this phase can include launching missiles from missile magazines, firing the ship's gun (if so equipped), conducting basic flight tests with rotary and fixed-wing aircraft that will be assigned to the ship, and various tests of the electronic and propulsion equipment. Often during this phase of testing problems arise relating to the state of the equipment on the ship, which can require returning to the builder's shipyard to address those concerns.\nIn addition to problems with a ship's arms, armament, and equipment, the sea trial phase a ship undergoes prior to commissioning can identify issues with the ship's design that may need to be addressed before it can be accepted into service. During her sea trials in 1999 French Naval officials determined that the was too short to safely operate the E-2C Hawkeye, resulting in her return to the builder's shipyard for enlargement.\nAfter a ship has successfully cleared its sea trial period, it will officially be accepted into service with its nation's navy. At this point, the ship in question will undergo a process of degaussing and/or deperming, to reduce the ship's magnetic signature.\nCommissioning.\nOnce a ship's sea trials are successfully completed, plans for the commissioning ceremony will take shape. Depending on the naval traditions of the nation in question, the commissioning ceremony may be an elaborately planned event with guests, the ship's future crew, and other persons of interest in attendance, or the nation may forgo a ceremony and administratively place the ship in commission.\nAt a minimum, on the day on which the ship is to be commissioned the crew will report for duty aboard the ship and the commanding officer will read through the orders given for the ship and its personnel. If the ship's ceremony is a public affair, the Captain may make a speech to the audience, along with other VIPs as the ceremony dictates. Religious ceremonies, such as blessing the ship or the singing of traditional hymns or songs may also occur.\nOnce a ship has been commissioned its final step toward becoming an active unit of the navy it serves is to report to its home port and officially load or accept any remaining equipment (such as munitions).\nDecommissioning.\nTo decommission a ship is to terminate its career in service in the armed forces of a nation. Unlike wartime ship losses, in which a vessel lost to enemy action is said to be struck, decommissioning confers that the ship has reached the end of its economical service life and is being retired from a country's navy. Depending on the naval traditions of the country, a ceremony commemorating the decommissioning of the ship may take place, or the vessel may be removed administratively with minimal fanfare. The term \"paid off\" is alternatively used in British and Commonwealth contexts, originating in the age-of-sail practice of ending an officer's commission and paying crew wages once the ship completed its voyage.\nShip decommissioning usually occurs some years after the ship was commissioned and is intended to serve as a means by which a vessel that has become too old or obsolete can be retired with honor from the country's armed forces. Decommissioning of the vessel may also occur due to treaty agreements (such as the Washington Naval Treaty) or for safety reasons (such as a ship's nuclear reactor and associated parts reaching the end of their service life), depending on the type of ship being decommissioned. In a limited number of cases a ship may be decommissioned if the vessel in question is judged to be damaged beyond economical repair, as was the case with , or . In rare cases, a navy or its associated country may recommission or leave a ship that is old or obsolete in commission with the regular force rather than decommissioning the vessel in question due to the historical significance or public sentiment for the ship in question. This is the case with the ships and . Vessels preserved in this manner typically do not relinquish their names to other, more modern ships that may be in the design, planning, or construction phase of the parent nation's navy.\nPrior to its formal decommissioning, the ship in question will begin the process of decommissioning by going through a preliminary step called inactivation or deactivation. During this phase, a ship will report to a naval facility owned by the country to permit the ship's crew to offload, remove, and dismantle the ship's weapons, ammunition, electronics, and other material that is judged to be of further use to the nation. The removed material from a ship usually ends up either rotating to another ship in the class with similar weapons and/or capabilities, or in storage pending a decision on equipment's fate. During this time a ship's crew may be thinned out via transfers and reassignments as the ongoing removal of equipment renders certain personnel (such as missile technicians or gun crews) unable to perform their duties on the ship in question. Certain aspects of a ship's deactivation \u2013 such as the removal or deactivation of a ship's nuclear weapons capabilities \u2013 may be governed by international treaties, which can result in the presence of foreign officials authorized to inspect the weapon or weapon system to ensure compliance with treaties. Other aspects of a ship's decommissioning, such as the reprocessing of nuclear fuel from a ship utilizing a nuclear reactor or the removal of hazardous materials from a ship, are handled by the government according to the nation's domestic policies. When a ship finishes its inactivation, it is then formally decommissioned, after which the ship is usually towed to a storage facility.\nIn addition to the economic advantages of retiring a ship that has grown maintenance intensive or obsolete, the decommissioning frees up the name used by the ship, allowing vessels currently in the planning or building stages to inherit the name of that warship. Often, but not always, ships that are decommissioned spend the next few years in a reserve fleet before their ultimate fate is decided.\nPractices by nation.\nUnited States Navy.\nCommissioning in the early United States Navy under sail was attended by no ceremony. An officer designated to command a new ship received orders similar to those issued to Captain Thomas Truxtun in 1798:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sir, I have it in command from the president of the United States, to direct you to repair with all due speed on board the ship \"Constellation\" lying at Baltimore. It is required that no Time be lost in carrying the Ship into deep water, taking on board her Cannon, Ammunition, Water, Provisions &amp; Stores of every kind \u2014 completing what work is yet to be done shipping her Complement of Seamen and Marines, and preparing her in every respect for Sea ... It is the President's express Orders, that you employ the most vigorous Exertions, to accomplish these several Objects and to put your Ship as speedily as possible in a situation to sail at the shortest notice.\nIn Truxtun's time, the prospective commanding officer had responsibility for overseeing construction details, outfitting the ship, and recruiting his crew. When a captain determined that his new ship was ready to take to sea, he mustered the crew on deck, read his orders, broke the national ensign and distinctive commissioning pennant, and caused the watch to be set and the first entry to be made in the log. Thus, the ship was placed in commission.\nCommissionings were not public affairs, and unlike christening-and-launching ceremonies, were not recorded by newspapers. The first specific reference to commissioning located in naval records is a letter of November 6, 1863, from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to all navy yards and stations. The Secretary directed: \"Hereafter the commandants of navy yards and stations will inform the Department, by special report of the date when each vessel preparing for sea service at their respective commands, is placed in commission.\"\nSubsequently, various editions of Navy regulations mentioned the act of putting a ship in commission, but details of a commissioning ceremony were not prescribed. Through custom and usage, a fairly standard practice emerged, the essentials of which are outlined in current Navy regulations. Craft assigned to Naval Districts and shore bases for local use, such as harbor tugs and floating drydocks, are not usually placed in commission but are instead given an \"in service\" status. They do fly the national ensign, but not a commissioning pennant.\nIn modern times, officers and crew members of a new warship are assembled on the quarterdeck or other suitable area. Formal transfer of the ship to the prospective commanding officer is done by the Chief of Naval Operations or his representative. The national anthem is played, the transferring officer reads the commissioning directive, the ensign is hoisted, and the commissioning pennant broken. The prospective commanding officer reads his orders, assumes command, and the first watch is set. Following, the sponsor is traditionally invited to give the first order to the ship's company: \"Man our ship and bring her to life!\", whereupon the ship's assigned crew would run on board and man the rails of the ship.\nIn recent years, commissionings have become more public occasions. Most commonly assisted by a Commissioning Support Team (CST), the Prospective Commanding Officer and ship's crew, shipbuilder executives, and senior Navy representatives gather for a formal ceremony placing the ship in active service (in commission). Guests, including the ship's sponsor, are frequently invited to attend, and a prominent individual delivers a commissioning address. On May 3, 1975, more than 20,000 people witnessed the commissioning of at Norfolk, Virginia. The carrier's sponsor, daughter of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, was introduced, and U.S. President Gerald R. Ford was the principal speaker.\nRegardless of the type of ship, the brief commissioning ceremony completes the cycle from christening and launching to bring the ship into full status as a warship of her nation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain&amp;colon; U.S. Navy (1975) \"Ships of the United States Navy: Christening, Launching and Commissioning, Second Edition\"; prepared for and published by the Naval History Division of the Department of the Navy, Washington, D.C."}

It is a nautical tradition in many cultures, dating back millennia, to accompany the physical process with ceremonies which have been observed as public celebration and a solemn blessing, usually but not always, in association with the launch itself.\nShip launching imposes stresses on the ship not met during normal operation and in addition to the size and weight of the vessel represents a considerable engineering challenge as well as a public spectacle. The process also involves many traditions intended to invite good luck, such as christening by breaking a sacrificial bottle of champagne over the bow as the ship is named aloud and launched.\nMethods.\nThere are three principal methods of conveying a new ship from building site to water, only two of which are called \"launching\". The oldest, most familiar, and most widely used is the end-on launch, in which the vessel slides down an inclined slipway, usually stern first. With the side launch, the ship enters the water broadside. This method came into use in the 19th century on inland waters, rivers, and lakes, and was more widely adopted during World War II. The third method is float-out, used for ships that are built in basins or dry docks and then floated by admitting water into the dock.\nIf launched in a restrictive waterway, drag chains are used to slow the ship speed to prevent it striking the opposite bank.\nStern-first.\nNormally, ways are arranged perpendicular to the shore line (or as nearly so as the water and maximum length of vessel allows) and the ship is built with its stern facing the water. Where the launch takes place into a narrow river, the building slips may be at a shallow angle rather than perpendicular, even though this requires a longer slipway when launching. Modern slipways take the form of a reinforced concrete mat of sufficient strength to support the vessel, with two \"barricades\" that extend well below the water level taking into account tidal variations. The barricades support the two launch ways. The vessel is built upon temporary cribbing that is arranged to give access to the hull's outer bottom and to allow the launchways to be erected under the complete hull. When it is time to prepare for launching, a pair of standing ways is erected under the hull and out onto the barricades. The surface of the ways is greased. (Tallow and whale oil were used as grease in sailing ship days.) \nA pair of sliding ways is placed on top, under the hull, and a launch cradle with bow and stern poppets is erected on these sliding ways. The weight of the hull is then transferred from the build cribbing onto the launch cradle. Provision is made to hold the vessel in place and then release it at the appropriate moment in the launching ceremony; common mechanisms include weak links designed to be cut at a signal and mechanical triggers controlled by a switch from the ceremonial platform.\nOn launching, the vessel slides backwards down the slipway on the ways until it floats by itself.\nSideways.\nSome slipways are built so that the vessel is side-on to the water and is launched sideways. This is done where the limitations of the water channel would not allow lengthwise launching, but occupies a much greater length of shore. \"The Great Eastern\" designed by Brunel was built this way, as were many landing craft during World War II. This method requires many more sets of ways to support the weight of the ship.\nAir-bag.\nSometimes ships are launched using a series of inflated tubes underneath the hull, which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water. This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull of the ship and aid its launching motion into the water, thus this method is arguably safer than other options such as sideways launching. These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with hemispherical heads at both ends.\nTraditions.\nAncient.\nA Babylonian narrative dating from the 3rd millennium BC describes the completion of a ship:\nOpenings to the water I stopped;&lt;br&gt;\nI searched for cracks and the wanting parts I fixed:&lt;br&gt;\nThree \"sari\" of bitumen I poured over the outside;&lt;br&gt;\nTo the gods I caused oxen to be sacrificed.\nIt is believed that ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans called on their gods to protect seamen. Favor was evoked from the monarch of the seas\u2014Poseidon in Greek mythology, Neptune in Roman mythology. Ship launching participants in ancient Greece wreathed their heads with olive branches, drank wine to honor the gods, and poured water on the new vessel as a symbol of blessing. Shrines were carried on board Greek and Roman ships, and this practice extended into the Middle Ages. The shrine was usually placed at the quarterdeck, an area which continues to have special ceremonial significance.\nDifferent peoples and cultures shaped the religious ceremonies surrounding a ship launching. Jews and Christians customarily used wine and water as they called upon God to safeguard them at sea. Intercession of the saints and the blessing of the church were asked by Christians. Ship launchings in the Ottoman Empire were accompanied by prayers to Allah, the sacrifice of sheep, and appropriate feasting.\nChaplain Henry Teonge of Britain's Royal Navy left an interesting account of a warship launch, a \"briganteen of 23 oars,\" by the Knights of Malta in 1675:\nTwo fryers and an attendant went into the vessel, and kneeling down prayed halfe an houre, and layd their hands on every mast, and other places of the vessel, and sprinkled her all over with holy water. Then they came out and hoysted a pendent to signify she was a man of war; then at once thrust her into the water.\nEarly Modern Age.\nThe liturgical aspects of ship christenings, or baptisms, continued in Catholic countries, while the Reformation seems to have put a stop to them for a time in Protestant Europe. By the 17th century, for example, English launchings were secular affairs. The christening party for the launch of the 64-gun ship of the line in 1610 included the Prince of Wales and famed naval constructor Phineas Pett, who was master shipwright at the Woolwich yard. Pett described the proceedings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"standing cup\" was a large cup fashioned of precious metal. When the ship began to slide down the ways, the presiding official took a ceremonial sip of wine from the cup, and poured the rest on the deck or over the bow. Usually the cup was thrown overboard and belonged to the lucky retriever. As navies grew larger and launchings more frequent, economy dictated that the costly cup be caught in a net for reuse at other launchings. Late in 17th century Britain, the standing-cup ceremony was replaced by the practice of breaking a bottle across the bow.\nBy country.\nLaunching could be said to mark the birth of a vessel; and people throughout history have performed launching ceremonies, in part to appeal for good fortune and the safety of each new vessel.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, Aboriginal peoples will perform ceremonies at the launching of vessels along with other methods of launching.\nFrance.\nFrench ship launchings and christenings in the 18th and early 19th centuries were accompanied by unique rites closely resembling marriage and baptismal ceremonies. A godfather for the new ship presented a godmother with a bouquet of flowers as both said the ship's name. No bottle was broken, but a priest pronounced the vessel's name and blessed it with holy water.\nIndia.\nIn India, ships have historically been launched with a Puja ceremony that dedicates the ship to a Hindu god or goddess, and seeks blessings for her and her sailors. Historically, Hindu priests would perform the \"puja\" ceremony at launch. In the 20th century, ships were launched with a lady breaking a coconut on the bow of the vessel, which is sometimes followed by a small Puja.\nJapan.\nJapanese ship launchings incorporate silver axes which are thought to bring good luck and scare away evil. Japanese shipbuilders traditionally order the crafting of a special axe for each new vessel; and after the launching ceremony, they present the axe to the vessel's owner as a commemorative gift. The axe is used to cut the rope which tethers the ship to the place where she was built.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSponsors of British warships were customarily members of the royal family, senior naval officers, or Admiralty officials. A few civilians were invited to sponsor Royal Navy ships during the nineteenth century, and women became sponsors for the first time. In 1875, a religious element was returned to naval christenings by Princess Alexandra, wife of the Prince of Wales, when she introduced an Anglican choral service in the launching ceremony for battleship . The usage continues with the singing of Psalm 107 with its special meaning to mariners:\nThey that go down to the sea in ships;&lt;br&gt;\nThat do business in great waters;&lt;br&gt;\nThese see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.\nIn 1969, Queen Elizabeth II named the ocean liner \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" after herself, instead of the older liner , by saying, \"I name this ship \"Queen Elizabeth the Second\". May God bless her and all who sail in her.\" On 4 July 2014, the Queen named the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier with a bottle of single malt Scotch whisky from the Bowmore distillery on the island of Islay instead of champagne because the ship had been built and launched in Scotland. The Duchess of Rothesay similarly launched by pulling a lever which smashed a bottle of single malt Scotch whisky at the side of the ship.\nAt the 2024 launching of CalMac ferry \"Glen Rosa\", newly-qualified welder Beth Atkinson named the ship and pulled a lever to similarly smash a bottle, of single malt from the Ardgowan distillery at nearby Inverkip.\nShipyard ephemera is a rich source of detail concerning a launch and this was often material produced for the audience of the day and then thrown away. Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums has many of these items from Tyne and Wear shipyards. A number can be seen in http://. The 1900 piece for reproduced in this article lists a woman performing the launch.\nUnited States.\nCeremonial practices for christening and launching ships in the United States have their roots in Europe. Descriptions are not plentiful for launching American Revolutionary War naval vessels, but a local newspaper detailed the launch of Continental frigate at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in May 1776:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On Tuesday the 21st inst. the Continental Frigate of thirty-two guns, built at this place... was Launched amidst the acclamation of many thousand spectators. She is esteemed by all those who are judges that have seen her, to be one of the compleatest ships ever built in America. The unwearied diligence and care of the three Master-Builders... and the good order and industry of the Carpenters, deserve particular notice; scarcely a single instance of a person's being in liquor, or any difference among the men in the yard during the time of her building, every man with pleasure exerting himself to the utmost: and altho' the greatest care was taken that only the best of timber was used, and the work perform'd in a most masterly manner, the whole time from her raising to the day she launched did not exceed sixty working days, and what afforded a most pleasing view (which was manifest in the countenances of the Spectators) this noble fabrick was completely to her anchors in the main channel, in less than six minutes from the time she run, without the least hurt; and what is truly remarkable, not a single person met with the least accident in launching, tho' near five hundred men were employed in and about her when run off.\nIt was customary for the builders to celebrate a ship launching. Rhode Island authorities were charged with overseeing construction of frigates and . They voted the sum of fifty dollars () to the master builder of each yard \"to be expended in providing an entertainment for the carpenters that worked on the ships.\" Five pounds () was spent for lime juice for the launching festivities of frigate at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suggesting that the \"entertainment\" included a potent punch with lime juice as an ingredient.\nNo mention has come to light of christening a Continental Navy ship during the American Revolution. The first ships of the Continental Navy were , , , and . These were former merchantmen, and their names were assigned during conversion and outfitting. Later, Congress authorized the construction of thirteen frigates, and no names were assigned until after four had launched.\nThe first description that we have of an American warship christening is that of at Boston, October 21, 1797, famous as \"Old Ironsides.\" Her sponsor was Captain James Sever, USN, who stood on the weather deck at the bow. \"At fifteen minutes after twelve she commenced a movement into the water with such steadiness, majesty and exactness as to fill every heart with sensations of joy and delight.\" As \"Constitution\" ran out, Captain Sever broke a bottle of fine old Madeira over the heel of the bowsprit.\nFrigate had an interesting launching on April 10, 1800, at New York:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWas launched yesterday morning, at ten o'clock, in the presence of perhaps as great a concourse of people as ever assembled in this city on any occasion. At nine, captain Ten-Eyck's company of artillery..., accompanied by the uniform volunteer companies of the sixth regiment and the corps of riflemen, marched in procession... and took their station alongside the frigate. Everything being prepared, and the most profound silence prevailing... At a given signal she glided into the waters, a sublime spectacle of gracefulnes and grandeur. Immediately on touching the water federal salutes were fired from the sloop of war \"Portsmouth\", the revenue cutter \"Jay\" and the \"Aspasia\", Indiaman. These were returned by the uniform companies on shore, who fired a feu-de-joye, and marched off the ground to the battery... and were dismissed.\nAs the 19th century progressed, American ship launchings continued to be festive occasions, but with no set ritual except that the sponsor(s) used some \"christening fluid\" as the ship received her name.\nSloop of war was launched in 1828 and was \"christened by a young lady of Portsmouth.\" This is the first known instance of a woman sponsoring a United States Navy vessel. The contemporaneous account does not name her. The first \"identified\" woman sponsor was Lavinia Fanning Watson, daughter of a prominent Philadelphian. She broke a bottle of wine and water over the bow of sloop-of-war at Philadelphia Navy Yard on August 22, 1846.\nWomen as sponsors became increasingly the rule, but not universally so. As sloop-of-war \"glided along the inclined plane\" in 1846, \"two young sailors, one stationed at each side of her head, anointed her with bottles, and named her as she left her cradle for the deep.\" As late as 1898, the torpedo boat was christened by the son of the builder.\nWine is the traditional christening fluid, although numerous other liquids have been used. and were sent on their way in 1843 with whisky. Seven years later, \"a bottle of best brandy was broken over the bow of steam sloop .\" Steam frigate earned her place in naval history as Confederate States of America ironclad , and she was baptized with water from the Merrimack River. Admiral David Farragut's famous American Civil War flagship steam sloop was christened by three sponsors; two young ladies broke bottles of Connecticut River water and Hartford, Connecticut spring water, while a naval lieutenant completed the ceremony with a bottle of sea water.\nChampagne came into popular use as a christening fluid as the 19th century closed. A granddaughter of Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy wet the bow of , the Navy's first steel battleship, with champagne at the New York Navy Yard on November 18, 1890. The effects of national prohibition on alcoholic beverages were reflected to some extent in ship christenings. Cruisers and , for example, were christened with water; the submarine \"V-6\" with cider. However, battleship appropriately received her name with California wine in 1919. Champagne returned in 1922, but only for the launch of light cruiser .\nRigid naval airships , , , and were built during the 1920s and early 1930s, carried on the Naval Vessel Register, and each was formally commissioned. The earliest First Lady of the United States to act as sponsor was Grace Coolidge who christened the airship \"Los Angeles\". Lou Henry Hoover christened \"Akron\" in 1931, but the customary bottle was not used. Instead, the First Lady pulled a cord which opened a hatch in the airship's towering nose to release a flock of pigeons.\nThousands of ships of every description came off the ways during World War II, the concerted effort of a mobilized American industry. The historic christening and launching ceremonies continued, but travel restrictions, other wartime considerations, and sheer numbers dictated that such occasions be less elaborate than those in the years before the war. \nOn 15 December 1941, the United States Maritime Commission announced that all formal launching ceremonies would be discontinued for merchant ships being constructed under its authority, though simple informal ceremonies could continue without reimbursement to builders.\nIn recent history, all U.S. Navy sponsors have been female. In addition to the ceremonial breaking of a champagne bottle on the bow, the sponsor remains in contact with the ship's crew and is involved in special events such as homecomings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the noumenon, which \"cannot\" be directly observed. Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. Far predating this, the ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus also used \"phenomenon\" and \"noumenon\" as interrelated technical terms.\nCommon usage.\nIn popular usage, a \"phenomenon\" often refers to an extraordinary, unusual, or notable event. According to the \"Dictionary of Visual Discourse\":In ordinary language 'phenomenon/phenomena' refer to any noteworthy occurrence and investigation, typically an untoward or unusual event, person or fact that is of special significance or otherwise notable.\nPhilosophy.\nIn modern philosophical use, the term \"phenomena\" means things as they are experienced through the senses and processed by the mind as distinct from things in and of themselves (\"noumena\"). In his inaugural dissertation, titled \"On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World\", Immanuel Kant (1770) theorizes that the human mind is restricted to the logical world and thus can only interpret and understand occurrences according to their physical appearances. He wrote that humans could infer only as much as their senses allowed, but not experience the actual object itself. Thus, the term \"phenomenon\" refers to any incident deserving of inquiry and investigation, especially processes and events which are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance.\nScience.\nIn scientific usage, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, including the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data. Especially in physics, the study of a phenomenon may be described as measurements related to matter, energy, or time, such as Isaac Newton's observations of the Moon's orbit and of gravity; or Galileo Galilei's observations of the motion of a pendulum.\nIn natural sciences, a phenomenon is an observable happening or event. Often, this term is used without considering the causes of a particular event. Example of a physical phenomenon is an observable phenomenon of the lunar orbit or the phenomenon of oscillations of a pendulum.\nA mechanical phenomenon is a physical phenomenon associated with the equilibrium or motion of objects. Some examples are Newton's cradle, engines, and double pendulums.\nSociology.\nGroup phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its own behaviors not possible for an individual because of the herd mentality.\nSocial phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term. Attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group, and either be adapted by the larger society, or seen as aberrant, being punished or shunned.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Sudarium (Latin for \"sweat cloth\") is thought to be the cloth that was wrapped around the head of Jesus Christ after he died.\nThe small chapel housing it was built specifically for the cloth by King Alfonso II of Asturias in AD 840; the Arca Santa is an elaborate reliquary chest with a Romanesque metal frontal for the storage of the Sudarium and other relics. The Sudarium is displayed to the public three times a year: Good Friday, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on 14 September, and its octave on 21 September.\nBackground and history.\nThe Sudarium shows signs of advanced deterioration, with dark flecks that are symmetrically arranged but form no image, unlike the markings on the Shroud of Turin. The sudarium is linked to a face cloth in the empty tomb mentioned by . Outside of the Bible, the anonymous pilgrim of Piacenza recorded in 570 AD that he visited a cave on the Jordan rumored to have the face cloth mentioned in John.\nPelagius of Oviedo, a bishop of medieval Spain, gives an account of the Sudarium's history from the Holy Land to Spain preserved in the \"Liber testamentorum\" and interpolated into the \"Chronica ad Sebastianum\" in the \"Liber chronicorum\".\nThis account claims the Sudarium was taken from Israel in 614 AD, after the invasion of the Byzantine provinces by the Sassanid Persian King Khosrau II. To avoid destruction in the invasion, it was taken away first to Alexandria by the presbyter Philip, who then carried it through northern Africa when Khosrau II conquered Alexandria in 616 AD, and arrived in Spain shortly thereafter. The Sudarium entered Spain at Cartagena, along with people who were fleeing from the Persians. Fulgentius, bishop of Ecija, welcomed the refugees and the relics, and gave the chest containing the Sudarium to Leandro, bishop of Seville. He took it to Seville, where it spent some years.\nIn 657 it was moved to Toledo, then in 718 on to northern Spain to escape the advancing Moors. The Sudarium was hidden in the mountains of Asturias in a cave known as Montesacro until King Alfonso II, having battled back the Moors, built a chapel in Oviedo to house it in 840 AD.\nOn 14 March 1075, King Alfonso VI, his sister and Rodrigo Diaz Vivar (El Cid) opened the chest after days of fasting.

{"id": "60933", "revid": "45806405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60933", "title": "Triboelectric effect", "text": "Charge transfer due to contact or sliding\nThe triboelectric effect (also known as triboelectricity, triboelectric charging, triboelectrification, or tribocharging) describes electric charge transfer between two objects when they contact or slide against each other. It can occur with different materials, such as the sole of a shoe on a carpet, or between two pieces of the same material. It is ubiquitous, and occurs with differing amounts of charge transfer (tribocharge) for all solid materials. There is evidence that tribocharging can occur between combinations of solids, liquids and gases, for instance liquid flowing in a solid tube or an aircraft flying through air.\nOften static electricity is a consequence of the triboelectric effect when the charge stays on one or both of the objects and is not conducted away. The term triboelectricity has been used to refer to the field of study or the general phenomenon of the triboelectric effect, or to the static electricity that results from it. When there is no sliding, tribocharging is sometimes called contact electrification, and any static electricity generated is sometimes called contact electricity. The terms are often used interchangeably, and may be confused.\nTriboelectric charge plays a major role in industries\u00a0such as packaging of pharmaceutical powders, and in many processes such as dust storms and planetary formation. It can also increase friction and adhesion. While many aspects of the triboelectric effect are now understood and extensively documented, significant disagreements remain in the current literature about the underlying details.\nHistory.\nThe historical development of triboelectricity is interwoven with work on static electricity and electrons themselves. Experiments involving triboelectricity and static electricity occurred before the discovery of the electron. The name \u0113lektron (\u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) is Greek for amber, which is connected to the recording of electrostatic charging by Thales of Miletus around 585 BC, and possibly others even earlier. The prefix \"\" (Greek for 'rub') refers to sliding, friction and related processes, as in tribology.\nFrom the axial age (8th to 3rd century BC) the attraction of materials due to static electricity by rubbing amber and the attraction of magnetic materials were considered to be similar or the same. There are indications that it was known both in Europe and outside, for instance China and other places. Syrian women used amber whorls in weaving and exploited the triboelectric properties, as noted by Pliny the Elder.\nThe effect was mentioned in records from the medieval period. Archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica, Greek scholar and writer of the 12th century, records that Woliver, king of the Goths, could draw sparks from his body. He also states that a philosopher was able, while dressing, to draw sparks from his clothes, similar to the report by Robert Symmer of his silk stocking experiments, which may be found in the 1759 Philosophical Transactions.\nIt is generally considered that the first major scientific analysis was by William Gilbert in his publication De Magnete in 1600. He discovered that many more materials than amber such as sulphur, wax, glass could produce static electricity when rubbed, and that moisture prevented electrification. Others such as Sir Thomas Browne made important contributions slightly later, both in terms of materials and the first use of the word electricity in Pseudodoxia Epidemica. He noted that metals did not show triboelectric charging, perhaps because the charge was conducted away. An important step was around 1663 when Otto von Guericke invented a machine that could automate triboelectric charge generation, making it much easier to produce more tribocharge; other electrostatic generators followed. For instance, shown in the Figure is an electrostatic generator built by Francis Hauksbee the Younger. Another key development was in the 1730s when C. F. du Fay pointed out that there were two types of charge which he named \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\". These names corresponded to the glass (vitreous) rods and bituminous coal, amber, or sealing wax (resinous) used in du Fay's experiments. These names were used throughout the 19th century. The use of the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" for types of electricity grew out of the independent work of Benjamin Franklin around 1747 where he ascribed electricity to an over- or under- abundance of an electrical fluid.\nAt about the same time Johan Carl Wilcke published in his 1757 PhD thesis a triboelectric series. In this work materials were listed in order of the polarity of charge separation when they are touched or slide against another. A material towards the bottom of the series, when touched to a material near the top of the series, will acquire a more negative charge.\nThe first systematic analysis of triboelectricity is considered to be the work of Jean Claude Eug\u00e8ne P\u00e9clet in 1834. He studied triboelectric charging for a range of conditions such as the material, pressure and rubbing of surfaces. It was some time before there were further quantitative works by Owen in 1909 and Jones in 1915. The most extensive early set of experimental analyses was from 1914\u20131930 by the group of Professor Shaw, who laid much of the foundation of experimental knowledge. In a series of papers he: was one of the first to mention some of the failings of the triboelectric series, also showing that heat had a major effect on tribocharging; analyzed in detail where different materials would fall in a triboelectric series, at the same time pointing out anomalies; separately analyzed glass and solid elements and solid elements and textiles, carefully measuring both tribocharging and friction; analyzed charging due to air-blown particles; demonstrated that surface strain and relaxation played a critical role for a range of materials, and examined the tribocharging of many different elements with silica.\nMuch of this work predates an understanding of solid state variations of energies levels with position, and also band bending. It was in the early 1950s in the work of authors such as Vick that these were taken into account along with concepts such as quantum tunnelling and behavior such as Schottky barrier effects, as well as including models such as asperities for contacts based upon the work of Frank Philip Bowden and David Tabor.\nBasic characteristics.\nTriboelectric charging occurs when two materials are brought into contact then separated, or slide against each other. An example is rubbing a plastic pen on a shirt sleeve made of cotton, wool, polyester, or the blended fabrics used in modern clothing. An electrified pen will attract and pick up pieces of paper less than a square centimeter, and will repel a similarly electrified pen. This repulsion is detectable by hanging both pens on threads and setting them near one another. Such experiments led to the theory of two types of electric charge, one being the negative of the other, with a simple sum respecting signs giving the total charge. The electrostatic attraction of the charged plastic pen to neutral uncharged pieces of paper (for example) is due to induced dipolesChapter 27 in the paper.\nThe triboelectric effect can be unpredictable because many details are often not controlled. Phenomena which do not have a simple explanation have been known for many years. For instance, as early as 1910, Jaimeson observed that for a piece of cellulose, the sign of the charge was dependent upon whether it was bent concave or convex during rubbing. The same behavior with curvature was reported in 1917 by Shaw, who noted that the effect of curvature with different materials made them either more positive or negative. In 1920, Richards pointed out that for colliding particles the velocity and mass played a role, not just what the materials were. In 1926, Shaw pointed out that with two pieces of identical material, the sign of the charge transfer from \"rubber\" to \"rubbed\" could change with time.\nThere are other more recent experimental results which also do not have a simple explanation. For instance the work of Burgo and Erdemir, which showed that the sign of charge transfer reverses between when a tip is pushing into a substrate versus when it pulls out; the detailed work of Lee \"et al.\" and Forward, Lacks and Sankaran and others measuring the charge transfer during collisions between particles of zirconia of different size but the same composition, with one size charging positive, the other negative; the observations using sliding or Kelvin probe force microscope of inhomogeneous charge variations between nominally identical materials.\nThe details of how and why tribocharging occurs are not established science as of 2023. One component is the difference in the work function (also called the electron affinity) between the two materials. This can lead to charge transfer as, for instance, analyzed by Harper. As has been known since at least 1953, the contact potential is part of the process but does not explain many results, such as the ones mentioned in the last two paragraphs. Many studies have pointed out issues with the work function difference (Volta potential) as a complete explanation. There is also the question of why sliding is often important. Surfaces have many nanoscale asperities where the contact is taking place, which has been taken into account in many approaches to triboelectrification. Alessandro Volta and Hermann von Helmholtz suggested that the role of sliding was to produce more contacts per second. In modern terms, the idea is that electrons move many times faster than atoms, so the electrons are always in equilibrium when atoms move (the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation). With this approximation, each asperity contact during sliding is equivalent to a stationary one; there is no direct coupling between the sliding velocity and electron motion. An alternative view (beyond the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation) is that sliding acts as a quantum mechanical pump which can excite electrons to go from one material to another. A different suggestion is that local heating during sliding matters, an idea first suggested by Frenkel in 1941. Other papers have considered that local bending at the nanoscale produces voltages which help drive charge transfer via the flexoelectric effect. There are also suggestions that surface or trapped charges are important. More recently there have been attempts to include a full solid state description.\nExplanations and mechanisms.\nFrom early work starting around the end of the 19th century a large amount of information is available about what, empirically, causes triboelectricity. While there is extensive experimental data on triboelectricity there is not as yet full scientific consensus on the source, or perhaps more probably the sources. Some aspects are established, and will be part of the full picture:\nTriboelectric series.\nAn empirical approach to triboelectricity is a triboelectric series\".\" This is a list of materials ordered by how they develop a charge relative to other materials on the list. Johan Carl Wilcke published the first one in a 1757 paper. The series was expanded by Shaw and Henniker by including natural and synthetic polymers, and included alterations in the sequence depending on surface and environmental conditions. Lists vary somewhat as to the order of some materials.\nAnother triboelectric series based on measuring the triboelectric charge density of materials was proposed by the group of Zhong Lin Wang. The triboelectric charge density of the tested materials was measured with respect to liquid mercury in a glove box under well-defined conditions, with fixed temperature, pressure and humidity.\nIt is known that this approach is too simple and unreliable. There are many observed cases of triboelectric interactions that are intransitive with respect to the materials involved, an issue mentioned by Shaw in 1914. There exist materials A, B, and C, where A charges positively when rubbed against B, B charges positively when rubbed against C, and C charges positively when rubbed against A. This cyclic relation cannot be explained by the a linear triboelectric series. Furthermore, there are many cases where charging occurs with contacts between two pieces of the same material. This has been modelled as a consequence of the electric fields from local bending (flexoelectricity).\nWork function differences.\nIn all materials there is a positive electrostatic potential from the positive atomic nuclei, partially balanced by a negative electrostatic potential of what can be described as a sea of electrons. The average potential is positive, what is called the \"mean inner potential\" (MIP). Different materials have different MIPs, depending upon the types of atoms and how close they are. At a surface the electrons also spill out a little into the vacuum, as analyzed in detail by Kohn and Liang. This leads to a dipole at the surface. Combined, the dipole and the MIP lead to a potential barrier for electrons to leave a material which is called the work function.\nA rationalization of the triboelectric series is that different members have different work functions, so electrons can go from the material with a small work function to one with a large. The potential difference between the two materials is called the Volta potential, also called the \"contact potential\". Experiments have validated the importance of this for metals and other materials. However, because the surface dipoles vary for different surfaces of any solid the contact potential is not a universal parameter. By itself it cannot explain many of the results which were established in the early 20th century.\nFor completeness, it should be mentioned that the original concept of a Volta potential came from a model to explain the function of an electric battery (Voltaic pile). The concept was a simplified form where contact between two metals led to a force to transfer electrons, what is called contact tension. This was extensively debated in the 19th century, the conclusion being that this was not the driving force for battery operation.\nElectromechanical contributions.\nWhenever a solid is strained, electric fields can be generated. One process is due to linear strains, and is called piezoelectricity, the second depends upon how rapidly strains are changing with distance (derivative) and is called flexoelectricity. Both are established science, and can be both measured and calculated using density functional theory methods. Because flexoelectricity depends upon a gradient it can be much larger at the nanoscale during sliding or contact of asperity between two objects.\nThere has been considerable work on the connection between piezoelectricity and triboelectricity. While it can be important, piezoelectricity only occurs in the small number of materials which do not have inversion symmetry, so it is not a general explanation. It has recently been suggested that flexoelectricity may be very important in triboelectricity as it occurs in all insulators and semiconductors. Quite a few of the experimental results such as the effect of curvature can be explained by this approach, although full details have not as yet been determined. There is also early work from Shaw and Hanstock, and from the group of Daniel Lacks demonstrating that strain matters.\nCapacitor charge compensation model.\nAn explanation that has appeared in different forms is analogous to charge on a capacitor. If there is a potential difference between two materials due to the difference in their work functions (contact potential), this can be thought of as equivalent to the potential difference across a capacitor. The charge to compensate this is that which cancels the electric field. If an insulating dielectric is in between the two materials, then this will lead to a polarization density formula_1 and a bound surface charge of formula_2, where formula_3 is the surface normal. The total charge in the capacitor is then the combination of the bound surface charge from the polarization and that from the potential.\nThe triboelectric charge from this compensation model has been frequently considered as a key component. If the additional polarization due to strain (piezoelectricity) or bending of samples (flexoelectricity) is included this can explain observations such as the effect of curvature or inhomogeneous charging.\nElectron and/or ion transfer.\nThere is debate about whether electrons or ions are transferred in triboelectricity. For instance, Harper discusses both possibilities, whereas Vick was more in favor of electron transfer. The debate remains to this day with, for instance, George M. Whitesides advocating for ions, while Diaz and Fenzel-Alexander as well as Laurence D. Marks support both, and others just electrons.\nThermodynamic irreversibility.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century the Soviet school led by chemist Boris Derjaguin argued that triboelectricity and the associated phenomenon of triboluminescence are fundamentally irreversible. A similar point of view to Derjaguin's has been more recently advocated by Seth Putterman and his collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nA proposed theory of triboelectricity as a fundamentally irreversible process was published in 2020 by theoretical physicists Robert Alicki and Alejandro Jenkins. They argued that the electrons in the two materials that slide against each other have different velocities, giving a non-equilibrium state. Quantum effects cause this imbalance to pump electrons from one material to the other. This is a fermionic analog of the mechanism of rotational superradiance originally described by Yakov Zeldovich for bosons. Electrons are pumped in both directions, but small differences in the electronic potential landscapes for the two surfaces can cause net charging. Alicki and Jenkins argue that such an irreversible pumping is needed to understand how the triboelectric effect can generate an electromotive force.\nHumidity.\nGenerally, increased humidity (water in the air) leads to a decrease in the magnitude of triboelectric charging. The size of this effect varies greatly depending on the contacting materials; the decrease in charging ranges from up to a factor of 10 or more to very little humidity dependence. Some experiments find increased charging at moderate humidity compared to extremely dry conditions before a subsequent decrease at higher humidity. The most widespread explanation is that higher humidity leads to more water adsorbed at the surface of contacting materials, leading to a higher surface conductivity. The higher conductivity allows for greater charge recombination as contacts separate, resulting in a smaller transfer of charge. Another proposed explanation for humidity effects considers the case when charge transfer is observed to increase with humidity in dry conditions. Increasing humidity may lead to the formation of water bridges between contacting materials that promote the transfer of ions.\nExamples.\nFriction and adhesion from tribocharging.\nFriction is a retarding force due to different energy dissipation process such as elastic and plastic deformation, phonon and electron excitation, and also adhesion. As an example, in a car or any other vehicle the wheels elastically deform as they roll. Part of the energy needed for this deformation is recovered (elastic deformation), some is not and goes into heating the tires. The energy which is not recovered contributes to the back force, a process called rolling friction.\nSimilar to rolling friction there are energy terms in charge transfer, which contribute to friction. In static friction there is coupling between elastic strains, polarization and surface charge which contributes to the frictional force. In sliding friction, when asperities contact and there is charge transfer, some of the charge returns as the contacts are released, some does not and will contribute to the macroscopically observed friction. There is evidence for a retarding Coulomb force between asperities of different charges, and an increase in the adhesion from contact electrification when geckos walk on water. There is also evidence of connections between jerky (stick\u2013slip) processes during sliding with charge transfer, electrical discharge and x-ray emission. How large the triboelectric contribution is to friction has been debated. It has been suggested by some that it may dominate for polymers, whereas Harper has argued that it is small.\nLiquids and gases.\nThe generation of static electricity from the relative motion of liquids or gases is well established, with one of the first analyses in 1886 by Lord Kelvin in his water dropper which used falling drops to create an electric generator. Liquid mercury is a special case as it typically acts as a simple metal, so has been used as a reference electrode. More common is water, and electricity due to water droplets hitting surfaces has been documented since the discovery by Philipp Lenard in 1892 of the \"spray electrification\" or \"waterfall effect\". This is when falling water generates static electricity either by collisions between water drops or with the ground, leading to the finer mist in updrafts being mainly negatively charged, with positive near the lower surface. It can also occur for sliding drops.\nAnother type of charge can be produced during rapid solidification of water containing ions, which is called the \"Workman\u2013Reynolds effect\". During the solidification the positive and negative ions may not be equally distributed between the liquid and solid. For instance, in thunderstorms this can contribute (together with the waterfall effect) to separation of positive hydrogen ions and negative hydroxide ions, leading to static charge and lightning.\nA third class is associated with contact potential differences between liquids or gases and other materials, similar to the work function differences for solids. It has been suggested that a triboelectric series for liquids is useful. One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938.\nFinally, with liquids there can be flow-rate gradients at interfaces, and also viscosity gradients. These can produce electric fields and also polarization of the liquid, a field called electrohydrodynamics. These are analogous to the electromechanical terms for solids where electric fields can occur due to elastic strains as described earlier.\nPowders.\nDuring commercial powder processing or in natural processes such as dust storms, triboelectric charge transfer can occur. There can be electric fields of up to 160kV/m with moderate wind conditions, which leads to Coulomb forces of about the same magnitude as gravity. There does not need to be air present, significant charging can occur, for instance, on airless planetary bodies. With pharmaceutic powders and other commercial powders the tribocharging needs to be controlled for quality control of the materials and doses. Static discharge is also a particular hazard in grain elevators owing to the danger of a dust explosion, in places that store explosive powders, and in many other cases. Triboelectric powder separation has been discussed as a method of separating powders, for instance different biopolymers. The principle here is that different degrees of charging can be exploited for electrostatic separation, a general concept for powders.\nIn industry.\nThere are many areas in industry where triboelectricity is known to be an issue. some examples are:\nOther examples.\nWhile the simple case of stroking a cat is familiar to many, there are other areas in modern technological civilization where triboelectricity is exploited or is a concern: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first made compound in the German term \"Pleochroismus\" by the Austrian mineralogist Wilhelm Haidinger in 1854, in the journal \"Annalen der Physik und Chemie\". Its first known English usage is by geologist James Dana in 1854.\nBackground.\nAnisotropic crystals will have optical properties that vary with the direction of light. The direction of the electric field determines the polarization of light, and crystals will respond in different ways if this angle is changed. These kinds of crystals have one or two optical axes. If absorption of light varies with the angle relative to the optical axis in a crystal then pleochroism results.\nAnisotropic crystals have double refraction of light where light of different polarizations is bent different amounts by the crystal, and therefore follows different paths through the crystal. The components of a divided light beam follow different paths within the mineral and travel at different speeds. When the mineral is observed at some angle, light following some combination of paths and polarizations will be present, each of which will have had light of different colors absorbed. At another angle, the light passing through the crystal will be composed of another combination of light paths and polarizations, each with their own color. The light passing through the mineral will therefore have different colors when it is viewed from different angles, making the stone seem to be of different colors.\nTetragonal, trigonal, and hexagonal minerals can only show two colors and are called dichroic. Orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic crystals can show three and are trichroic. For example, hypersthene, which has two optical axes, can have a red, yellow, or blue appearance when oriented in three different ways in three-dimensional space. Isometric minerals cannot exhibit pleochroism. Tourmaline is notable for exhibiting strong pleochroism. Gems are sometimes cut and set either to display pleochroism or to hide it, depending on the colors and their attractiveness.\nThe pleochroic colors are at their maximum when light is polarized parallel with a principal optical vector. The axes are designated X, Y, and Z for direction, and alpha, beta, and gamma in magnitude of the refractive index. These axes can be determined from the appearance of a crystal in a conoscopic interference pattern. Where there are two optical axes, the acute bisectrix of the axes gives Z for positive minerals and X for negative minerals and the obtuse bisectrix gives the alternative axis (X or Z). Perpendicular to these is the Y axis. The color is measured with the polarization parallel to each direction. An absorption formula records the amount of absorption parallel to each axis in the form of X &lt; Y &lt; Z with the left most having the least absorption and the rightmost the most.\nIn mineralogy and gemology.\nPleochroism is an extremely useful tool in mineralogy and gemology for mineral and gem identification, since the number of colors visible from different angles can identify the possible crystalline structure of a gemstone or mineral and therefore help to classify it. Minerals that are otherwise very similar often have very different pleochroic color schemes. In such cases, a thin section of the mineral is used and examined under polarized transmitted light with a petrographic microscope. Another device using this property to identify minerals is the dichroscope.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60944", "revid": "49829305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60944", "title": "USS Akron", "text": "U.S. Navy airship destroyed in 1933\nUSS \"Akron\" (hull number ZRS-4) was a helium-filled rigid airship of the U.S. Navy, the lead ship of her class, which operated between September 1931 and April 1933. She was the world's first purpose-built flying aircraft carrier, carrying F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes, which could be launched and recovered while in flight. With an overall length of , \"Akron\" and her sister ship were among the largest flying objects ever built. Although LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\" and LZ 130 \"Graf Zeppelin II\" were some longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with hydrogen, so the two US Navy craft still hold the world record for the largest helium-filled airships.\n\"Akron\" was destroyed in a thunderstorm off the coast of New Jersey on the morning of 4 April 1933, killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers. The accident involved the greatest loss of life in any airship crash, and was the deadliest aviation disaster of any kind prior to World War II.\nTechnical description.\nThe airship's skeleton was built of the new lightweight alloy duralumin 17-SRT. The frame introduced several novel features compared with traditional Zeppelin designs. Rather than being single-girder diamond trusses with radial wire bracing, the main rings of \"Akron\" were self-supporting deep frames: triangular Warren trusses \"curled\" around to form a ring. Though much heavier than conventional rings, the deep rings promised to be much stronger, a significant attraction to the navy after the in-flight breakup of the earlier conventional airships R38/ZR-2 and ZR-1 \"Shenandoah\". The inherent strength of these frames allowed the chief designer, Karl Arnstein, to dispense with the internal cruciform structure used by Zeppelin to support the fins of their ships. Instead, the fins of \"Akron\" were cantilevered:, mounted entirely externally to the main structure. \"Graf Zeppelin\", \"Graf Zeppelin II\", and \"Hindenburg\" used a supplementary axial keel along the hull centerline. However, the \"Akron\" used three keels, one running along the top of the hull and one each side, 45\u00b0 up from the lower centerline. Each keel provided a walkway running almost the entire length of the ship. The electric and telephone wiring, control cables, 110 fuel tanks, 44 water ballast bags, eight engine rooms, engines, transmissions, and water-recovery devices were placed along the lower keels. The inert gas helium was used instead of flammable hydrogen, which improved streamlining by allowing the engines to be safely placed inside the hull. A generator room, with two Westinghouse direct-current generators powered by a 30 hp internal combustion engine, was forward of the No. 7 engine room.\nThe main rings were spaced at and between each pair were three intermediate rings of lighter construction. In keeping with conventional practice, \"station numbers\" on the airship were measured in meters from zero at the rudder post, positive forward and negative aft. Thus, the tip of the tail was at station \u221223.75 and the nose mooring spindle was at station 210.75. Each ring frame formed a polygon with 36 corners, and these (and their associated longitudinal girders) were numbered from 1 (at the bottom center) to 18 (at the top center), port and starboard. Thus, a position on the hull could be referred to, for example, as \"6 port at station 102.5\" (the number-one engine room).\nWhile Germany, France, and Britain used goldbeater's skin to gas-proof their gasbags, \"Akron\" used Goodyear Tire and Rubber's rubberized cotton, heavier but much cheaper and more durable. Half the gas cells used an experimental cotton-based fabric impregnated with a gelatin-latex compound. This was more expensive than the rubberized cotton, but lighter than goldbeater's skin. It was so successful that all the gasbags of \"Macon\" were made from it. The 12 gas cells were numbered 0 to XI, using Roman numerals and starting from the tail. While the \"air\" volume of the hull was , the total volume of the gas cells at 100% fill was . At a normal 95% fill with helium of standard purity, the of gas would yield a gross lift of . Given a structure deadweight of , this gives a useful lift of available for fuel, lubricants, ballast, crew, supplies, and military load (including the skyhook airplanes)\nEight Maybach VL II gasoline engines were mounted inside the hull. Each engine turned a two-bladed, diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and bevel gearing, which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal. With the engines' ability to reverse, this allowed thrust to be applied forward, aft, up, or down. From photographs, the four propellers on each side apparently were contrarotating, so it would appear that the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the thrust lines to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in \"Akron\"'s propellers all being in line. This proved problematic in service, as it induced considerable vibration, which was especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, \"Akron\" had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers. These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for \"Macon\".\nThe outer cover was of cotton cloth, treated with four coats of clear and two coats of aluminum-pigmented cellulose dope. The total area of the skin was and it weighed, after doping, .\nThe prominent, dark, vertical bands on the hull were condensers of the system designed to recover water from the engines' exhaust for buoyancy compensation. In-flight fuel consumption continuously reduces an airship's weight and changes in the temperature of the lifting gas can do the same. Normally, expensive helium has to be released to compensate, so any way of avoiding this is desirable. In theory, a water-recovery system such as this can produce a unit by weight of ballast water for every unit of fuel burned, though this is unlikely to be achieved in practice.\n\"Akron\" could carry up to of gasoline () in 110 separate tanks, which were distributed along the lower keels to preserve the ship's trim, giving her a normal range of at cruising speed. Theoretical maximum ballast water capacity was in 44 bags, again distributed along her length, though normal ballast load at unmasting was . Maximum ballast was never an option, because a full fuel and ballast load would have left only lifting capacity for aircraft, crew, and supplies, and each fully loaded F9C fighter alone weighed .\nThe heart of the ship, and her sole reason for existing, was the airplane hangar and trapeze system. Aft of the control car, in bay VII, between frames 125 and 141.25, was a compartment large enough to accommodate up to five F9C Sparrowhawk airplanes. Two structural girders, though, partially obstructed \"Akron\"'s aftmost hangar bays, limiting its capacity to three airplanes (one in each forward corner of the hangar and one on the trapeze). A modification to remove this design flaw was pending at the time of the ship's loss.\nThe F9C was not the ideal choice, being designed as a \"conventional\" carrier-borne fighter. It was heavily built to withstand carrier landings, downward visibility was not very good, and it initially lacked an effective radio, but the primary role of \"Akron\"'s airplanes was long-range naval scouting. What was actually needed was a stable, fast, lightweight scouting airplane with a long range, but none existed capable of fitting between the structural members and into the airship's hangar, as the F9C could.\nThe trapeze was lowered through the T-shaped door in the bottom of the ship and into the slipstream, with an airplane attached to the crossbar by the skyhook above its top wing, with its pilot on board and its engine running. The pilot tripped the hook, and the airplane fell away from the ship. On his return, he positioned himself beneath the trapeze and climbed up until he could fly his skyhook onto the crossbar, at which point it automatically latched shut. Now, with the engine idling, the trapeze and airplane were raised into the hangar, the pilot cutting his engine as he passed through the door. Once inside, the airplane was transferred from the trapeze to a trolley, running on an overhead monorail system by which it could be shunted into one of the four corners of the hangar to be refueled and rearmed. Having a single trapeze raised two problems; it limited the rate at which airplanes could be launched and recovered, and any fault in the trapeze would leave any airborne scouts with nowhere to land. The solution was a second, fixed trapeze permanently rigged further aft along the bottom of the ship at station 102.5 and known as the \"perch\". By 1933, a perch was fitted and in use. Three more perches were planned (at stations 57.5, 80.0, and 147.5), but these were never fitted.\n\"Akron\" revived an idea used, and eventually rejected, by the German Navy Zeppelins during World War I, the \"Sp\u00e4hkorb\" or \"spy basket\". The \"angel basket\" or \"subcloud observation car\" allowed the airship to remain hidden in a cloud layer, while still observing the enemy below. The small car, rather like an airplane fuselage without wings, could be lowered on a 1000-foot-long cable. The observer on board communicated with the ship by telephone. In practice, the device was unstable, almost looping over the airship during its only test flight.\nDuring the design stage, in 1929, the Navy requested an alteration to the fins. Seeing the bottom of the lower fin from the control car was considered desirable. Charles E. Rosendahl had witnessed, from the control room, \"Graf Zeppelin\" almost snagging her fin on high-tension power lines during her heavy take-off into an unsuspected but very marked temperature inversion from Mines Field, Los Angeles, at the start of the last leg of her round-the-world flight earlier that year. The design change would also allow direct vision between the main control car and the emergency control position in the lower fin. The control car was moved aft and all the fins were shortened and deepened. The leading-edge root of the fins no longer coincided with a main (deep) ring, and instead, the foremost attachment was now to an intermediate ring at frame 28.75. This achieved the required visibility, improved low-speed controllability, due to the increased span of the control surfaces, and simplified stress calculations, by reducing the number of fin attachment points. The designers and the Navy's inspectors, led by the very experienced Charles P. Burgess, were entirely satisfied with the revised stress calculations. However, this alteration has been the subject of much criticism as an \"inherent defect\" in the design, and is often alleged to have been a major factor in the loss of \"Akron\"'s sister ship \"Macon\". Construction for both ships amounted to $8,800,000 (in 1931 dollars) with the \"Akron\" accounting $5,538,400 of the total.\nConstruction and commissioning.\nConstruction of ZRS-4 was begun on 31 October 1929 at the Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Ohio, by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation. Because it was larger than any airship previously built in the US, a special hangar was constructed. Chief Designer Karl Arnstein and a team of experienced German airship engineers instructed and supported design and construction of both U.S. Navy airships USS \"Akron\" and USS \"Macon\".\nOn 7 November 1929, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, the chief of the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, drove the \"golden rivet\" into the main ring of ZRS-4. Erection of the hull sections began in March 1930. Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams chose the name \"Akron\" (for the city near where it was being built), and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ernest Lee Jahncke announced it in May 1930.\nOn 8 August 1931, \"Akron\" was launched (floated free of the hangar floor) and christened by First Lady Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of the President of the United States, Herbert Clark Hoover. The maiden flight of \"Akron\" took place around Cleveland on the afternoon of 23 September with Secretary of the Navy Adams and Rear Admiral Moffett on board. The airship made 10 trial flights, including a journey over a period of 48 hours to St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. On 21 October, \"Akron\" left the Goodyear Zeppelin Air Dock for the Lakehurst Naval Air Station (NAS), with Lieutenant Commander Charles E. Rosendahl in command, arriving the next day. On Navy Day, 27 October 1931, \"Akron\" was commissioned as a Navy vessel.\nHistory of service.\nMaiden voyage.\nOn 2 November 1931, \"Akron\" departed on her first cruise down the eastern seaboard to Washington, DC. On 3 November, she took to the air with 207 persons on board. This demonstration was to prove that in an emergency, airships could provide limited but high-speed airlift of troops to outlying possessions. Over the weeks that followed, some 300 hours aloft were logged in a series of flights, including a 46-hour endurance flight to Mobile, Alabama, and back. The return leg of the trip was made via the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.\nParticipation in a search exercise (January 1932).\nOn the morning of 9 January 1932, \"Akron\" departed from Lakehurst to work with the Scouting Fleet on a search exercise. Proceeding to the coast of North Carolina, \"Akron\" headed out over the Atlantic, where she was assigned to find a group of destroyers bound for Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Once these were located, the airship was to shadow them and report their movements. Leaving the coast of North Carolina around 07:21 on 10 January, the airship proceeded south, but bad weather prevented sighting the destroyers (contact with them was missed at 12:40 EST, although their crews had sighted \"Akron\") and eventually shaped a course toward the Bahamas by late afternoon. Heading northwesterly into the night, \"Akron\" then changed course shortly before midnight and proceeded to the southeast. Ultimately, at 09:08 on 11 January, the airship succeeded in spotting the light cruiser and 12 destroyers, positively identifying them on the eastern horizon two minutes later. Sighting a second group of destroyers shortly thereafter, \"Akron\" was released from the evaluation about 10:00, having achieved a \"qualified success\" in the initial test with the Scouting Fleet, but the performance could have been better with radio detection-finding equipment, and scout planes.\nAs U.S. naval aviation historian Richard K. Smith wrote in his definitive study, \"The Airships Akron &amp; Macon: Flying Aircraft Carriers of the United States Navy\", with \"consideration given to the weather, duration of flight, a track of more than flown, her material deficiencies, and the rudimentary character of aerial navigation at that date, the \"Akron\"'s performance was remarkable. There was not a military airplane in the world in 1932 which could have given the same performance, operating from the same base.\"\nFirst accident (February 1932).\n\"Akron\" was to have taken part in Fleet Problem XIII, but an accident at Lakehurst on 22 February 1932 prevented her participation. While the airship was being taken from her hangar, the tail came loose from her moorings, was caught by the wind, and struck the ground. The heaviest damage was confined to the lower fin area, which required repair. Also, ground-handling fittings had been torn from the main frame, necessitating further repairs. \"Akron\" was not certified as airworthy again until later in the spring. Her next operation took place on 28 April, when she made a nine-hour flight with Rear Admiral Moffett and Secretary of the Navy Adams aboard.\nAs a result of this accident, a turntable with a walking beam on tracks powered by electric mine locomotives was developed to secure the tail and turn the ship even in high winds, so she could be pulled into the massive hangar at Lakehurst.\nTesting of the \"spy basket\".\nSoon after returning to Lakehurst to disembark her distinguished passengers, \"Akron\" took off again to conduct a test of the \"spy basket\"\u2014something like a small airplane fuselage suspended beneath the airship that would enable an observer to serve as the ship's \"eyes\" below the clouds while the ship herself remained out of sight above them. The first time the basket was tried (with sandbags aboard instead of a man), it oscillated so violently that it put the whole ship in danger. The basket proved \"frighteningly unstable\", swooping from one side of the airship to the other before the startled gaze of \"Akron\"'s officers and men, and reaching as high as the ship's equator. Though it was later improved by adding a ventral stabilizing fin, the spy basket was never used again.\nExperimental use as a \"flying aircraft carrier\".\n\"Akron\" and \"Macon\" (which was still under construction) were regarded as potential \"flying aircraft carriers\", carrying parasite fighters for reconnaissance. On 3 May 1932, \"Akron\" cruised over the coast of New Jersey with Rear Admiral George C. Day, and the Board of Inspection and Survey, on board, and for the first time tested the \"trapeze\" installation for in-flight handling of aircraft. The aviators who carried out those historic \"landings\"\u2014first with a Consolidated N2Y trainer and then with the prototype Curtiss XF9C-1 Sparrowhawk\u2014were Lieutenant D. Ward Harrigan and Lieutenant Howard L. Young. The following day, \"Akron\" carried out another demonstration flight, this time with members of the House Committee on Naval Affairs on board; this time, Lieutenants Harrigan and Young gave the lawmakers a demonstration of \"Akron\"'s aircraft hook-on ability.\n\"Coast-to-coast\" flight and second accident (May 1932).\nFollowing the conclusion of those trial flights, \"Akron\" departed from Lakehurst, New Jersey, on 8 May 1932, for the American West Coast. The airship proceeded down the eastern seaboard to Georgia, and then across the southern Gulf Coast states, continuing over Texas and Arizona. En route to Sunnyvale, California, \"Akron\" reached Camp Kearny in San Diego on the morning of 11 May and attempted to moor. Since neither trained ground handlers nor specialized mooring equipment were present, the landing at Camp Kearny was fraught with danger. By the time the crew started the evaluation, the helium gas had been warmed by sunlight, increasing lift. Lightened by , the amount of fuel spent during the transcontinental trip, \"Akron\" was now uncontrollably light.\nThe mooring cable was cut to avert a catastrophic nose-stand by the errant airship, which floated upwards. Most of the mooring crew\u2014predominantly \"boot\" seamen from the Naval Training Station San Diego\u2014released their lines, although four did not. One let go at about and suffered a broken arm, while the three others were carried further aloft. Of these, Aviation Carpenter's Mate 3rd Class Robert H. Edsall and Apprentice Seaman Nigel M. Henton soon plunged to their deaths while Apprentice Seaman C. M. \"Bud\" Cowart held on to his line and then secured himself to it before being hoisted on board the airship an hour later. \"Akron\" moored at Camp Kearny later that day before proceeding to Sunnyvale, California. Footage from the accident appears in the film \"Encounters with Disaster\", released in 1979 and produced by Sun Classic Pictures.\nWest Coast flights.\nOver the weeks that followed, \"Akron\" \"showed the flag\" on the West Coast of the United States, ranging as far north as the Canada\u2013US border before returning south in time to exercise once more with the Scouting Fleet. Serving as part of the \"Green Force\", the \"Akron\" attempted to locate the \"White Force\". Although opposed by Vought O2U Corsair floatplanes from \"enemy\" warships, the airship located the opposing forces in just 22 hours, a fact not lost upon some of the participants in the exercise in subsequent critiques.\nIn need of repairs, \"Akron\" departed from Sunnyvale on 11 June 1932 bound for Lakehurst, on a return trip that was sprinkled with difficulties, mostly because of unfavorable weather, and having to fly at pressure height while crossing the mountains. \"Akron\" arrived on 15 June after a \"long and sometimes harrowing\" aerial voyage.\n\"Akron\" next underwent a period of voyage repairs before taking part in July in a search for \"Curlew\", a yacht that had failed to reach port at the end of a race to the island of Bermuda. The yacht was later discovered safe off Nantucket. She then resumed operations capturing aircraft on the \"trapeze\" equipment. Admiral Moffett again boarded \"Akron\" on 20 July, but the next day left the airship in one of her N2Y-1s, which took him back to Lakehurst after a severe storm had delayed the airship's own return to base.\nFurther tests as \"flying aircraft carrier\".\n\"Akron\" entered a new phase of her career that summer of 1932, engaging in intense experimentation with the revolutionary \"trapeze\" and a full complement of F9C-2s. A key element of the entrance into that new phase was a new commanding officer, Commander Alger Dresel.\nThird accident (August 1932).\nAnother accident hampered training on 22 August, when \"Akron\"'s tail fin became fouled by a beam in Lakehurst's massive Hangar No 1 after a premature order to commence towing the ship out of the mooring circle. Nevertheless, rapid repairs enabled eight more flights over the Atlantic during the last three months of 1932. These operations involved intensive work with the trapeze and the F9C-2s, as well as the drilling of lookouts and gun crews.\nAmong the tasks undertaken were the maintenance of two aircraft patrolling and scouting on \"Akron\"'s flanks. During a seven-hour period on 18 November 1932, the airship and a trio of planes searched a sector 100\u00a0mi wide.\nReturn to the fleet.\nAfter local operations out of Lakehurst for the remainder of 1932, \"Akron\" was ready to resume operations with the fleet. On the afternoon of 3 January 1933, Commander Frank C. McCord relieved Commander Dresel as commanding officer, the latter becoming the first commanding officer of \"Akron\"'s sister ship \"Macon\", whose construction was almost complete. Within hours, \"Akron\" headed south down the eastern seaboard toward Florida, where after refueling at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Opa-locka, Florida, near Miami, the next day proceeded to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for an inspection of base sites. At this time, the N2Y-1s were used to provide aerial \"taxi\" service to ferry members of the inspection party back and forth.\nSoon thereafter, \"Akron\" returned to Lakehurst for local operations, which were interrupted by a two-week overhaul and poor weather. In March, she carried out intensive training with an aviation unit of F9C-2s, honing hook-on skills. During the course of these operations, an overfly of Washington, DC, was made 4 March 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt first took the oath of office as President of the United States.\nOn 11 March, \"Akron\" departed Lakehurst bound for Panama, stopping briefly \"en route\" at Opa-locka before proceeding on to Balboa, where an inspection party looked over a potential air base site. While returning northward, the airship paused at Opa-locka again for local operations exercising gun crews, with the N2Y-1s serving as targets, before getting underway for Lakehurst on 22 March.\nLoss.\nOn the evening of 3 April 1933, \"Akron\" cast off from the mooring mast to operate along the coast of New England, assisting in the calibration of radio direction finder stations. Rear Admiral Moffett was again on board, along with his aide, Commander Henry Barton Cecil, Commander Fred T. Berry, the commanding officer of NAS Lakehurst, and Lieutenant Colonel Alfred F. Masury, U.S. Army Reserve, a guest of the admiral, the vice president of Mack Trucks, and a strong proponent of the potential civilian uses of rigid airships.\nAfter casting off at 19:28, \"Akron\" soon encountered fog and then severe weather, which did not improve when the airship passed over Barnegat Light, New Jersey, at 22:00. According to Richard K. Smith, \"[u]nknown to the men on board the \"Akron\", they were flying ahead of one of the most violent stormfronts to sweep the North Atlantic states in 10 years. It would soon envelop them.\" Enveloped in fog, increased lightning, and heavy rain, it became extremely turbulent at 00:15. \"Akron\" began a rapid nose-down descent, reaching while still falling. Ballast was dumped, which stabilized the ship at , and climbed back to its cruising altitude. Then, a second violent descent sent the \"Akron\" downwards at . \"Landing stations\" alerted the crew, as the ship descended tail-down. The lower fin struck the sea, water entered the fin, and the stern was dragged under. The engines pulled the ship into a nose-high attitude, then the \"Akron\" stalled, and crashed into the sea.\n\"Akron\" broke up rapidly and sank in the stormy Atlantic. The crew of the nearby German merchant ship \"Phoebus\" saw lights descending toward the ocean around 00:23 and altered course to starboard to investigate, with her captain believing that he was witnessing an airplane crash. At 00:55, executive officer Lieutenant Commander Herbert V. Wiley was pulled from the water while the ship's boat picked up three more men: Chief Radioman Robert W. Copeland, Boatswain's Mate Second Class Richard E. Deal, and Aviation Metalsmith Second Class Moody E. Erwin. Despite artificial respiration, Copeland never regained consciousness, and he died aboard \"Phoebus\".\nAlthough the German sailors spotted four or five other men in the water, they did not know their ship had chanced upon the crash of \"Akron\" until Lt. Commander Wiley regained consciousness half an hour after being rescued. The crew of \"Phoebus\" combed the ocean in boats for over five hours in a fruitless search for more survivors. The Navy blimp \"J-3\"\u2014sent out to join the search\u2014also crashed, with the loss of two men.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard cutter \u2014the first American vessel on the scene\u2014arrived at 06:00, taking the airship's survivors and the body of Copeland on board. Among the other ships combing the area for survivors were the heavy cruiser , the destroyer , the Coast Guard cutter , and the Coast Guard destroyers and , as well as two Coast Guard aircraft. The fishing vessel \"Grace F\" from Gloucester, Massachusetts, also assisted in the search, using her seining gear in an effort to recover bodies.\nMost casualties had been caused by drowning and hypothermia, since the crew had not been issued life jackets, and time had not been available to deploy the single life raft. The accident left 73 dead, and only three survivors. Wiley, standing next to the two other survivors,&lt;ref name=\"airships/akron-crash-crew\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moody E. Erwin (AM2c | Aviation Metalsmith 2d), and Richard E. Deal (CBM | Chief Boatswain\u2019s Mate), gave a brief account on 6 April.\nAftermath of loss.\n\"Akron\"'s loss spelled the beginning of the end for the rigid airship in the U.S. Navy, especially since one of her leading proponents, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, was among the dead. President Roosevelt said, \"The loss of the \"Akron\" with her crew of gallant officers and men is a national disaster. I grieve with the Nation and especially with the wives and families of the men who were lost. Ships can be replaced, but the Nation can ill afford to lose such men as Rear Admiral William A. Moffett and his shipmates who died with him upholding to the end the finest traditions of the United States Navy.\" The loss of the \"Akron\" was the largest loss of life in any airship crash.\n\"Macon\" and other airships received life jackets to avert a repetition of this tragedy. When \"Macon\" was damaged in a storm in 1935 and subsequently sank after landing in the sea, 70 of the 72 crew were saved.\nSongwriter Bob Miller wrote and recorded a song, \"The Crash of the Akron\", within one day of the disaster.\nIn 2003, the U.S. submarine surveyed the wreck site and performed sonar imaging of the \"Akron\"'s girders.\nAssessment.\nFor numerous reasons, in the opinion of Richard K. Smith, \"Akron\" never got the chance to show what she was capable of. Initially, the idea had been to use her as a scout for the fleet, just as the German Navy Zeppelins had been used during World War I with her airplanes being simply useful auxiliaries capable of extending her range of vision or of defending her against attacking enemy aircraft. Gradually, in the minds of the more forward-thinking officers familiar with airship and scouting fleet operations, that was reversed, \"Macon\" and \"Akron\" came to be regarded as aircraft carriers, whose sole job was to get the scouting airplanes to the search area and then to support them in their flights. The mothership herself should stay in the background, out of sight of enemy surface units, and act merely as a mobile advanced base for the airplanes, which should do all of the actual searching. Any aircraft carrier could do that, but only an airship could do it so quickly, since her speed was at least twice that of a surface ship, enabling her to get to the scene or be switched from flank to flank quickly. However, she was an experimental ship, a prototype, and time was needed for the doctrine and suitable tactics to evolve, as well as for developing the techniques of navigating, controlling, and coordinating the scouts. At first, developments were hampered by inadequate radio equipment, and the difficulties encountered by the scout pilots in navigating, scouting, and communicating from their cramped, open cockpits.\nSome politicians, some senior officers, and some sections of the press seemed predisposed to judge the airship experiment a failure without regard to the evidence. Even within the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, many opposed spending so much on a single asset. Smith also asserts that political pressure inside and outside the Navy led to the ship being pushed too early to attempt too much. Little allowance seems to have been made for the fact that this was a prototype, an experimental system, and that tactics for her use were being developed \"on the hoof\". As a result, the airship's performance in fleet exercises was not all that some had hoped, and gave an exaggerated impression of the ship's vulnerability and failed to demonstrate her strengths.\nSpecifications (as built).\nThese data are based on the book \"The Story of the Airship\" by Hugh Allen:\nGeneral characteristics* Crew: 60* Length: * Diameter: ()* Width: ()* Height: * Volume: * Gross weight: * Useful lift: * Powerplant: 8 \u00d7 Maybach VL II\n 60 deg.

It lies on a plateau 400\u00a0ft (130 m) above sea level, 12 miles (19\u00a0km) east of Glasgow. As of 2012[ [update]], it had a population of 37,130.\nAirdrie developed as a market town in the late 17th century following an act of Parliament allowing it to hold a weekly market. It later grew in prominence as a centre for weaving and manufacturing, as well as being the settlement near several coalmines. In the mid 19th century, the town expanded greatly as a result of immigration and the development of iron works and railway links. The first public library in Scotland was established in Airdrie in 1853.117-119\nDuring the 20th century, industrial decline took place in Airdrie, with heavy industry closing down across much of the town. In the 21st century, Airdrie has continued as a regional centre for services and retail, as well as being a commuter settlement within the Central Belt. Historically part of Lanarkshire, Airdrie forms a conurbation with its neighbour Coatbridge, in what was formerly the Monklands district, with a population of approximately 90,000.\nName.\nAirdrie's name first appeared in the Register of the Great Seal of Scotland (Latin: \"Registrum Magni Sigilii Regum Scotorum\") in 1373 as 'Ardre'. By 1546 it had become 'Ardry' and by 1587 it was known as 'Ardrie'. In 1630 it finally appeared in the Register as 'Airdrie'. Given the topography of the area, the most likely interpretation is that the name derives from the Gaelic \"An \u00c0rd Ruigh\" meaning 'a level height' or 'high pasture land'. Another possibility is from the Gaelic \"An \u00c0rd \u00c0irighe\" meaning 'a sheiling, a summer pasture/shepherd's hut'. A third possibility is the Gaelic \"Ard Reidh\" meaning 'a high plain'. A further, non-Gaelic alternative is the Brythonic, i.e. Cumbric or North Welsh, \"ard tref\" (becoming ardre by process of assimilation), meaning 'a high steading or farmstead', which would date back to the times of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, before the expansion of Gaelic or English speech into the region. Airthrey Castle in Stirlingshire may have a similar derivation.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThere is no evidence to support the claim (George Chalmers, Caledonia) that Airdrie is the site of the ancient battle of Arderyth. Under the patronage of King Malcolm IV of Scotland Cistercian monks established an abbey at Melrose in 1136. Five years later a daughter house was founded at Newbattle Abbey in Lothian. In 1160, Malcolm granted lands in central Scotland to the monks of Newbattle. These became known as the \"Munklands\" (Register of the Great Seal 1323).3\nMalcolm's Charter constitutes the oldest documentary record of place-names in the Monklands. The area of land granted by the Charter is clearly defined by direct reference to geographical and topographical features thus: \"Dunpeldre by its right boundaries, namely with Metheraugh and Mayeuth and Clarnephin as far as Dunduffes in the east.\" The name \"Dunpeldre\" is found in the modern name Drumpellier, \"Metheraugh\" is Medrox; \"Mayeuth\" is Myvot and \"Clarnephin\" refers to the North Calder Water in the east of the parish (from old Brittonic name \"claur n afon\" meaning plain of the river). \"Dunduffes\" has become directly translated into the modern Black Hill which, as the Charter states, lies at the eastern extremity of the parish. The Charter does not mention anything resembling Airdrie, although this is where Airdrie is located.3\nAirdrie owes its existence to its location on the 'Hogs Back' \u2013 a ridge of land running from east to west. One very important aspect of the town's history was the Cistercian monks of Newbattle Abbey, which is why the area is called the Monklands. The monks were farmers and some of their place names survive, e.g., Ryefield and Whifflet (the wheat flats). Much of the land they used is known today as 'The Four Isles' (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands): Mull, Islay, Iona and Luing in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie. The monks of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a farm grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a court house at Kipps, a chapel in the area of Chapelhall and a number of corn mills. The Monks were also expert in the construction of roads. In the 12th century, they established the original Glasgow to Edinburgh road via Airdrie and Bathgate, to link up with their lands in Newbattle in East Lothian.3\nDefinitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old monks' road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring Coatbridge), Airdrie House (now the site of Monklands Hospital), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig Street, Flowerhill Street and Colliertree Road. The first houses in Airdrie were built along this road. Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of inhabitants was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area. A large contingent of Airdrieonians fought at the Battle of Bothwell Brig during the Covenanter Rebellion of 1679; their banner can still be viewed at the local library.\nA significant event in Airdrie's history was the 1695 passing of a special act of Parliament, the \"'&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Airdrie Fairs and Market Act 1695\" (c. 94)17 in the Scottish Parliament allowing Robert Hamilton of Airdrie to hold four fairs yearly and a weekly market in the town of 'Airdry'. This helped develop Airdrie from a 'farm town' into a thriving 'market town'.\nHowever, Airdrie really came to prominence through its weaving industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and flax was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the burgh. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, coal mining was in progress and around thirty colliers were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century.73-85\nGiven its large number of weavers, its geographic location and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Airdrie became a major centre of support for the Radical War of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants. At this time, the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a local act of Parliament, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Airdrie Improvement Act 1821 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. lx), Airdrie became a free and independent burgh of barony.\nIn 1821, the first election of a town council took place and by August it had appointed an assessor, procurator fiscal, master of police and a town crier. Anyone who had paid their 3 guineas was allowed to vote; there is even a record of a John Mackay voting despite being under 10 years old.63\nIn 1824, it was decided to build the Airdrie Town House, originally designed by Alexander Baird and now a local landmark known as the 'town clock'. In 1832, the Town House was used as a hospital due to the cholera outbreak of this year.\n1850 to 1920.\nThe enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the Highlands and predominantly Ireland. This followed the Highland potato famine of the mid-1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to heavy industry in the area. Most of the Irish immigrant population were involved with mining and labouring.\nThis led to an increase in ironwork foundries around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, railway links were established starting in 1826.72 By 1862, the Airdrie and Bathgate Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.\nIn August the Public Libraries Act (Scotland) 1853 was passed, and in November Airdrie Public Library became the first in Scotland.117-119\nThe dramatic rise in population and industry prompted the need for more accessible water supplies. Until the mid-1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.110-112\nJournalism in Airdrie began with \"The Airdrie Literary Album\" in 1828. Several local newspapers began appearing around this time notably the Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser in 1855, which is still the most popular local paper today.125-129 The prison was legalised in 1859 and had 51 cells.\nAirdrie Working Men's Club was established in 1869.150-151 Also around this time, football and cricket began to emerge as popular sports. Following the codification of association football rules a local team called Excelsior was formed in 1878 which would later be renamed Airdrieonians. Horse race meetings were also held in the town (1851\u20131870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877.\nEducation posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. In the early 1830s there were about 800 pupils while the town had about 7,000 residents. Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until an act of Parliament of 1889 relieved some of the infant classes in schools of this burden. Airdrie Academy was built in 1849 and by 1919 all school boards were dissolved and Lanarkshire Education Authority took over responsibility for education throughout Lanarkshire.112-116\nAirdrie Public Observatory, one of only four public observatories in the UK (second oldest and smallest) \u2013 all in Scotland, was founded in the first library building in 1896, and is still operated in the present building by the Airdrie Astronomical Association a Scottish astronautic and astronomy society and registered charity.120-121\nBy the turn of the 20th century variety shows were becoming popular in the area and by 1911 the Pavilion in Graham Street was built which after initially being used as a music hall started showing cinematographic pictures. Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 and finally closed in 1970. The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but it too has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following an offer of \u00a310,000 from Sir John Wilson).\nOn 9 July 1918 nineteen miners died in the Stanrigg Pit Disaster. The pit was situated in boggy land and collapsed after being saturated by heavy rainfall.\n1920 onwards.\nAt the end of the First World War, Airdrie was hard hit with many casualties from the war. Unemployment reached 30% in the local area. After years of moving from one site to another, the first purpose built library in Airdrie was opened in Anderson Street in 1895. However, this only lasted 30 years until the current Airdrie Library building was erected in 1925.\nConditions in the town did not really improve until well after the Second World War but in 1949 the Boots pharmaceutical company and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 Pye opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time (Newhouse, Chapelhall, and Brownsburn). The Airdrie Arts Centre opened in 1967 in the former Airdrie Library building, and was a popular venue for concerts and plays, but was closed in 2012 by North Lanarkshire Council.\nBetween 1964 and 1991, the town was the location of a Royal Observer Corps monitoring bunker, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. No trace remains today.\nThe 1970s saw the opening of Monklands Hospital, which replaced an older hospital on the Airdrie House estate. Airdrie hosted the National M\u00f2d in 1993.\nIn the 21st century, the town has continued to grow as a residential settlement, with development and conversion of some town centre buildings, such as the Historic Orrs Department Store into new homes. In 2024, permission was given for a significant expansion of the town, with the creation of up to 3,000 new homes in East Airdrie on former mining land.\nGovernance.\nAirdrie is represented by several tiers of elected government. North Lanarkshire Council, the unitary local authority for Airdrie, is based at Motherwell, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nWestminster.\nThe town forms part of the burgh constituency of Airdrie and Shotts, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. In 2005, changes to the constituency boundaries saw part of its area transferred to Motherwell and Wishaw, offset by the addition of part of Hamilton North and Bellshill.\nThe location has been represented by several prominent Labour MPs in recent years:\nThe current MP for the constituency is the Scottish National Party's Anum Qaisar.\nScottish Parliament.\nFor the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Airdrie forms part of the Airdrie and Shotts constituency. This has slightly different boundaries from those of the UK Parliament constituency of the same name. The current Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Airdrie and Shotts is Neil Grey MSP (Scottish National Party), who won this seat in 2021.\nIn addition to this, Airdrie is represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region.\nEuropean Parliament.\nBefore Brexit, it was part of the Scotland European Parliament constituency.\nLocal government.\nUp until 1975, Airdrie had its own Burgh Council. Between 1975 and 1996, Airdrie came under Monklands District Council operating in conjunction with Strathclyde Regional Council. Monklands District Council was headquartered in the Coatbridge Municipal Building. Many Airdrieonians felt short-changed by MDC's actions and a significant political scandal known as Monklandsgate greatly tarnished the council's reputation. After 1996, it came under the authority of the unitary North Lanarkshire Council. North Lanarkshire has many councillors; currently, the council is in control of the Labour group and the leader of the council is Jim Logue, councillor for Airdrie Central.\nGeography.\nSatellite villages.\nChapelhall, Calderbank, Caldercruix, Gartness, Glenmavis, Greengairs, Longriggend, Plains, Stand, Upperton, Newhouse and Wattston are generally considered satellite villages of Airdrie.\nWards.\nSince the most recent major reorganisation in 2006, North Lanarkshire Council divides Airdrie into the following wards, each electing four councillors since the 2017 election:\nDemography.\nHistorical records of Airdrie's population are available from the 18th, the early decades of the 19th century, and into the early 20th century.189\nAccording to the 2001 Census, Airdrie's population of 36,326 was:\nEconomy.\nOverview.\nAs outlined in the history section, Airdrie's traditional economic activities of weaving, coal mining, and heavy industry have ceased to exist. Although the Glenflagler Distillery is now closed, the town still retains a strong involvement in the whisky industry. Airdrie was also home to a Crimpy Crisps factory. Given its location near to Glasgow and other commercial or industrial areas, Airdrie might now be considered something of a commuter town. In fact, housing construction in Airdrie has been very prominent in recent years, with builders developing a number of brownfield sites following the closure of various factories such as Boots (who closed their factory in 2004). Nonetheless, it does retain significant economic activity.\nTrading estates.\nThere are two trading estates in the town, Brownsburn Industrial Estate and Osprey Trade Park.\nLaw.\nPolice.\nPolicing in Airdrie is undertaken by Police Scotland. Airdrie is part of Coatbridge Area Command with Chief Inspector Kenny MacLeod as the Area Commander. Airdrie also forms part of NA (or Monklands) sub division which includes Coatbridge and the surrounding area. There is one police office in Airdrie and this is open 24 hours.\nSheriff Court.\nAirdrie Sheriff Court is a modern building in Graham Street which provides a comprehensive local court service for the area including civil actions and criminal cases. It is administered by the Scottish Court Service and part of the South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway Sheriffdom headed by a Sheriff Principal. It replaced the old County Buildings in Bank Street which was demolished in 1969.\nReligion.\nChristian\nChurch of Scotland \u2013 Airdrie's Church of Scotland churches are part of the Presbytery of Hamilton.\nRoman Catholic Church \u2013 Airdrie's Roman Catholic churches are immediately governed by the Diocese of Motherwell, currently led by Bishop Joseph Toal. The Bishops' Conference of Scotland (effectively the Church's headquarters in Scotland) is situated in Airdrie.\nCongregational Church \u2013 Airdrie's Congregational churches are associated with the Congregational Federation.\nOther\nTransport.\nAirdrie railway station is on the electrified North Clyde Line. This railway provides a frequent train service to Glasgow via Coatbridge Sunnyside and Easterhouse. In 2010, the Airdrie\u2013Bathgate rail link re-opened providing Airdrie with a direct commuter train service to Bathgate, Livingston North and Edinburgh Waverley. Drumgelloch railway station serves the eastern end of the town. Including the satellite village of Caldercruix, Airdrie is served by four stations; Caldercruix, Drumgelloch, Airdrie, and Coatdyke, on the border of Airdrie and Coatbridge.\nAirdrie has road links to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Livingston, Motherwell, and Cumbernauld and is situated close to the M8 motorway. Bus services are largely undertaken by local operators, and links to Glasgow are provided by First Glasgow and McGills. McGill's took over most of the local companies in 2016 to form its 'Monklands' network in Go Zone 8. The services link all the local neighbourhoods with longer distance services e.g. the 212 from Coatbridge - Caldercruix via Airdrie and Plains, or the 247 from Monklands Hospital - Kirkintilloch via Airdrie, Glenmavis, Cumbernauld and Blackwood.\nAirdrie is connected to the UK National Cycle Network by National Cycle Route 75. This route provides a path between Glasgow and Edinburgh. According to the Sustrans website: \"there is currently a gap in the National Cycle Network route at Devol Glen, Port Glasgow.\" Other than the Sustrans path, there are no cycle lanes in Airdrie.\nHistorical transport links include:-\nHealthcare.\nAirdrie is home to Monklands District General Hospital with a 24-hour Accident &amp; Emergency department.\nAdjacent to Monklands Hospital is Maggie's Lanarkshire, part of the Maggie's Centres cancer support charity.\nThere is a community health centre in Airdrie city centre on Graham Street.\nEducation.\nThe following are the secondary schools, all of which are run by North Lanarkshire Council:\nInternational relations.\nAirdrie is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are recognized by their small seed pods: triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery outer shell and small, black seeds; \"Elettaria\" pods are light green and smaller, while \"Amomum\" pods are dark brown and larger.\nSpecies used for cardamom are native throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. The first references to cardamom are found in Sumer, and in Ayurveda. In the 21st century, it is cultivated mainly in India, Indonesia, and Guatemala.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"cardamom\" is derived from the Latin , as a Latinisation of the Greek (), a compound of (, \"cress\") and (), of unknown origin.\nThe earliest attested form of the word signifying \"cress\" is the Mycenaean Greek , written in Linear B syllabic script, in the list of flavorings on the spice tablets found among palace archives in the House of the Sphinxes in Mycenae.\nThe modern genus name \"Elettaria\" is derived from the root attested in Dravidian languages.\nTypes and distribution.\nThe two main types of cardamom are:\nOther related culinary plants known as cardamom:\nUses.\nBoth forms of cardamom are used as flavorings and cooking spices in food and drink. \"E. cardamomum\" (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a masticatory, or is smoked. \nFood and beverage.\nCardamom has a strong taste, with an aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a more smoky \u2013 though not bitter \u2013 aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint.\nGreen cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight, but little is needed to impart flavor. It is best stored in the pod, as exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavor. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 teaspoons (7.4 ml) of ground cardamom.\nCardamom is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in baking in the Nordic countries, in particular in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Yule bread , the Swedish Kardemummabullar sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread . In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, and as a traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a , and cooked together in a skillet, a , over wood or gas, to produce mixtures with up to 40% cardamom.\nIn Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savoury dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in such spice mixes as Indian and Nepali masalas, Thai curry pastes, and Yemeni hawaij. Green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in \"masala chai\" (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant Wrigley; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains \"cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors\". It is also included in aromatic bitters, gin, and herbal teas.\nIn Korea, Tavoy cardamom (\"Wurfbainia villosa\" var. \"xanthioides\") and red cardamom (\"Lanxangia tsao-ko\") are used in tea called .\nComposition.\nThe essential oil content of cardamom seeds depends on storage conditions and may be as high as 8%. The oil is typically 45% \u03b1-terpineol, 27% myrcene, 8% limonene, 6% menthone, 3% \u03b2-phellandrene, 2% 1,8-cineol, 2% sabinene and 2% heptane. Other sources report the following contents: 1,8-cineol (20 to 50%), \u03b1-terpenylacetate (30%), sabinene, limonene (2 to 14%), and borneol.\nIn the seeds of round cardamom from Java (\"Wurfbainia compacta\"), the content of essential oil is lower (2 to 4%), and the oil contains mainly 1,8-cineol (up to 70%) plus \u03b2-pinene (16%); furthermore, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b1-terpineol and humulene are found.\nProduction.\nIn 2022, world production of cardamom (included with nutmeg and mace for reporting to the United Nations) was 138,888 tonnes, led by India, Indonesia and Guatemala, which together accounted for 85% of the total (table).\nProduction practices.\nAccording to Nair (2011), in the years when India achieves a good crop, it is still less productive than Guatemala. Other notable producers include Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nMuch production of cardamom in India is cultivated on private property or in areas the government leases out to farmers. Traditionally, small plots of land within the forests (called \"eld-kandies\") where the wild or acclimatised plant existed are cleared during February and March. Brushwood is cut and burned, and the roots of powerful weeds are torn up to free the soil. Soon after clearing, cardamom plants spring up. After two years the cardamom plants may have eight-to-ten leaves and reach in height. In the third year, they may be in height. In the following May or June the ground is again weeded, and by September to November a light crop is obtained. In the fourth year, weeding again occurs, and if the cardamoms grow less than apart a few are transplanted to new positions. The plants bear for three or four years; and historically the life of each plantation was about eight or nine years. In Malabar the seasons run a little later than in Mysore, and \u2013 according to some reports \u2013 a full crop may be obtained in the third year. Cardamoms grown above elevation are considered to be of higher quality than those grown below that altitude.\nPlants may be raised from seed or by division of the rhizome. In about a year, the seedlings reach about in length, and are ready for transplantation. The flowering season is April to May, and after swelling in August and September, by the first half of October usually attain the desired degree of ripening. The crop is accordingly gathered in October and November, and in exceptionally moist weather, the harvest protracts into December. At the time of harvesting, the scapes or shoots bearing the clusters of fruits are broken off close to the stems and placed in baskets lined with fresh leaves. The fruits are spread out on carefully prepared floors, sometimes covered with mats, and are then exposed to the sun. Four or five days of careful drying and bleaching in the sun is usually enough. In rainy weather, drying with artificial heat is necessary, though the fruits suffer greatly in colour; they are consequently sometimes bleached with steam and sulphurous vapour or with ritha nuts.\nThe industry is highly labour-intensive, each hectare requiring considerable maintenance throughout the year. Production constraints include recurring climate vagaries, the absence of regular re-plantation, and ecological conditions associated with deforestation.\nCultivation.\nIn 1873 and 1874, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) exported about each year. In 1877, Ceylon exported , in 1879, , and in the 1881\u201382 season, In 1903, of cardamom growing areas were owned by European planters. The produce of the Travancore plantations was given as , or just a little under that of Ceylon. The yield of the Mysore plantations was approximately , and the cultivation was mainly in Kadur district. The volume for 1903\u201304 stated the value of the cardamoms exported to have been Rs. 3,37,000 as compared with Rs. 4,16,000 the previous year. India, which ranks second in world production, recorded a decline of 6.7 percent in cardamom production for 2012\u201313, and projected a production decline of 30\u201340% in 2013\u201314, compared with the previous year due to unfavorable weather. In India, the state of Kerala is by far the most productive producer, with the districts of Idukki, Palakkad and Wynad being the principal producing areas. Given that a number of bureaucrats have personal interests in the industry, in India, several organisations have been set up to protect cardamom producers such as the Cardamom Growers Association (est. 1992) and the Kerala Cardamom Growers Association (est. 1974). Research in India's cardamom plantations began in the 1970s while Kizhekethil Chandy held the office of Chairman of the Cardamom Board. The Kerala Land Reforms Act imposed restrictions on the size of certain agricultural holdings per household to the benefit of cardamom producers.\nIn 1979\u20131980, Guatemala surpassed India in worldwide production. Guatemala cultivates \"Elettaria cardamomum\", which is native to the Malabar Coast of India. Alta Verapaz Department produces 70 percent of Guatemala's cardamom. Cardamom was introduced to Guatemala before World War I by the German coffee planter Oscar Majus Kloeffer. After World War II, production was increased to 13,000 to 14,000 tons annually.\nThe average annual income for a plantation-owning household in 1998 was US$3,408. Although the typical harvest requires over 210 days of labor per year, most cardamom farmers are better off than many other agricultural workers, and there are a significant number of those from the upper strata of society involved in the cultivation process. Increased demand since the 1980s, principally from China, for both \"Wurfbainia villosa\" and \"Lanxangia tsao-ko\", has provided a key source of income for poor farmers living at higher altitudes in localized areas of China, Laos, and Vietnam, people typically isolated from many other markets. Laos exports about 400 tonnes annually through Thailand according to the FAO.\nTrade.\nCardamom production's demand and supply patterns of trade are influenced by price movements, nationally and internationally, in 5 to 6-year cycles. Importing leaders mentioned are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, while other significant importers include Germany, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the former USSR. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 80 percent of cardamom's total consumption occurs in the Middle East.\nIn the 19th century, Bombay and Madras were among the principal distributing ports of cardamom. India's exports to foreign countries increased during the early 20th century, particularly to the United Kingdom, followed by Arabia, Aden, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Persia and Egypt. However, some 95% of cardamom produced in India is for domestic purposes, and India is itself by far the most important consuming country for cardamoms in the world. India also imports cardamom from Sri Lanka. In 1903\u20131904, these imports came to , valued at Rs. 1,98,710. In contrast, Guatemala's local consumption is negligible, which supports the exportation of most of the cardamom that is produced. In the mid-1800s, Ceylon's cardamom was chiefly imported by Canada. After saffron and vanilla, cardamom is currently the third most expensive spice, and is used as a spice and flavouring for food and liqueurs.\nHistory.\nCardamom has been used in flavorings and food over centuries. During the Middle Ages, cardamom dominated the trade industry. The Arab states played a significant role in the trade of Indian spices, including cardamom. It is now ranked the third most expensive spice following saffron and vanilla.\nCardamom production began in ancient times, and has been referred to in ancient Sanskrit texts as . The Babylonians and Assyrians used the spice early on, and trade in cardamom opened up along land routes and by the interlinked Persian Gulf route controlled from Dilmun as early as the third millennium BCE Early Bronze Age, into western Asia and the Mediterranean world.\nThe ancient Greeks thought highly of cardamom, and the Greek physicians Dioscorides and Hippocrates wrote about its therapeutic properties, identifying it as a digestive aid. Due to demand in ancient Greece and Rome, the cardamom trade developed into a handsome luxury business; cardamom was one of the spices eligible for import tax in Alexandria in 126 CE. In medieval times, Venice became the principal importer of cardamom into the west, along with pepper, cloves and cinnamon, which was traded with merchants from the Levant with salt and meat products.\nIn China, \"Amomum\" was an important part of the economy during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279). In 1150, the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi noted that cardamom was being imported to Aden, in Yemen, from India and China.\nThe Portuguese became involved in the trade in the 16th century, and the industry gained wide-scale European interest in the 19th century.\nReferences.\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain&amp;colon; G.

Its seed pods have a strong, camphor-like flavour, with a smoky character derived from the method of drying.\nCharacteristics.\nThe pods are used as a spice, in a similar manner to green cardamom pods but with a different flavour. Unlike green cardamom, this spice is rarely used in sweet dishes. Its smoky flavour and aroma derive from traditional methods of drying over open flames.\nSpecies.\nAt least two distinct species are called black cardamom: \"Amomum subulatum\" (also known as Nepal cardamom) and \"Lanxangia tsaoko\" (formerly \"Amomum tsao-ko\"). The pods of \"A. subulatum,\" used primarily in the cuisines of India and certain regional cuisines of Pakistan, are the smaller of the two, while the larger pods of \"L. tsaoko\" (Chinese: wiktionary:\u8349\u679c; pinyin: \"c\u01ceogu\u01d2\"; Vietnamese: \"th\u1ea3o qu\u1ea3\") are used in Vietnamese cuisine and Chinese cuisine, particularly that of Sichuan province.\nAgricultural production.\nThe largest producer of black cardamom is Nepal, followed by India and Bhutan.\nMedical use.\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, black cardamom is used for stomach disorders and malaria. In the traditional medicine of Nepal &amp; India, the decoction of \"Amomum subulatum\" rhizomes is used in the therapy of jaundice.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It tells the story of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas, a black youth living in utter poverty in a poor area on Chicago's South Side in the 1930s. Thomas accidentally kills a white woman at a time when racism is at its peak and he pays the price for it.\nWhile not apologizing for Bigger's crimes, Wright portrays a systemic causation behind them. Bigger's lawyer, Boris Max, makes the case that there is no escape from this destiny for his client or any other black American, since they are the necessary product of the society that formed them and told them since birth who exactly they were supposed to be.\nPlot summary.\nBook One: Fear.\nTwenty-year-old Bigger Thomas lives in one room with his brother Buddy, his sister Vera, and their mother. Suddenly, a rat appears. The room turns into a maelstrom, and after a violent chase, Bigger kills the animal with an iron skillet and terrorizes his sister Vera with the dead rat. She faints, and Mrs. Thomas scolds Bigger, who hates his family because they suffer and he cannot do anything about it.\nThat evening, Bigger has to see Mr. Dalton, a white man, for a new job. Bigger's family depends on him. He would like to leave his responsibilities forever, but when he thinks of what to do, he only sees a blank wall.\nBigger walks to a poolroom and meets his friend, Gus. Bigger tells him that every time he thinks about whites, he feels something terrible will happen to him. They meet other friends, G.H. and Jack, and plan a robbery. They are all afraid of attacking and stealing from a white man, but none of them wants to admit their concerns. Before the robbery, Bigger and Jack go to the movies. They are attracted to the world of wealthy whites in the newsreel and feel strangely moved by the tom-toms and the primitive black people in the film, yet also feel they are equal to those worlds. After the film, Bigger returns to the poolroom and attacks Gus violently, forcing him to lick his blade in a demeaning way to hide Bigger's own cowardice. The fight ends any chance of the robbery occurring, and Bigger is vaguely aware that his actions were intentional.\nWhen he finally gets the job, Bigger does not know how to behave in Dalton's large, luxurious house. Mr. Dalton and his blind wife use strange words. They try to be kind to the young man, but actually make him uncomfortable; Bigger does not know what they expect of him.\nThen their daughter, Mary, enters the room, asks Bigger why he is not in a union, and calls her father a \"capitalist\". Bigger does not know the word and becomes even more confused and fearful that he may lose the job. After the conversation, Peggy, an Irish cook, takes Bigger to his room and tells him the Daltons are a nice family, but he must avoid Mary's Communist friends. After she leaves, Bigger marvels that he has never had a room of his own before.\nThat night, he drives Mary around and meets her Communist boyfriend Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan and Mary talk to Bigger, oblige him to take them to a diner where their friends are eating, invite him to sit at their table, and tell him to call them by their first names. Bigger does not know how to respond to their requests and becomes frustrated, as he is simply their chauffeur for the night. At the diner, they buy a bottle of rum, then Bigger drives throughout Washington Park while Jan and Mary drink and make out in the back seat. Jan departs, but Mary is so drunk that Bigger has to carry her to her bedroom when they return home. He is terrified someone will see him with her in his arms; however, he still cannot resist the forbidden temptation and kisses her.\nJust then, the bedroom door opens, and Mrs. Dalton enters. Bigger knows she is blind but is terrified she will sense him there. Frightened of the consequences if he, a black man, were to be found in Mary's bedroom, he silences Mary by pressing a pillow into her face. Mary claws at Bigger's hands while Mrs. Dalton is in the room, trying to alert Bigger that she cannot breathe. Mrs. Dalton approaches the bed, smells alcohol in the air, scolds her daughter, and leaves. As Bigger removes the pillow, he realizes that Mary has suffocated to death. Bigger starts thinking frantically, and decides he will tell everyone that her boyfriend Jan took Mary into the house that night.\nThinking it will be better if Mary disappears as she was supposed to leave for Detroit in the morning, Bigger decides in desperation to burn her body in the house furnace. Her body initially will not fit through the furnace opening, but after decapitating it, Bigger finally manages to put the corpse inside. He adds extra coal to the furnace, leaves the corpse to burn, and goes home.\nBook Two: Flight.\nBigger's current girlfriend Bessie Mears suspects him of having done something to Mary. Bigger goes back to work.\nMr. Dalton has hired a private detective, Mr. Britten, who interrogates Bigger accusingly, but Dalton vouches for Bigger. Bigger relates the events of the previous evening in a way calculated to throw suspicion on Jan, knowing Mr. Dalton dislikes Jan because he is a Communist. When Britten finds Jan, he puts the boy and Bigger in the same room and confronts them with their conflicting stories. Jan is surprised by Bigger's story, but offers him help.\nBigger storms away from the Daltons'. He decides to write a false kidnapping note when he discovers that Mr. Dalton owns the rat-infested flat that Bigger's family rents. Bigger slips the note under the Daltons' front door and then returns to his room.\nWhen the Daltons receive the note, they contact the police, who take over the investigation from Britten, and journalists soon arrive at the house. Bigger is afraid, but does not want to leave. In the afternoon, he is ordered to remove the ashes from the furnace and make a new fire. He is terrified and starts poking the ashes with the shovel until the whole room is full of smoke. Furious, one of the journalists takes the shovel and pushes Bigger aside. He immediately finds the remains of Mary's bones and an earring in the furnace, and Bigger flees.\nBigger goes directly to Bessie and tells her the whole story. Bessie realizes that white people will think he raped the girl before killing her. They leave together, but Bigger has to drag Bessie around because she is paralyzed by fear. When they lie down together in an abandoned building, Bigger rapes Bessie and falls asleep. In the morning, he decides he has to kill her in her sleep. He hits Bessie on the head with a brick before throwing her through a window and into an air shaft, then realizes that the money he had taken from Mary's purse was in Bessie's pocket.\nBigger flees through the city, during which he sees newspaper headlines and overhears various conversations about the crime. Whites hate him for the murder and blacks hate him even more for the shame he brought to the black community. After a frantic chase over the city rooftops, the police finally catch him.\nBook Three: Fate.\nDuring his first few days in prison, Bigger does not eat, drink, or talk to anyone. Then Jan comes to visit him. He says Bigger has taught him a lot about black and white relationships, and offers him the help of a Communist lawyer named Boris Max. In the long hours that Max and Bigger spend talking, Bigger starts understanding his relationships with his family and with the world. He acknowledges his fury, his need for a future, and his wish for a meaningful life. He reconsiders his attitudes about white people, whether they are aggressive like Britten or accepting like Jan.\nThroughout the trial, the prosecuting team focus primarily on Mary's murder and pay significantly less attention to Bessie's murder. It is also falsely argued that Bigger raped Mary before killing her. The novel finishes with Max's lengthy closing argument. In it, he does not argue that Bigger is innocent. Rather he talks about how whites have intentionally blinded themselves to racial oppression, and that the ghettos, in turn, have fueled oppression and crime. He concludes with the statement that the court cannot sentence Bigger to death when they have not even acknowledged that as a human being he has the right to exist. Max urges for them to give him life in prison instead.\nBigger is found guilty and sentenced to death for murder. As his execution draws near, he appears to have come to terms with his fate.\nDevelopment.\nThe Book-of-the-Month Club exerted influence to have \"Native Son\" edited. Wright originally had a scene where Bigger and a friend illegally masturbate in a movie theater, and other lines showing that Mary sexually arouses Bigger. Library of America published a restored draft version of the book assembled by editor Arnold Rampersad.\nCharacters.\nBigger Thomas.\nThe protagonist of the novel, Bigger, commits crimes and is put on trial for his life. He is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. His acts give the novel action but the real plot involves Bigger's reactions to his environment and his crime. Through it all, Bigger struggles to discuss his feelings, but he can neither find the words to fully express himself nor does he have the time to say them. However, as they have been related through the narration, Bigger \u2013 typical of the \"outsider\" archetype \u2014 has finally discovered the only important and real thing: his life. Though too late, his realization that he is alive \u2014 and able to choose to befriend Mr. Max \u2014 creates some hope that men like him might be reached earlier.\nDebatable as the final scene is, in which for the first time Bigger calls a white man by his first name, Bigger is never anything but a failed human. He represents a black man conscious of a system of racial oppression that leaves him no opportunity to exist but through crime. As he says to Gus, \"They don't let us do nothing... [and] I can't get used to it.\" A line goes, one cannot exist by simply reacting: a man must be more than the sum total of his brutalizations. Bigger admits to wanting to be an aviator and later, to Max, aspire to other positions esteemed in the American Dream. But here he can do nothing ... just be one of many blacks in what was called the \"ghetto\" and maybe get a job serving whites; crime seems preferable, rather than accidental or inevitable. Not surprisingly, then, he already has a criminal history, and he has even been to reform school. Ultimately, the snap decisions which the law calls \"crimes\" arose from assaults to his dignity and his subsequent violent reaction towards those he feels he is entitled to dominate, and being trapped like the rat he killed with a pan, living a life where others held the skillet.\nCritical reception.\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" stated that Wright was aware \"that he was taking a terrible chance with\" the character. The Bigger in the original novel comes from a low socioeconomic background. Troy Patterson of \"The New Yorker\" argued that the character in the novel is a \"thoughtless lunk\" and \"social problem\". In all versions, Bigger is a chauffeur who accidentally kills Mary Dalton, the daughter of his boss.\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles associate English professor Richard Yarborough stated that \"Wright didn't want him to be sympathetic, so he made him very brutal. Wright didn't want tears. He felt that pity would be an evasion.\" Yarborough added, \"You can forgive Bigger for the accidental killing but not for the killing of Bessie.\" Soraya Nadia McDonald, in an article for \"The Undefeated\", stated, \"Needless to say, this is not a character who inspires sympathy.\"\nIn the novel, Bigger additionally murders his girlfriend, Bessie Mears. Jerrold Freeman, director of the 1986 film, stated that \"The scene is pivotal in the novel because it underscores the disintegration of Bigger Thomas, a victim of racism and segregation in Chicago of the 1930's who in turn becomes a victimizer.\"\nEarlier drafts of the novel show that Mary sexually arouses Bigger, but these lines were removed from the final version. Louis Menand wrote in \"The New Yorker\" that in the final version, as a result of the cuts, \"Bigger's sexuality has always been a puzzle. He hates Mary, and is afraid of her, but she is attractive and is negligent about sexual decorum, and the combination ought to provoke some sort of sexual reaction; yet in the familiar edition it does not.\"\nWright later wrote an essay called \"How 'Bigger' Was Born\", which was included as an introduction in reprints of the novel.\nMary Dalton.\nAn only child, Mary is a rich white girl who has far leftist leanings. She is a Communist sympathizer recently understood to be frolicking with Jan, a known Communist party organizer. Consequently, she is trying to abide, for a time, by her parents' wishes and go to Detroit. She is to leave the morning after Bigger is hired as the family chauffeur. Under the ruse of a University meeting, she has Bigger take her to meet Jan. When they return to the house, she is too drunk to make it to her room unassisted and thus, Bigger helps her. Mrs. Dalton comes upon them in the room and Bigger smothers Mary for fear that Mrs. Dalton will discover him. Although she dies earlier in the story, she remains a significant plot element, as Bigger constantly has flashbacks during stressful times, in which he sees various scenes from her murder.\nHenry Dalton.\nFather of Mary, owns a controlling amount of stock in a real estate firm that maintains the black ghetto. Blacks in the ghetto pay too much for rat-infested flats. As Max points out at the inquest, Mr. Dalton refuses to rent flats to black people outside of the designated ghetto area. He does this while donating money to the NAACP, buying ping-pong tables for the local black youth outreach program, and giving people like Bigger a chance at employment. Mr. Dalton's philanthropy, however, only shows off his wealth while backing up the business practices that contain an already oppressed people. An example of this is when the reader learns that Mr. Dalton owns the real estate company that controls a lot of the South Side (where most of the black community lives), but instead of using his power to improve their situation, he does things such as donate ping-pong tables to them, or hire individual blacks to work in his house. Mr. Dalton is blind to the real plight of blacks in the ghetto, a plight that he maintains.\nMrs. Dalton.\nMary Dalton's mother. Her blindness serves to accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story. Both Bigger and Max comment on how people are blind to the reality of race in America. Mrs. Dalton betrays her metaphorical blindness when she meets Mrs. Thomas. Mrs. Dalton hides behind her philanthropy and claims there is nothing she can do for Bigger.\nJan Erlone.\nJan is a member of the Communist Party as well as the boyfriend of Mary Dalton. Bigger attempts to frame him for the murder of Mary. Nonetheless, Jan uses this to try to prove that black people aren't masters of their own destinies, but rather, a product of an oppressive white society. Jan had already been seeking a way to understand the 'negro' so as to organize them along communist lines against the rich like Mr. Dalton. He is not able to fully do so, but he is able to put aside his personal trauma and persuade Max to help Bigger. He represents the idealistic young Marxist who hopes to save the world through revolution. However, before he can do that, he must understand the 'negro' much more than he thinks he does.\nTrue crime influence.\nWright based aspects of the novel on the 1938 arrest and trial of Robert Nixon, executed in 1939 following a series of \"brick bat murders\" in Los Angeles and Chicago.\nTitle.\n\"Native Son\" was the original title of Chicago writer Nelson Algren's first novel, \"Somebody in Boots\", based on a piece of doggerel about the first Texan. Algren and Wright had met at Chicago's John Reed Club circa 1933 and later worked together at the Federal Writers' Project in Chicago. According to Bettina Drew's 1989 biography \"Nelson Algren\":\n\"A Life on the Wild Side\", he bequeathed the title \"Native Son\" to Wright.\nLiterary significance and criticism.\nWright's protest novel was an immediate best-seller; it sold 250,000 hardcover copies within three weeks of its publication by the Book-of-the-Month Club on March 1, 1940. It was one of the earliest successful attempts to explain the racial divide in America in terms of the social conditions imposed on African Americans by the dominant white society. It also made Wright the wealthiest Black writer of his time and established him as a spokesperson for African American issues, and the \"father of Black American literature.\" As Irving Howe said in his 1963 essay \"Black Boys and Native Sons\": \"The day \"Native Son\" appeared, American culture was changed forever. No matter how much qualifying the book might later need, it made impossible a repetition of the old lies ... [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear, and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture.\"\nThe novel's treatment of Bigger and his motivations is an example of literary naturalism.\nThe book also received criticism from some of Wright's fellow African-American writers. James Baldwin's 1948 essay, \"Everybody's Protest Novel,\" dismissed \"Native Son\" as protest fiction, as well as limited in its understanding of human character and in artistic value. The essay was collected with nine others in Baldwin's \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955).\nIn 1991, \"Native Son\" was published for the first time in its entirety by the Library of America, together with an introduction, a chronology, and notes by Arnold Rampersad, a well-regarded scholar of African American literary works. This edition also contains Richard Wright's 1940 essay \"How 'Bigger' Was Born.\" The original edition had a masturbation scene removed at the request of the Book-of-the-Month club.\n\"Native Son\" is number 27 on \"Radcliffe's Rival 100 Best Novels List\". The Modern Library placed it number 20 on its list of the 100 best novels of the 20th Century. \"Time Magazine\" also included the novel in its \"Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.\"\nCensorship in the United States.\nThe novel has endured a series of challenges in public high schools and libraries all over the United States. Many of these challenges focus on the book's being \"sexually graphic,\" \"unnecessarily violent,\" and \"profane.\" Despite complaints from parents, many schools have successfully fought to keep Wright's work in the classroom. Some teachers believe the themes in \"Native Son\" and other challenged books \"foster dialogue and discussion in the classroom\" and \"guide students into the reality of the complex adult and social world.\"\nThe book is number 71 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990\u20132000.\n\"Native Son\" and the Bible.\nBiblical allusions appear frequently throughout \"Native Son,\" but they do not serve as an uplifting component of Bigger Thomas' life. Instead, Richard Wright seems to allude to the Bible with irony. Bigger is exposed to Christianity through his religious mother, Reverend Hammond, a Catholic priest, and his encounter with the church. However, Bigger's constant rejection of Christianity and the church reveals Wright's negative tone toward the religion. He views Christianity as an opiate of the black masses.\nBigger has several negative encounters with religion. In one instance, Bigger hears his mother singing a hymn when he sneaks into his flat to get his pistol to prepare for robbing Blum's delicatessen. His mother is singing the words: \"Lord, I want to be a Christian, /In my heart, in my heart.\" Her hymns and prayers are wholly ineffective and do nothing to forestall his violence. Even toward the end of the novel, with her son facing a possible death sentence, Bigger's mother pleads with him to pray to God for repentance. Reverend Hammond also preaches to Bigger, yet he does not understand the words of Reverend Hammond and does not pray for repentance. Instead, Bigger does the opposite and rejects Christianity. When he later sees the fiery cross that the Ku Klux Klan displays, he tears the cross which Reverend Hammond had given him from his neck and throws it to the ground. In yet another instance, Bigger overhears the church choir singing and ponders whether he should become Christian. However, his contemplation of changing his heart into a humble heart causes him to reject the idea because it meant, \"losing his hope of living in the world. And he would never do that.\"\nWright directly alludes to the Bible in the epigraph of \"Native Son\". The epigraph states, \"Even today is my complaint rebellious; my stroke is heavier than my groaning\" (Job 23:2). This quotation is from the Book of Job. According to the Bible, Job was a faithful man of God. However, Job experienced immense suffering in his lifetime, losing his children and his great wealth. He was stricken with poverty and boils. In these afflictions, God was silent, leaving Job in a state of deep spiritual anguish. This tone of anguish and despair is established in the epigraph at the outset of \"Native Son\" and emphasizes Bigger's suffering.\nJob and Bigger are parallel characters in their dealings with suffering. That further suggests the aptness of Wright's epigraph. Job suffered trials from an outside force that he could not control. Similar to Job, Bigger struggled with an outside force of the racial norms of society. The parallel is further strengthened by the freedom both characters display in their defiance.\nSavory has mentioned two quotes in the book of Job and \"Native Son\" that suggest Bigger and Job's parallel stories. The protagonist of the book of Job lifts himself proudly through his suffering. \"If the charges my opponent brings against me were written down so that I could have them, I would wear them proudly around my neck, and hold them up for everyone to see. I would tell God everything I have done, and hold my head high in his presence\". During this point of the passage, Job has yet to confess his sins to God. Convinced of his innocence, Job asserts that he will stand proud and tall in God's presence.\nBigger has a similar experience. He muses, \"He had done this. He had brought all this about. In all of his life these two murders were the most meaningful things that had ever happened to him. He was living, truly and deeply, no matter what others might think, looking at him with their blind eyes. Never had he had the chance to live out the consequences of his actions: never had his will been so free as in this night and day of fear and murder and flight.\" It is the first time in the novel where Bigger does not throw the blame on others but instead asserts that he was responsible for his actions. Through that, he finally experiences free will and finds freedom.\nInfluence on Wright by Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\"Native Son\" contains several allusions to other works that were significant during Wright's time. One of the major works that influenced \"Native Son\" was Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852), the best-selling novel of the 19th century which also played a major role in the abolitionist movement.\nWright's \"Native Son\" (1940) contains multiple similarities to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". Like \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", \"Native Son\" can be interpreted as an illustration of the harsh reality of racial injustice in the United States. James Baldwin, writing in the \"Partisan Review\", boldly linked the two novels. In both books, racial injustice is a \"pre-ordained pattern set upon the living reality\". There is little the characters can do to escape racial discrimination. Additionally, both of these novels are a form of social protest, seek to disprove the idea that society neatly analyzes and treats race, and portrays African Americans who emerge confused, dishonest, and panicked as they are trapped and immobilized as prisoners within the American dream.\nThe title and content of another book Wright published, the collection of short stories \"Uncle Tom's Children\" (1938), suggest the inspiration Stowe's work provided Wright in his own books. Both \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and \"Uncle Tom's Children\" exploit the term \"Uncle Tom,\" attacking an African American who seems to act in a subservient manner toward white people. However, while these two titles are similar and contain similar themes, Wright's \"Native Son\" can also be considered reactionary against \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" Bigger Thomas is the antithesis of Uncle Tom. Bigger is fearful of and angry toward white society. He also lacks the religious background and Christian faith that Uncle Tom possessed. This contrast between the characters of Bigger Thomas and Uncle Tom may be Wright's attempt to show the contemporary racial conflicts that persisted long after the publication of Stowe's novel in 1852.\nInfluence of Communism on \"Native Son\".\nWright was affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States both prior to and following his publishing of \"Native Son\". The Communist ideas in \"Native Son\" are evident as Wright draws a parallel between the Scottsboro boys case and Bigger Thomas' case. One parallel is the court scene in \"Native Son\", in which Max calls the \"hate and impatience\" of \"the mob congregated upon the streets beyond the window\" (Wright, p.\u00a0386) and the \"mob who surrounded the Scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene\" after the Scottsboro boys' initial conviction. Critics attacked Max's final speech in the courtroom, claiming that it was an irrelevant elaboration on Wright's own Communist beliefs and unrelated to Bigger's case. \nThere are many different interpretations concerning which group was the intended target of Max's speech. James Baldwin, a renowned critic of Wright's, presented his own interpretation of Max's final speech in \"Notes by a Native Son\"; Baldwin says Max's speech is \"addressed to those among us of good will and it seems to say that, though there are whites and blacks among us who hate each other, we will not; there are those who are betrayed by greed, by guilt, by blood, by blood lust, but not we; we will set our faces against them and join hands and walk together into that dazzling future when there will be no white or black\" (Baldwin, p.\u00a047). However, other critics, such as Siegel, have argued that the original text in \"Native Son\" does not imply \"the dazzling future when there will be no white or black\".\nAdaptations.\nOn stage.\n\"Native Son\" was adapted for the stage by Wright and Paul Green, with some conflict between the authors affecting the project. The initial production, directed by Orson Welles and with Canada Lee as Bigger, opened at the St. James Theatre on March 24, 1941.\nThe book was newly adapted and directed again by Kent Gash (in conjunction with the Paul Green Foundation) for Intiman Theatre in Seattle, Washington, in 2006. The production, featuring Ato Essandoh as Bigger Thomas, was a more literal translation of the book than the 1941 version and was a critical success.\nIn 2014, a stage adaptation by Nambi E. Kelley played the Court Theatre in Chicago with Jerod Haynes starring as Bigger Thomas. Directed by Seret Scott, the show was the highest grossing straight play in the theatre's 60-year history, went on to win multiple awards, and has had celebrated productions across the country, most notably at Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. The play can be purchased through Samuel French Publications.\nIn films.\n\"Native Son\" has been adapted into a film three times: once in 1951, again in 1986 and a third released in 2019. The first version was made in Argentina. Wright, aged 42, played the protagonist despite being twice the age of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas. The film was not well received; Wright's performance was a particular target of critics.\n1986 film.\nVictor Love, who portrayed Bigger in the 1986 film, stated that his appearance and voice not being \"street\" meant that he did not feel he was initially seriously considered for the role. He was auditioning for \"Othello\", which he did not get, when he was called to perform as Bigger. Love felt that Wright did not really mean for Bigger Thomas to be played unsympathetically and that instead he was afraid to ask people to care for Bigger. According to Love the filmmakers initially refused him the role, but later offered it to him. The 1986 \"Native Son\" film omits the murder of Bessie, and Yarborough described this version of Bigger as \"much more a sympathetic victim\". Canby wrote that this Bigger was acted \"in such a passive way that Bigger Thomas never appears capable of taking charge of his own destiny, which is at the heart of Wright's terrifying fable.\"\n2019 film.\nThe 2019 film version of Bigger lives in a middle class household. He has, as described by Patterson, \"goth black\" nail polish and \"toxic green\" dyed hair. He also enjoys reading Ralph Ellison books and is able to teach himself material. Anna Shechtman of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that the 2019 Bigger has a \"confident style\" stemming from Ellison and that this Bigger \"has an assuredness that Wright, Love, and even the character that Wright originally wrote seemed to lack.\" In regards to the 2019 film, Patterson stated that this Bigger is \"a bit adrift\", \"serious and cerebral\", and \"a late adolescent at loose ends\". In the film, Bessie describes Bigger as \"a fixer upper\", reflecting that he has issues to work on. In this version, Bigger begins trying to choke Bessie but ultimately does not do it. Filmmaker Rashid Johnson explained that he removed Bessie's death from the film because having her survive would \"give Bigger an opportunity to be both complicated and (empathetic) simultaneously, and that was just a step off of a cliff that didn't allow us to tell the story in a (contemporary) way that we thought would facilitate conversation.\"\nAllusions and references in other works.\nFilms.\n\"Native Son\" is mentioned in a flashback in the film \"American History X\" (1998), when Dennis criticizes his son Derek's teacher for including lessons on African-American literature and affirmative action.\nAn allusion to the story is presented in part 1 of \"The Second Renaissance\" (2003), a short anime film from The Animatrix collection. In this film, a domestic robot named \"B1-66ER\" is placed on trial for murder. The name is created using Leet Speak.\nIn the motion picture \"The Help\" (2011), the main character (played by Emma Stone) is seen in an oblique camera angle to have a copy of \"Native Son\" on her bookshelf.\nFilm adaptations were released in 1951, 1986 and 2019. The 2019 adaptation was directed by Rashid Johnson and starred Ashton Sanders (as Bigger Thomas), Margaret Qualley, Nick Robinson and KiKi Layne.\nLiterature.\nNotes of a Native Son is the title of a collection of ten essays by James Baldwin, published in 1955, mostly tackling issues of race in America and Europe, that includes critical essays addressing \"Native Son\". James Baldwin's short story Previous Condition mentions a lead part in a play production of \"Native Son\" as \"type-casting\".\nIn Cecil Brown's novel \"The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger\" (1969), the protagonist, George Washington, states that he is not fearful, that he is not a \"Bigger Thomas\".\n\"Native Son\" is mentioned in Edward Bunker's novel \"Little Boy Blue\" (1981) as being read while in solitary confinement by the main character, Alex Hammond, who is said to be greatly fascinated by it.\nA large section of Percival Everett's novel \"Erasure\" (1999) contains a parody of \"Native Son\", entitled \"My Pafology\".\nA line from the trial speech by Bigger Thomas' lawyer, Boris Max, is woven into the plot of Lemony Snicket's book, \"The Penultimate Peril\" (2005): \"Richard Wright, an American novelist of the realist school, asks a famous unfathomable question... 'Who knows when some slight shock,' he asks, 'disturbing the delicate balance between social order and thirsty aspiration, shall send the skyscrapers in our cities toppling?' ... So when Mr. Wright asks his question, he might be wondering if a small event, such as a stone dropping into a pond, can cause ripples in the system of the world, and tremble the things that people want, until all this rippling and trembling brings down something enormous...\"\nIn Ron Suskind's book, \"A Hope in the Unseen\" (1998), \"Native Son\" is referenced during a discussion the main character takes part in at Brown University.\nMusic.\nBigger Thomas is mentioned in one of the lyrical hooks of \"The Ritual\" in Saul Williams' \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!\" (2007).\nThe U2 song \"Vertigo\" was called \"Native Son\" by the band during the recording sessions for \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" (2004). The song was originally released digitally as part of \"Unreleased &amp; Rare\", which debuted in The Complete U2 (2004), and later in \"U2: Medium, Rare &amp; Remastered\" (2009).\nTelevision.\nOn the HBO series \"Brave New Voices\", during the 2008 finals, the Chicago team performed a poem called \"Lost Count: A Love Story\". This poem addresses the youth on youth murder in Chicago and includes the phrase: \"Being brown in Bigger Thomas' town\".\nIn the \"\" episode, \"Far Beyond the Stars\" (1998), Benny Russell cites \"Native Son\" as an example of a significant work of African-American literature.\nHBO released \"Native Son\", a film adaptation of the book, on April 6, 2019. It was directed by Rashid Johnson, starring Ashton Sanders as Bigger Thomas and Kiki Layne as Bessie Mears.\nCritical reception.\nCritical reception remains mixed given disparities in the perception of Bigger Thomas: \"Is he a helpless victim of his environment? A symbol of the proletariat empowered by violence? Is the incompleteness of Bigger's personality a realistic portrayal or an act of bad faith that succumbs to racist caricature?\" Audiences were also split along the divide of race and gender: they were forced to choose between sympathizing with a rapist, or condemn him and ignore that he was a victim of systemic racism. Said Ayana Mathis of \"The New York Times\", \"I don't imagine many black people would have embraced such a grotesque portrait of themselves. [...] What future, what vision is reflected in such a miserable and incompletely realized creature?\"\nJames Baldwin wrote, \"No American Negro exists who does not have his private Bigger Thomas living in his skull.\" Frantz Fanon discussed the novel in his 1952 essay \"L'exp\u00e9rience v\u00e9cue du noir\" (\"The Fact of Blackness\"). \"In the end\", wrote Fanon, \"Bigger Thomas acts. To put an end to his tension, he acts, he responds to the world's anticipation.\" The book was a successful and groundbreaking best seller. However, it was also criticized by Baldwin and others as ultimately advancing Bigger as a stereotype, and not a real character.\nShechtman wrote that the character \"was a disgrace\" to middle class African-Americans, adding that liberal white Americans saw Bigger more positively as \"a black antihero, claiming their interest and testing their sympathy\". Canby concurred that middle class African-Americans saw the character negatively, adding that white people who held prejudice against blacks had their beliefs that black men were sexual threats confirmed by the character. Shechtman stated that, overall, the character \"had quickly become lodged in the country's popular imagination.\"\nEllison wrote that \"Bigger Thomas had none of the finer qualities of Richard Wright, none of the imagination, none of the sense of poetry, none of the gaiety. And I preferred Richard Wright to Bigger Thomas.\" The initial release of the 1950 film was heavily edited. An African-American newspaper review described the edited film as \"leaving the audience with no choice but to condemn\" Bigger, due to omission of key characteristics.\nAnalysis.\nDavid Bradley wrote in \"The New York Times\" that, in his first reading of the novel, while he strongly disliked the work, \"It wasn't that Bigger failed as a character, exactly\" as Bradley knew of the author's intentions to make Bigger unlikeable, but Bradley felt the author did not succeed in making Bigger symbolize ordinary black men. Upon reading an edition of the book with an introduction, Bradley stated \"Suddenly I realized that many readers of \"Native Son\" had seen Bigger Thomas as a symbol\". Upon researching other writings from the author Bradley interpreted Bigger as Wright's autobiographical view of himself, and Bradley changed his own view to see the work as a tragedy despite Wright initially not meaning for this.\nClyde Taylor, an associate professor of English at Tufts University, criticized Bradley's view, claiming that the analysis failed to perceive how the work \"disrupted the accommodation to racism through polite conventions in American social discourse\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The band announced another reunion in 2013. Since the breakup of Black Flag, Ginn has recorded solo albums, and performed with such bands as October Faction, Gone, Confront James, Mojack, and others. He was 99th on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\"\nEarly life.\nGinn was born June 8, 1954, in Tucson, Arizona. As a child, Ginn moved to California, living first in Wasco, then settling in Hermosa Beach. He began an electronics company in Hermosa Beach, California, called Solid State Tuners, when he was 12 years old. He was also an amateur radio operator. Ginn became a vegetarian at 17 years old in 1971 and has been a vegan since 1998.\nGinn claims to have never genuinely enjoyed rock music during his youth, believing it to be \"just trying to interject some kind of legitimacy into making three-minute commercials.\"\nLegacy.\nMany artists have cited Ginn as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him, including Buzz Osborne of Melvins,who also stated that he brought Kurt Cobain to his first punk show, a Black Flag show in 1984 where Kurt stated that he wanted that guitar sound for his band.

Founded in 1847, it was formerly self-styled as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\", a slogan from which its once integrated WGN radio and WGN television received their call letters. It is the most-read daily newspaper in the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region, and the sixth-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States.\nIn the 1850s, under Joseph Medill, the \"Chicago Tribune\" became closely associated with the Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln, and the then new Republican Party's progressive wing. In the 20th century, under Medill's grandson 'Colonel' Robert R. McCormick, its reputation was that of a crusading newspaper with an outlook that promoted American conservatism and opposed the New Deal. Its reporting and commentary reached markets outside Chicago through family and corporate relationships at the New York \"Daily News\" and the \"Washington Times-Herald\". Through much of the 20th century and into the early 21st, it employed a network of overseas news bureaus and foreign correspondents. In the 1960s, its corporate parent owner, Tribune Company began expanding into new markets buying additional daily papers. In 2008, for the first time in its history, its editorial page endorsed a Democrat, Barack Obama, a U.S. senator from Illinois, for U.S. president.\nOriginally published solely as a broadsheet, the \"Tribune\" announced on January 13, 2009, that it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. The change, however, proved unpopular with readers; in August 2011, the \"Tribune\" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels.\nThe \"Tribune\" was owned by parent company Tribune Publishing. In May 2021, Tribune Publishing was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media; since then, the newspaper's coverage has evolved away from national and international news and toward coverage of Illinois and especially Chicago-area news.\nThe \"Tribune\" settled a lawsuit over illegal charges to consumers in 2013 and was again sued for deceptive billing practices in 2023.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe \"Tribune\" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the \"Tribune\" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time, it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855, that the \"Tribune\" formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.\nAround 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Charles H. Ray of Galena, Illinois, through Horace Greeley, convinced Joseph Medill of Cleveland's \"Leader\" to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the \"Tribune\". Under their leadership, the \"Tribune\" distanced itself from the Know Nothings, and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party. However, the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials, in the wake of the massive famine immigration from Ireland.\nThe \"Tribune\" absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the \"Free West\" in 1855, the \"Democratic Press\" of William Bross in 1858, and the \"Chicago Democrat\" in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position when elected as Mayor of Chicago. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the \"Chicago Press &amp; Tribune\". On October 25, 1860, it became the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\". Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an abolitionist agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.\nIn 1861, the \"Tribune\" published new lyrics by William W. Patton for the song \"John Brown's Body\". These rivaled the lyrics published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\n20th century.\nIn the 20th-century, Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto \"The American Paper for Americans\". From the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the Democrats and the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\nWhen McCormick assumed the position of co-editor with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson in 1910, the \"Tribune\" was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000. The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as \"Little Orphan Annie\" and \"Moon Mullins\". They promoted political crusades, and their first success came with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. William Lorimer. At the same time, the \"Tribune\" competed with the Hearst paper, the \"Chicago Examiner\", in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out William Keeley, the newspaper's managing editor. By 1918, the \"Examiner\" was forced to merge with the \"Chicago Herald\".\nIn 1919, Patterson left the \"Tribune\" and moved to New York City to launch his own newspaper, the \"New York Daily News\". In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's \"Herald-Examiner\", McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The \"Tribune\" won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. The same year, the \"Chicago Tribune\" hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood. \nThe newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft. But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship CSS \"Acadia\".\nThe \"Tribune\"'s reputation for innovation extended to radio; it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN, the station call letters standing for the paper's self-description as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\". WGN Television was launched on April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remained \"Tribune\" properties for nine decades and were among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The \"Tribune\"'s East Coast sibling, the New York \"Daily News\", later established WPIX television and FM radio.)\nThe \"Tribune\"'s legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city's Century of Progress exposition.\nOne of the great scoops in \"Tribune\" history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The \"Tribune\"'s June 7, 1942, front page article implying that the United States had broken Japan's naval code could have resulted in the Japanese learning a closely guarded military secret. The story implying that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the \"Tribune\".\nFrom 1940 to 1943, the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with \"The Chicago Tribune Comic Book\", responding to the new success of comic books. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer-lasting \"The Spirit Section\", which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.\nUnder McCormick's stewardship, the \"Tribune\" was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity. Beginning in 1934, the paper compiled lists of dozens of common words whose spelling could be made \"saner\", removing double L's and shortening \"-ogue\" endings to \"-og\", among other changes. In 1939, some of these alternative spellings were abandoned due to unpopularity, such as \"crum\" for \"crumb\" and \"sherif\" for \"sheriff\", while introducing more prominent changes, such as the words \"altho\", \"tho\", \"thoro\", and \"thru\", which would become distinctive features of the \"Tribune\" for decades. Most of these simplified spellings were kept until a stylebook update in 1975 adopted \"Webster's Third\" as the paper's authority on spelling, with an editorial concluding that \"we do not want to make any more trouble between Johnny and his teacher.\" However, a few others, including \"cigaret\" and \"dialog\", were kept as late as 1981.\n1948 U.S. presidential election.\nThe paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.\nMcCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time.\nIn 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton Kirkpatrick, the \"Tribune\" began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.\nOn May 1, 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the \"Tribune\" published the complete 246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes, in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24\u00a0hours after the transcripts' release by the Nixon White House. Not only was the \"Tribune\" the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the U.S. Government Printing Office's published version, and made headlines doing so.\nA week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that \"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record.\" The \"Tribune\"'s editors concluded that \"nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency,\" and called for Nixon's resignation. The \"Tribune\" call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly perceived the \"Tribune\"'s editorial as a loss of a longtime supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal.\nOn December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a \"young and talented columnist\" for the paper, whose work had \"won a following among many \"Tribune\" readers over the last two years\", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that one column he wrote, dating to November 23, 1975, contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, \"Tribune\" editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.\nAfter leaving, Soll married Pam Zekman, a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived \"Chicago Times\" magazine,&lt;ref name=\"google/books=g1C5vwEACAAJ\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; by Small Newspaper Group Inc. of Kankakee, Illinois, in the late 1980s.\nSoll was born in 1946, in Chicago, to Marjorie and Jules Soll. Soll graduated from New Trier High School, received a Bachelor of Arts in 1968 from Colgate University, and a master's degree from Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University in 1970.&lt;ref name=\"legacy.suntimes/21263473\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"chicago.suntimes/18395757\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn January 1977, \"Tribune\" columnist Will Leonard died at age 64. In March 1978, the \"Tribune\" announced that it hired columnist Bob Greene from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\".\nKirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon, who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the United Press International. James Squires served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989.\nJack Fuller served as the \"Tribune\"'s editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the \"Chicago Tribune\". Howard Tyner served as the \"Tribune\"'s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.\nThe \"Tribune\" won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s. Editorial cartoonist Dick Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.\nIn September 1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the \"Tribune\" after a 38-year career at the \"Sun-Times\".\nIn September 1982, the \"Chicago Tribune\" opened a new $180 million printing facility, Freedom Center.\nIn November 1982, \"Tribune\" managing editor William H. \"Bill\" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle with leukemia.\nIn May 1983, \"Tribune\" columnist Aaron Gold died at age 45 of complications from leukemia. Gold had coauthored the Tribune's \"Inc.\" column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper's \"Tower Ticker\" column.\nThe \"Tribune\" scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival \"Sun-Times\".\nIn 1986, the \"Tribune\" announced that film critic Gene Siskel, the \"Tribune\"'s best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections.\nThe demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie review show, then known as \"At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert\" and later known as \"Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; The Movies\" from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Television unit. \"He has done a great job for us,\" editor James Squires said at the time. \"It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that.\" Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's \"Tribune\" bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that freelance position until he died in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.\nIn February 1988, Tribune foreign correspondent Jonathan Broder resigned after publishing his article from February 22 that contained a number of sentences and phrases taken, without attribution, from a column written by another writer, Joel Greenberg, that had been published 10 days earlier in \"The Jerusalem Post\".\nIn August 1988, \"Chicago Tribune\" reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.\nIn November 1992, \"Tribune\" associate subject editor Searle \"Ed\" Hawley was arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in his home in Evanston, Illinois. Hawley formally resigned from the paper in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3\u00a0years in prison.\nIn October 1993, the \"Tribune\" fired its longtime military affairs writer, retired Marine David Evans, saying publicly that the position was being replaced by a national security writer.\nIn December 1993, the \"Tribune\"'s longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was fired after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago. Horrock, who shortly thereafter left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention to the \"Tribune\"'s D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity broadcast journalists in Washington.\nIn December 1993, the \"Tribune\" hired Margaret Holt from the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" as its assistant managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers. In mid-1995, Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly created job, customer service editor.\nIn 1994, reporter Brenda You was fired by the \"Tribune\" after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers and lending them photographs from the \"Tribune\"'s photo library. She later worked for the \"National Enquirer\" and as a producer for \"The Jerry Springer Show\" before committing suicide in November 2005.\nIn April 1994, the \"Tribune\"'s new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott criticized Perkins on the air, and the \"Tribune\" later printed a correction acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement. Eight months later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly thereafter.\nIn December 1995, the alternative newsweekly \"Newcity\" published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play \"The Front Page\") but quickly identified by \"Tribune\" reporters as that of former \"Tribune\" reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the \"Chicago Reader\" that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for \"Newcity\".\nIn 1997, the \"Tribune\" celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book \"Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City\".\nOn April 29, 1997, popular columnist Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the \"Tribune\" promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.\nOn June 1, 1997, the \"Tribune\" published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary Schmich called \"Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young\", otherwise known as \"Wear Sunscreen\" or the \"Sunscreen Speech\". The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann.\nIn 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the \"Tribune\" after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter Don King for \"Emerge\" magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the \"Chicago Tribune\" Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas\u2014and suspend his photographer on the \"Emerge\" story, Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Tribune\" photographer Ovie Carter for a month\u2014because Thomas did not tell the \"Tribune\" about his outside work and also because the \"Emerge\" story wound up appearing in print first.\nOn June 6, 1999, the \"Tribune\" published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door. An airline representative wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account \"totally untrue, unprofessional and damaging to our airline\" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew, and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner \"now says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced.\"\nThe \"Tribune\" has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com (2008), and ChicagoNow (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as \"RedEye\".\n21st century.\nAnn Marie Lipinski was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper's editor in July 2008. In early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned as well. Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the editor of the \"Tribune\"'s \"RedEye\" tabloid.\nIn June 2000, Times Mirror merged with Tribune Company making \"The Baltimore Sun\" and its community papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of Tribune.\nIn July 2000, Tribune outdoors columnist John Husar, who had written about his need for a new liver transplant, died at age 63, just over a week after receiving part of a new liver from a live donor.\nTribune's Baltimore Community papers include \"Arbutus Times\", \"Baltimore Messenger\", \"Catonsville Times\", \"Columbia Flier\", \"Howard County Times\", \"The Jeffersonian\", \"Laurel Leader\", \"Lifetimes\", \"North County News\", \"Northeast Booster\", \"Northeast Reporter\", \"Owings Mills Times\", and \"Towson Times\".\nThe \"Howard County Times\" was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban Newspaper Association.\nThe \"Towson Times\" expands coverage beyond the Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.\nThe \"Tribune\" won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century. Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the \"Tribune\" in 2001 for international reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team\u2014lead writers of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajac\u2014won the honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system. In 2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial writing. In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois. And, in 2008, an investigative reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted Gregory, Michael Oneal, Evan Osnos and photojournalist Scott Strazzante won the Pulitzer for its series about faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.\nIn late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving the \"Tribune\" after just two months because he was homesick. He ultimately returned to \"The Boston Globe\", where he had been working immediately before the \"Tribune\" had hired him.\nOn September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist, Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging \"engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column.\" The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois. \"Greene's behavior was a serious violation of \"Tribune\" ethics and standards for its journalists,\" Lipinski wrote. \"We deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this newspaper.\"\nIn January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the \"Los Angeles Times\", was hired as new \"Tribune\" sports columnist. He and colleague Rick Morrissey would write the \"In the Wake of the News Column\" originated by Ring Lardner.\nIn March 2004, the \"Tribune\" announced that freelance reporter Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the \"Tribune\" in 2002 after 16\u00a0years as a foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written over the prior three years.\nIn May 2004, the \"Tribune\" revealed that freelance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant\u2014namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. \"Upon questioning, the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three restaurants and could not verify the prices,\" the paper noted. After the correction, the \"Tribune\" stopped using Falanga.\nIn October 2004, \"Tribune\" editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written for the paper's WomanNews section by freelance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli titled \"You c_nt say that (or can you?),\" about a noted vulgarism. The paper ordered every spare body to go to the \"Tribune\"'s printing plant to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the October 27 package of preprinted sections in the \"Tribune\".\nIn September 2008, the \"Tribune\" considered hiring controversial sports columnist Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from \"Tribune\" archrival \"Chicago Sun-Times\". Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the \"Sun-Times\" threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, which was to run until August 2009. Sports columnist Rick Morrissey defected to the \"Sun-Times\" in December 2009.\nIn April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. \"We'll let the e-mail speak for itself,\" reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as \"a brief market research project\".\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the \"Tribune\" had multiple rounds of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with the industrywide declines in advertising revenues:\nThe \"Tribune\" broke the story on May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called \"Category I\" admissions program, university President B. Joseph \"Joe\" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the \"Tribune\", in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted. The \"Tribune\" has since filed suit against the university administration under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.\nOn February 8, 2010, the \"Chicago Tribune\" shrank its newspaper's width by an inch. They said that the new format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal content changes.\nIn July 2011, the \"Chicago Tribune\" underwent its first round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting go about 20 editors and reporters. Among those let go were DuPage County reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer Dave Pierini.\nOn March 15, 2012, the \"Tribune\" laid off 15 editorial staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died on November 12, 2012). At the same time, the paper gave buyouts to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.\nIn June 2012, the \"Tribune\"'s Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.\nIn September 2012, \"Tribune\" education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the paper to become a real estate broker, City Hall reporter Kristen Mack left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and the \"Tribune\" hired Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer John J. Kim from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\".\nIn October 2012, the \"Tribune\"'s science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join a public relations firm.\nAlso in October 2012, the \"Tribune\" announced plans to create a paywall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.\nIn February 2013, the \"Tribune\" agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group over unpaid overtime wages. The suit had been filed in federal court on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from July 2010 until October 2011. The paper's TribLocal unit had been formed in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.\nOn June 12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing tribute was posted again, which showed the words \"We are Chicago\" above the names of Boston sports teams. On the graphic on June 12, the word \"Bruins\" was ripped off and the comment was added, \"Yeah, not right now we're not\", in a reference to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against the Boston Bruins. Gerould Kern tweeted later that the \"Tribune\" \"still supports [Boston] after all you've been through. We regret any offense. Now let's play hockey.\"\nOn November 20, 2013, the \"Tribune\" laid off another 12 or so editorial staffers.\nOn April 6, 2014, the \"Tribune\" increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, or 42.9%, to $2.50. By January 2017 the price increased again, up $1 or 40% at newsracks, to $3.50. At newsstands it went up also $1, or 33.3%, to $3.99.\nOn January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor.\nOn February 18, 2016, the Tribune announced the retirement of editor Gerould Kern and the immediate promotion of the paper's editorial page editor, R. Bruce Dold, to be the Tribune's editor.\nOn June 9, 2018, the Tribune ended their 93-year stint at Tribune Tower and moved to One Prudential Plaza. The tower was later converted to condos.\n2020s.\nOn February 27, 2020, the \"Tribune\" announced that publisher and editor Bruce Dold would leave the \"Tribune\" on April 30, 2020, and would step down immediately as editor in chief. His replacement as editor was Colin McMahon. Also, the paper announced that one of the two managing editors of the paper, Peter Kendall, would leave the \"Tribune\" on February 28, 2020.\nIn January 2021, the \"Chicago Tribune\" moved out of One Prudential Plaza, and relocated their offices and newsroom to Freedom Center.\nIn May 2021, the paper was purchased by Alden Global Capital. Alden immediately launched a round of employee buyouts, reducing the newsroom staff by 25 percent, and the cuts continued. A former reporter said the paper is being \"snuffed out, quarter after quarter after quarter\". A report in \"The Atlantic\" said that Alden's business model is simple: \"Gut the staff, sell the real estate, jack up subscription prices, and wring as much cash as possible out of the enterprise until eventually enough readers cancel their subscriptions that the paper folds, or is reduced to a desiccated husk of its former self.\"\nMitch Pugh was named the \"Tribune\"'s executive editor on August 20, 2021, after eight years in the same role at \"The Post and Courier\" in Charleston, South Carolina.\nEditorial.\nPolicy.\nIn a 2007 statement of principles published in the \"Tribune\"'s print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas.\nThe \"Tribune\" brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas.\nThe \"Tribune\" places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The \"Tribune\" embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.\nThe \"Tribune\" has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. It criticized the George W. Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal from office.\nIn 2018, the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" withdrew their websites from European Union nations to avoid the purview of the General Data Protection Regulation.\nElection endorsements.\nIn 2004, the \"Tribune\" endorsed President George W. Bush for reelection, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator Barack Obama\u2014the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president. The \"Tribune\" endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012, and in 2020 would endorse another Democrat, Joe Biden, who had served as vice president under Obama. In 2024, it abstained from endorsement.\nThe \"Tribune\" has occasionally backed candidates of other parties for president. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party newspaper editor, and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William Howard Taft. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, for president, over Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nEven when it uniformly backed Republicans for president, the \"Tribune\" endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House of Representatives' longest-serving Republican. Although the \"Tribune\" endorsed George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.\nTribune Company.\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" was the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed \"Tribune Media\"), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owned the WGN radio station (720\u00a0AM) and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the \"Los Angeles Times\"\u2014which displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property\u2014and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009;the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing.\nTribune Company owned the New York \"Daily News\" from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder of the \"News\" \u2014 Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson \u2014 was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of \"Tribune\" editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper \"Newsday\"\u2014founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter), Alicia Patterson\u2014to Long Island cable TV company Cablevision.\nFrom 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.\nPulitzer Prizes.\nColonel McCormick prevented the \"Tribune\" for years from participating in the Pulitzer Prize competition. But it has won 28 of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing.\nThe \"Tribune\" won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 for reporting. A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979. In 2022, Cecilia Reyes, \"Chicago Tribune\", and Madison Hopkins, Better Government Association, won a Pulitzer Prize in local reporting for a piercing examination of the city's long history of failed building- and fire-safety code enforcement, which let scofflaw landlords commit serious violations that resulted in dozens of unnecessary deaths.\nCurrent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nZell ownership and bankruptcy.\nIn December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2\u00a0billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman. A year after going private, following a $124\u00a0million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13\u00a0billion and assets of $7.6\u00a0billion.\nSam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.\nAs part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich on December 9, 2008. Specifically, Blagojevich was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.\nIn the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a \"fraudulent transfer\" of wealth.\nThe law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock. Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company, the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500\u00a0million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.\nThe Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling off many of its assets.\nTribune Publishing divestment.\nTribune Publishing, owning the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed Tribune Media. Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.\nSpinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%. Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.\nOn February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing Company agreed to sell the \"Los Angeles Times\" to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong. The purchase, made through Soon-Shiong's Nant Capital investment fund, was valued at $500 million, along with the assumption of $90 million in pension liabilities. The deal, which also included the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" and other assets, was finalized on June 16, 2018.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of her books concern the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). She co-wrote some of her works with her husband, Clark L. Kidd, and also co-wrote a novel with Orson Scott Card.\nLife and career.\nKidd was born in New Orleans and raised in Mandeville, Louisiana. She graduated from Brigham Young University and was baptized in the LDS Church. Raised a Protestant, Kidd is quoted as converting because she wanted a patriarchal blessing, but couldn't receive one unless she was a baptized member of the LDS faith. Upon receiving her bachelor's degree, Kidd reported for the \"Deseret News\" in Salt Lake City. During this time, she became friends with Orson Scott Card, who was then an assistant editor for the official LDS magazine, \"The Ensign\". After Kathryn married Clark Kidd, the two worked with Card on a project for Compute! Books. Clark programmed the games in a series while Kathy wrote the directions. The couple moved to Virginia in 1987. She was subsequently associate and managing editor of \"Meridian\" magazine until 2008, after which she continued writing for it and also for \"Nauvoo Times\". She died on December 14, 2015.\nPublications.\nKidd wrote and co-wrote with her husband several non-fiction books of practical advice geared toward fellow members of the LDS Church. These include titles such as \"Ward Activities for the Clueless\", \"Food Storage for the Clueless\", \"On My Own and Clueless: An LDS Guide to Independent Life\", and \"A Parent's Survival Guide to the Internet\". The Kidds jointly authored \"A Convert's Guide to Mormon Life\", which won an Association of Mormon Letters Award for devotional literature. They also collaborated on a large number of articles for \"Meridian\".\nKidd also wrote a few comedic novels about life among members of the church, including \"Paradise Vue\" and \"Return to Paradise\", and children's books such as \"The Innkeeper's Daughter\".\nKidd was a longtime friend of Orson Scott Card. In 1989, Card founded a Mormon publishing company with his wife and brother, called \"Hatrack River Publications.\" Card approached Kidd to provide a novel that fit the company's themes. Kidd's novel \"Paradise Vue\" became its first publication. Other collaboration with Card included co-authoring \"Lovelock\", the first part of a proposed trilogy.\nLovelock.\n\"Lovelock\" is a speculative science fiction novel co-written by both Kidd and Orson Scott Card. The novel is narrated by a scientist who takes the name of real scientist James Lovelock. The novel examines the Gaia Hypothesis through the lens of Lovelock, who is a genetically-enhanced capuchin monkey. Lovelock the monkey is assigned to examine the lives of several humans on board the \"Mayflower\" spacecraft, and in the process becomes more humanized and rebellious.\nKidd passed away before the second installment, \"Rasputin,\" could be published.\nParadise Vue.\n\"Paradise Vue\" takes place in an LDS ward congregation. Beneath their perfectionist fa\u00e7ade, the Church members in Kidd's novel exhibit cruel, dark, and obsessive tendencies.

Created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the character first appeared in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #120 (April 1979) as a member of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight.\nNorthstar is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. The character possesses the ability to travel at superhuman speeds, fly, and project photonic energy blasts. His twin sister, Aurora, possesses similar abilities. Although the character was initially depicted as a member of Alpha Flight, he has appeared regularly as a member of the X-Men since joining the team of mutants in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #414 (December 2002).\nThe character is one of the first openly gay superheroes in American comic books, and the first openly gay character to come out in a book published by Marvel Comics. He married his husband, Kyle Jinadu, in \"Astonishing X-Men\" #51 (June 2012), which was the first depiction of a same-sex wedding in mainstream comics.\nPublication history.\n1979\u20131994.\nNorthstar debuted in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #120 (April 1979) as part of the Canadian government sponsored team Alpha Flight, who sought to take Wolverine of the X-Men into custody. In 1983, Alpha Flight went on to star in its own comic, with Northstar as a charter member. In addition to the \"Alpha Flight\" comic and associated annuals, Northstar and other members of the team made numerous guest appearances in other titles, particularly \"Uncanny X-Men\" and \"Wolverine\". Northstar was also featured in miniseries including two \"X-Men and Alpha Flight\" series and \"Secret Wars II\".\nCreator John Byrne was reluctant to produce an initial run of the 1983 \"Alpha Flight\" comic series for lack of developed and compelling characters. They had no back-stories and were created as nothing more than a team to face the X-Men. So in order to make the team less two-dimensional and more developed, Northstar's sexual orientation was subtly introduced into the start of the new \"Alpha Flight\" series. Although Byrne had intended the character to be gay, he was restricted to implied hints of this fact, due to Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter's policy against openly homosexual characters, and by the Comics Code Authority. For example, in \"Alpha Flight\" #18, when Northstar's residence is called by Heather Hudson, a half-naked man in swim trunks who had been swimming with Northstar answers the phone, while in \"Alpha Flight\" #41, Northstar's sister Aurora says to her brother, \"Since when do you object to having attractively-dressed men about, my brother?\" Northstar's apparent lack of interest in women was implied to be due to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion, and writer Bill Mantlo's later attempt to reveal that Northstar had AIDS was squelched. In \"Alpha Flight\" #106 (1992), writer Scott Lobdell was finally given permission to have Northstar state, \"I am gay.\"\nAs the first major, openly gay character created by Marvel Comics, Northstar generated significant publicity in the mainstream press, and \"Alpha Flight\" #106 sold out in a week, although the series was not a very popular title. It is the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. The event was also controversial, and almost no mention was made of his sexual orientation for the remainder of the first \"Alpha Flight\" series, which ended with issue #130 in 1994. One exception was a subplot in which his sister Aurora\u2014experiencing a split personality\u2014accepted his homosexuality in one personality, while rejecting it in the other. After the cancellation of \"Alpha Flight,\" Northstar appeared in his own miniseries, which uses his mutancy as allegory and sexuality as subtext. Interactions between Northstar and other gay characters have been depicted, such as in a \"Marvel Swimsuit Special\", in which he is shown socializing with the gay Pantheon member Hector.\n1994\u2013present.\nAfter the 1994 cancellation of \"Alpha Flight\", Northstar starred in an eponymous four issue limited series. In 1997, a second on-going series of \"Alpha Flight\" was initiated. Northstar was not a member of this group, but appeared in later issues searching for his missing sister Aurora. He featured in eight issues before the series cancellation with issue #20.\nIn 2005, Marvel killed Northstar in three separate continuities within the space of one calendar month. Between February 16 and March 9, 2005, versions of Northstar were killed in the Earth-616-based \"Wolverine\" #25, and in \"X-Men: Age of Apocalypse\" and \"\", which were set in alternate timelines. Northstar did not stay dead long in Marvel's primary continuity, as he is resurrected in \"Wolverine\" #26.\nWhen Northstar rejoined the X-Men as a regular member in 2002, writers were less hesitant to address his sexual orientation. Northstar even experienced a crush on long-time X-Man Iceman, though it was unrequited. One of his students in the Alpha Squadron, Victor Borkowski, the gay mutant Anole, looks up to him as a role model. When Northstar rejoined the X-Men yet again in 2009, he was revealed to be in a relationship with his sports company's events manager Kyle. Their relationship faces strain from the remaining mutants' exodus to the mutant island Utopia, though the two agree to work through their issues. It was later implied that he also had a sexual relationship with Hercules at an unspecified point in time.\nNorthstar and Kyle's marriage in issue #51 of \"Astonishing X-Men\", drew attention from the right-wing group One Million Moms.\nFictional character biography.\nJean-Paul Beaubier is born to a French Canadian family in Montreal. After his parents die in an automobile accident during his childhood, he and his twin sister, Jeanne-Marie, are separated. Jean-Paul is adopted, but his adopted parents are killed after only a couple of years. Before his debut as a superhero, Beaubier competes as a professional skier (reaching elite level skier as a teenager, prior to his mutation surfacing). Once he develops his mutant abilities he becomes virtually unbeatable and eventually bores of the sport due to the lack of competition. He becomes an angry and rebellious youth. In young adulthood he joins the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (a militant separatist movement for Quebec from Canada) but soon becomes disgusted with, and renounces, the group's violent tactics. He learns of a superhero group financed by the Canadian government called \"Alpha Flight\".\nAlpha Flight.\nJean-Paul joins Alpha Flight, adopting the codename Northstar. There he is reunited with his sister Jeanne-Marie (\"Aurora\"). Northstar's comic debut occurs in \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #120, as a member of Alpha Flight fighting the X-Men to capture former teammate Wolverine. When Northstar meets his old friend Raymond Belmonde (a man who took him in and mentored him) he introduces Aurora to Belmonde, only for the twins to be attacked by local crime boss Deadly Ernest, who kills Belmonde. The twins deal with the villain, though their relationship sours when Northstar offends Aurora by asking if she had \"romanced her way to safety\". Aurora refuses to speak to him, and her lover and teammate Sasquatch assists in a power alteration, allowing her to generate light without Northstar. Her attempts to isolate him cause Northstar to quit Alpha Flight. Later, Aurora seeks him out &amp; the twins begin to reconcile, but Aurora rejects him again after discovering his FLQ history. Alpha Flight cross-examine him about his FLQ activities, but are interrupted by an emergency. When Sasquatch dies, the twins reconcile after Northstar comforts his grieving sister. However, during a confrontation with the Hulk, Aurora discovers that her power alterations cause the twins to negate one another's abilities upon touching. After the battle, Northstar rejoins Alpha Flight.\nWhile on a skiing vacation, Northstar must expose his mutant powers to save a woman's life. Accused of using his powers to cheat in competition and realizing he could never know if he subconsciously had, he relinquishes his medals and bitterly turns his back on skiing.\nThe villain Pestilence senses decay in Northstar's body and causes his sickness to grow serious to the point that his wounds no longer heal, slowly killing him. As his illness progresses, Aurora desperately uses her healing light to cure him. The Asgardian Loki fools the Beaubier twins into believing that their mother was an elf from Asgard. When Aurora is thought lost in action, Northstar travels to Asgard (seeking this heritage) but is trapped there. Loki had sent a depowered Aurora to a convent (in an attempt to appease \"Those Who Sit Above In Shadow\"). When a supernatural threat mobilizes Alpha Flight, the sorceress Talisman sends Aurora to Asgard to rescue Northstar. He shares the light with her, restoring their powers (allowing both to independently generate light).\nDuring another battle, Northstar discovers an abandoned baby girl. Doctors discover that she is dying of AIDS, after HIV infection in the womb. Jean-Paul adopts her and names her Joanne Beaubier. Alpha Flight perform various events to remind the public of AIDS and the dangers of silence about it. Her death weeks later spurs Northstar to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, hoping that, as a gay celebrity, he can increase media attention on HIV/AIDS safety and prevention. Eventually Northstar leaves Alpha Flight and writes a memoir about his experience as a mutant and gay man entitled \"Born Normal\".\nX-Men.\nIn the 2001 \"\" story arc, Northstar is briefly recruited to an improvized team of X-Men by Jean Grey to rescue Professor X, who has been captured by Magneto and is being kept prisoner in Genosha. Jean meets Northstar at a book-signing appearance, where he is mobbed. One person in the crowd turns out to be carrying a gun. Northstar foils his own assassination attempt at super-speed. Later, he meets one of the new mutants, an invulnerable young man called \"Omerta\", whose extreme homophobia leads to an actual fight between the two on X-Men's mansion driveway.\nAt Professor Xavier's request, Northstar then works with the X-Men to save the life of a mutant child who cannot stop exploding. Despite his speed, Northstar cannot save the boy, who perishes simply because of his powers. Soon afterwards, Northstar officially joins the X-Men, and becomes an instructor at the Xavier Institute, teaching business, economics, French, and superpowered flight classes. Northstar becomes a mentor to his own squad of young mutants, Alpha Squadron, and forms a close mentor relationship with student Anole. During his time at Xavier's, he forms a close friendship with Annie Ghazikhanian, a former nurse at the Xavier Institute. Annie realizes that Northstar has developed an attraction to Bobby Drake. Bobby remains oblivious, despite Northstar, who was currently sick, saving him from the misguided anger of a jealous mutant.\nWhen Hydra forms an alliance with the cults the Dawn of the White Light and the Hand, the groups start recruiting new agents from the superhero community by killing, resurrecting, and brainwashing them. The X-Man Wolverine is one of their victims, brainwashed into becoming a Hydra assassin. He eventually attacks the X-Men and kills Northstar. One of the New Mutants, Elixir, manages to heal Northstar's wounds, but is unable to revive him. A few days later a statue of Northstar is placed in a garden of statues of fallen X-Men on the campus grounds. S.H.I.E.L.D. requests that Northstar be decapitated (to prevent resurrection) but his corpse is stolen by Elektra, another brainwashed victim of Hydra. A resurrected Northstar leads an attack with Elektra on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, crippling S.H.I.E.L.D. and putting Nick Fury in critical condition. Northstar also takes the time to kill racists and homophobes all across the country, and uses his regained 'flash' ability to generate a brief blinding light. Wolverine meets Northstar, but is taken prisoner by the other Dawn of the White Light mutants, all of whom he kills except for Northstar. When Northstar refuses to tell Wolverine the location of Hydra's command center, Wolverine knocks him out and asks S.H.I.E.L.D. to psychologically \"deprogram\" him.\nNot long afterward, the mysterious Children of the Vault abduct Northstar from the S.H.I.E.L.D. holding facility, to use him to kill Sabretooth and the X-Men. They easily are able to control Northstar due to the Hand's previous mental manipulations. Under their control he finds his sister about to commit suicide and stops her so that The Children can mentally control her too. Together they attack the school under The Children's command and make quick work of several X-Men, notably Iceman and Anole, whose encounter with Northstar briefly shakes him from mind-control. Leaving Aurora to battle the X-Men, Northstar begins a search for Sabretooth but is stopped by Rogue and Cable. The X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier to try to fix their mental damage. Using their V.R. equipment the X-Men allow the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace. The process is interrupted near the end of the session by Exodus, creating a telepathic connection between the twins. Using each other's emotional support they apparently manage to face their inner turmoils. This gives both more control of their powers.\nX-Men split and reformation.\nNorthstar is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole (who is in hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to PTSD from his X-Mansion experiences). Northstar discovers Anole in a tree, the teenager not too happy to see his former mentor. Jean-Paul thinks Victor is having a problem with fitting in, as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Victor explains that his town accepts him for who he is \u2013 his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for stealing the New X-Men's innocence. Just before departing, he elbows Jean-Paul in the face \u2013 similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past \u2013 and says that the New X-Men should not look for him.\nNorthstar and his sister Aurora respond to Emma Frost's telepathic APB and fight alongside the X-Men in San Francisco against the Skrulls when they invade Earth. However, Northstar also makes a life for himself outside of superheroics, having returned to being a star at extreme snowsports, as well as starting his own brand of snow sporting equipment and becoming involved in a relationship. Wolverine approaches Jean-Paul to rejoin the X-Men as its speedster. After confirming that he would not be a token gay member, he accepts. While training Surge in super-speed, Northstar stops to give an interview, where he learns of Simon Trask's Proposition X (a Mutant Breeding Act Ballot Initiative). He runs back to the X-Men and threatens to quit and go back to Canada. However, he remains with the X-Men throughout several missions, including confrontations with Norman Osborn's Dark X-Men and a rescue mission to retrieve Illyana Rasputin after she is banished to Limbo during the events of \"\".\nA temporal copy of Northstar\u2014from shortly before the apparent death of Guardian at the hands of Jerry Jaxon\u2014was introduced near the end of the third \"Alpha Flight\" series, along with an entire team of early Alpha Flight members. This Northstar is last seen with a similarly time-displaced Aurora, still operating in the Earth-616 present.\nDuring the \"Chaos War\" storyline, Northstar alongside Aurora, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood, and they reform Alpha Flight.\nPowers and abilities.\nNorthstar is a mutant who can move and fly at superhuman speed with the potential of reaching near light speeds. He also possesses superhuman stamina, endurance (both essential to maintain super-speed for any length of time), and reflexes. He can channel a portion of the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in his body's molecules in a single direction, accelerating his body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy he has tapped. Northstar also has an advanced equilibrium, and exceptional agility, reaction time, and coordination which allows for him to make sharp turns, and run at such speeds without becoming sick. Northstar is also able to punch at great speeds, which grants him the ability to hurt even the Hulk. In an early issue of Alpha Flight Northstar reveals to readers that his sister Aurora has greater endurance and can fly longer, whereas he can fly faster in the same amount of time. Northstar can create cyclones by running in circles, can run up walls and across water, and can breathe while traveling at supersonic speeds. However, if Northstar wanted to travel with someone else at superhuman speeds, they would need a breathing apparatus to keep from asphyxiating.\nAs a side effect of partially robbing his molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules have increased, which enhances the sheer toughness of Northstar's entire body. This effect gives his skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury, but the upper limit of this ability has not been measured. It had once been theorized that Northstar could fly at 99% of the speed of light: , although this has never been attempted because he would do irreparable damage to the environment. While Northstar can withstand Mach 10 speeds, traveling any faster would carry complications with breathing and damage caused by wind and air resistance to his body. When Aurora, his sister, and Northstar are in contact with each other, usually by holding hands, they can also vary the rate of acceleration of his molecules to release a cascade of photons creating a momentary burst of light equal to one million candela which they use to blind their opponents. The only other minor drawback to this ability, other than he and his sister having to be in contact with each other to utilize this gift, is that they are unable to adjust the brilliance of the flash. After being captured by the Children of the Vault in the Supernovas arc of Mike Carey's \"X-Men\", his and Aurora's powers have been enhanced to the point where they can now move at light speed without harm and can generate explosive thermal energy in addition to light.\nNorthstar is a world-class professional skier, skilled trapeze artist, business man, and an accomplished novelist. A native French speaker, he is also fluent in English. He is a good hand-to-hand combatant using a style utilizing his superhuman speed, and received coaching from his teammate Puck. After his resurrection by the Hand, Northstar has been trained in the martial arts. Northstar also has peak human strength, but has superhuman strength in his legs.\nNorthstar wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric made of special materials for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nStacie Rook of \"Screen Rant\" said, \"Northstar married his husband in the comics in 2012, in what was the first depiction of a same-sex wedding in Marvel Comics. His position as the first openly gay Marvel character is important for the history of representation, and an on-screen portrayal of him would be a great way to honor that milestone.\"\nVolumes.\nThe issue of \"Alpha Flight\" in which Northstar came out was hugely popular. \"New York\" magazine reported that a store on Bleecker Street in New York City resorted to making customers who wanted to buy a copy of it to purchase a second comic as well. Later, they changed the policy to require that everyone who bought a copy had to buy an issue of the series \"The Punisher War Zone\" as well. The store claimed they did this to prevent hoarding of the comic. The policy was in effect for thirty minutes until the store was all sold out. In the end, they have received only one complaint.\nOther versions.\nAge of Apocalypse.\nIn the Age of Apocalypse, Northstar and Aurora are part of Mr. Sinister's Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, are assigned to patrolling the breeding pens. The siblings are rather snotty about their superior status as mutants and seem to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who act up or try to escape. When the E.M.F.'s leader, Cyclops, switches sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he is caught in the act by the speeding twins. However, both of them are defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happens to be Polaris. When the series was revisited for the 10 year anniversary, both Northstar and Aurora are later killed by Weapon X (Wolverine) and Kirika (X-23 in the main Marvel Universe).\nMarvel Zombies.\nIn the Marvel Zombies comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified Alpha Flight attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by Magneto. Northstar is seen in a panel of \"\" attacking the X-Man Storm alongside his sister Aurora. The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.\nUltimate Marvel.\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, his features are similar to his original counterpart, although his ears are no longer pointed. He can also move at super-speed, though he has yet to demonstrate the ability to fly, or any abilities related to light emission.\nA student at New York City's Stuyvesant High School, Northstar is kicked off the school's track team for suspected illegal steroid use. In fact, his unnatural levels of speed are actually due to his mutation. When the X-Men reveal to him he is a mutant and ask him to join them, he turns them down, saying that separating themselves from humans is segregation and noting how a student there (Beast) had been recently killed.\nSoon after, Mister Sinister, a deranged man who is apparently under orders of Apocalypse to kill ten mutants, shoots Northstar. Thanks to his quick reflexes, Northstar manages to survive the attack but is left in a coma. After being hospitalized, he is awakened from his coma by the X-Man Jean Grey. Upon being told that Colossus had watched over him all night to protect him from any further attacks, Northstar asks if Colossus is single, startling Colossus so much that his body involuntarily turns to steel.\nNorthstar is later recruited by Emma Frost to join the Academy of Tomorrow, a magnet school for gifted children both mutant and human with a more pacifistic and integrationist philosophy than the X-Men. Along with fellow students Lorna Dane and Alex Summers, he completes Frost's Advanced Leadership Workshop, allowing him to make use of his powers performing off-campus community service missions in conjunction with local authorities. When Lorna is framed for murder and imprisoned in the Triskelion (the headquarters of the Ultimates), in an elaborate scheme by Magneto to help him escape the prison, Northstar is part of the group of Frost's students who try to break her out. During a battle with the Ultimates and the X-Men, he shows that he has improved his abilities enough to move faster than the human eye (allowing him to attack without being seen), run across water (though a direct hit from a super-powered person could cause him to sink), and resist gravity (he is able to run up the side of a tall building).\nDuring the battle he shows romantic interest in Colossus, and a week later it is revealed that the two have kept in contact, having exchanged email addresses. Colossus is shown on the phone talking to Northstar, who asks Colossus to be his date to his school's homecoming dance (which he accepts). But the dance is interrupted by the Brotherhood. After the supposed death of Charles Xavier, Colossus agrees to temporarily live with Northstar at his school.\nDuring a softball game between the Academy of Tomorrow and the Xavier School, Ultimate Alpha Flight shows up to kidnap Northstar. Aurora makes her debut, revealing herself to be Northstar's sister. She physically takes him against his will. Later, Colossus, Cyclops, Rogue, Angel, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler break into Alpha Flight's base to rescue him. After they incapacitate Alpha Flight, Colossus finds Northstar overdosing on the mutant drug, Banshee, resulting in him being crippled from the waist down.\n\"X-Men: The End\".\nIn the alternate future of \"\", Northstar is one of many members of the staff of the Xavier Institute. He briefly survives the destruction of it and several surrounding miles, only to die in Scott Summers' arms. As he dies, he sees a vision of his Alpha Flight friends, leading is his sister, who encourages him to leave his body.\nHouse of M.\nIn the alternate reality created by the Scarlet Witch known as House of M, Northstar is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency's junior training squad program. Much like the rest of the super-powered community in House of M, Northstar supported this reality's Magneto and his mutant-supremacy platform.\nAge of X.\nIn the alternate timeline seen in the \"Age of X\" storyline, Jean-Paul was on the first team of Fortress X defenders to attack Kitty Pryde when she breached the barriers, while Jean-Paul wants revenge for his sister's murder.\nWhat If?\nIn \"What If Scott Summers and Jean Gray Got Married Sooner?\", their leaving inspired the rest of the original X-Men to leave the X-Men as well and seek lives in the outside world. Professor X recruited Northstar as part of a new team, along with Aurora, Storm, Colossus and Catseye. This new team died fighting the living island Krakoa. Sunfire and the Avengers defeated it, and found their bodies.\nIn \"What If Wolverine was Leader of Alpha Flight?\", Northstar was responsible for Wolverine staying in Canada after his capture by government forces. This story diverged from the story in X-Men 120\u2013121, where Alpha Flight was assigned to capture Wolverine and return him to the service of Canada. As in the mainstream reality, the X-Men (Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Storm, Colossus, Banshee and their associate Colleen Wing) flew off, but here, Wolverine did not escape custody and slip aboard the plane. They circled back to attempt a rescue. The Canadian government tried to call Alpha Flight to handle things before they were forced into military intervention, but Northstar was on monitor duty and refused to take the call (presumably in anger that Cyclops had just beaten him in combat before Wolverine surrendered). Left with no other alternative, the Canadian military shot the X-Men down. None of them survived the crash. James McDonald Hudson learned what Northstar did and concealed it from Wolverine. Left without his new family, Wolverine chose to return to his first one: Alpha Flight. He led the team well, but Northstar was constantly nervous around Wolverine, fearing his wrath if he ever learned the truth. Wolverine did in fact learn- the team battled the Hellfire Club, and Jean Gray as Dark Phoenix revealed the truth. She wanted Wolverine to kill Northstar, but he killed her instead to free her. He forgave Northstar's role in the deaths of his friends and stayed on as leader of Alpha Flight. Northstar became a mainstay of the team once the threat of disembowelment no longer hung over him.\nIn other media.\nTelevision.\nNorthstar appears in \", voiced by Rene Lemieux. This version is initially a prisoner of Genosha before being freed by the X-Men and joining Alpha Flight.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
