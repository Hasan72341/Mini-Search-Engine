A member of the Drew and Barrymore theatrical families, he initially tried to avoid the stage and briefly attempted a career as an artist, but appeared on stage together with his father, Maurice, in 1900, and then his sister Ethel the following year. He began his career in 1903 and first gained attention as a stage actor in light comedy, then high drama, culminating in productions of \"Justice\" (1916), \"Richard III\" (1920), and \"Hamlet\" (1922); his portrayal of Hamlet led to him being called the \"greatest living American tragedian\".\nAfter a success as \"Hamlet\" in London in 1925, Barrymore left the stage for 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well received in such pictures as \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1920), \"Sherlock Holmes\" (1922) and \"The Sea Beast\" (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and four of his works, \"Grand Hotel\" (1932), \"Dinner at Eight\" (1933), \"Twentieth Century\" (1934), and \"Midnight\" (1939), have been inducted into the National Film Registry.\nBarrymore's personal life has been the subject of much attention before and since his death. He struggled with alcohol abuse from the age of 14, was married and divorced four times, and declared bankruptcy later in life. Much of his later work involved self-parody and the portrayal of drunken has-beens. His obituary in \"The Washington Post\" observed that \"with the passing of the years\u00a0\u2013 and as his private life became more public\u00a0\u2013 he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character.\" Although film historians have opined that Barrymore's \"contribution to the art of cinematic acting began to fade\" after the mid-1930s, Barrymore's biographer, Martin Norden, considers him to be \"perhaps the most influential and idolized actor of his day\".\nBiography.\nEarly life: 1882\u20131903.\nBarrymore was born John Sidney Blyth in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandmother Louisa Lane Drew and was known by family, friends and colleagues as \"Jack\". Although the Barrymore family Bible puts his date of birth as February 15, 1882, his birth certificate shows February 14. He was the youngest of three children. His siblings were Lionel (1878\u20131954), and Ethel (1879\u20131959). His father was Maurice Barrymore, an Indian-born British actor who had been born Herbert Blyth, and had adopted \"Barrymore\" as a stage name after seeing it on a poster in the Haymarket Theatre in London. Barrymore's mother, Georgie Drew Barrymore, was born into a prominent theatrical family. His maternal grandparents were Louisa Lane Drew, a well-known 19th-century American actress and the manager of the Arch Street Theatre, and John Drew, also an actor whose specialty was comedy. Barrymore's maternal uncles were two more thespians, John Drew Jr. and Sidney.\nMuch of Barrymore's early life was unsettled. In October 1882, the family toured in the US for a season with Polish actress Helena Modjeska. The following year his parents toured again with Modjeska but left the children behind. Modjeska was influential in the family, and she insisted that all three children be baptized into the Catholic Church. In 1884 the family traveled to London as part of Augustin Daly's theatrical company, returning to the US two years later. As a child, Barrymore was sometimes badly behaved, and he was sent away to schools in an attempt to instill discipline. The strategy was not always successful, and he attended elementary schools in four states. He was sent first to the boys' annex of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One punishment that he received there was being made to read a copy of Dante's \"Inferno\"; he later recounted that, as he looked at the illustrations by Gustave Dor\u00e9, \"my interest was aroused, and a new urge was born within me. I wanted to be an artist\". He was expelled from the school in 1891 and was sent to Seton Hall Preparatory School in New Jersey, where Lionel was already studying. Barrymore was unhappy at Seton and was soon withdrawn, after which he attended several public schools in New York, including the Mount Pleasant Military Academy.\nIn 1892, his grandmother Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she lost control of her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by his grandmother. The loss of their mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors' club.\nIn 1895, Barrymore entered Georgetown Preparatory School, then located on Georgetown University Campus, but he was expelled in November 1897, probably after being caught waiting in a brothel. One of his biographers, Michael A. Morrison, posits the alternate theory that Barrymore was expelled after the staff saw him inebriated. By the time he left Georgetown he was, according to Martin Norden in his biography of Barrymore, \"already in the early stages of a chronic drinking problem\". 1897 was an emotionally challenging year for Barrymore: he lost his virginity when he was seduced by his step-mother, Mamie Floyd, and in August his grandmother, the main female role model in his life, died.\nBarrymore traveled with his father to England in 1898, where he joined King's College School, Wimbledon. A year later he joined the Slade School of Fine Art, to study literature and art. After a year of formal study, he left and \"devoted much of his subsequent stay in London to bohemianism and nocturnal adventures\", according to family biographer Margot Peters. Barrymore returned to New York in the summer of 1900, and by November he found work as an illustrator on \"The New York Evening Journal\", at a salary of $50 a week.\nBarrymore had always professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded by his father to join him on stage for a few performances of a short play, \"A Man of the World\" which his father had produced in Fort Lee, New Jersey near his home in town. He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, rather than as a possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in \"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines\" when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped in the middle of his dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, \"I've blown up. Where do we go from here?\", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.\nAn incident in 1901 had a major impact on Barrymore. In March, his father had a mental breakdown as a result of tertiary syphilis, and Barrymore, after a discussion with Ethel and gaining a court petition, took him to Bellevue Hospital. Maurice was later transferred to a private institution in Amityville, Long Island, where he suffered a \"rapid descent into madness\". The \"Encyclopedia of World Biography\" states that Barrymore was constantly \"haunted by the bright and dark spell of his father\", and his close friend Gene Fowler reported that \"the bleak overtone of this breaking of his parents' reason never quite died away in Barrymore's mind, and he was haunted by fears he would suffer the same fate\". Barrymore became fascinated with the beautiful artists' model, \"\"Florodora\" girl\" and aspiring actress named Evelyn Nesbit, who was a mistress of the prominent New York architect Stanford White and was 16 or 17 years old at the time. The two had a romantic affair in 1902, and Barrymore proposed marriage to her. Nesbit's mother did not think that, as a struggling artist who seemed irresponsible with money, Barrymore was a good match for her daughter. To break off their relationship her mother and White sent Nesbit away to school in New Jersey in November 1902. Barrymore later described Nesbit as \"the most maddening woman\", saying \"She was the first woman I ever loved.\" A few years later in 1906, White was shot and killed public by Nesbit's then-husband, the mentally unstable Pittsburgh millionaire heir Harry K. Thaw, who she had married in 1905. Nesbit later testified that White had drugged and raped her when she was 15 or 16 (shortly before she met Barrymore) and that she had told Thaw about it, leading Thaw to become obsessed with White and enraged about his acceptance in society. The trial of Thaw for murder was the focus of extreme press interest and was one of the first to be dubbed the \"Trial of the Century\". It was speculated that Barrymore could be called to testify at the trial due to his prior relationship with Nesbit. Thaw was eventually found not guilty by reason of insanity.\nIn May 1902, Barrymore was fired from his newspaper position after producing a poor illustration for the paper while hung over. He spent time as a poster designer but realized it was not lucrative enough for his lifestyle, which was being partly financed by Ethel, who was also paying for their father's care. While discussing his future with his brother, Barrymore said \"it looks as though I'll have to succumb to the family curse, acting\", and he later admitted that \"there isn't any romance about how I went on stage.\u00a0... I needed the money.\"\nEarly stage career: 1903\u20131913.\nBarrymore began to contact his family's theatrical connections to find work and approached Charles Frohman, who had been the producer of \"Captain Jinks\" and had also been an employer of Barrymore's mother Georgie a decade earlier. Frohman thought that Barrymore had comedic potential but needed more experience before making a Broadway debut. Barrymore joined the company of McKee Rankin, Sidney Drew's father-in-law, on the Chicago leg of their tour, at the W. S. Cleveland Theatre in October 1903. He first played the minor role of Lt. Max von Wendlowski in \"Magda\", and in November when the troupe produced \"Leah the Forsaken\", he took the small part of Max, a village idiot with one spoken line.\nA year later Barrymore appeared in his first Broadway production, in a small role in the comedy \"Glad of It\", which only had a short run. Afterwards he played the role of Charles Hyne in the farce \"The Dictator\" at the Criterion Theatre, which starred William Collier. During the play's run and subsequent tour across the US, Collier became a mentor to the young actor, although his patience was continually tested by Barrymore's drinking, which led to occasional missed performances, drunken stage appearances, and general misbehavior. Collier taught Barrymore much about acting, including coaching him in comic timing, but \"at times regretted his sponsorship\" of his apprentice. In March 1905, while \"The Dictator\" was playing in Buffalo, Barrymore's father died in Amityville and was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Philadelphia. At the close of the US tour, \"The Dictator\" visited Britain from April 1905, where it played at the Comedy Theatre. The critic for \"The Observer\" wrote that Barrymore \"admirably seconded\" Collier.\nWhen he returned to America, Barrymore appeared at the Criterion Theatre in a double bill of works by J. M. Barrie; he played a clown in \"Pantaloon\" opposite his brother, and Stephen Rollo in \"Alice Sit-by-the-Fire\" opposite his sister. Both plays ran for 81 performances from December 1905, and then went on tour. Barrymore continued drinking and lacked discipline, which affected his performances. Ethel was angry with her brother and had the producers fire him from the show, but re-hire him the following day, to teach him a lesson. After a tour of the US and Australia with Collier in \"On the Quiet\" and \"The Dictator\", Barrymore joined his sister in the 1907 comedy \"His Excellency the Governor\" at the Empire Theatre. He received mixed reviews for his performances, and \"The Wichita Daily Eagle\" commented that \"Barrymore seems to imitate John Drew too much ever to be a good actor. Why doesn't young Barrymore imitate a real actor if he must copy someone.\"\nBarrymore gained his first leading role in early 1907, in the comedy \"The Boys of Company B\" at the Lyceum Theatre. Although he was well received by the critics\u00a0\u2013 \"The Washington Post\" noted that \"his work has been pronounced astonishingly clever by the critics wherever he played\"\u00a0\u2013 at times he continued his unprofessional stage behavior, which led to a rebuke from John Drew, who attended a performance. After a short run in \"Toddles\" at the Garrick Theatre, Barrymore was given the lead role of Mac in \"A Stubborn Cinderella\", both on tour and at the Broadway Theatre in Boston. He had previously been earning $50 a week during his sporadic employment but now enjoyed a wage increase to $175. He briefly appeared in \"The Candy Shop\" in mid-1909, before he played the lead role in Winchell Smith's play \"The Fortune Hunter\" at the Gaiety Theatre in September the same year. It was his longest-held role, running for 345 performances until May 1911, initially at the Gaiety Theatre in New York, and then on tour. The critic for \"The New York Times\" thought the play was, \"acted with fine comedy spirit by John Barrymore\u00a0... [who] gave indisputable signs last night of grown and growing powers.\"\nIn mid-1910 Barrymore met socialite Katherine Corri Harris, and the couple married in September that year. Harris' father objected to the relationship and refused to attend the wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, \"The Dictator\" went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore \"began to think of his marriage as a 'bus accident'\". Film critic Hollis Alpert wrote that, within a week of the wedding, Katherine was complaining that she saw her new husband too infrequently. Barrymore's increasing dependence on alcohol was also a cause of marital problems, and he explained that \"unhappiness increased the drink, and drink increased the unhappiness\".\nBarrymore's next two plays\u00a0\u2013 \"Uncle Sam\" and \"Princess Zim-Zim\", both from 1911\u00a0\u2013 were critically and commercially weak, but the second work introduced him to playwright Edward Sheldon, who would \"reshape\u00a0... [Barrymore's] entire career\". In January 1912, Barrymore appeared together with his sister in \"A Slice of Life\" at the Empire Theatre on Broadway, which ran for 48 performances. Charles Darnton, a critic for \"The Evening World\", observed that \"Barrymore takes delight in 'kidding' his part not only to the limit, but perhaps beyond\". A review in \"The Washington Times\" stated that \"Barrymore inimitably imitates his uncle John Drew\".\nBarrymore may have appeared in his first films in 1912. In four short films, a cast member is listed as \"Jack Barrymore\"; this is probably John Barrymore, although Norden notes that \"we may never know for certain if [these] are in fact Barrymore movies.\" The four films were \"Dream of a Motion Picture Director\", \"The Widow Casey's Return\", \"A Prize Package\" (all 1912) and \"One on Romance\" (1913). The films were produced by the Philadelphia-based Lubin Manufacturing Company and were lost in an explosion and fire at the Lubin vaults in 1914.\nIn July 1912, Barrymore went to Los Angeles, where he appeared in three short-running plays at the Belasco Theatre. He returned to New York in October, where he took the lead role in 72 performances of the comedy \"The Affairs of Anatol\" at the Little Theatre. Although the critical response was lukewarm, Barrymore's salary for the play was $600 a week. He began the following year by appearing in a short run of \"A Thief for a Night\" in McVicker's Theatre, Chicago, before returning to New York, and the Thirty-Ninth St. Theatre, for a two-month run in \"Believe Me, Xantippe\".\nEntry into motion pictures, and theatrical triumphs: 1913\u20131924.\nIn late 1913, Barrymore made his first confirmed feature film, the romantic comedy \"An American Citizen\", with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company. When the film was released in January 1914, Barrymore \"delighted movie audiences with an inimitable light touch that made a conventional romance 'joyous',\" writes Peters. A reviewer for \"The Oregon Daily Journal\" thought that Barrymore gave a \"portrayal of unusual quality\". The success of the picture led to further film work, including \"The Man from Mexico\" (1914), \"Are You a Mason?\", \"The Dictator\" and \"The Incorrigible Dukane\" (all 1915). Except for \"The Incorrigible Dukane\", all of these early films are presumed lost.\nDespite the film work and the higher fees he earned from it, Barrymore continued to seek stage work, and in January 1914 he played the lead in \"The Yellow Ticket\" at New York's Eltinge Theatre. The role marked a departure from the light comedy of his previous performances, a result of Sheldon urging him to turn towards more dramatic parts. \"The Yellow Ticket\" was not the breakthrough that Barrymore wanted. A few months before the outbreak of World War I, he took a vacation to Italy with Sheldon to enjoy a temporary break from his worsening marriage. He returned from Italy and accepted another serious stage role, that of an ex-convict in \"Kick In\", at New York's Longacre Theatre. The play was a success, and Barrymore received praise from the critics; \"The New York Times\" reviewer thought that in a play that had \"uncommonly able and sincere playing\", Barrymore acted his role with \"intelligence and vigor and impart[ed] to it a deal of charm\".\nBarrymore spent the second half of 1915 making three films, including \"The Red Widow\", which he called \"the worst film I ever made\" in his 1926 autobiography. In April 1916, he starred in John Galsworthy's prison drama \"Justice\", again at the instigation of Sheldon. The play was a critical success, and \"The New York Times\" thought the audience saw \"Barrymore play as he had never played before, and so, by his work as the wretched prisoner in \"Justice\", step forward into a new position on the American stage.\" The critic went on to say that Barrymore gave \"an extraordinary performance in every detail of appearance and manner, in every note of deep feeling\u00a0... a superb performance.\"\nFrom early 1916, Barrymore had been living apart from Katherine, and she sued for divorce in November 1916. By the time the divorce was finalized in December 1917, he had taken the lead role in the film \"Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman\". He had also tried to enlist in the U.S. Army following the country's entry into World War\u00a0I, but Army doctors discovered that he had varicose veins, and he was not accepted for military service. For over a year beginning in April 1917, he appeared together with Lionel in a stage version of George du Maurier's 1891 novel \"Peter Ibbetson\". The play and the two Barrymores were warmly regarded by the critics. Around this time, Barrymore began a relationship with a married mother of two, Blanche Oelrichs, a suffragist from an elite Rhode Island family with what Peters calls \"anarchistic self-confidence\". Oelrichs also published poetry under the name Michael Strange. While their relationship began in secret, it became more open after Oelrichs' husband was commissioned into the army and then posted to France.\nBoth Oelrichs and Sheldon urged Barrymore to take on his next role, Fedya Vasilyevich Protasov, in Leo Tolstoy's play \"Redemption\" at the Plymouth Theatre. The critic for \"The New York Times\" felt that, although Barrymore's performance was \"marred by vocal monotony\", overall the performance was \"a distinct step forward in Mr. Barrymore's artistic development\u00a0... There is probably not another actor on our stage who has a temperament so fine and spiritual, an art so flexible and sure.\" In 1918, Barrymore starred in the romantic comedy film \"On the Quiet\"; the \"Iowa City Press-Citizen\" considered the film superior to the original Broadway performance.\nIn 1919, Barrymore portrayed a struggling lawyer in the film adaptation of the Broadway show \"Here Comes the Bride\", which he followed with \"The Test of Honor\". The latter film marked his first straight dramatic role on screen after years of performing in comedy dramas. Later that year, when Barrymore again appeared on stage with Lionel in Sem Benelli's historical drama \"The Jest\", audience members \"agree[d] that the American stage had never witnessed finer acting\", according to Peters. Alexander Woollcott, writing in \"The New York Times\", thought that \"John and Lionel Barrymore hold spellbound each breathless audience\", and he commented that Barrymore \"contributes to that appeal by every step, every hand, every posture of a body grown unexpectedly eloquent in recent years\". \nIn November, Barrymore began filming \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", playing the dual leading role, and the film was released in theaters the following year. \"Wid's Daily\" thought that \"it is the star's picture from the very outset, and it is the star that makes it\", going on to say that Barrymore's portrayal was \"a thing of fine shadows and violent emotions\". \"The Washington Post\" was in agreement, and considered the performance to be \"a masterpiece\", and \"a remarkable piece of work\". The film was so successful that the US Navy used stills of Barrymore in its recruiting posters.\nAfter planning for over a year\u00a0\u2013 largely in secret\u00a0\u2013 Barrymore played his first Shakespeare part, the title role in \"Richard III\". Conscious of the criticism of his vocal range, he underwent training with Margaret Carrington, the voice and diction trainer, to ensure he sounded right for the part, and the pair worked together daily for up to six hours a day for six weeks. After the debut in March 1920, the critics were effusive in their praise. The \"Washington Herald\" observed that the audience were \"held by the sheer power of Barrymore's performance\", which was \"remarkable for\u00a0... [the actor's] unexpected vocal richness\", while Woollcott, in \"The New York Times\", thought the performance \"marked a measurable advance in the gradual process of bringing [Barrymore's] technical fluency abreast with his winged imagination and his real genius for the theatre\".\nAlthough a commercial and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in \"Redemption\" he had worked ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, and by the time he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for \"Clair de Lune\", which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel \"The Man Who Laughs\". Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen\u00a0\u2013 it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together in over a decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.\nIn 1921, Barrymore portrayed a wealthy Frenchman in New York in the film \"The Lotus Eater\", with Colleen Moore. In September, Barrymore and Oelrichs went to Europe on holiday; cracks were appearing in their relationship, and she fell in love with a poet during their extended stay in Venice. In October, Oelrichs returned to New York and Barrymore traveled to London to film the exterior scenes for his latest movie, \"Sherlock Holmes\", in which he played the title role. He then returned to New York to work on the film's interior scenes in January 1922. Barrymore became involved in the pre-production work for the film and provided designs for Moriarty's lair. The film was released later that year and was generally thought \"a little dull and ponderous, with too many intertitles\", although James W. Dean of \"The Evening News\" of Harrisburg opined that \"the personality of Barrymore is the film's transcendent quality\".\nBarrymore decided next to star in \"Hamlet\" on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They spent six months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as \"a man's man\", according to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a \"normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a mess that was too thick for him\u00a0... he was a great fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?\" Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16, 1922. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the \"New York Herald\", opined that it was \"an evening that will be memorable in the history of the American theater\". while John Corbin, the drama critic for \"The New York Times\", agreed, writing that \"in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet\". The reviewer for \"Brooklyn Life\" stated that Barrymore had \"doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian\". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as \"not so much princely\u00a0\u2013 he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous\".\nBarrymore and Hopkins decided to end the run at 101 performances, just breaking the record of one hundred by Edwin Booth, before the play closed in February 1923. In November and December that year, a three-week run of the play was staged at the Manhattan Opera House, followed by a brief tour that closed at the end of January 1924.\nFilms with the major studios: 1924\u20131932.\nNews of Barrymore's success in \"Hamlet\" piqued the interest of Warner Bros., which signed him as the lead in the 1924 film \"Beau Brummel\". Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore\u00a0\u2013 aged 40 at the time\u00a0\u2013 sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname \"the Great Profile\", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: \"The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that are to be found in almost any normal anthropological specimen, and those are the apples I try to keep on top of the barrel.\"\nIn February 1925, Barrymore staged \"Hamlet\" in London at the Haymarket Theatre, which the \"Manchester Guardian\" later said had \"the most memorable first night for years\". The reviews were positive, and \"although none of the London critics found Barrymore superior to [Henry] Irving and [Johnston] Forbes-Robertson, many were favorable in their comparisons\". Among the audience members was the 20-year-old actor John Gielgud, who wrote in his program \"Barrymore is romantic in appearance and naturally gifted with grace, looks and a capacity to wear period clothes, which makes his brilliantly intellectual performance classical without being unduly severe, and he has tenderness, remoteness, and neurosis all placed with great delicacy and used with immense effectiveness and admirable judgment\". Looking back in the 1970s, he said: \"The handsome middle-aged stars of the Edwardian theatre romanticised the part. Even John Barrymore, whose Hamlet I admired very much, cut the play outrageously so that he could, for instance, play the closet scene all out for sentiment with the emphasis on the 'Oedipus complex'\u00a0\u2013 sobbing on Gertrude's bosom. Yet Barrymore\u00a0... had a wonderful edge and a demonic sense of humour.\"\nAt the end of this run of \"Hamlet\", Barrymore traveled to Paris, where Oelrichs had stayed during his residence in London, but the reunion was not a happy one and the couple argued frequently. When he returned to America, she remained in Paris, and the couple drew up a separation agreement that provided Oelrichs with $18,000 a year and stated that neither could sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery. While he had been in London, Warner Bros and Barrymore entered into a contact for three further films at a salary of $76,250 per picture. He later claimed that his motivation for moving from stage to films was the \"lack of repetition\u2014the continual playing of a part, which is so ruinous to an actor, is entirely eliminated\".\nBarrymore's first film under the contract was \"The Sea Beast\" (1926), loosely based on the 1851 novel \"Moby-Dick\", in which he played Captain Ahab Ceeley. This was one of the biggest money-makers of the year for Warner Bros. Although Barrymore wanted Astor to play the female lead, she was unavailable, and Dolores Costello was cast in her place. He later said that \"I fell in love with her instantly. This time I knew I was right\", and the couple began an affair. Costello's father was angered by the relationship, but his complaints were ignored by both Costello and her mother: Costello's parents separated and were divorced as a result. The film was well received by critics, and Mordaunt Hall, the film critic of \"The New York Times\", praised the \"energy, earnestness and virility\" Barrymore displayed in the role of Ceeley.\nAs filming finished on \"The Sea Beast\", work began on \"Don Juan\", the first feature-length film with synchronized Vitaphone sound effects and a musical soundtrack. Although Barrymore wanted to play opposite Costello again, Jack L. Warner, the film's producer, signed Astor. After completing his Warner Bros. contract with \"When a Man Loves\", with Costello, Barrymore joined United Artists (UA) under a three-film deal. For the next three years, according to Morrison, he \"enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and spent lavishly\". Nevertheless, he received some harsh reviews. Critic and essayist Stark Young wrote in \"The New Republic\" that Barrymore's films were \"rotten, vulgar, empty, in bad taste, dishonest, noisome with a silly and unwholesome exhibitionism, and odious with a kind of stale and degenerate studio adolescence. Their appeal is cheap, cynical and specious\".\nIn 1927, Barrymore planned to revive \"Hamlet\" at the Hollywood Bowl, but in August he canceled the production, without explanation, and began filming the third of the UA pictures, \"Eternal Love\", for which he was paid $150,000. In February 1928, Barrymore obtained a quiet divorce from Oelrichs; she eagerly agreed to the separation, as she was in a relationship with a lawyer, Harrison Tweed, whom she later married. Barrymore and Costello married in November that year; their daughter, Dolores, was born in April 1930 and a son, John Drew Barrymore, followed in June 1932. Barrymore purchased and converted an estate in the Hollywood Hills into 16 different buildings with 55 rooms, gardens, skeet ranges, swimming pools, fountains and a totem pole.\nBy the late 1920s, sound films had become common, following the 1927 sensation, \"The Jazz Singer\". Actors with trained voices were in demand by the studios, and Barrymore was offered a five-film deal with Warner Bros. at $150,000 per picture, and a share of the profits. Before he began this contract, he played his first speaking role on film: a one-off section in \"The Show of Shows\" (1929), playing Richard, Duke of Gloucester in \"Henry VI, Part 3\". His first two films under contract were \"General Crack\" and \"The Man from Blankley's\", each of which were modestly successful. As he had been frustrated at the inability of making \"The Sea Beast\" as a sound film, Barrymore returned to \"Moby Dick\" as the source for a 1930 film of the same name. Peters thinks little of the film, describing it as \"a seesaw between the cosmic and the comic, a travesty of Melville as well as a silly film all on its own\".\nThe following year, Barrymore played the title role of a manipulative voice coach in \"Svengali\", opposite Marian Marsh. Martin Dickstein, the critic for the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\", wrote that Barrymore \"registers a personal triumph in the role\", calling his performance \"brilliant\u00a0... one of the best of his movie career\". Later in 1931, he played a crippled puppeteer, who tries to fulfill his frustrated ambitions by manipulating the life of a young male ballet dancer and the dancer's lover (also Marsh) in \"The Mad Genius\"; the film was a commercial failure. With disappointing box office returns from their five-film deal, Warner Bros. decided not to offer Barrymore a contract renewal. Instead, Barrymore signed a non-exclusive contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and took a $25,000 salary cut per film.\nYears of transition: 1932\u20131936.\nBarrymore's first film for MGM was the 1932 mystery \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\", in which he co-starred with his brother Lionel. In \"The New York Times\", Hall called Barrymore's performance \"admirable\" and wrote that \"it is a pleasure to see [him] again in something in a lighter vein.\" The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film \"Grand Hotel\", in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming \"more like\u00a0... [Garbo's] affectionate father than her lover\", while George Blaisdell of \"International Photographer\" praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be \"deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking.\" \"Grand Hotel\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.\nIn 1932, Barrymore went to RKO Pictures where he played a borderline-alcoholic lawyer in \"State's Attorney\", and an escaped lunatic in \"A Bill of Divorcement\", opposite Katharine Hepburn in her screen debut. Film scholar Daniel Bernardi later noted the humanism demonstrated between Barrymore's character and his family, particularly the \"close bond\" between father and daughter. In his final film of the year, he returned to MGM for \"Rasputin and the Empress\", Barrymore, Ethel and Lionel co-starred. Physically, Barrymore had deteriorated since filming \"Svengali\", and he had gained weight because of his drinking. Peters notes the \"dissipation of the once ascetic face, a dissipation only underlined by the studio's attempt to reconstruct with lights, filters and make-up a spiritual beauty that had been corrupted.\" The film was a critical and commercial failure, and MGM lost significant amounts of money. \"The New Yorker\" thought the three Barrymores had produced their worst work.\nThe year 1933 was a busy one for Barrymore, and his decline began to be evident. He appeared in five films during the year, including as a meek schoolteacher-turned-businessman in \"Topaze\", opposite Myrna Loy, and \"Dinner at Eight\", with Lionel. Peters opines that Barrymore's portrayal of a washed-up alcoholic actor \"could well have fixed\u00a0... in the public's and MGM's mind that John Barrymore was a drunken has-been.\" After the run of films with MGM, the company ended its contact with Barrymore amid its financial woes caused by the Great Depression. He then signed with Universal Studios to portray a troubled Jewish lawyer in \"Counsellor at Law\". During filming he struggled to remember his lines for even small scenes. Filming was stopped on one occasion after more than 25 takes when he struggled to recall the right lines; it was a problem with which he began to suffer regularly. Despite the problems, Norden believes that this was \"one of his best film performances\".\nIn December 1933, Barrymore agreed with RKO to film \"Hamlet\". He underwent screen tests and hired Carrington to act as vocal coach again, but during one session, his memory failed him again, and the project was eventually scrapped. Barrymore starred in two films released in 1934, the drama \"Long Lost Father\" and the screwball comedy \"Twentieth Century\". In the latter film, Barrymore played madcap Broadway impresario Oscar Jaffe, a role in which he demonstrated a \"rare genius as a comedian\". Morrison writes that the portrayal was one \"that many consider to be his finest contribution to film\". In 2011, the picture was added to the National Film Registry, where it was described as Barrymore's \"last great film role\".\nIn May 1934, Barrymore was filming \"Hat, Coat and Glove\" for RKO when, during the filming of one scene, he again forgot his lines and even the name of his character. Filming was postponed until the following day, but the result was the same. After he took a break for a few days, he returned to the set, but he still could not remember any of the script, and RKO replaced him with Ricardo Cortez. Soon afterwards, he suffered a mental and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello confirmed that his drinking over the previous two years had worsened, and she described him as a \"hopeless alcoholic\". Barrymore's relationship with Costello was deeply troubled and, believing she was going to declare him mentally incompetent, he left their home in Los Angeles and traveled first to London and then to India. He returned to the U.S. in early 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly after his return, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and influenza. A 19-year-old fan, Elaine Jacobs, visited him, and the two became good friends. On his release from the hospital, her mother invited him to recuperate at their house. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she explained was to get \"as near to Barrymore as I dared\", and they began a relationship. In May, the couple underwent the first of several professional collaborations, when they appeared on Rudy Vall\u00e9e's \"The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour\" radio show. Costello filed for a divorce from Barrymore on May 25, 1935, citing mental cruelty, habitual intemperance, and desertion.\nThe new relationship was widely reported in the tabloid press, who labeled the couple Caliban and Ariel. After a series of arguments with Barrie, Barrymore considered the relationship with Barrie to be at an end, and he left for Los Angeles. A newspaper editor chartered a plane and flew Barrie to Chicago, to meet Barrymore's train; she broadcast a plea for him to return, and her pursuit became national news. Costello's divorce from Barrymore became final in October 1935. Morrison thinks that the headlines established a new reputation for Barrymore of \"the aging satyr, the has-been alcoholic, the much-married ham\". This was a blow to his self-respect, but he faced his troubles \"with aplomb and a sense of humor\", according to Morrison. To escape from the spotlight, Barrymore took vacations on his yacht, \"Infanta\"; it cost him over $35,000 a year to run, and so he sold it in 1938 after encountering financial difficulties.\nDecline and death: 1936\u20131942.\nBarrymore's alcohol dependence meant most studios were unwilling to employ him, but MGM risked casting him in the role of Mercutio in their 1936 film \"Romeo and Juliet\". To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that \"he was drinking and unreliable on the set\u00a0... It was sad to see him in such a state.\" Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the \"Hollywood Spectator\", thought \"Barrymore is an acting gem\", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that \"Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot.\"\nWord about Barrymore's problems on and off the set spread around the industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year until he had a supporting role in the musical film \"Maytime\". His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterward, and he again spent time in Kelley's Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When he came out, he collapsed on the \"Maytime\" set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.\nBarrymore decided to work on more Shakespeare roles. In June 1937, he signed with NBC Radio to produce a series of six episodes under the name \"Streamlined Shakespeare\", which also featured Barrie. The first program was \"Hamlet\", which was well received by critics. \"The New York Times\" commented that \"Shakespeare's lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the 'ether' with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words and no one else could speak them with such lifelike force\". Peters disagrees however, and considers that \"because he was desperate he pressed too hard and ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting\".\nThroughout the NBC series, Barrymore had been reliable, sober, and responsible, and the studios reacted positively with offers of work. This led to appearances in nine films in 1937 and 1938, including as Colonel Nielson in three Bulldog Drummond films, and roles in \"True Confession\" and \"Marie Antoinette\". He was offered predominantly supporting roles, but he worked conscientiously on the films and as a result was able to honor his debts. His memory was still problematic, and he used cue cards as an aid; his fellow actors and the directors of the films were sympathetic to his condition. When he filmed his last serious role, Gregory Vance in the 1939 film \"The Great Man Votes\", the director, Garson Kanin, ensured that the cast and crew addressed him as \"Mr. Barrymore\" as a mark of respect.\nBarrymore and his wife both appeared in supporting roles in the 1939 screwball comedy \"Midnight\", her only film role. \"The New York Times\" thought the film was \"one of the liveliest, gayest, wittiest and naughtiest comedies of a long hard season\" and that Barrymore, \"the [Lou] Gehrig of eye-brow batting, rolls his phrases with his usual richly humorous effect\". The film was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2013. Barrymore and his wife appeared together in the stage farce \"My Dear Children\", which opened in March 1939 at Princeton University's McCarter Theatre. He played the lead role, Allan Manville, an ageing hammy Shakespearean has-been.\nBecause of his failing memory, Barrymore ad-libbed constantly throughout the show. In some points the new additions were an improvement, but he also greeted friends in the audience, and used profanities freely. Nevertheless, the show was a success. \"Life\" magazine wrote that \"People flock to see [Barrymore], not for polished performance, but because he converts the theater into a rowdy histrionic madhouse. Sometimes he arrives late. Sometimes he is tight [drunk]. Usually he forgets his lines. But he always puts on a great show.\" When the show reached Broadway, \"Life\" wrote that \"Barrymore's return to Times Square was a huge professional triumph\". Brooks Atkinson, writing for \"The New York Times\" thought Barrymore was \"still the most gifted actor in this country.\u00a0... Although he has recklessly played the fool for a number of years, he is nobody's fool in \"My Dear Children\" but a superbly gifted actor on a tired holiday.\" Barrymore and his wife continued to argue during the play's run, and she left the play part way through the tour. They attempted a reconciliation when the production reached New York, but the couple divorced in late 1940.\nIn 1940, Barrymore appeared in \"The Great Profile\", a spoof of his life in the months prior to \"My Dear Children\". Barrymore played Evans Garrick, closely modeled on his own experience, and Mary Beth Hughes played his wife. The critics reacted harshly to the film, and to Barrymore's association with it. \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"As a play it is a feeble thing, hardly matching the spectacular public accounts of his amours\u00a0... for all of Mr. Barrymore's shenanigans and devastating wit, \"The Great Profile\" is more than a little pathetic. In the Winter of his Discontent Mr. Barrymore is selling his talent at cut-rate\". Worse was to come in his final film, \"Playmates\" (1941), which \"amply illustrated the depths to which he had fallen; he played an alcoholic Shakespearean ham named John Barrymore\".\nIn October 1940, Barrymore returned to the NBC Radio network to work on Rudy Vall\u00e9e's show, now called the \"Sealtest Show\". Barrymore recorded 74 episodes of the program, continuing in the vein of self-parody, with jokes about his drinking, declining career, and marital issues. On May 19, 1942, while recording a line from \"Romeo and Juliet\" for the show, Barrymore collapsed. He was taken to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital and died there on May 29, from cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure, complicated by pneumonia.\nShortly before his death, Barrymore returned to his childhood Catholic faith. Although Errol Flynn's memoirs claim film director Raoul Walsh \"borrowed\" Barrymore's body before burial to leave his corpse propped in a chair for a drunken Flynn to discover when he returned home, Gene Fowler, a close friend of Barrymore, stayed with the body all night and denied the story. However, in a 2020 interview for the YouTube series \"Hot Ones\", John's granddaughter Drew Barrymore claimed the Flynn account was accurate. Barrymore was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles on June 2. In 1980, Barrymore's son had his father's body reinterred in the family plot in Philadelphia's Mount Vernon Cemetery.\nLegacy.\n\"The New York Times\" obituary stated that during the period when Barrymore performed in \"Justice\", \"Richard III\" and \"Hamlet\", the actor \"was accepted by most critics as the foremost English-speaking actor of his time\u00a0... equipped both by nature and by art.\" \"The Washington Post\" agreed, noting that during his stage triumphs and early years in film, \"he was the great profile, the darling of the 'royal family' of the stage.\" Many of the obituaries made the point that Barrymore fell short of his potential. \"The Manchester Guardian\" thought that he \"might with some self-discipline have added his name to the list of truly great actors\u00a0... yet he dissipated his energies\". \"The New York Times\" noted that he could twist his abilities \"to parody, burlesque himself and play the clown\", and they considered that it was \"unfortunate that the public in recent years saw him in\u00a0... [that] mood. It was a mood of careless abdication\". \"The Washington Post\" observed that \"with the passing of the years\u00a0\u2013 and as his private life became more public\u00a0\u2013 he became, despite his genius in the theater, a tabloid character.\"\nAccording to Morrison, Barrymore's stage portrayals of \"Richard III\" and \"Hamlet\" were a model for modern performances of these roles. His interpretation along psychological lines was innovative, and his \"dynamic portrayals\u00a0... changed the direction of subsequent revivals.\" Barrymore's natural acting style reversed the stage conventions of the time; his \"\u2009'colloquial' verse speaking introduced to the stage the vocal manner of a postwar gentleman.\"\nBarrymore, while alive, was honored on few occasions by the entertainment industry and its members. Although both his brother and sister won Academy Awards, the only award Barrymore ever received for his screen work was from Rudolph Valentino in 1925 for \"Beau Brummel\". Valentino created an award in his own name and felt that his fellow actors should receive accolades for their screen work. When Barrymore attended his ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1940, he left more than the customary hand and footprints in the theater's forecourt: aided by the owner, Sid Grauman, Barrymore left a cement imprint of his facial profile. In February 1960, for his contribution to the motion picture industry, Barrymore was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a star at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard; Barrymore, along with his two siblings, is included in the American Theater Hall of Fame. The Barrymore \"Royal Family\" of actors continued through two of his children\u00a0\u2013 his son with Costello, John Drew Barrymore and his daughter with Oelrichs, Diana\u00a0\u2013 both of whom became actors, as did John Jr.'s daughter Drew. Barrymore's brother Lionel died on November 15, 1954, and their sister Ethel died on June 18, 1959.\nBarrymore's achievements and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, \"Confessions of an Actor\". Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, authorized by the subject, \"John Barrymore: The Legend and the Man\"; Fowler, wrote \"Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life and Times of John Barrymore\" (1943); Alpert published \"The Barrymores\" (1964); and John Kobler wrote \"Damned in Paradise: The Life of John Barrymore\" (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 that many of these earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, \"The House of Barrymore\", and his own study of the actor's work in \"John Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography\" (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed \"John Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor\" in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.\nThere were several celebratory events in 1982, on the centenary of Barrymore's birth. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Museum of Modern Art jointly hosted a commemorative program of his work, which included numerous excerpts from his films and interviews with some who knew him, including Barrie and his one-time co-star Myrna Loy. The same year, in celebration of the centenary of the Actors Fund of America, the US Postal Service issued a postage stamp featuring Barrymore and his siblings. In February 2010, an intersection in Fort Lee, New Jersey, was renamed John Barrymore Way on what would have been the actor's 128th birthday. The intersection marked the spot of the former Buckheister's Hotel, where Barrymore had his 1900 stage debut in \"A Man of the World\".\nPortrayals and characterizations.\nBarrymore has been used as the inspiration for characters on stage and film. He performed as himself in a number of works (including \"The Great Profile\", \"My Dear Children\" and \"Playmates\"), and in the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" of 1921 he was played by his friend W. C. Fields. In 1927 the Barrymore family was parodied in \"The Royal Family\" in which a character based on him was portrayed by Fredric March, whose performance Barrymore admired. The play was staged in London in 1934 as \"Theatre Royal\", with Laurence Olivier in the Barrymore role, and adapted as a film in 1930, with March reprising his performance.\nIn 1991, Paul Rudnick's comedy \"I Hate Hamlet\", performed at the Walter Kerr Theatre, was set in Barrymore's former apartment. He returns after a s\u00e9ance, dressed in his \"Hamlet\" costume. Nicol Williamson played the Barrymore role. Three years later, a London production, \"Jack: A Night on the Town with John Barrymore\", ran for 60 performances at the Criterion Theatre, and Williamson again played the lead. \"Barrymore\", a two-person play by William Luce, premiered in 1996 and depicts Barrymore shortly before his death in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his Richard III. Christopher Plummer played the title role. A film version was released in 2011, with Plummer again taking the main role.\nBarrymore had been a friend and drinking companion of Fields. In the 1976 film \"W.C. Fields and Me\", Barrymore was played by Jack Cassidy. Barrymore's friend, Errol Flynn, played him in a 1958 film \"Too Much, Too Soon\", an adaptation of the autobiography of Diana Barrymore, with Dorothy Malone playing the female lead. Howard Thompson, the film critic of \"The New York Times\", wrote that \"Flynn, as the late John Barrymore, a moody, wild-drinking ruin of a great actor, steals the picture, lock, stock and keg. It is only in the scenes of his savage disintegration, as the horrified girl hangs on, that the picture approaches real tragedy.\"\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was not affiliated with Major League Baseball or the organized minor leagues. The league was founded in 1993 and folded after its 2010 season when financial stability became a problem. The three teams remaining in the league when it folded joined with the remaining teams in United League Baseball and the Golden Baseball League to form a new independent organization called the North American League.\nHistory.\nThe modern Northern League was founded by Miles Wolff. Wolff started the league after many midwestern cities contacted him (through his affiliation with \"Baseball America\") asking how they could get a minor league team. After visiting some of them, most notably Duluth, Minnesota, and its Wade Stadium, he began contacting potential owners to start the league. The league was structured to where teams were not allowed to load their rosters with ex-pros. Players with five or more years of professional experience were labeled \"veterans\" and teams could carry no more than four. At least the same number of \"rookies\" (players with less than a year of experience) had to be on a team's roster. The rest of the roster was made up of \"limited service\" or \"LS\" players, each having a number from 1 through 5 attached to the LS depending on how long they had been in pro baseball.\nThe league began in 1993 with six teams: Duluth\u2013Superior Dukes (Duluth, Minnesota), Rochester Aces (Rochester, Minnesota), St. Paul Saints (St. Paul, Minnesota), Sioux Falls Canaries (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), Sioux City Explorers (Sioux City, Iowa) and Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks (Thunder Bay, Ontario). The prospects for the league were originally \"cloudy.\" Many forecast an early demise especially in St. Paul where competition with the Minnesota Twins led many local sportswriters to consider it a \"beer league.\" The league, however, was a relatively moderate success, with only the Rochester franchise struggling to draw crowds to their games. The first league title was won by St. Paul. After the season, the Aces were sold to an ownership group led by future Winnipeg, Manitoba mayor Sam Katz and the team relocated to the city and became known as the Winnipeg Goldeyes, taking the name of the Winnipeg team that played in the original Northern League. The Goldeyes won the league championship in their first season in the new city.\nThe first wave of expansion to the league came in 1996 as the Northern League entered Wisconsin and North Dakota. The Madison Black Wolf, based in the capital of Wisconsin, and Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, based in Fargo, North Dakota, but named for the metropolitan area that includes Moorhead, Minnesota, joined the league. The second wave of expansion came in 1999. First, the Whiskey Jacks left Canada and moved to Schaumburg, Illinois, where they became known as the Schaumburg Flyers. The bigger news, however, was that the Northeast League, an independent league in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states also founded by Wolff, would merge with the Northern League and become the Northern League's East Division. The rest of the Northern League teams comprised the Central Division, and both division champions would meet in a league championship series. The merger lasted until 2002, and Northeast League teams won all four of the Northern League's championships in that time. Meanwhile, Madison's team moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2001 to become the Lincoln Saltdogs while teams were awarded to Joliet, Illinois, and Gary, Indiana, in 2002. The Joliet JackHammers made the playoffs in their first season while the Gary SouthShore RailCats were forced to play an entire season on the road because the city of Gary did not have their stadium completed on time.\nAt the end of the 2002 season Miles Wolff resigned as commissioner of the Northern League to focus on his duties with the now-reinstated Northeast League. Mike Stone became league commissioner in 2003. Over the next two years the league entered three new markets. Charter member Duluth-Superior left Minnesota in 2003 to move to Kansas City, Kansas, and became known as the Kansas City T-Bones. For 2004, the league expanded its Canadian operations into the province of Alberta and added the Calgary Vipers and Edmonton CrackerCats to the league.\nMike Stone left the commissioner's position in 2005 shortly after a dramatic move by several of the league's teams. Following the season's conclusion St. Paul, Sioux City, Sioux Falls, and Lincoln announced they were leaving the league to form a new independent league with five teams from the folded Central Baseball League in the southern United States; the new league was to be known as the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Stone was replaced by Jim Weigel, who in turn was replaced by Clark C. Griffith after one year in charge. Following the 2007 season, the league was left with six teams as Calgary and Edmonton left to join the Golden Baseball League. This number grew to seven in 2009 as Zion, Illinois, was granted an expansion team known as the Lake County Fielders. In 2010 an eighth team was added when the Rockford RiverHawks moved from the Frontier League.\nFollowing the 2010 season, the Northern League announced that Winnipeg, Kansas City, Fargo-Moorhead, and Gary SouthShore would be leaving the league to join the American Association. This left Rockford, Lake County, Joliet, and Schaumburg with decisions to make. The JackHammers were sold and renamed to the Joliet Slammers, and moved to the Frontier League. The other three franchises merged with the Golden Baseball League and United League Baseball franchises to form the North American League. However, things did not work out as planned. The Flyers were evicted from Alexian Field, their home stadium, due to a large amount of debt owed to their home town of Schaumburg and eventually suspended operations. The RiverHawks decided to decline the invitation in the league and return to the Frontier League for 2011. The Fielders were the only team remaining from the original three merged into the new league but have since folded, meaning there are no longer any Northern League teams remaining in the North American League. As of the end of the 2011 season only one member of the North American League has, in fact, played in the Northern League \u2013 the Edmonton Capitals (the former Cracker-Cats). The fate of the North American League was also soon decided with the Golden Baseball League's teams disbanding and the United Baseball League decided to re-adopt their league name due to only UBL teams remaining in the ill-fated NAL after the 2012 season. The UBL itself folded after the 2014 season.\nOver 12 seasons, over two dozen former Northern League players have played in Major League Baseball. These include players such as J. D. Drew, Kevin Millar, Chris Coste, Jeff Zimmerman, and Rey Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. Several former MLB players played in the league including Dennis \"Oil Can\" Boyd, Darryl Strawberry, Jack Morris, Pedro Guerrero, Jermaine Allensworth, Ken Harvey, Mike Caruso, Bo Hart, Leon \"Bull\" Durham, and Brant Brown. Former MLB players and coaches have also coached or managed in the Northern League including Terry Bevington, \"Dirty\" Al Gallagher, Jackie Hern\u00e1ndez, Danny Jackson, Maury Wills, Tim Johnson, Ron Kittle, Hal Lanier, Darryl Motley, Matt Nokes, and Wayne Terwilliger.\nLeague structure.\nWhen the Northern League consisted of between eight and twelve teams, it played a split season 96-game schedule with two divisions from late May until early September. The division winners in each half qualified for the post-season, though if a team were to win both halves, the team with the best overall record, regardless of division, qualified as a wild card. Both the league semi-finals and Championship Series were best of five.\nWhen the league dropped to six teams in 2008, it still played a 96-game schedule, but did not split the season and did not have divisions. Instead, the top four teams qualified for the playoffs. The first round consisted of a best-of-five series between the first and fourth-place finishers and between second and third-place finishers. The winners of the first round then played a best-of-five championship series.\nIn October 2009 the Northern League voted to expand from its 96-game season to a 100-game schedule, effective for the 2010 season. The playoff format was to remain the same, with the top four clubs making the playoffs.\nRosters.\nDuring the season, rosters were limited to 22 players, broken into seven classes based on a players years of service. One year of service was defined as one National Association (affiliated) season, or two independent league seasons.\nFormer teams (1993\u20132010).\nAssociation)\nLeague timeline.\nFinal league members Former Team\nAll-Star Game.\nThe Northern League hosted an annual All-Star Game starting in 1997. The venue changed annually. Its format pitted the all-stars from each division against each other. In 2008 and 2009, there were no divisions during the regular season so the league temporarily split to have the \"Chicagoland\" clubs play the \"I-29\" clubs in 2008 and the \"Great Lakes\" clubs play the \"Great Plains\" clubs in 2009. In 2010, the Northern League played the Golden League all-stars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has also published miniature wargaming rules, role-playing games and sports simulations. It is a subsidiary of Hasbro, and operates under the company's \"Hasbro Gaming\" division.\nAvalon Hill introduced many of the concepts of modern recreational wargaming, including the use of a hexagonal grid (a.k.a. hexgrid) overlaid on a flat folding board, zones of control (ZOC), stacking of multiple units at a location, and board games based upon historical events.\nHistory.\nThe Avalon Game Company.\nAvalon Hill was started in 1952 outside Baltimore in Catonsville, Maryland, by Charles S. Roberts under the name of \"The Avalon Game Company\" for the publication of his game \"Tactics\". It is considered the first of a new type of war game, consisting of a self-contained printed map, pieces, rules and box designed for the mass-market. Other war games published over the prior half-century, from which Roberts drew inspiration, were either not designed for the commercial market and/or used miniatures with self-made maps/terrain. Roberts sold \"Tactics\" by mail from his home in the Avalon neighborhood of Catonsville; his house overlooked the Patapsco River valley and B&amp;O Railroad for which Roberts, his father and grandfather worked. \nFollowing the success of \"Tactics\", Roberts changed the name upon incorporation from \"The Avalon Game Company\" to \"Avalon Hill\" in 1958 because of a naming dispute with another company, and given the Avalon house was on a hill. The number of games released per year was erratic until 1964 as the company released anywhere from 1 to 7 games.5-8\nThe first game published by the company under the name of \"Avalon Hill\" was \"Gettysburg\", published in 1958, it was also the first board wargame to simulate a historical battle. AH published two other games that year, the second edition of \"Tactics\", titled \"Tactics II\", and the railroad game \"Dispatcher\". \nIn 1959, Roberts moved Avalon into an office space on Gay Street in Baltimore and took on its first outside designed game, \"Verdict\", by two corporate lawyers. After another office move, in Thomas N. Shaw, a high school friend of Roberts, was hired to design games.6\nIn 1960, Avalon published the first mostly dice-less sports game in \"Football Strategy\" designed by Thomas N. Shaw which was followed by two sister games, \"Baseball Strategy\" and \"Basketball Strategy\". Of this sports strategy line, the football and baseball versions were previously privately published by Shaw in 1959.7 With a recession occurring, debt began to pile up starting in 1961.\nAvalon launched a pre-school children's line in 1963 with four games, \"Imagination\", \"What Time Is It?\", \"Doll House\" and \"Trucks, Trains, Boats &amp; Planes\", which flopped. Roberts gave up and planned to file bankruptcy on .p7 Instead his creditors, Monarch Office Services and J.E. Smith &amp; Co., interceded and took over. Monarch had printed all but the boxes, which were done by J.E. Smith. The company was reorganized by retaining only one staff member, Shaw, moving, cutting costs and appointing J.E. Sparling as president.p7,8 In 1964, AH set a two-game per year release schedule.5-8\nAvalon Hill published \"Blitzkrieg\" in 1965. This game was an abstract combat game, featuring two sides (red and blue) and some neutral countries. Many rules variants were created for \"Blitzkrieg\". The company also published simulations of actual battles and campaigns, such as \"Midway,\" \"Afrika Korps,\" and \"The Battle of the Bulge.\"\nAvalon Hill published \"PanzerBlitz\" in 1970, designed for the company by Jim Dunnigan's Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) on a royalty basis from SPI's \"Tac Force 3\" game.p9\nMonarch Avalon division.\nMonarch bought out J.E. Smith &amp; Co., Avalon Hill's co-owner, on . Thus the company became a division of a renamed Monarch Office Services, Monarch Avalon.p10 Coinciding with the purchase, an additional warehouse was opened in historic downtown Baltimore at 1501 Guilford Ave., complementing the original building at 4517 Harford Road. Don Greenwood joined in 1972.\nThe company acquired several successful games including \"Acquire\", \"TwixT\", and \"Feudal\" from the purchase of 3M Games in .p5,12 The \"Sports Illustrated\" (SI) line of sports games were purchased in . Both lines increased the retail outlets that would take AH games. The Aladdin Industries game line was another acquisition in . With the SI line, the company started a sports game division in with Bruce Milligan hired to head the division and launch \"All Star Replay\" sport games magazine. While from the 3M line, \"Facts in Five\" became its top selling game.p5,12\nDuring the 1970s, Avalon Hill published a number of popular games such as \"Outdoor Survival\", \"Panzer Blitz\", \"Squad Leader\", the \"Statis Pro\" sports line, and \"\".\nAvalon Hill also purchased many games from smaller companies and republished them. Heritage Models sold AH its Battleline Publications in .p5,15 Many of the Battleline products, including \"Wooden Ships and Iron Men\" and \"Machiavelli\" (a variant of \"Diplomacy\" set in Renaissance Italy), was republished by Avalon Hill, along with the popular \"Diplomacy\". AH also acquired Jedko Games' \"The Russian Campaign\" and \"War at Sea\", and Hartland Trefoil's \"Civilization\". The railroad building game \"1830\" was developed by Avalon Hill, based on Francis Tresham's European game \"1829\"; the AH version was so successful it spawned an entire 18XX genre of games.\n\"Gulf Strike\" was introduced by the company in . It was based on the Iran\u2013Iraq War, then updated after the cease-fire in 1988. \"Dr. Ruth's Game of Good Sex\" was released in 1985. A Baltimore distributor said: \"I'm going to have to compare this to \"Trivial Pursuit\". The orders overshadow anything we've had in our company's 100-year history.\" It then dropped off.\nFacing an economic downturn in 1990 and a three-year period of losses, Monarch Avalon closed its New York office, sold its toy division, and reduced inventory. AH also published its timely game expansion, \"Desert Shield\", that sold out in weeks after its release such that a second print run hit the market in . In 1991, Hobbycraft Canada was sharing office space with Monarch Avalon.\nThe AvalonCon World Boardgaming Championships was first held by AH in 1991, in the Baltimore area.\nRoleplaying games.\nIn 1974, a new game developer attempted to pitch his concept to Avalon Hill. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson had co-developed a new type of co-operative game that used role-playing. But when Gygax pitched \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" to AH, the largest company in wargaming did not understand the concept of role-playing, and turned down his offer. Gygax responded by founding TSR Inc to self-publish his game. In less than five years, TSR would be the dominant player in the new RPG market.\nAvalon Hill entered the role-playing game market a decade later by publishing \"Powers and Perils\" in 1983 and \"Lords of Creation\" in 1984. The licenses to \"RuneQuest\" and the board games \"White Bear &amp; Red Moon\" (republished as \"Dragon Pass\") and \"Elric\", were acquired in a complex agreement in 1983 with Chaosium, and Avalon Hill published the 3rd Edition in 1984. None of these role-playing games achieved the popularity of the long-established competitor, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\".\nVideo games.\nAvalon Hill became an early publisher of computer games in 1980 with its video game division Microcomputer Games, adapting some of its boardgame titles to various computer platforms (TRS-80, Vic-20, Commodore 64, Apple II, etc.) on several data formats (cassette tape and 5\u00bc\" disk). Sales of these products were decent, but the only outstanding success was \"Achtung Spitfire!\", published relatively late in the company history.\nIn December 1992, AH hired Jim Rose to lead its computer game division, with the goal of reviving this part of the business in the face of flagging board game sales. AH reentered the computer game market in 1994 with a good review of \"Flight Commander 2\". The company added Pogs to its game line up in 1995. By June 1995, Rose had left the company to found TalonSoft. In 1995, Monarch Avalon placed Avalon Hill up for sale but it was later withdrawn. Avalon Hill's return to computer games proved unsuccessful: Terry Coleman of \"Computer Gaming World\" reported in late 1998 that \"no AH game in the past five years [had] sold even 50,000 units worldwide\".\nHasbro subsidiary.\nMonarch sold Avalon Hill to Hasbro on August 4, 1998, for $6 million. Coinciding with the purchase, Hasbro laid off AH's entire staff. Hasbro, seeking popular board games that could be converted to computer versions, purchased the rights to the Avalon Hill trademarks, copyrights, inventory, tooling and divisions, Avalon Hill Software and Victory Games, and placed them under its video game subsidiary, Hasbro Interactive. Avalon Hill Games, Inc. was incorporated by Hasbro on .\nIn 2001, Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames; Avalon Hill was not included in the sale and Hasbro later transferred control of the company to its subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast, in 2004.\nHasbro has released new titles under the Avalon Hill name, and added the Avalon Hill imprint to older titles such as \"Axis and Allies\" that were not originally made by Avalon Hill.\nOn September 8, 2020, Hasbro announced that it would move the management of Avalon Hill from Wizards of the Coast to Hasbro Gaming in January 2021.\nGame rights.\nThe rights to many of Avalon Hill's more complex games have been licensed or sold to other game publishers, or have reverted to their original owners and been republished by other companies:\nVictory Games.\nOne of Avalon Hill's competitors, Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI), produced wargames that were more complex and realistic simulations than those that Avalon Hill published. In 1982, after SPI's assets were acquired by TSR, Avalon Hill hired away some of SPI's design staff and formed them into a subsidiary company, Victory Games. When Victory Games released a line of SPI-style games, it met with critical and commercial acclaim. In 1989, Victory Games brought on Leonard Quam, a veteran from West End Games, and hired Kevin Boylan as a product developer. Victory Games continued to develop and release new products, including \"3rd Fleet\", ', ', and \"Carrier\". The New York office closed in early 1991 after Quam left the company. Victory's final two games, \"Flashpoint Golan\" and \"Across Five Aprils\", were developed by Boylan alone, who worked remotely in collaboration with Avalon Hill's art department. \nIn addition from 1983 to 1987, the imprint also published an officially licensed tabletop role-playing game of the \"James Bond\" spy fiction media franchise, \"James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service\".\nMagazines.\n\"The General\".\nAvalon Hill also had its own house organ which promoted sale and play of its games, \"The General Magazine\", which was published regularly between 1964 and 1998. The magazine offered a wide array of features, including articles on both strategies of play and tactics for specific situations, historical analyses, semi-regular features devoted to individual games, columns on sports and computer games by AH, listings of vendors and opponents, answers to questions on game rules, ratings for both games and players, discount coupons for mail orders, and insider information on future AH projects.\n\"All-Star Replay\".\nThis magazine was for Avalon Hill's sports games. A total of 19 issues were published quarterly (later bi-monthly) from 1977 to 1981.\n\"Heroes\".\nIn early 1984, on the occasion of the release of third edition \"RuneQuest\", Avalon Hill included in all \"RuneQuest\" boxes a single advertising flyer announcing the launch of \"HEROES\", its own role-playing magazine. \"HEROES\" ran for ten issues from 1984 to 1986 and had the main purpose to promote all four of Avalon Hill's role-playing games: \"James Bond 007\", \"Lords of Creation\", \"Powers and Perils\", and \"RuneQuest\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after the Austrian botanist Friedrich Welwitsch, who documented the plant in the 1850s. In common use, it is sometimes referred to as the tree tumbo. It is native to Angola and Namibia, where it grows in the extreme conditions of the Namib desert, tolerating high heat and low precipitation. \"Welwitschia\" is the only living genus of the family Welwitschiaceae and order Welwitschiales, and is one of three extant genera of gnetophytes, alongside \"Gnetum\" and \"Ephedra\".\n\"Welwitschia\" is well known for its unique morphology. The plant has only two leaves that grow out of a large woody stem, known as a crown, and continue to grow throughout the plant's life. \"Welwitschia\" is one of the longest-living plants on Earth, with some individuals being thousands of years old. Because of the long lifespan the leaves can become quite large, often reaching several meters in length.\nAs a gymnosperm, \"Welwitschia\" uses cones to reproduce. Both male and female plants produce nectar from their cones that attract insects that then carry the pollen to other plants. The species is not currently in any significant danger of extinction, in part because its long lifespan insulates it from temporary reproductive struggles. Despite this, \"Welwitschia\" is susceptible to future overgrazing and disease, because it grows in only one environment.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Welwitschia\" is named after Austrian botanist and doctor Friedrich Welwitsch, who documented the plant in Angola in 1859. Welwitsch was fascinated by the plant, writing, \"I could do nothing but kneel down [...] and gaze at it, half in fear lest a touch should prove it a figment of the imagination.\" Joseph Dalton Hooker of the Linnean Society of London formally described the species using Welwitsch's description and collected material along with material from artist Thomas Baines, who had independently recorded the plant in Namibia. Welwitsch proposed calling the genus \"Tumboa\" after the local name, \"N'tumbo\".186 Hooker asked Welwitsch for permission to name the genus \"Welwitschia\" instead. Welwitsch concurred and supplied some well-preserved material that Hooker was able to study. \nThe taxonomy of \"Welwitschia\" subsequently changed intermittently with the development of new classification systems. Its current taxonomic status is essentially the same as Hooker's placement. Most botanists have treated \"Welwitschia\" as a distinct monotypic genus in a monotypic family or even order. Most recent systems place \"Welwitschia mirabilis\" in the family Welwitschiaceae, which also includes several extinct species. The plant is commonly known simply as welwitschia in English, but the name tree tumbo is also used. It is called or in Nama, ('two leaves; can't die') in Afrikaans, in Damara, and in Herero.\nDescription.\nAfter germination, the seedling produces two cotyledons that grow to in length. They start off pink, but turn green shortly after germination. Subsequently, two permanent leaves emerge from the crown (large, woody stem) and are produced opposite (at right angles to) the cotyledons. The permanent leaves grow rapidly and last for the plant's entire life. They are long and ribbon-shaped, with their veins running down their length parallel to each other. Shortly after the appearance of the permanent leaves, the apical meristem dies and meristematic activity is transferred to the periphery of the crown. The two (rarely three) leaves grow continuously from the crown across its entire circumference, reaching lengths up to . The crown is disc-shaped and widens with age, reaching up to a meter in diameter. The largest specimens may be no more than tall above ground, but the circumference of the leaves in contact with the sand may exceed . The largest known individual is in diameter and in circumference. \nAs the plant ages, the leaves often split into ribbons and become frayed from years of weathering. The age of individual plants is difficult to assess, with radiocarbon dating being the most common method in determining plant age. The plant is exceptionally long-lived, with many being hundreds of years old, and the oldest being perhaps as much as 2,000 years old.\n\"Welwitschia\" is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Both sexes produce cones that grow out of the crown of the plant, which often number in the hundreds. Cones can range from green to salmon and various shades of brown in color. The cones produce nectar that attracts various insects, most commonly flies, that then carry the oval-shaped pollen on them. The Welwitschia bug, \"Probergrothius angolensis\", is commonly observed on the plant, but probably does not have a role in pollination; it is not particularly attracted to the nectar and is usually found on the leaves of the plant. Infrequently, wasps and bees also play a role as pollinators of \"Welwitschia.\"\nBecause \"Welwitschia\" produces only a single pair of leaves, the plant was thought by some to be neotenic, consisting essentially of a \"giant seedling.\" However, research showed that its anatomy is not consistent with that of a \"giant seedling\". Instead, the plant is more accurately thought to achieve its unusual morphology as a result of having \"lost its head\" (apical meristem) at an early stage.\nGenetics.\nIn July 2021, the genome of \"Welwitschia\" was 98% sequenced, totaling 6.8\u00a0Gb on 21 chromosomes. There is evidence of a whole genome duplication followed by extensive reshuffling, probably caused by extreme stress due to a time of increased aridity and prolonged drought some 86 million years ago. As a result of this duplication, the genome contains more \"junk\" self-replicating DNA sequences. This increase in retrotransposon activity was counteracted with a silencing DNA methylation process, allowing the metabolic cost of so much genetic material to be lowered.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Welwitschia\" is endemic to the Namib desert. Its range stretches over along the Angolan and Namibian coast, being found between 14th and 24th southern parallels. The area is arid; the coast is recorded as having almost zero rainfall, while less than of rain falls annually below the escarpment in the wet season from February to April. Populations tend to occur in ephemeral water sources, indicating a dependence on groundwater in addition to precipitation from fog.\nCultivation.\n\"Welwitschia\" grows from a seed, which can be bought from specialty seed dealers. The seeds have been shown to display orthodox seed behavior, meaning they can be stored for long periods of time at extreme humidity and temperature. \"Welwitschia\" seeds are able to survive temperatures as high as and as low as without major side effects.\nSeeds collected from the wild often are heavily contaminated with spores of the fungus \"Aspergillus niger\", which causes them to rot shortly after they germinate. The fungus infects the growing cones of \"Welwitschia\" early in their development with a sharp increase in infection occurring when the pollination drop (a sugary substance produced by the ovule) appears. Because of this, seeds in the wild may be rendered nonviable before they develop fully. The fungicide tebuconazole may be useful in controlling limited \"A.\u00a0niger\" seed infection.\nIndigenous people sometimes eat the cone of the plant by eating it raw or baking it in hot ashes. The Herero name of the plant, \"onyanga\", translates to 'onion of the desert'. \"Welwitschia\" is also featured on the coat of arms of Namibia growing from a sand dune.\nConservation.\nThe wild population of \"Welwitschia\" is reasonably stable. The international trade in the plant is controlled under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Plants in Angola are generally better protected than those in Namibia because the relatively high concentration of land mines from the Angolan Civil War that remain in the former region.\nAlthough \"Welwitschia\" is not immediately threatened, with abundant populations distributed over a large area, its status is far from secure; its recruitment and growth rates are low and its range, though wide, covers only a single compact, ecologically limited and vulnerable area. The remarkable longevity of \"Welwitschia\" favors its survival of temporary periods adverse to reproduction, but it offers no protection against direct threats, such as overgrazing and disease. Fungal infection of female cones severely reduces seed viability, reducing already inherently low recruitment. Other threats include injury from off-road vehicles, collection of wild plants and overgrazing by zebras, rhinos, and domestic animals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68074", "revid": "287161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68074", "title": "Incheon", "text": "City in South Korea\nIncheon is a city located in northwestern South Korea, bordering Seoul and Gyeonggi Province to the east. Inhabited since the Neolithic, Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. As of February 2020, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the Seoul Metropolitan Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province, forming the world's fourth-largest metropolitan area by population.\nIncheon has since led the economic development of South Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of South Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as South Korea's first free economic zone. Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.\nAs an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair &amp; Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon is also a major transportation hub in northeast Asia, with Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port. The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.\nHistory.\nThe first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 AD, during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo, by the name of Michuhol, which is supposed to be located on modern Munhak Hill (). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called Gyeongwon () or Inju (). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, ). Old Incheon consisted of modern southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu District, and Namdong District) and the northern part of Siheung. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office () and the local academy (hyanggyo, ) were located. The \"original\" two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from Munhak Baseball Stadium.\nModern history.\nAnother historical name of the city, Jemulpo (alternatively Romanized as Chemulpo), was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883. It was frequently used until the Japanese annexation. After the opening of the Incheon port, the city center moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered \"Original Incheon\" (). It was internationally known as Jinsen during Japanese rule, based on the Japanese pronunciation of Incheon's Sino-Korean name.\nIn 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former center of Gwangyo) with Bupyeong County, forming Bucheon County. Between 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon, by which some part of \"old\" Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.\nIncheon was originally part of Gyeonggi Province, but was granted \"Directly Governed\" (now Metropolitan) City status on 1 July 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon.\nIncheon was known as Inchon prior to South Korea's adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.\nMajor events.\nThe city was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired.\nDuring the Korean War, Incheon was occupied by North Korean troops on 4 July 1950. Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950. was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.\nPrior to and during the June Democratic Movement in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests.\nIncheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair &amp; Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.\nThe city hosted a meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers in February 2010. Incheon was the site of the third Global Model United Nations Conference, held from 10 to 14 August 2011.\nIt first hosted the Incheon Women Artists' Biennale in 2004 which expanded into welcoming international artists in its subsequent 2007, 2009 and 2011.\nIncheon hosted the Asian Games in 2014. It hosted the 6th OECD World Forum in 2018.\nIncheon was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2015 by UNESCO.\nEducation.\nOn 27 February 2007, Incheon declared itself an \"English City\", and inaugurated the \"Incheon Free English Zone\" program. The goal of the program is to make the city as proficient in English as Singapore. This is for the ultimate purpose of establishing Incheon as a commercial and business hub of northeast Asia (see Free Economic Zone below). The official slogan of the program is \"Smile with English\".\nHigher education.\nIncheon is home to a number of colleges and universities:\nClimate.\nIncheon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cwa\") using the isotherm, and humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dwa\", respectively) using the isotherm. Like other metropolitan cities, Incheon has a strong urban heat island effect. Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.\nEconomy.\nIncheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.\nIn recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city. Currently, with the total production capacity of 330k\u2113 per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with San Francisco, United States. The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510k\u2113. Also, logistics industry is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to Incheon Airport, which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.\nTransportation.\nIncheon is a major domestic and international transport hub for Korea.\nAir.\nIncheon International Airport is South Korea's primary international airport and a regional air hub. In 2015, it was the world's 22nd busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 49,412,750 passengers.\nThere were a total of 305,446 flights (300,634 international, 4,812 domestic) to and from Incheon International Airport in 2015, an average of 837 flights (824 international, 13 domestic) daily. Korea's two main carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, serviced 50.9% of flights, while low-cost and foreign carriers serviced the remaining 49.1% of flights. The airport is experiencing a rapid increase in passengers, and the opening of Terminal 2 in December 2017 spurred additional traffic.\nThe airport was also featured in the Korean drama series, \"Air City\".\nIncheon International Airport ranked \"5th in the world\" among international airports in late 2018.\nSea.\nIncheon's sea port is the second largest port in Korea after Busan Port.\nThe International Passenger Terminal located at the port offers ferries to five cities in China: Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dandong, and Weihai. There are also ferries to Incheon's outlying islands as well as Baengnyeongdo inside of the Northern Limit Line.\nBuses.\nIncheon Bus Terminal, located at its eponymous subway stop, offers express bus transportation to all parts of Korea. Many city bus lines offer transportation within city limits as well as to the neighboring cities of Bucheon, Gimpo, Seoul, and Siheung.\nTrains.\nLocal service to Guro, Seoul, Cheongnyangni, Uijeongbu and Soyosan is offered by Seoul's subway Line 1. The line has 11 stations within Incheon and connects to the Incheon Subway at Bupyeong and Juan stations.\nRapid service on the same line to Yongsan station in Seoul depart from Dongincheon station and stops at major stations.\nThe Airport Express (AREX) line runs from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010. Passengers can choose a high-speed service stopping only at Incheon airport and Seoul, which takes 43 minutes but departs only every half-hour; or the all-station service which takes 53 minutes but leaves every six minutes.\nKTX service was introduced on the AREX line on 30 June 2014, with stops at Incheon International Airport station and Geomam station. There are additional plans to use the newly built Suin Line to bring KTX service to Incheon station by 2021.\nSubway.\nThe Incheon Subway has two subway lines serving the city. The first line connects to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system at Bupyeong station (Seoul Subway Line 1), and AREX line at Gyeyang station. It connects International Business District station in Songdo to Gyeyang station. The line has 28 stations on of track. The line also has transfer stations with the Suin Line at Woninjae station, with the Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station, and with Seoul Subway Line 7 at Bupyeong-gu Office station. Incheon Subway Line 2 opened in July 2016 and runs from Geomdan Oryu station to Unyeon station. The automated line is long, and has 27 stations, including transfer stations at Geomam station with the AREX line, Juan station with Seoul Subway Line 1 and Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station.\nThe Incheon subway is operated by the Incheon Rapid Transit Corporation (IRTC).\nKorail has also constructed a new commuter rail line named Suin Line. The line opened in 2012 from Oido station in Siheung to Songdo station in Incheon. It was then extended in 2016, and now reaches Incheon station where passengers can transfer to Seoul Subway Line 1. In 2020, the line was extended from Oido station to Suwon Station.\nSMRT (one of three operating companies of Seoul Metropolitan Subway) has extended Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 7 to Bupyeong-gu office by 2011 and provided transfers to the Incheon Subway system. It has 3 stations within Incheon. By 2020, the line will further be extended westwards to Seoknam station where it will be possible to transfer to Incheon Subway Line 2.\nFree Economic Zone.\nThe Incheon Free Economic Zone (\"IFEZ\") comprises the regions of Songdo, Cheongna, and Yeongjong Island, covering a total area of 51,739 acres (20,938 hectares). IFEZ was established to develop these areas into centres for logistics, international business, leisure, and tourism, aimed primarily at the Northeast Asian region. The designation of \"Free Economic Zone\" refers to efforts to enhance the business environment for foreign enterprises and improve living conditions for expatriates. It was the first zone of its kind in South Korea, formally designated in August 2003. The region includes infrastructure for air and sea transportation, logistics, international business, financial services, and residential facilities, alongside educational, medical, and leisure amenities.\nNew Songdo City.\nDevelopment of Songdo International City began in 1994 on reclaimed land and has been intended as a centre for international business, trade, technology, and environmentally conscious urban living. Initially projected to be completed by 2020, some areas continue to be under development, with evolving projects and adjustments to the original master plan. Songdo houses various multinational companies and hosts several international institutions, including the Green Climate Fund.

It is a semi-autobiographical fantasy based on aspects of Fosse's life and career as a dancer, choreographer and filmmaker. It was also the final work of its producer Robert Alan Aurthur, who wrote the screenplay with Fosse and died a year before its release.\nThe story draws from Fosse's experience editing his 1974 film \"Lenny\" while simultaneously staging the Broadway musical \"Chicago\", which he directed, choreographed and co-wrote. Like Fosse, Scheider's character attempts to stage an ambitious Broadway musical while supervising the editing of a film he directed and which, like \"Lenny\", centers around a stand-up comedian. Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer, Cliff Gorman and Ben Vereen co-star in supporting roles. The film borrows its title from the song of the same name from \"Chicago\".\n\"All That Jazz\" was released on December 20, 1979, to commercial and critical success, being praised by critics for its creativity, ambition, choreography, and Scheider's performance, although it was labelled by some as pretentious or \"egomaniacal\", in particular in regard to its autobiographical nature. It jointly won the Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival together with Akira Kurosawa's \"Kagemusha\" and received a leading nine nominations at the 52nd Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for Scheider, winning four: Best Original Score, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Film Editing. Following its release, Stanley Kubrick called it \"[the] best film I think I have ever seen\", and in 2001 it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nJoe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer attempting to balance staging his latest Broadway musical, \"NY/LA\", while editing a Hollywood film he has directed, \"The Stand-Up\". He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer constantly flirting and engaging in sexual encounters with a stream of women. Each morning, he begins his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine, Alka-Seltzer, and Dexedrine, always concluding by looking at himself in the mirror and saying, \"It's showtime, folks!\" Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique in a nightclub setting, discussing his life with her.\nAs Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he vents his anger on the dancers and in his choreography. This leads to a highly sexualized number of topless women during a rehearsal, frustrating the show's penny-pinching backers. One of the few moments of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of \"The Stand-Up\", moving him to tears. During a table-read of \"NY/LA\", Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina.\nJoe brushes off his symptoms, attempting to leave for rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from exhaustion. \"NY/LA\" is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, smoking and drinking while hosting endless streams of women in his room. As he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie remaining by his side for support. A negative review for \"The Stand-Up\", released during Joe's hospitalization, comes in despite the film's financial success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event.\nWhile Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery, the producers of \"NY/LA\" realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon's death: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, all berating him for his behavior. He realizes he cannot avoid his death and has another heart attack.\nAs the doctors try to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs, exploring the basement of the hospital and the autopsy ward before allowing himself to be taken back. He goes through the five stages of grief\u2014anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\u2014featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (\"Bye Bye Life\", a whimsical parody of \"Bye Bye Love\"). In his dying dream, Joe can thank his family and acquaintances, as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation. Joe finally dreams of himself traveling down a hallway to meet Angelique at the end. Meanwhile, his corpse is zipped up in a body bag.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nWhile trying to edit \"Lenny\" and choreograph \"Chicago\" in 1974, Fosse suffered a massive heart attack and underwent open heart surgery. After recovering, Fosse became interested in the subject of life and death and hospital behavior. Alongside his friend Robert Alan Aurthur, they set out to make a film adaption of \"Ending\" by Hilma Wolitzer which had similar themes of death and marital problems. However, after completing the screenplay, Fosse decided against making it a film as he found the material too depressing and felt he wasn't strong enough to stick with it for over a year. Still wanting to stick with the subject matter of death and wanting to use what he felt were his best tools of song and dance, he instead decided to make a film based on his own experiences with making \"Lenny\" and \"Chicago\". The story's structure closely mirrors Fosse's own health issues at the time and is often compared to Federico Fellini's \"8\u00bd\", another thinly veiled autobiographical film with fantastical elements.\nThe part of Audrey Paris\u2014Joe's ex-wife and continuing muse, played by Leland Palmer\u2014closely reflects that of Fosse's wife, the dancer and actress Gwen Verdon, who continued to work with him on projects including \"Chicago\" and \"All That Jazz\" itself.\nGideon's rough handling of chorus girl Victoria Porter closely resembles Bob Fosse's own treatment of Jennifer Nairn-Smith during rehearsals for \"Pippin\". Nairn-Smith herself appears in the film as Jennifer, one of the \"NY/LA\" dancers.\nAnn Reinking auditioned for and received the role of Katie Jagger, a role loosely based on herself.\nCliff Gorman was cast in the titular role of \"The Stand-Up\"\u2014the film-within-a-film version of \"Lenny\"\u2014after having played the role of Lenny Bruce in the original theatrical production of the show (for which he won a Tony Award), but was passed over for Fosse's film version of the production in favor of Dustin Hoffman.\nThe part of Joe Gideon was offered to Paul Newman, who turned it down as he didn't feel the character was redeemable and also didn't take Fosse into consideration. Newman would later call it a \"dumb mistake\".\nWith increasing production costs and a loss of enthusiasm for the film, Columbia brought in Fox to finance completion, and the latter studio acquired domestic distribution rights in return.\nCritical reception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 48 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Director Bob Fosse and star Roy Scheider are at the top of their games in this dazzling, self-aware stage drama about a death-obsessed director-choreographer.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 72 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating .\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby called the film \"an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego\" and \"an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time... some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun... A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, \"All That Jazz\" might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider's is a presence to reckon with.\"\n\"Variety\" described it as \"a self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film\" and added, \"Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a character filled with nervous energy... The film's major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates [him].\"\nGene Siskel praised the film on \"Sneak Previews\" finding it fresh and entertaining describing it as \"an obituary of a creative man who's afraid his work just might be trivial.\" His colleague Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, praising Fosse's choreography though criticizing the story finding it discombobulated and self-indulgent. He also found it inferior to \"8\u00bd\" stating, \"I think it's kind of ironic Bob Fosse makes a film about his own life and it turns out to be Fellini's life.\" In 2003, Ebert said he had changed his opinion, and praised the film stating that he was \"wrong\" about it at the time and felt it was unfair of him to compare it to Fellini.\nStanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote 'Except for one brief flashback, it's a latter-day self destructive agon in which the protagonist is beginning a complex Broadway show,'.\n\"TV Guide\" said, \"The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type . . . \"All That Jazz\" is great-looking but not easy to watch. Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing.\"\nLeonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four) in his 2009 movie guide; he said that the film was \"self-indulgent and largely negative,\" and that \"great show biz moments and wonderful dancing are eventually buried in pretensions\"; he also called the ending \"an interminable finale which leaves a bad taste for the whole film.\"\n\"Time Out London\" states, \"As translated onto screen, [Fosse's] story is wretched: the jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song 'n' dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; Fellini-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal.\"\nUpon release in 1979, director Stanley Kubrick, who is mentioned in the movie, reportedly called it \"[the] best film I think I have ever seen\".\nIn 2001, \"All That Jazz\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was also preserved by the Academy Film Archive in the same year. In 2006, the film was ranked #14 by the American Film Institute on its list of the Greatest Movie Musicals.\nThe film would be the last musical nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture until Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" was nominated in 1992, and was the last live-action musical to compete in the category until Baz Luhrmann's \"Moulin Rouge!\" was nominated in 2002.\nHome media.\nThe DVD issued in 2003 features scene-specific commentary by Roy Scheider and interviews with Scheider and Fosse. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released a \"Special Music Edition\" DVD in 2007, with an audio commentary by the film's Oscar-winning editor, Alan Heim. Blu-ray and DVD editions were released in August 2014 with all the old special features, as well as new supplements through The Criterion Collection brand.\nLegacy.\nThe final dance sequence of \"All That Jazz\" is depicted in FX's \"Fosse/Verdon\" starring Sam Rockwell as Bob Fosse. The series' executive producer and Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda played the dual role of Joe Gideon/Roy Scheider. The \"Get Happy\" dream sequence musical number in the season 7 \"House\" episode \"Bombshells\" was also inspired by this dance sequence.\nThe film is referenced in the \"Better Call Saul\" first-season episode, \"Mijo\". During the episode, there is a montage depicting the daily routine of protagonist Jimmy McGill, which includes looking at himself in the mirror and saying \"It's showtime, folks!\", mirroring the words and gesture part of \"All That Jazz\" protagonist Joe Gideon's own routine; McGill acknowledges that the words are \"from a movie\" when a bystander sees him do the routine.\nSeason 3 Episode 5 of \"GLOW\", \"Freaky Tuesday\", opens with the same Vivaldi concerto music while the character Tamm\u00e9 is shown struggling, with the help of pills and wine and hot showers, to wake up every morning and tamp down her back pain while continuing to perform as a wrestler each night.\nSeason 3 Episode 10 of \"Get a Life\", \"Zoo Animals on Wheels\", features a rehearsal montage set to \"On Broadway\". During this sequence, Chris Peterson (Chris Elliott) mimics Joe Gideon's cigarette smoking and use of Visine before saying, \"It's showtime, folks!\" to himself in his dressing room mirror. Elliott would again reference the film in the finale of the Adult Swim series \"Eagleheart\", which concludes with a recreation of the \"Bye Bye Life\" sequence, with his character Chris Monsanto as Joe Gideon.\nThe David Fincher\u2013directed music video for Paula Abdul's song \"Cold Hearted\" is inspired by the \"Take Off With Us\" dance sequence in \"All That Jazz\".\nThe 2006 film \"Marie Antoinette\" written and directed by Sofia Coppola reuses the Vivaldi concerto in a montage depicting the daily routine of Marie's life with her husband.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

S. Forester. It was directed by John Huston and produced by Sam Spiegel and John Woolf. The screenplay was adapted by James Agee, John Huston, John Collier and Peter Viertel. It was photographed in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff and has a music score by Allan Gray. The film stars Humphrey Bogart (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor, his only Oscar) and Katharine Hepburn with Robert Morley, Peter Bull, Walter Gotell, Richard Marner and Theodore Bikel. \"The African Queen\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1994, and the Library of Congress deemed it \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nSamuel Sayer and his sister Rose are English Methodist missionaries in German East Africa in August 1914. Their mail and supplies are delivered by a small steamboat named the \"African Queen\", helmed by the rough-and-ready Canadian mechanic Charlie Allnut, whose coarse behavior they stiffly tolerate.\nWhen Charlie warns the Sayers that war has broken out between Germany and Britain, they choose to remain in Kungdu, only to witness German colonial troops burn down the village and herd the villagers away to be pressed into service. When Samuel protests, he is struck by a soldier and soon becomes delirious with fever, dying shortly afterward. Charlie helps Rose bury her brother and they escape in the \"African Queen\".\nCharlie mentions to Rose that the British are unable to attack the Germans because of the presence of a large gunboat, the , patrolling a large lake downriver. Rose comes up with a plan to convert the \"African Queen\" into a torpedo boat and sink the . After some persuasion, Charlie goes along with the plan.\nCharlie encourages Rose to navigate the river by rudder while he tends the engine, and she is emboldened after they pass the first set of rapids with minimal flooding in the boat. When they pass the German fortress, the soldiers begin shooting at them, damaging the boiler. Charlie manages to reattach a pressure hose just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding on the deck. While celebrating their success, Charlie and Rose find themselves in an embrace and kiss. The third set of rapids damages the boat's propeller shaft. They rig up a primitive forge on shore and Charlie straightens the shaft and welds a new blade onto the propeller, allowing the two to set off again.\nAll appears lost when the boat becomes mired in the mud and dense reeds near the mouth of the river. With no supplies left and short of potable water, Rose and a feverish Charlie pass out, both accepting that they will soon die. Rose says a quiet prayer. As they sleep, torrential rains raise the river's level and float the \"African Queen\" into the lake.\nOver the next two days, Charlie and Rose prepare for their attack. The returns and Charlie and Rose steam the \"African Queen\" out onto the lake in darkness, intending to set her on a collision course. A strong storm strikes, causing water to pour into the \"African Queen\" through the torpedo holes. Eventually the boat capsizes, throwing Charlie and Rose into the water. Charlie loses sight of Rose in the storm.\nCharlie is captured and taken aboard the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\", where he is interrogated by German officers. Believing that Rose has drowned, he makes no attempt to defend himself against accusations of spying and the German captain sentences him to death by hanging. Rose is brought aboard the ship just after Charlie's sentence is pronounced. The captain questions her, and Rose proudly confesses the plot to sink the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\", deciding that they have nothing to lose. The captain sentences her to be executed with Charlie, both as British spies. Charlie asks the German captain to marry them before they are executed. The captain agrees, and after conducting the briefest of marriage ceremonies, is about to carry out the execution when the is rocked by a series of explosions, quickly capsizing. The ship has struck the overturned submerged hull of the \"African Queen\" and detonated the torpedoes. The newly married couple is able to escape the sinking ship and swim to safety together.\nProduction.\nProduction censors objected to several aspects of the original script, such as the unmarried characters Charlie Allnut and Rose Sayer cohabiting the boat (as in the C. S. Forester book), and some changes were made before the film was completed. Another change followed the casting of Humphrey Bogart; his character Charlie's lines in the original screenplay were rendered with a thick Cockney dialect, but the script had to be completely rewritten because he was unwilling to attempt the accent. The rewrite made the character Canadian.\nThe film was partially financed by John and James Woolf of Romulus Films, a British company. Michael Balcon, an advisor to the National Film Finance Corporation, advised the NFFC to refuse a loan to the Woolfs unless the film starred his former Ealing Studios actors John McCallum and Googie Withers rather than Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, whom the Woolfs wanted. The Woolfs persuaded NFFC chairman Lord Reith to overrule Balcon, and the film went ahead. The Woolfs provided \u00a3250,000 and were so pleased with the completed film that they convinced John Huston to direct their next picture, \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952).\nThe cast and crew assembled in Africa in December 1950 and much of the film was shot in Lake Albert, Uganda, and in the Belgian Congo in Africa. This was rather novel for the time, especially for a Technicolor picture that used large, cumbersome \"Three-Strip\" cameras. The cast and crew endured sickness and spartan living conditions during their time on location. In the early scene in which Rose (Hepburn) plays an organ in the church, a bucket was placed off-camera in which she could vomit between takes because she was sick. Bogart later bragged that he and Huston were the only members of the cast and crew who escaped illness, which he credited to having drunk whiskey on location rather than the local water.\nAbout half of the film was shot in the UK. The scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at Worton Hall Studios in Isleworth, near London. These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa. All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also filmed in studio. A myth has grown that the scenes in the reed-filled riverbank were filmed in Dalyan, Turkey, but in her book about the filming, Hepburn stated: \"We were about to head... back to Entebbe but John [Huston] wanted to get shots of Bogie and me in the miles of high reeds before we come out into the lake...\". The sequence was shot on location in Africa and at the London studios. The shots of the German-occupied Fort Shona were all filmed at Worton Hall, where a fortress set was constructed from tubular scaffolding and covered with plaster.\nScenes on the boat were filmed using a large raft with a mockup of the boat on top. Sections of the boat set could be removed to make room for the large Technicolor camera. This proved hazardous on one occasion when the boat's boiler, a heavy copper replica, almost fell on Hepburn. It was not secured to the deck because it also had to be moved to accommodate the camera. The small steamboat used to depict the \"African Queen\" was built in 1912 in Britain for service in Africa. At one time it was owned by actor Fess Parker. The boat was restored in April 2012 and is now on display as a tourist attraction in Key Largo, Florida.\nBecause of the dangers involved with shooting the rapids scenes, a small-scale model was used in the studio tank in London. The vessel used to portray the German gunboat \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" was the steam tug \"Buganda\", owned and operated on Lake Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation. Although fictional, the was inspired by the World War I vessel (also known as ), which operated on Lake Tanganyika until she was scuttled in 1916 during the Battle for Lake Tanganyika. The British refloated the in 1924 and placed her in service on Lake Tanganyika in 1927 as the passenger ferry and she is still operating with continuing maintenance agreed in 2023.\nThe name \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" was taken from a German steam ferry that operated from Hamburg before being taken over by the on the outbreak of World War I. She was used as an auxiliary minelayer off Harwich before being sunk on 5 August 1914 by the cruiser .\nA persistent rumour holds that London's population of feral ring-necked parakeets originated from birds that escaped or were released during filming of \"The African Queen\".\nPremiere.\n\"The African Queen\" opened on December 26, 1951, at the Fox Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills in time to qualify for the 24th Academy Awards. The film opened in New York City on February 20, 1952, at the Capitol Theatre.\nReception and box office.\nContemporary critical reviews were mostly positive. Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film \"should impress for its novelty both in casting and scenically,\" and found the ending \"rather contrived and even incredible, but melodramatic enough, with almost a western accent, to be popularly effective\". Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a slick job of movie hoodwinking with a thoroughly implausible romance, set in a frame of wild adventure that is as whopping as its tale of off-beat love ... This is not noted with disfavor.\" Crowther added that \"Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills.\"\n\"Variety\" called \"The African Queen\" \"an engrossing motion picture ... Performance-wise, Bogart has never been seen to better advantage. Nor has he ever had a more knowing, talented film partner than Miss Hepburn.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" declared that \"Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart come up with a couple of remarkable performances, and it's fortunate that they do, for the movie concentrates on them so single-mindedly that any conspicuous uncertainty in their acting would have left the whole thing high and dry.\" Richard L. Coe wrote in \"The Washington Post\" that \"Huston has tried a risky trick and most of the time pulls it off in delicious style. And from both his stars he has drawn performances which have rightly been nominated for those Academy Awards on the [20th].\"\n\"Harrison's Reports\" printed a negative review, writing that the film \"has its moments of comedy and excitement, but on the whole the dialogue is childish, the action silly, and the story bereft of human appeal. The characters act as childishly as they talk, and discriminating picture-goers will, no doubt, laugh at them. There is nothing romantic about either Katharine Hepburn or Humphrey Bogart, for both look bedraggled throughout.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was also negative, writing: \"Huston seems to have been aiming at a measured, quiet, almost digressive tempo, but the material does not support it, and would have benefited by the incisiveness his previous films have shown. In spite of Hepburn's wonderful playing, and some engaging scenes, the film must be accounted a misfire.\"\nThe film earned an estimated \u00a3256,267 at UK cinemas in 1952, making it the 11th-most-popular film of the year. It earned an estimated $4 million in North American theatrical rentals and $6 million worldwide.\nOn review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 96% rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Perfectly cast, smartly written, and beautifully filmed, \"The African Queen\" remains thrilling, funny, and effortlessly absorbing even after more than half a century's worth of adventure movies borrowing liberally from its creative DNA.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 91% based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nDifferences from the novel.\nIn 1935, when the novella \"The African Queen\" by C. S. Forester was published, many British people believed that World War I was a grievous mistake that could have been avoided. In the novella, the Germans are the antagonists, not the villains, and are depicted as noble and chivalrous opponents of the British, who are likewise equally noble and honorable. The overall message of the novella was that the war was a tragedy in which decent people killed one another for unfathomable reasons and that both sides suffered equally. The British historian Antony Barker wrote that, in the book, there is a strong sense of the shared suffering of the European characters in Africa during the war including the Germans who are presented as having only a \"limited responsibility\" for the war. By contrast, when the film version of \"The African Queen\" came out in 1951, memories of the Second World War were still fresh and the German characters were far more villainous and disagreeable than in the novella. Unlike the memory of the First World War, the Second World War was remembered as a crusade against evil, which influenced the script of \"The African Queen\". In the novella, the Germans capture Rose and Charlie, but release them in a magnanimous gesture, unaware of the failed plot. In the film they also capture Rose and Charlie, but are on the verge of hanging them when the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" is sunk by the wreck of \"The African Queen\".\nIn the novella, Charlie and Rose fail in their attempt to sink the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" as the message in the book is: \"What appears to be an impossible mission for a private citizen is shown to be just that--it remains a job best left for the professionals\". The \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" is instead sunk in a lake battle by a Royal Navy gunboat as Rose and Charlie watch from the shore. The film presented the efforts of Charlie and Rose in a more favorable light as their struggle to bring \"The African Queen\" to the lake causes the sinking of the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\", and the Royal Navy gunboat does not appear in the film. In the novella, the character of Charlie was British; in the film, he becomes Canadian to accommodate Bogart's American accent. In 1915, there was a successful expedition commanded by Geoffrey Spicer-Simson where the British dragged two Royal Navy gunboats across the African wilderness to Lake Tanganyika to challenge German naval mastery of the lake, which served as the inspiration for the novella. C. S. Forester, the author of \"The African Queen\", did not focus on the story of the real life expedition\u2014which he incorporated into his novella, as the Royal Navy gunboat in the book is clearly supposed to be one of the two real life gunboats\u2014largely because of the tremendous suffering endured by the African porters who had to drag the two gunboats across the wilderness, an aspect of the expedition that Forester did not wish to dwell upon.\nDuring the campaign in East Africa, the German forces were quite ruthless in forcibly conscripting Africans to work as porters; seizing animals and food for themselves; and in carrying out a scorched earth strategy meant to deny the pursuing British forces the use of the countryside. Barker wrote that the heroic way that the crew of the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" go down fighting in the book \"cancelled\" out the brutal behavior of the German forces earlier while in the film the sinking of the \"K\u00f6nigin Luise\" is the just punishment of the German characters. Both the book and the film accurately depict the scorched earth tactics of the German \"Schutztruppe\", which had a devastating effect on the African peoples as thousands of Africans starved to death as a result of the destruction of crops and farm animals. However, the focus in both the film and the book is on the white characters, and both the film and book treat the Africans as mere extras in the story. Despite the fact that both the book and the film are set in the Great Lakes region of Africa, there are no important African characters in either the book or the film. Both the book and the film present Africa as an exotic and dangerous locale where white people have adventure and romance, with the Africans themselves just in the background.\nBoth the book and the film treat Africa as a place where it is possible to find happiness in a way that would be impossible in Europe. In both the book and the film, Rose is a prim, proper missionary from a middle class English family who is dominated by her bossy older brother Samuel, and it is during the voyage of the \"African Queen\" that she finds romance and happiness with Charlie along with the courage to assert herself. In the book, Charlie is a coarse and somewhat disreputable working class Cockney who marries a middle class woman that he would be unlikely to marry in England. The film changes Charlie into a Canadian, but has the same message that a working class man is able to marry a middle class woman that he would be unlikely to marry in a place other than Africa. In the book, it is strongly implied that Rose and Charlie are engaged in a sexual relationship before marriage, an aspect of the book that was toned down in the film because of the Hays Code, which forbade any depiction of a pre-marital sexual relationship. Unlike the book which was a straight adventure story, the film borrows much from American romantic comedies of the 1930s-1940s which portray a \"battle of the sexes\" that ends with a man and a woman finding love on the basis of \"equality and symmetry\". The book is set in a thinly disguised version of Lake Tanganyika, on whose eastern shores was the colony of German East Africa (modern Tanzania), but the parts of the film shot on location were filmed in the Belgian Congo (modern Democratic Republic of the Congo) because director Huston had heard that the Belgian Congo was better for hunting elephants.\nAccolades.\nOthers.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nAFI has also honored both Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn as the greatest American screen legends.\nSubsequent releases.\nThe film was released on Region 2 DVD in the United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The British DVD includes a theatrical trailer and an audio commentary by cinematographer Jack Cardiff in which he details many of the hardships and challenges involved in filming in Africa.\nPrior to 2010, the film had been released in the United States on VHS video, LaserDisc and as a Region 1 DVD.\n2009 digital restoration.\nIn 2009, Paramount Pictures (the current owner of the film's American rights) completed restoration work for Region 1, and a 4K digitally restored version from the original camera negative was issued on DVD and Blu-ray on March 23, 2010. The film was restored with its original mono soundtrack from original UK film elements under the sole supervision of Paramount, and had as an extra a documentary on the film's production, \"Embracing Chaos: The Making of The African Queen\". Romulus Films and international-rights holder ITV Studios were acknowledged in the restoration credits.\nITV released the restoration in Region 2 on June 14, 2010.\nAdaptations in other media.\n\"The African Queen\" was adapted as a one-hour Lux Radio Theater play on December 15, 1952. Bogart reprised his film role and was joined by Greer Garson. This broadcast is included as a bonus CD in the commemorative box-set version of the Paramount DVD.\nThe March 26, 1962 episode of \"The Dick Powell Theater\", titled \"Safari\", was based on the story, with James Coburn and Glynis Johns in the lead roles.\nA 1977 television film continued the adventures of Charlie and Rose, with Warren Oates and Mariette Hartley in the lead roles. Though intended as the pilot for a series, it was not picked up. An elliptic commentary on the making of \"The African Queen\" can be found in the 1990 film \"White Hunter Black Heart\", directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\"The African Queen\" partially inspired the Jungle Cruise attraction at Disneyland. Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the film frequently in his ideas, and his designs for the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film.\nThe \"African Queen\".\nOne of the two boats used as the \"African Queen\" is actually the 35-foot (10 m) L.S. \"Livingston\", which had been a working diesel boat for 40 years; the steam engine was a prop and the real diesel engine was hidden under stacked crates of gin and other cargo. Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast Jim Hendricks Sr. purchased the boat in 1982 in Key Largo, Florida. After falling into a state of disrepair following Hendricks' 2001 death, the ship was discovered rusting in a Florida marina in 2012 by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband Lance. The couple repaired and refurbished the ailing ship and made it available to tourists and film enthusiasts, providing cruises around the Florida Keys.\nReferences.\nSpecific.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film features Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), who has partnered with Dr. Sandra Mornay (Lenore Aubert) in order to find a brain to reactivate Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange), and they find Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello), the ideal candidate.\nThe film was developed and production started with misgivings by Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who disliked the script. Barton faced difficulty during the production of the film, with Abbott and Costello often absent from the set. However, the film was successful at the box office and became one of Universal's top films of the year. Several follow-up films ensued involving Abbott and Costello meeting other horror film actors and monsters. The film was mostly well received by critics on its release and in 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry; it also placed at number 56 on the list of the American Film Institute's 100 Funniest American Movies.\nPlot.\nLarry Talbot makes an urgent phone call to a railway station in Florida, where Chick Young and Wilbur Grey work as baggage clerks. Talbot tries to warn Wilbur of a shipment due to arrive for \"McDougal's House of Horrors\". However, before he finishes, the moon rises and Talbot transforms into a werewolf, causing Wilbur to think the call is a prank. Meanwhile, McDougal demands the crates be personally delivered to his wax museum.\nChick and Wilbur deliver the crates after hours. They open the first one and find Dracula's coffin. When Chick leaves the room to retrieve the second crate, Wilbur reads the Dracula legend and the coffin suddenly opens, and Dracula sneaks out. Wilbur is so frightened he can barely articulate his call for help. When Chick returns, he refuses to believe the story. The boys open the second crate, and Chick goes to greet McDougal. Dracula hypnotizes Wilbur, finds Frankenstein's Monster in the second crate, and reanimates him. Both leave and McDougal finds the crates empty and has Wilbur and Chick arrested.\nThat night, Dr Sandra Mornay welcomes Dracula and the Monster to her island castle. Sandra has seduced Wilbur as part of Dracula's plan to give the monster a more obedient brain. Meanwhile, Wilbur and Chick are bailed out of jail by Joan Raymond, an undercover insurance investigator who feigns love for Wilbur, hoping to gain information. Wilbur invites Joan to a masquerade ball that evening. Talbot takes the apartment across the hall from Wilbur and Chick and asks them to help him find and destroy Dracula and the Monster. Wilbur agrees, but Chick remains sceptical.\nWilbur, Chick and Joan go to Sandra's castle to pick her up for the ball. Wilbur answers a telephone call from Talbot, who informs them that they are in fact in the \"House of Dracula\". Wilbur reluctantly agrees to search the castle and soon stumbles upon a basement staircase, where he has a few close encounters with the monsters. Meanwhile, Joan discovers Dr Frankenstein's notebook in Sandra's desk, and Sandra finds an Insurance Investigator ID in Joan's purse.\nDracula, under the alias of Dr Lejos, introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle and attending the ball is the na\u00efve Professor Stevens, who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur says that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells the others to attend the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that she feels they are not safe to conduct the experiment. Dracula then turns her into a vampire.\nAt the masquerade ball, Talbot accuses Lejos of being Dracula, but no one takes him seriously. Joan soon disappears. Sandra lures Wilbur into the woods and attempts to bite him, but fails. While looking for Joan, Talbot becomes the Wolfman and attacks McDougal. Since Chick's costume is a wolf, McDougal accuses Chick, who escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur, Stevens, and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot meet up in the bayou and set out to rescue Wilbur and Joan.\nWilbur is quickly freed, but Dracula uses hypnotism to call him back. As Sandra prepares to cut into Wilbur's brain, Talbot and Chick burst in. Chick knocks out Sandra with a chair and Talbot tries to release Wilbur but turns into the Wolfman again. Frankenstein's Monster breaks free of his bonds and Sandra tries to control him, but he throws her out the window. After a chase through the house between Chick, Wilbur and the Monster and a face-off between Dracula and The Wolf Man, Dracula transforms into a bat but is pounced on by the Wolfman, who drags the two of them to their deaths. Chick and Wilbur escape in boats; while Joan and Stevens set the pier ablaze while the Monster is standing on it, and he dies in the flames.\nWilbur scolds Chick for his earlier scepticism, and Chick remarks they have nothing to fear now. The Invisible Man addresses them from the boat's thwart, and they jump into the water in terror.\nCast.\nCast adapted from the American Film Institute:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Bud Abbott as Chick Young\nProduction.\nBackground and development.\nOn November 28, 1945, Universal Pictures joined with British entrepreneur J. Arthur Rank, who bought a one-fourth interest in the studio. In 1946, Universal reported a profit of only $4.6\u00a0million. They responded by dropping many actors from their contract roster, including Chaney. On July 31, 1946, an official merger began. The company, now called Universal\u2013International, had only Deanna Durbin, Maria Montez, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello and a few other actors remaining on their payroll. Since the February 1941 release of \"Buck Privates\" starring Abbott and Costello, the duo were among the most powerful stars at Universal. By 1945 however, the duo were close to splitting due to in-fighting with each other and personal issues; Abbott suffered from severe epilepsy and Costello had nearly died of rheumatic heart disease in 1943.\nIn their first year of operation, the studio nearly went bankrupt. By 1948, William Goetz had been in charge of production since the merger and Abbott and Costello's popularity was waning. According to director Charles Barton, who was among the top comedy film directors at Universal between 1945 and 1952, Goetz did not want anything to do with Abbott and Costello after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had dropped their option for more films and Camel Cigarettes dropped their radio show in 1947.\nPreproduction.\nRobert Arthur, a former writer and associate producer of MGM musicals along with veteran Abbott and Costello writers Frederic Rinaldo and Robert Lees, developed a script that involved Frankenstein's monster, Count Dracula and the Wolf Man. Their original script also included Kharis the Mummy, Dracula's son Count Alucard and the Invisible Man, and involved the Monster becoming Dracula's slave and the search for the brain of a simpleton to be placed into the Monster's body. Kharis and Alucard were dropped from the script and the Invisible Man was only included as a small gag at the end of the film. On reading the script, initially titled \"The Brain of Frankenstein\", Lou Costello responded negatively, stating \"You don't think I'll do that crap do you? My 5-year-old daughter can write something better than that\". \"Variety\" made the first public announcement of \"The Brain of Frankenstein\" in July 1947.\nArthur felt strongly about the project and offered Costello a $50,000 advance on his percentage if he agreed to do the film. Among the cast was Glenn Strange, who had previously played the Monster in \"House of Dracula\" (1945). Strange had only been in a handful of roles since that film, including Monogram's \"Beauty and the Bandit\" (1946), Eagle-Lion's \"Frontier Fighters\" (1947) and two for Universal: \"Brute Force\" (1947) and another Abbott and Costello film, \"The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap\" (1947). Other actors were called back to reprise roles from previous Universal horror films, including Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. Chaney had been doing stage work on \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"Born Yesterday\". Returning as Dracula was Bela Lugosi, who had not worked in a Hollywood studio since 1946 with \"Scared to Death\". Universal-International had Lugosi, Chaney and Strange sign their contracts for the film on January 16, 1948. Lugosi spoke positively about the role during production, glad that the script was not \"unbecoming to Dracula's dignity\" and that \"all I have to do is frighten the boys, a perfectly appropriate activity. My trademark will be unblemished\".\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"All three of the 'monsters' were the nicest. The \"real\" monsters were Abbott and Costello\".\n- Charles Barton, director of \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\"\nProduction began on February 5, 1948. According to Barton, Abbott and Costello were not happy with working on the project, noting that the two would \"fight me like hell. But I stood my ground with them, and so did Bob Arthur\". Barton continued that both the comedians would leave home several times during shooting the film, not show up, or spend about three days playing cards on set. Abbott and Costello improvised some dialogue in the film. Other script alterations were made in the film, such as a week within shooting when producer Robert Arthur decided to change the ending of the film to include a cameo by the Invisible Man.\nThe film had a new make-up department instead of the old one headed by Jack Pierce. Emile LaVigne tended to Chaney's make-up while Jack Kevan worked on Glenn Strange. Both Chaney and Strange required one hour each in the make-up chair each morning, although Strange's make-up was mostly a rubber mask.\nAn accident happened on set when Strange was supposed to throw Lenore Aubert through a window. An invisible wire was attached to her to help Strange lift her, but when she was thrown, she swung back into camera range. Strange tried to catch her, causing him to fall and break his foot. As Strange's injury was being treated, Chaney took to applying the make-up and portrayed the monster throwing Aubert through the window. By the end of February, the film's title had changed to one closer resembling its final release title. Filming completed on March 20, 1948. A new scene was filmed after production wrapped with Jane Randolph on April 9.\nPost-production started immediately on the film. Frank Skinner, who had previously scored \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939) and worked on the score of \"The Wolf Man\", (1941) composed the original score for the film. Some effect shots were filmed in late March. Special effects for the film were developed by David Horsley and Jerome Ash and included the bats that could be seen in the eyes of Miss Aubert and the animation that transformed Lugosi into a bat.\nRelease.\nContemporary sources vary on the first release of \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\". The AFI Catalog of Feature Films and Rhodes book \"No Traveller Returns\" declare it was released on June 15, 1948, with no information on when or where this release took place. Historian Gregory W. Mank has stated in three separate books that the film premiered in Los Angeles at the Forum Theatre on June 25, 1948. Earliest reviews of the film appear in publications such as \"Variety\" and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" only on June 28, 1948. Universal-International also did not copyright the film until August 1948.\nThe film went on to become the most successful film in the \"Frankenstein\" series since the original release of \"Frankenstein\" (1931). Along with \"The Naked City\" (1948) and \"Tap Roots\" (1948), it became one of Universal-International's highest grossing features of the year. To promote the film, Universal paid Boris Karloff's New York hotel bill to pose outside of Loew's Criterion Theatre in New York. Karloff agreed, stating \"as long as I don't have to see the movie!\" Box office was particularly strong in New York City, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. According to \"Variety\" the film earned $2.2 million in the US in 1948.\nIt was initially banned in British Columbia and then later allowed for release after most of the scenes involving the Wolf Man were removed. On the film's release in Australia, nearly all the scenes with a monster were removed. In England, the film was released as \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Ghosts\". The film was reissued on March 23, 1956, on a double-bill with \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff\".\nHome media.\nOn the film's release on Laserdisc, Douglas Pratt, author of \"The Laser Video Disc Companion\" described the disc as \"highly sought after\" as only a few hundred copies were issued (MCA DiscoVision label release among the first videodisc titles produced in 1978). It was reissued as an Encore Edition afterwards. It was first released on DVD on August 29, 2000, and was re-released several times as part of different Abbott and Costello collections, \"The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Three\", on August 3, 2004, on October 28, 2008, as part of \"Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection\", and in 2015 in the \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters Collection\". The film's Blu-ray debut and DVD re-release was on September 4, 2012, as part of Universal's 100th Anniversary series. It was also included in \"Frankenstein: Complete Legacy Collection\" (2014) along with seven other Universal Frankenstein films. Because this film includes characters and people featured in their own collections, it is part of the legacy collections of \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"The Wolf Man\", and \"The Best of Abbott and Costello\".\nReception.\nFrom contemporary reviews, trade papers praised the film. A review in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" proclaimed it as a \"crazy giddy show\" noting that \"Robert Arthur's production spells out showmanship right down the line, and Charles T. Barton's direction keeps things moving at a lively, vigorous pace\". \"Variety\" echoed this praise, stating that Arthur and Barton \"can chalk it up as one of the best for [Abbott and Costello]\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Philip K. Scheuer praised the film as \"put together with enormous ingenuity. Its comic inventiveness seldom falters, yet it never seriously violates the tradition of the three celebrated creatures who are its antagonists\". The reviews continued to be positive from other industry press papers, including \"Film Daily\", \"Daily Variety\", \"Harrison's Reports\", and \"Motion Picture Daily\". On the film's release in New York City's Lowe's Criterion Theatre, the film predominantly received negative reviews from the Manhattan critics. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that he found the idea of the film amusing but ultimately found it to be an \"assembly-line comedy\". The \"New York Sun\" found the story was a \"grand idea, but it was too bad that it could have been attended by persons capable of satire rather than pie-throwing comedy only\". A review from \"New York World-Telegram\" warned audiences that if they did not have the palate for Abbott and Costello's comedy the film would be a \"painful experience\". The negative response to the film in New York made a review in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" refer to the New York critics as \"the \"BOO-geymen of Broadway\". One positive mention in New York came from the \"New York Star\", which declared that \"it's heart-warming to see all our favorite monsters once more, each inexorably expressing his individuality, all at the same time. It's kind of like a class reunion. They look a little older now, and a little tired. Dracula seems to creak a bit with arthritis as he emerges from his coffin these days, but his bite has lost some of its depth\".\nFrom retrospective reviews, Carlos Clarens wrote about the monster rally films, such as \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) and \"House of Dracula\", in his book \"An Illustrated History of the Horror Film\" (1967) summarizing that \"the sole charm of these films resides in the very proficient contract players that populated them\", but by the time of \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" was released, the film's \"unconscious parody finally gave way to deliberate spoof\" and, at this point, \"Universal was flogging a dead horse\".\nA later review from Kim Newman writing for \"Empire\" described it as not one of Abbott and Costello's better films, finding they do a lot of \"whining and slapping business\". Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" stated similar reactions, noting that Abbott and Costello \"never got the hang of the kiddie slapstick Universal assigned to them\" and that the film was \"probably the last of their watchable films, though it's a long way from their best\". On reviewing Abbott and Costello's output at Universal in 2010, Nick Pinkerton in \"Sight &amp; Sound\" summarized that the duo's work was an \"all-or-nothing proposition, something you either take or leave\" and that described the duo's general reception, finding them \"stuck somewhere beneath Laurel and Hardy and just above, say, the Ritz Brothers.\"\nLegacy.\nFollowing the success of the film, Universal-International paired Abbott and Costello in similar scenarios. The first was \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff\" (1949), followed by \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man\" (1951), \"Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1953), and their last film for Universal: \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy\" (1955). The duo only made one more film afterwards, \"Dance with Me, Henry\" (1956), which was directed by Barton and made for United Artists.\nLon Chaney Jr. did not have positive things to say about the feature, later proclaiming that he \"used to enjoy horror films when there was thought and sympathy involved. Then they became comedies. Abbott and Costello ruined the horror films: they made buffoons out of the monsters...\"\nKim Newman declared that \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\", unlike that of \"House of Frankenstein\" and \"House of Dracula\", set a precedent that in films where there are multiple monsters, Dracula will be their leader. This plot element would be replicated in later films such as \"The Monster Squad\" (1987), \"The Creeps\" (1997), \"Van Helsing\" (2004), \"Hotel Transylvania\" (2012) and \"Monster Family\" (2017).\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed this film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, The film is number 56 on the list of the American Film Institute's \"100 Funniest American Movies\".\nJerry Garcia, of The Grateful Dead, acknowledged the movie as one that \"changed my life\" and was an inspiration for his art and music.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as married lawyers who come to oppose each other in court. Judy Holliday co-stars as the third lead in her second credited movie role. Also featured are Tom Ewell, David Wayne, and Jean Hagen. The music was composed by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, and the song \"Farewell, Amanda\" was written by Cole Porter.\nThe film was well received upon its release and is considered a classic romantic comedy. It ranked at No. 22 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list. In 1992, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDoris Attinger follows her husband with a gun in Manhattan one day, suspecting he is having an affair with another woman. In her rage, she fires wildly and blindly around the room and at the couple multiple times. One of the bullets hits her husband in the shoulder. His lover escapes unscathed.\nThe following morning, the married New York lawyers Adam and Amanda Bonner read about the incident in the newspaper. Adam is an assistant district attorney, while Amanda is a solo-practicing defense attorney. They argue over the case. Amanda sympathizes with the woman, particularly noting the double standard that exists for men and women regarding adultery. Adam thinks Doris is guilty of attempted murder. When Adam arrives at work, he learns that he has been assigned to prosecute the case. When Amanda hears this, she seeks out Doris and becomes her defense lawyer.\nAmanda bases her case on the belief that women and men are equal, and that Doris had been forced into the situation by her husband's adultery and emotional and physical abuse. Adam thinks Amanda is showing contempt for the law, since there should never be any excuse for such criminal behavior. Tension increasingly builds at home as the two battle each other in court. The situation comes to a head as Adam feels humiliated during the trial when Amanda encourages one of her witnesses, a woman weightlifter, to lift him overhead. Later at home that evening, Adam still angry, gives Amanda an earful; he doesn't want to be married to a liberated \"new woman.\" Having just packed his bags, he storms out of their apartment. When the verdict is returned, Amanda's plea to the jury to \"judge this case as you would if the sexes were reversed\" proves successful, and Doris is acquitted.\nThat night, Adam, who has left their upper-floor apartment, looks through its window and sees the silhouettes of his wife Amanda and their neighbor Kip Lurie, a popular singer, songwriter and piano player who has shown a keen interest in Amanda all along, and repeatedly taunted Adam, as the two of them seem to be dancing and drinking together. Adam breaks into the apartment enraged, pointing a gun at the pair. Amanda is horrified and says to Adam, \"You've no right to do this\u00a0\u2013 nobody does!\" Adam feels he has proven his point about the injustice of Amanda's line of defense. He puts the gun in his mouth, as Amanda and Kip scream in terror. Then Adam bites a large piece off the gun and chews it. It is made of licorice. Amanda is furious with this prank and a three-way fight ensues.\nNow in the midst of a divorce, Adam and Amanda reluctantly reunite for a meeting with their tax accountant. Going through their expenses for the year, they talk about their relationship in the past tense. They talk about the farm they own and recall burning the mortgage. Tears begin to roll down Adam's cheeks. Astonished and touched, Amanda gently bundles her sobbing husband out of the office and to the farm. That night, Adam announces that he has been selected as the Republican nominee for County Court Judge. Amanda jokes about running for the post as the Democratic candidate. Adam says it would make him cry and demonstrates how easily he can turn on the tears, remarking that men can use crocodile tears to manipulate people too. Amanda says there really isn't any difference between the sexes as Adam jumps in bed and closes the curtains, exclaiming otherwise.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe screenplay was written specifically as a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle (their sixth film together) by Garson Kanin and actress Ruth Gordon, married script writers who were friends of the couple. Kanin claimed that Judy Holliday initially declined her role because her character is called \"fatso\" in the script. According to Kanin, the story of \"Adam's Rib\" was based on the lives of Gordon's friends Dorothy and William Dwight Whitney, and of actor Raymond Massey. The Whitneys were married lawyers who represented opposing sides in Massey's high-profile divorce from actress Adrienne Allen before pursuing their own divorce in order to marry their clients from the Massey case. Kanin and Gordon saw great potential in the idea of married lawyers as adversaries, and the plot for \"Adam's Rib\" was developed. Other titles for the film were \"Love is Legal\" and \"Man and Wife\". The MGM front office quickly vetoed the latter as dangerously indiscreet.\nKanin also recalled that Cole Porter refused to write a song for Madelaine, as Hepburn's character was originally named, but proceeded when the character's name was changed to Amanda. The change allowed Porter to quickly revise a tune he had written during his 1940 adventure in the South Pacific and later discarded as mediocre \u2014 \"So Long, Samoa.\" In June 1949, \"Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that Porter and MGM agreed to donate all profits from the song, rechristened \"Farewell, Amanda,\" to the Runyon Cancer Fund.\nAlthough set in New York, \"Adam's Rib\" was filmed mainly on MGM's stages in Culver City, California. However, location shooting occurred in various parts of New York City, including at the Women's House of Detention where Doris Attinger is imprisoned after shooting her husband, and at Gordon and Kanin's farm in Connecticut.\nHepburn and Kanin encouraged Judy Holliday to play the role of Doris, and Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn considered her performance a screen test for the lead role in the planned film adaptation of Kanin's play \"Born Yesterday,\" in which Holliday had starred during its Broadway run. Receiving positive notices for \"Adam's Rib\", Holliday was cast in the \"Born Yesterday\" film, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nReception.\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $2,971,000 in the US and Canada and $976,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $826,000.\nVariety staff reviewing the film on December 31, 1949, praised the \"...bright comedy success, belting over a succession of sophisticated laughs...This is the sixth Metro teaming of Tracy and Hepburn, and their approach to marital relations around their own hearth is delightfully saucy.

{"id": "68085", "revid": "191875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68085", "title": "Conifer", "text": "Group of seed plants\nConifers () are a group of seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms. They are mainly evergreen trees with a regular branching pattern, reproducing with male and female cones, usually on the same tree. They are wind-pollinated and the seeds are usually dispersed by the wind. \nScientifically, they make up the division Pinophyta, also known as Coniferae. All extant conifers except for the Gnetophytes are perennial woody plants with secondary growth. There are over 600 living species.\nConifers first appear in the fossil record over 300 million years ago in the Carboniferous. They became dominant land plants in the Mesozoic, until flowering plants took over many ecosystems in the Cretaceous. Many conifers today are relict species, surviving in a small part of their former ranges. Such relicts include \"Wollemia\", known only from a small area of Australia, and \"Metasequoia glyptostroboides\", known from Cretaceous fossils and surviving in a small area of China.\nAlthough the total number of species is relatively small, conifers are ecologically important. They are the dominant plants over the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere. Boreal conifers have multiple adaptations to survive winters, including a conical shape to shed snow, strong tracheid vessels to tolerate ice pressure, and a waxy covering on the needle leaves to minimise water loss. Several fungi form ectomycorrhizal associations with conifers. Other fungi cause diseases such as needle cast, especially harmful to young trees. Conifers are affected by pest insects such as wood-boring longhorn beetles and by bark beetles, which make galleries just under the bark. Conifers are of great economic value for timber and paper production.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe earliest conifers appear in the fossil record during the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) over 300 million years ago. Conifers are thought to be most closely related to the Cordaitales\",\" a group of extinct Carboniferous-Permian trees and clambering plants whose reproductive structures had some similarities to those of conifers. The most primitive conifers belong to the paraphyletic assemblage of \"walchian conifers\", which were small trees, and probably originated in dry upland habitats. The range of conifers expanded during the Early Permian (Cisuralian) to lowlands due to increasing aridity. Walchian conifers were gradually replaced by more advanced voltzialean or \"transition\" conifers. Conifers were largely unaffected by the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, and were dominant land plants of the Mesozoic era. Modern groups of conifers emerged from the Voltziales during the Late Permian through Jurassic. Conifers underwent a major decline in the Late Cretaceous corresponding to the explosive adaptive radiation of flowering plants.\nRelict species.\nSeveral extant conifers have relict taxon status, surviving in small areas or in very small numbers where they once may have been common and widespread. One such is \"Wollemia nobilis\", discovered in 1994 in some narrow, steep-sided, sandstone gorges in Australia. The wild population consisted of under 60 adult trees with essentially no genetic variability, implying a genetic bottleneck some thousands of years ago. The extant gnetophytes consist of three relict genera, namely \"Ephedra\", \"Gnetum\", and \"Welwitschia\". Fossils definitely of the group date back to the Late Jurassic, with many species in the Cretaceous. Conifers as a whole, too, declined markedly after the angiosperms (flowering plants) diversified during the Cretaceous, coming to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems. Many conifer species became extinct, leaving 30 out of 80 genera with just one extant species, and 11 more with just two or three species. The popular phrase \"living fossils\" could, the Dutch botanist Aljos Farjon states, fittingly be applied to many of these. Thus, \"Metasequoia glyptostroboides\", the dawn redwood, is known from fossils of Late Cretaceous and Miocene age, and was found also as an extant tree with a small relict range in China.\nExternal phylogeny.\nThe cladogram summarizes the group's external phylogeny. The conifers are gymnosperms, sister to a clade consisting of the ginkgos and cycads. \nInternal phylogeny.\nThe Gnetophyta, despite their distinct appearances, were long viewed as outside the conifer group, but phylogenomic analysis indicates that they are part of the conifer clade, sister to the pine family (the 'gnepine' hypothesis). If so, the gnetophytes once shared the distinctive characters of the conifers, and have lost them. The cladogram summarizes the conifers' internal phylogeny: \nTaxonomy.\nThe name \"conifer\", meaning 'cone-bearing', derives from Latin (cone) and (to bear). As recently as 1999, the botanist Aljos Farjon wrote that while the Coniferae had up to the early 20th century been considered \"a natural family\", comparable to the Rosaceae, he doubted that the conifers or the gymnosperms formed natural groups (clades). By 2016, the conifers were recognised as a clade, with six families (not including the gnetophytes), 65\u201370 genera, and over 600 living species (c.\u20092002). Depending on interpretation, the Cephalotaxaceae may or may not be included within the Taxaceae, while some authors recognize Phyllocladaceae as distinct from Podocarpaceae. The family Taxodiaceae is here included in the family Cupressaceae.\nDescription.\nAll living conifers (except the gnetophytes) are woody plants, and most are trees with narrow leaves, often needle-like. There are separate male and female reproductive structures, the cones. Pollination is always by wind; the seeds are mostly winged. The trees have a regular branching pattern. Many conifers have distinctly scented resin.\nThe world's tallest and oldest living trees are conifers. The tallest is a coast redwood (\"Sequoia sempervirens\"), with a height of . Among the smallest conifers is the pygmy pine (\"Lepidothamnus laxifolius\") of New Zealand, which is seldom taller than 30 cm when mature. The oldest non-clonal living tree is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (\"Pinus longaeva\"), 4,700 years old.\nBoreal conifers have multiple adaptations to survive winters, including the tree's conical shape to shed snow, strong tracheid vessels to tolerate ice pressure, and a waxy covering on the needle leaves to minimise water loss.\nFoliage.\nMost conifers are evergreens. In many species such as pines, firs, and cedars, the leaves are long, thin and needle-like. Others like cypresses have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, the exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 or 4. In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as \"Abies grandis\", the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2 mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400 mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache pine, \"Pinus engelmannii\"). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from lower latitudes with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish pine \"Pinus brutia\") often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, \"Picea pungens\") may develop blue or silvery leaves to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves remain on the plant for several (2\u201340) years before falling, but five genera (\"Larix\", \"Pseudolarix\", \"Glyptostrobus\", \"Metasequoia\" and \"Taxodium\") are deciduous, shedding their leaves in autumn. The seedlings of some conifers, including pines, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different from the typical adult leaves.\nWood.\nConifer wood consists of two types of cells: parenchyma, which have an oval or polyhedral shape, and strongly elongated tracheids. Tracheids make up more than 90% of timber volume. The tracheids of earlywood formed at the beginning of a growing season have large radial sizes and smaller, thinner cell walls. Then, the first tracheids of the transition zone are formed, where the radial size of cells and the thickness of their cell walls changes considerably. Finally, latewood tracheids are formed, with small radial sizes and greater cell wall thickness. This is the basic pattern of the internal cell structure of conifer tree rings.\nReproduction.\nConifers produce their seeds inside a protective cone called a strobilus. Most species are monoecious, with male and female cones on the same tree. All conifers are wind-pollinated. In conifers such as pines, the cones are woody, and when mature the scales usually spread open allowing the seeds, which are often winged, to fall out and be dispersed by the wind. In others such as firs and cedars, the cones disintegrate to release the seeds. \nSome conifers produce nut-like seeds, such as pine nuts, which are dispersed by birds, in particular, nutcrackers, and jays, which break up the cones.\nIn fire-adapted pines such as \"Pinus radiata\", the seeds may be stored in closed cones for many years, being released only when a fire opens the cones.\nIn families such as Taxaceae, the cone scales are much modified as edible arils, resembling berries. These are eaten by fruit-eating birds, which then pass the seeds in their droppings.\nLife cycle.\nConifers are heterosporous, generating two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. These spores develop on separate male and female sporophylls on separate male and female cones, usually on the same tree. \nIn the male cones, microspores are produced from microsporocytes by meiosis. The microspores develop into pollen grains, which contain the male (micro)gametophytes. Large amounts of pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some pollen grains land on female cones, pollinating them. The generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis, leading to the development of the pollen tube. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells unites its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of an egg cell. \nThe female cone develops two ovules, each of which contains haploid megaspores. A megasporocyte is divided by meiosis in each ovule. The female gametophytes grow to produce two or more haploid eggs. The fertilized egg, the (diploid) zygote, gives rise to the embryo, and a seed is produced. The female cone then opens, releasing the seeds which grow into seedlings. Some seedlings survive to grow into trees. \nConifer reproduction is synchronous with seasonal changes in temperate zones. Reproductive development slows to a halt during each winter season and then resumes each spring. The male strobilus development is completed in a single year. Conifers have one of three reproductive cycles that differ in the time to complete female strobilus development from initiation to seed maturation. The cycle is one year in genera such as \"Abies\", \"Picea\", \"Cedrus\", and \"Tsuga\"; two years in most pine species and in \"Sequoiadendron\"; and three years in three pine species including \"Pinus pinea\". All three types have a long gap between pollination and fertilization.\nDistribution and ecology.\nConifers are the dominant plants over the taiga forest of the Northern Hemisphere, forming the world's largest terrestrial biome. The taiga consists mainly of larches, pines, and spruces. Larch is the most common tree in Russia, and by volume of timber, easily the most abundant tree genus worldwide. The larch species \"Larix gmelinii\" is the world's most northerly-growing tree, at 75\u00b0 north in the Taymyr Peninsula. Conifers are widespread also in southern Europe, the Middle East, the Himalayas, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Conifers are not confined to the Northern Hemisphere: around 200 conifer species live only in the tropics, and others live in Australasia, Africa (including Madagascar), and Central and South America. Species richness decreases with latitude; a northern country like Canada has just 9 species, whereas Mexico has 43, and the tropical island of New Caledonia has 42 endemic species.\nSince conifers cannot regrow their leaves rapidly like hardwoods, leaf diseases can seriously damage coniferous plantations, especially dense stands of young trees. Needle cast diseases, often caused by ascomycete fungi in the Rhytismataceae family, result in leaf fall. Another ascomycete, \"Rhizosphaera\" (Sphaeropsidales), causes severe defoliation and shoot blight, for instance in spruces.\nAt least 20 species of roundheaded wood-boring longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) feed on the wood of spruces, firs, and hemlocks. Bark beetles (Scolytinae, in the Curculionidae) are destructive pests of commercial forestry; major pests of spruce and other conifers include \"Ips typographus\" in Eurasia and \"Dendroctonus rufipennis\" in North America.\nThe basidiomycete fungus \"Boletus pinophilus\" is among the fungi that form an ectomycorrhizal association with conifers, in its case with pines such as \"Pinus sylvestris\". \nSome conifers introduced for forestry including \"Pinus radiata\" have become invasive species in New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia. \nEconomic importance.\nThe softwood derived from conifers is more easily worked than hardwood from broadleaved (angiosperm) trees. This makes it widely used and of great economic value, its many uses including construction, furniture, telegraph poles and fencing. A large part of production is used for paper. In the United Kingdom, the 48% of the woodland that is coniferous yields over 90% of the timber; the top species is sitka spruce, yielding about half of the timber produced. Worldwide, wood products reached a value of $100 billion by the end of the 20th century.\nConifers such as fir, cedar, cypress, juniper, spruce, pine, yew and false cedar have been selected by plant breeders for ornamental purposes. Plants with unusual growth habits, sizes, and colours are propagated and planted in parks and gardens throughout the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fields\nThe Bank Dick, released as The Bank Detective in the United Kingdom, is a 1940 American comedy film starring W. C. Fields. Set in Lompoc, California, Fields plays Egbert Sous\u00e9, a drunk who accidentally thwarts a bank robbery and ends up a bank security guard as a result.\nThe film was written by Fields, using the alias Mahatma Kane Jeeves (derived from the Broadway drawing-room comedy clich\u00e9 \"My hat, my cane, Jeeves!\"), and directed by Edward F. Cline. The film also stars Una Merkel, Richard Purcell, Shemp Howard, Franklin Pangborn, Grady Sutton, Jessie Ralph and Cora Witherspoon.\nIn 1992, \"The Bank Dick\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nIn a somewhat frowsy home in Lompoc, hard-drinking, henpecked family man, Egbert Sous\u00e9 has strained relations with his slattern wife and waspish mother-in-law over his drinking, smoking and habit of taking money from the piggy bank of his youngest daughter, Elsie Mae and replacing it with IOUs. Sous\u00e9 prefers to spend his days reading detective stories and patronizing his favorite saloon, the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9, run by Joe Guelpe. Sous\u00e9 is on his way to the saloon when Elsie Mae bounces a ketchup bottle off of his head; Sous\u00e9 attempts to hit her with a potted palm tree but is interrupted when his eldest daughter Myrtle introduces him to Og Oggilby, her fianc\u00e9, who is employed as a bank teller.\nAt the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9, film producer Mackley Q Greene is vexed when A. Pismo Clam, the director of a movie being filmed in town, goes on a bender. When Sous\u00e9 brags about having directed silent film comedians, Greene offers him the directing job. Later, the Lompoc Bank where Og works, is robbed and Sous\u00e9 is mistakenly credited with catching Loudmouth McNasty, one of the two robbers. Mr. Skinner, the president of the bank, rewards Sous\u00e9 by giving him a job as the bank's \"special officer,\" a bank detective (\"dick\").\nBack at the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9, a swindler named J. Frothingham Waterbury cons Sous\u00e9 into investing in a questionable mining operation. Sous\u00e9 convinces Og to borrow (steal) $500 from the bank to buy the stock; expecting to receive his annual bonus in four days, Og intends to return the borrowed money, but bank examiner J. Pinkerton Snoopington arrives unexpectedly to immediately audit the books. In an attempt to prevent the audit, Sous\u00e9 invites Snoopington to the Black Pussy Cat, where he has Joe slip him a mickey. Immediately, Snoopington becomes deathly ill and\nSous\u00e9 helps the inebriated bank examiner back to his hotel room where he telephones Dr. Stall, a quack, who examines Snoopington and advises three days of bed rest. Still feeling extremely ill the following day, Snoopington is determined to do his duty and he returns to the bank to proceed with the audit. Og faints when he sees the examiner and Sous\u00e9 again tries to delay the audit by breaking Snoopington's eyeglasses.\nWaterbury the swindler reads in the newspaper that Og's mine has struck it rich. He returns to the bank and offers to buy back the \"worthless\" stock from Og; but Sous\u00e9 also reads the same news story and slugs Waterbury, knocking him through a window. Og, suddenly wealthy, is no longer worried about the audit and he agrees to split the money with Sous\u00e9; however, the escaped bank robber, Repulsive Rogan returns to rob the bank a second time, taking Sous\u00e9 hostage and escaping with the bank's money and Og's mining-company stock. Rogan forces Sous\u00e9 to drive the getaway car and they are followed in another car by the police, the bank president, Og and Greene. A frantic chase ensues as the getaway car, with Sous\u00e9 at the wheel, narrowly avoids several accidents and continually falls apart. Rogan attempts to jump from the disintegrating car but is knocked unconscious by a low-hanging tree branch. Sous\u00e9 once again receives the credit for catching the crook and receives a $5,000 reward for the capture of Rogan, $10,000 from producer Mackley Q. Greene for his screen story and a contract to direct a film based on it.\nNow an affluent man, Sous\u00e9 lives in a mansion with his family, all of whom now dress and speak with refinement and treat him with respect, believing he has changed; but each morning at nine o'clock, Sous\u00e9 continues to leave the house and follows Joe Guelpe to spend the day at the \"office\" - the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* W.C. Fields as Egbert Sous\u00e9\nProduction.\nAlternative titles for the film were \"The Bank Detective\" and \"The Great Man\". With the success of his two previous films, \"You Can't Cheat an Honest Man\" and \"My Little Chickadee\", Fields was able to demand complete creative control. He wrote the script under the pseudonym of Mahatma Kane Jeeves. Principal photography began at Universal Studios in early September 1940. Parts of the film were shot on location in Lompoc, California.\nReception.\n\"The Bank Dick\" received many favorable reviews. Bosley Crowther of the \"New York Times\" wrote that \"for anyone who simply likes to laugh at the reckless inanities of an inspired buffoon, we recommend \"The Bank Dick.\" It's great fun.\" A reviewer for \"Variety\" wrote: \"It's a crazy-quilt pattern aiming for laughs, and achieves the purpose adequately. Several times, Fields reaches into satirical pantomime reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's best effort in that line during Mutual and Essanay days.\" \"James Agee\" lauded the film: \"The talkies brought one great comedian, the late, majestically lethargic W. C. Fields, who could not possibly have worked as well in silence; he was the toughest and most warmly human of all screen comedians, and It's a Gift and \"The Bank Dick\", fiendishly funny and incisive white-collar comedies, rank high among the best comedies (and best movies) ever made.\"\n\"Harrison's Reports\" called the film \"[a] good program comedy. W.C. Fields is at his best and for that reason the picture should go over very well with his fans.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that \"there is often an incident or gesture reminiscent of the Mack Sennett comedies. At times, the movie even smacks of those old days so exactly that you almost believe it must be a revival of some classic. There's nothing antiquated about it, however, no stale, museum starchiness, and the scandalous Mr. Fields has to be forgiven his outrageous behavior, since he is so simply and honestly funny.\" Film critic Leslie Halliwell deemed the film \"[i]mperfect, but probably the best Fields vehicle there is\" and W.C. Fields biographer Robert Lewis Taylor called it \"[o]ne of the great classics of American comedy.\"\nHowever, Otis Ferguson, a reviewer for the \"New Republic\", wrote: \"When [Fields] is funny he is terrific...but the story is makeshift, the other characters are stock types, the only pace discernible is the distance between drinks or the rhythm of the fleeting seconds it takes Fields to size up trouble and duck the hell out.\"\nThe film has a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. In a list submitted to \"Cinema\" magazine in 1963, noted director Stanley Kubrick named it his eighth-favorite film.\nOne scene from the film, where Fields asks a bartender: \"Was I in here last night and did I spend a twenty-dollar bill?\" and expressing relief that he did, because: \"Oh, what a load that is off my mind. I thought I LOST it.\", has become classic. The line is often quoted in context of the film.\nThe film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection but has since been out of print.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1935, he formed the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, his minimalist piano style, and others.\nMany musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, plunger trombonist Al Grey, and singers Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Dennis Rowland, Thelma Carpenter, and Joe Williams.\nAs a composer, Basie is known for writing such jazz standards as \"Blue and Sentimental\", \"Jumpin' at the Woodside\" and \"One O'Clock Jump\".\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nWilliam Basie was born to Lillian (Childs) and Harvey Lee Basie in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area. Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the mellophone, and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for Count Basie's piano instruction.\nThe best student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school, but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the silent movies.\nThough a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of Sonny Greer, who also lived in Red Bank and became Duke Ellington's drummer in 1919, Basie switched to piano exclusively at age 15. Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pickup groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson's \"Kings of Syncopation\". When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore, and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.\nEarly career.\nAround 1920, Basie went to Harlem, a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington's early band. Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were \"making the scene\", including Willie \"the Lion\" Smith and James P. Johnson. One of his earliest gigs in Harlem was working in the band at Broadway Jones's nightclub; a job he was given by banjo player Elmer Snowden who had temporarily taken over leadership of the group while Jones was performing elsewhere.\nBasie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including \"Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies\" (featuring singer Katie Crippen) as part of the \"Hippity Hop\" show; on the Keith, the Columbia Burlesque, and the Theater Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to blues singer Gonzelle White as well as Crippen. His touring took him to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong. Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy's, a place known for its piano players and its \"cutting contests\". The place catered to \"uptown celebrities\", and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using \"head arrangements\". He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City). As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie \"the Lion\" Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at \"house-rent parties\", introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.\nIn 1928, Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which featured Jimmy Rushing on vocals. A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. It was at this time that he began to be known as \"Count\" Basie (see Jazz royalty).\nKansas City years.\nThe following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten's ambition to raise his band to match the level of those led by Duke Ellington or Fletcher Henderson. Where the Blue Devils were \"snappier\" and more \"bluesy\", the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the \"Kansas City stomp\" style. In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with Eddie Durham, who notated the music.\nTheir \"Moten Swing\", which Basie claimed credit for, was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform. During a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted. The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.\nWhen the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms. When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band. A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten's band, and played with them until Moten died in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. The band tried to stay together but failed. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).\nThe Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie's name some style, so he called him \"Count\". It positioned him with Earl Hines, as well as Duke Ellington.\nBasie's new band played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece \"One O'Clock Jump\". According to Basie, \"we hit it with the rhythm section and went into the riffs, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.\" It became his signature tune.\nJohn Hammond and first recordings.\nAt the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm, moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Cafe. Right from the start, Basie's band was known for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of Herschel Evans' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the alto players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in \"duels\". Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.\nIn that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer John Hammond later described as \"the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I've ever had anything to do with\". Hammond first heard Basie's band on the radio and went to Kansas City to check them out. He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Oh Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled \"Boogie Woogie\" (Columbia album C44). When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.\nBy then, Basie's sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone). Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie \"Holy Man\", \"Holy Main\", and just plain \"Holy\".\nBasie favored blues, and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, Helen Humes, and Joe Williams. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band's abilities, such as Eddie Durham and Jimmy Mundy.\nNew York City and the swing years.\nWhen Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, \"We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing\". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.\nThe producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up. His first official recordings for Decca followed, under contract to agent MCA, including \"Pennies from Heaven\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\".\nHammond introduced Basie to Billie Holiday, whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos). The band's first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and Jimmy Rushing getting the most attention. Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their \"head arrangements\" and collective memory.\nNext, Basie played at the Savoy, which was noted more for lindy-hopping, while the Roseland was a place for fox-trots and congas. In early 1938, the Savoy was the meeting ground for a \"battle of the bands\" with Chick Webb's group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer Ella Fitzgerald. As \"Metronome\" magazine proclaimed, \"Basie's Brilliant Band Conquers Chick's\"; the article described the evening:\nThroughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick's forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick's brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick's thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.\nThe publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, Benny Goodman recorded their signature \"One O'Clock Jump\" with his band.\nA few months later, Holiday left for Artie Shaw's band. Hammond introduced Helen Humes, whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years. When Eddie Durham left for Glenn Miller's orchestra, he was replaced by Dicky Wells. Basie's 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot with a CBS network feed and air conditioning, which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap. Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from Jimmy Mundy (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and Earl Hines), particularly for \"Cherokee\", \"Easy Does It\", and \"Super Chief\". In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first West Coast dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the William Morris Agency, who got them better fees.\nOn February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at Southland in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on February 20.\nOn the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in \"Reveille With Beverly\", a musical film starring Ann Miller, and a \"Command Performance\" for Armed Forces Radio, with Hollywood stars Clark Gable, Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, Jerry Colonna, and the singer Dinah Shore. Other minor movie spots followed, including \"Choo Choo Swing\", \"Crazy House\", \"Top Man\", \"Stage Door Canteen\", and \"Hit Parade of 1943\". They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records. The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as swing began to fade, the effects of the musicians' strikes of 1942\u201344 and 1948 began to be felt, and the public's taste grew for singers.\nBasie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.\nLos Angeles and the Cavalcade of Jazz concerts.\nCount Basie was the featured artist at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field on September 23, 1945, which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. Al Jarvis was the Emcee and other artists to appear on stage were Joe Liggins and his Honeydrippers, The Peters Sisters, Slim and Bam, Valaida Snow, and Big Joe Turner. They played to a crowd of 15,000. Count Basie and his Orchestra played at the tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert also at Wrigley Field on June 20, 1954. He played along with The Flairs, Christine Kittrell, Lamp Lighters, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five, Ruth Brown, and Perez Prado and his Orchestra.\nPost-war and later years.\nThe big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the Universal-International short film \"\"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet.\" He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. This group was eventually called the New Testament band. Basie credited Billy Eckstine, a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that Norman Granz got them into the Birdland club and promoted the new band through recordings on the Mercury, Clef, and Verve labels. By 1956, Basie's recordings were also showcased by Ben Selvin within the RCA Thesaurus transcription library. The jukebox era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early rock'n'roll and rhythm and blues artists. Basie's new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on \"head\" and more on written arrangements.\nBasie added touches of bebop \"so long as it made sense\", and he required that \"it all had to have feeling\". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop musicians as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, \"so it doesn't matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat\". Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied. Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, Idrees Sulieman, and Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinichette and Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson (tenor sax); Frank Wess (tenor sax and flute); Marshal Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax). \"DownBeat\" magazine reported: \"(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.\" In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.\nIn 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many expatriate American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. Neal Hefti began to provide arrangements, including \"Li'l Darlin'\". By the mid-1950s, Basie's band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the \"Birdland Stars of 1955\", whose lineup included Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Lester Young, George Shearing, and Stan Getz.\nIn 1957, Basie released the live album \"Count Basie at Newport\". \"April in Paris\" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album. The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, along with Judy Garland, Vera Lynn, and Mario Lanza. He was a guest on ABC's \"The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom\", a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie's band recorded a \"greatest hits\" double album \"The Count Basie Story\" (Frank Foster, arranger), and \"Basie/Eckstine Incorporated\", an album featuring Billy Eckstine, Quincy Jones (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.\nLater that year, Basie appeared on a television special with Fred Astaire, featuring a dance solo to \"Sweet Georgia Brown\", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five John F. Kennedy Inaugural Balls. That summer, Basie and Duke Ellington combined forces for the recording \"First Time! The Count Meets the Duke\", each providing four numbers from their play books.\nDuring the balance of the 1960s, the band kept active with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, Las Vegas shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.\nThrough steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as in the Jerry Lewis film \"Cinderfella\" (1960) and the Mel Brooks movie \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), playing a revised arrangement of \"April in Paris\". In 1982 Basie and his orchestra were the featured entertainment for the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the Pittsburgh Steelers at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.\nBasie was a Prince Hall Freemason as a member of Wisdom Lodge No. 102 in Chicago as well as a Shriner.\nMarriage, family and death.\nBasie was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. On July 21, 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on July 13, 1940, in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. Their only child, Diane, was born February 6, 1944. She was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors claimed she would never walk. The couple kept her and cared deeply for her, and especially through her mother's tutelage, Diane learned not only to walk but to swim. The Basies bought a home in the new whites-only neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, St. Albans, Queens. They moved to Freeport in the Bahamas in the 1970s. His wife Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple's home in Freeport on April 11, 1983. She was 69 years old.\nA year later, Count Basie died of pancreatic cancer in Hollywood, Florida, on April 26, 1984, at the age of 79. His funeral was attended by Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones among others. His daughter, Diane Basie, died four decades later, on October 15, 2022, of a heart attack.\nSingers.\nBasie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album \"One O'Clock Jump\", and 1956's \"Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings\", with \"Every Day (I Have the Blues)\" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album \"Basie/Eckstine Incorporated\", in 1959. Ella Fitzgerald made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album \"Ella and Basie!\". With the New Testament Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful Quincy Jones, this album proved a swinging respite from her \"Songbook\" recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums \"A Classy Pair\", \"Digital III at Montreux\", and \"A Perfect Match\", the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to Quincy Jones, Basie was using arrangers such as Benny Carter \"(Kansas City Suite)\", Neal Hefti \"(The Atomic Mr Basie)\", and Sammy Nestico \"(Basie-Straight Ahead)\".\nFrank Sinatra recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962's \"Sinatra-Basie\" and for a second studio album on 1964's \"It Might as Well Be Swing\", which was arranged by Quincy Jones. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live \"Sinatra at the Sands\" which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra stayed at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas at Sinatra's request. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's Royal Festival Hall with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Sinatra later said of this concert \"I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting\".\nBasie also recorded with Tony Bennett in the late 1950s. Their albums together included \"In Person\" and \"Strike Up the Band.\" Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at Carnegie Hall. He also recorded with Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, and Sarah Vaughan. One of Basie's biggest regrets was never recording with Louis Armstrong, though they shared the same bill several times. In 1968, Basie and his Band recorded an album with Jackie Wilson titled \"Manufacturers of Soul\".\nLegacy and honors.\nCount Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music. In his autobiography, he wrote, \"I think the band can really \"swing\" when it swings \"easy\", when it can just play along like you are cutting butter.\"\nDiscography.\nCount Basie made most of his albums with his big band. See the Count Basie Orchestra Discography.\nFrom 1929 to 1932, Basie was part of Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra:\nAs sideman.\nWith Eddie Lockjaw Davis\nWith Harry Edison\nWith Benny Goodman\nWith Jo Jones\nWith Joe Newman\nWith Paul Quinichette\nWith Lester Young\nAwards.\nGrammy Awards.\nIn 1958, Basie became the first African-American to win a Grammy Award.\nGrammy Hall of Fame.\nBy 2011, four recordings of Count Basie had been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\nHonors and inductions.\nOn May 23, 1985, William \"Count\" Basie was presented, posthumously, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. The award was received by Aaron Woodward.\nOn September 11, 1996, the U.S. Post Office issued a Count Basie 32 cents postage stamp. Basie is a part of the Big Band Leaders issue, which, is in turn, part of the Legends of American Music series.\nIn 2009, Basie was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\nIn May 2019, Basie was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Memphis, TN, presented by The Blues Foundation.\nNational Recording Registry.\nIn 2005, Count Basie's song \"One O'Clock Jump\" (1937) was included by the National Recording Preservation Board in the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. The board selects songs in an annual basis that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, with supporting performances from John Huston, John Hillerman, Perry Lopez, Burt Young, and Diane Ladd. The film's narrative, set in 1930s Los Angeles, is loosely inspired by the California water wars\u2014early 20th-century conflicts over water rights that enabled Los Angeles to access resources from the Owens Valley. Produced by Robert Evans and distributed by Paramount Pictures, \"Chinatown\" was Polanski's final film made in the United States and is considered a landmark of the film noir genre, blending mystery and psychological drama.\nReleased on June 20, 1974, \"Chinatown\" received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, and performances\u2014particularly those of Nicholson and Dunaway. \"Chinatown\" led the 47th Academy Awards with 11 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Polanski), Best Actor (Nicholson), and Best Actress (Dunaway), with Towne winning for Best Original Screenplay. At the 32nd Golden Globe Awards, the film received a leading 7 nominations, including Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama (Dunaway) and Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture (Huston), and won a leading 4 awards, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, Best Director and Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama (Nicholson). It also received a leading 11 nominations at the 28th British Academy Film Awards, including BAFTA Award for Best Film, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won a leading 3 awards \u2013 Best Direction (Polanski) and Best Actor in a Leading Role (Nicholson). In 2008, the American Film Institute ranked it #2 on its list of the top ten mystery films. In 1991, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.\nA sequel, \"The Two Jakes\", was released in 1990, with Nicholson reprising his role and directing. Towne returned as screenwriter, but the film received mixed reviews and failed to replicate the success of its predecessor.\nPlot.\nIn 1930s Los Angeles, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J. \"Jake\" Gittes to trail her husband, Hollis, the chief engineer at the Department of Water and Power. Gittes photographs Hollis in the company of a young woman and the pictures make their way into the \"Post-Record\", exposing their apparent affair. Gittes is then confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. He concludes that the impostor was using him to discredit Hollis.\nGittes crosses paths with his former colleague, LAPD Lieutenant Lou Escobar, when Hollis's corpse is found in a reservoir. Investigating further, he discovers that huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir each night, despite the fact that the city is in the midst of a drought. Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill warns him off, and he has his nose slashed by one of Mulvihill's henchmen.\nNow working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Hollis's death. He learns that Hollis was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he finds Hollis's supposed mistress, who has disappeared. Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, the woman who posed as Evelyn. She refuses to say who hired her, but urges Gittes to check the \"Post-Record\"'s obituary section.\nPublic records reveal that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Gittes recognizes one of the buyers' names from the obituary section; the obituary indicates that he had been dead for a week when the deal was closed. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home where the buyer had lived and discover that many of the other residents are \"buyers\" too, although they have no knowledge of this fact. A suspicious staff member calls Mulvihill, but Gittes and Evelyn escape him and his thugs and hide at her mansion, where they sleep together. Later that night, Gittes follows Evelyn to a house where he sees her comforting the missing girl. When confronted, Evelyn claims the girl is her sister, Katherine.\nA call from Escobar summons Gittes to Ida's apartment; she has been murdered. Escobar reveals that Hollis had saltwater in his lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the reservoir. He suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray residence, Gittes retrieves a pair of glasses \nfrom the saltwater garden pond.\nGittes confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom she now claims is her daughter. Frustrated, he repeatedly slaps Evelyn until she breaks down and reveals that Katherine is both her sister and daughter; the girl's father is Cross, who impregnated Evelyn when she was 15. She tells Gittes that the glasses he found did not belong to Hollis.\nGittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray estate, having deduced that Cross dropped his glasses when he drowned Hollis in the pond. Cross reveals that he is behind both the water shortage and the land grab in the Northwest Valley. Once the land is his, he will obtain a contract from the city to build a reservoir there. He discredited and killed Hollis when the latter came close to uncovering the plan.\nAt gunpoint, Cross and Mulvihill force Gittes to take them to Chinatown, where the police are waiting. Escobar detains Gittes as Cross attempts to claim Katherine. Evelyn shoots Cross in the arm and tries to escape with Katherine, but the police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross takes a distraught Katherine away, and Escobar orders Gittes released. As the traumatised Gittes is led away by his associates, one tells him, \"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nBackground.\nIn 1971, producer Robert Evans offered Towne $175,000 to write a screenplay for \"The Great Gatsby\" (1974), but Towne felt he could not better the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Instead, Towne asked Evans for $25,000 to write his own story, \"Chinatown\", to which Evans agreed. Towne had originally hoped to also direct \"Chinatown\", but realized that by taking Evans' money, he would lose control of the project's future and his role as a director.\n\"Chinatown\" is set in 1937 and portrays the manipulation of a critical municipal resource\u2014water\u2014by a cadre of shadowy oligarchs. It was the first part of Towne's planned trilogy about the character J. J. Gittes, the foibles of the Los Angeles power structure, and the subjugation of public good by private greed. The second part, \"The Two Jakes\", has Gittes caught up in another grab for a natural resource\u2014oil\u2014in the 1940s. It was directed by Jack Nicholson and released in 1990, but the second film's commercial and critical failure scuttled plans to make \"Gittes vs. Gittes\", about the third finite resource\u2014land\u2014in Los Angeles, circa 1968.\nOrigins.\nThe character of Hollis Mulwray was inspired by and loosely based on Irish immigrant William Mulholland (1855\u20131935) according to Mulholland's granddaughter. Mulholland was the superintendent and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who oversaw the construction of the 230-mile (370-km) aqueduct that carries water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. Mulholland was considered by many to be the man who made Los Angeles possible by building the Los Angeles Aqueduct in the early 1900s. The 233 mile long feat of engineering brought the water necessary for urban expansion from the Owens Valley to a Los Angeles whose growth was constrained by the limits of the Los Angeles River. Mulholland credited Fred Eaton, then mayor of Los Angeles, with the idea to secure water for the city from the Owens Valley.\nAlthough the character of Hollis Mulwray was relatively minor in the film and he was killed in the early part of the movie, the events of Mulholland's life were portrayed through both the character of Mulwray and other figures in the movie. This portrayal, along with other changes to actual events that inspired \"Chinatown\", such as the time frame which was some thirty years earlier than that of the movie, were some of the liberties with facts of Mulholland's life that the movie takes.\nAuthor Vincent Brook considers real-life Mulholland to be split, in the film, into \"noble Water and Power chief Hollis Mulwray\" and \"mobster muscle Claude Mulvihill\", just as Land syndicate and Combination members, who \"exploited their insider knowledge\" on account of \"personal greed\", are \"condensed into the singular, and singularly monstrous, Noah Cross\".\nIn the film, Mulwray opposes the dam wanted by Noah Cross and the city of Los Angeles, for reasons of engineering and safety, arguing he would not repeat his previous mistake, when his dam broke resulting in hundreds of deaths. This alludes to the St. Francis Dam disaster of March 12, 1928. Unlike the character of Mulwray, who was concerned about the dam in \"Chinatown\", Mulholland's role in the disaster diverged from the events in the film. Mulholland had inspected the St. Francis Dam after the dam keeper Tony Harnischfeger requested it, when Harnischfeger became concerned about the safety of the dam upon discovering cracks and brown water leaking from its base, which indicated to him the erosion of the dam's foundation. Mulholland inspected the dam at around 10:30 in the morning, declaring that all was well with the structure. Just before midnight that same evening, a massive failure of the dam occurred. The dam's failure inundated the Santa Clara River Valley, including the town of Santa Paula, with flood water, causing the deaths of at least 431 people. The event effectively ended Mulholland's career.\nThe plot of Chinatown is also drawn not just from the diversion of water from the Owens Valley via the aqueduct but also from another actual event. In the movie, water is being purposely released in order to drive the land owners out and create support for a dam through an artificial drought. The event that the movie refers to occurred in late 1903 and 1904 when underground water levels plummeted and water usage rose precipitously. Rather than a deliberate release, Mulholland was able to figure out that because of faulty valves and gates in the water system, large quantities of water were being released in the overflow sewer system and then into the ocean. Mulholland was able to stop the leaks.\nScript.\nAccording to Robert Towne, both Carey McWilliams's \"Southern California Country: An Island on the Land\" (1946) and a \"West\" magazine article called \"Raymond Chandler's L.A.\" inspired his original screenplay. In a letter to McWilliams, Towne wrote that \"Southern California Country\" \"really changed my life. It taught me to look at the place where I was born, and convinced me to write about it\".\nTowne wrote the screenplay with Jack Nicholson in mind. He took the title (and the exchange \"What did you do in Chinatown?\" / \"As little as possible\") from a Hungarian vice cop, who had worked in Los Angeles's Chinatown, dealing with its confusion of dialects and gangs. The vice cop thought that \"police were better off in Chinatown doing nothing, because you could never tell what went on there\" and whether what a cop did helped victims or further exploited them.\nPolanski first learned of the script through Nicholson, as they had been searching for a suitable joint project, and the producer Robert Evans was excited at the thought that Polanski's direction would create a darker, more cynical, and European vision of the United States. Polanski was initially reluctant to return to Los Angeles (it was only a few years since the murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate), but was persuaded on the strength of the script.\nTowne wanted Cross to die and Evelyn Mulwray to survive, but the screenwriter and director argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end: \"I knew that if \"Chinatown\" was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die\". They parted ways over this dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene a few days before it was shot.\nThe original script was more than 180 pages and included a narration by Gittes; Polanski cut and reordered the story so the audience and Gittes unraveled the mysteries at the same time.\nAccording to Sam Wasson's \"The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood\", Towne \"secretly employed an old college friend named Edward Taylor as his uncredited writing partner for more than 40 years.\" (Taylor died in 2013).\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography took place from October 1973 to January 1974. William A. Fraker accepted the cinematographer position from Polanski when Paramount agreed. He had worked with the studio previously on Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\". Robert Evans, never consulted about the decision, insisted that the offer be rescinded since he felt pairing Polanski and Fraker again would create a team with too much control over the project and complicate the production.\nBetween Fraker and the eventual choice John A. Alonzo, the two compromised on Stanley Cortez, but Polanski grew frustrated with Cortez's slow process, old fashioned compositional sensibility, and unfamiliarity with the Panavision equipment. Alonzo had worked on documentaries and shot film for \"National Geographic\" and for Jacques Cousteau. Alonzo was chosen for his fleetness and skill with natural light a few weeks into production. Alonzo understood that Polanski wanted realism in his lighting; \"He wants the soft red tile to look soft red.\" Ultimately, only a handful of scenes in the finished film, including the orange grove confrontation, were shot by Cortez. Because Polanski's English was poor, Alonzo and Polanski would communicate in Italian, which Alonzo would then translate for the crew. Polanski was rigorous in his framing and use of Alonzo's vision, making the actors strictly adhere to blocking to accommodate the camera and lighting.\nIn keeping with a technique Polanski attributes to Raymond Chandler, all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through the main character's eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and fades in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film. This subjectivity is the same construction used in Francis Coppola's \"The Conversation\" in which the main character, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), appears in every scene in the film. \"The Conversation\" began shooting eleven months prior to \"Chinatown\".\nSoundtrack.\nJerry Goldsmith composed and recorded the film's score in ten days, after producer Robert Evans rejected Phillip Lambro's original effort at the last minute. It received an Academy Award nomination and remains widely praised, ranking ninth on the American Film Institute's list of the top 25 American film scores. Goldsmith's score, with \"haunting\" trumpet solos by Hollywood studio musician and MGM's first trumpet Uan Rasey, was released through ABC Records and features 12 tracks at a running time just over 30 minutes. It was later reissued on CD by the Var\u00e8se Sarabande label. Rasey related that Goldsmith \"told [him] to play it sexy \u2014 but like it's not good sex!\"\nHistorical background.\nIn his 2004 film essay and documentary \"Los Angeles Plays Itself\", film scholar Thom Andersen lays out the complex relationship between \"Chinatown\"'s script and its historical background,\n\"Chinatown\" isn't a docudrama, it's a fiction. The water project it depicts isn't the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, engineered by William Mulholland before the First World War. \"Chinatown\" is set in 1937, not 1905. The Mulholland-like figure\u2014\"Hollis Mulwray\"\u2014isn't the chief architect of the project, but rather its strongest opponent, who must be discredited and murdered. Mulwray is against the \"Alto Vallejo Dam\" because it's unsafe, not because it's stealing water from somebody else... But there are echoes of Mulholland's aqueduct project in \"Chinatown\"... Mulholland's project enriched its promoters through insider land deals in the San Fernando Valley, just like the dam project in \"Chinatown\". The disgruntled San Fernando Valley farmers of \"Chinatown\", forced to sell off their land at bargain prices because of an artificial drought, seem like stand-ins for the Owens Valley settlers whose homesteads turned to dust when Los Angeles took the water that irrigated them. The \"Van Der Lip Dam\" disaster, which Hollis Mulwray cites to explain his opposition to the proposed dam, is an obvious reference to the collapse of the Saint Francis Dam in 1928. Mulholland built this dam after completing the aqueduct and its failure was the greatest man-made disaster in the history of California. These echoes have led many viewers to regard \"Chinatown\", not only as docudrama, but as truth\u2014the real secret history of how Los Angeles got its water. And it has become a ruling metaphor of the non-fictional critiques of Los Angeles development.\nAnalysis and interpretation.\nIn a 1975 issue of \"Film Quarterly\", scholar Wayne D. McGinnis drew parallels between \"Chinatown\" and Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\". He argued that both works share a \"wasteland motif\", wherein a central figure\u2014Noah Cross in \"Chinatown\" and Oedipus in \"Oedipus Rex\"\u2014exploits a plague or crisis to gain power, ultimately becoming the source of deeper societal corruption. According to McGinnis, both narratives reflect the moral decay of their respective eras: ancient Athens during a time of post-heroic intellectual upheaval, and the United States during the Watergate era.\nMcGinnis further suggested that director Roman Polanski symbolically divides the character of Oedipus into two figures in \"Chinatown\". Jake Gittes, the film's protagonist, embodies the morally conscious \"good\" Oedipus, a seeker of truth who gradually uncovers a network of corruption. He contended that Gittes' pursuit of rational investigation blinds him to emotional and moral complexities, invoking literary theorists Cleanth Brooks and Robert B. Heilman to describe Gittes as \"the Oedipus whose success [...] has tended to blind [him] to possibilities which pure reason fails to see.\"\nMcGinnis concluded that both works elicit pity for their protagonists, noting that \"there is finally pity for the doomed, ignorant Gittes, just as there is pity for the blind Oedipus in Sophocles\", but that Gittes' understanding, like that of Oedipus, arrives too late to change the outcome.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Chinatown\" was released in the United States on June 21, 1974, by Paramount Pictures. The film grossed approximately $29.2 million domestically, with an additional $28,149 earned in international markets, resulting in a worldwide total of $29.23 million.\nAdjusted for inflation, \"Chinatown\"'s domestic gross is estimated to be approximately $146 million in 2022 dollars.\nCritical response.\n\"Chinatown\" received widespread critical acclaim for its screenplay, direction, and performances, and is often regarded as one of the greatest films of the 20th century.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 98% approval rating based on 147 reviews, with an average score of 9.40/10. The site's consensus reads: \"As bruised and cynical as the decade that produced it, this noir classic benefits from Robert Towne's brilliant screenplay, director Roman Polanski's steady hand, and wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\nRoger Ebert included \"Chinatown\" in his \"Great Movies\" list, noting that Nicholson's performance was instrumental in lifting the film beyond a standard crime thriller, and concluding that it \"seems to settle easily beside the original noirs.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" praised the film as \"unquestionably one of the best films to emerge from the 1970s,\" highlighting its complex characters and narrative.\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" described the film as a \"superlative neo-noir,\" stating that \"Chinatown\" \"now looks like a classic in a direct line of succession to earlier pictures\" and has \"weathered the years with a real touch of class.\" Rob Fraser of \"Empire\" echoed the sentiment, calling it \"the best private eye movie ever made\" and \"a never-bettered noir masterpiece.\"\nRyan Brown, writing for \"Pantheon of Film\", characterized it as \"a masterpiece drenched in murky reservoir water,\" lauding its bleak tone and thematic depth. He noted that the film \"flips an entire genre on its head in masterful fashion.\" \"Cineluxe\" emphasized the film's striking visual and narrative cohesion, describing it as \"a razor-sharp, tightly paced film that remains just as unnerving and engrossing today.\"\n\"Common Sense Media\" noted the film's mature themes and disturbing content, advising that it's \"best suited for older teens and adults,\" but also commended it as \"a landmark of American cinema\" with \"powerful storytelling.\" \"That Old Picture Show\" called it \"a staggering, disturbing, brilliant film\" with \"layered performances and a script that doesn't just evoke the noir tradition\u2014it rewrites it.\"\nWhile the film was praised by most major critics, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" offered a more reserved view, suggesting that the filmmakers \"have attempted nothing so witty and entertaining,\" and expressing a preference for earlier noir classics. However, he acknowledged Nicholson's performance as the film's \"major contribution to the genre.\"\nAccolades.\nOther honors.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nSubsequent works.\nA sequel titled \"The Two Jakes\" was released in 1990, with Jack Nicholson reprising his role as Jake Gittes and also serving as director. Robert Towne returned as screenwriter. Unlike its predecessor, the film received mixed reviews and was a commercial disappointment.\nIn November 2019, a prequel television series was reported to be in development at Netflix, with David Fincher and Robert Towne attached to the project. The series is expected to explore the early career of Jake Gittes and the founding of his detective agency.\nIn August 2020, it was reported that a feature film chronicling the making of \"Chinatown\" was in development. The film is based on Sam Wasson's non-fiction book \"\", with Ben Affleck attached as writer and director.\nLegacy.\n\"Chinatown\" is widely regarded as one of the most influential films of the 20th century, particularly noted for its screenplay by Robert Towne, which has been frequently cited as one of the greatest ever written. The script is renowned for its narrative structure, character development, and integration of personal and political themes. Despite Towne's significant contribution, the film's final scene was changed by director Roman Polanski, who insisted on a more pessimistic ending. Towne had originally conceived an alternative conclusion in which Evelyn kills her father and is imprisoned, unable to reveal the truth, while Jake Gittes remains silent. Polanski, however, opted for a starker ending, in which Evelyn is killed and her daughter is taken by Noah Cross. Towne initially objected, describing Polanski's version as overly melodramatic, but later acknowledged its effectiveness, stating, \"Roman was right.\"\nThe film's closing line\u2014\"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\"\u2014has since become one of the most iconic lines in American cinema and is frequently referenced in popular culture as a symbol of fatalism and moral ambiguity. \"Chinatown\" has been credited with revitalizing the film noir genre, blending classical noir elements with 1970s sensibilities and themes of political corruption, institutional failure, and trauma. Its visual style, characterized by subdued colors, natural lighting, and restrained cinematography, has been influential in both academic film studies and contemporary filmmaking.\nThe film also drew public attention to historical events involving the California water wars, particularly the controversial diversion of water from the Owens Valley to supply Los Angeles in the early 20th century. The fictional narrative was inspired in part by these real-life events, and scholars have noted the film's commentary on land speculation, environmental exploitation, and civic corruption. More recent analyses have framed \"Chinatown\" as a broader critique of patriarchal control and capital-driven urban development, with contemporary critics drawing parallels between its themes and ongoing socio-political issues.\nOn the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the film has continued to receive critical reappraisal. Outlets such as \"BBC Culture\", \"Screen Rant\", and the \"Los Angeles Review of Books\" have reaffirmed its cultural and cinematic relevance, emphasizing its enduring legacy in shaping modern noir and political thrillers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its distinctive features are that it refers to files by the piece that occupies the back rank square in the starting position and that it describes each square two ways depending on whether it is from White or Black's point of view. It was common in English, Spanish and French chess literature until about 1980. In most other languages, the more concise algebraic notation was in use. Since 1981, FIDE no longer recognizes descriptive notation for the purposes of dispute resolution, and algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard.\nDescription.\nNomenclature.\nWith the exception of the knight, each piece is abbreviated as the first letter of its name: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and P for pawn. As \"knight\" begins with the same letter as \"king\", it is abbreviated as either N or Kt, the first being the modern convention. In 1944, \"Chess Review\" received many letters debating the change from Kt to N.\nEach square has two names, depending on the viewpoint of White or Black. Each &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt; is given a name corresponding to the piece that occupies the first &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt; at the start of the game. Thus, in English descriptive notation the queen's file is named \"Q\" and the king's file is named \"K\". Since there are two each of the remaining pieces on the first rank, it is necessary to distinguish between them. The pieces on the queen's side of the board (to White's left; to Black's right) are named with respect to the queen, i.e. \"queen's rook\", \"queen's knight\" and \"queen's bishop\"; and have the shortened names \"QR\", \"QN\" and \"QB\", respectively. Similarly, the pieces on the king's side (White's right; Black's left) are named with respect to the king, i.e. \"king's rook\", \"king's knight\" and \"king's bishop\"; and have the shortened names \"KR\", \"KN\" and \"KB\". The rank is given a number, ranging from 1 to 8, with rank 1 being closest to the player. In 19th century chess literature the first rank is usually called simply the \"[piece]'s square\", so \"K1\" (\"King One\") is called \"King's square\" (K. Sq.). Some players omitted both the \"1\" and the \"sq\", so \"Rook to King 1\" was written R\u2013K.\nThis method of naming the squares means that each square has one name from White's point of view and another from Black's. For a full diagram of the board using this naming method, see the image above.\nWhen recording a move by White, the naming from White's point of view is used; when recording a move by Black, the naming from Black's point of view is used.\nSpanish descriptive notation uses a similar system, with a few differences:\nIn Spanish descriptive notation the Sicilian Defence (1. P\u2013K4 P\u2013QB4 in English) would be written 1. P4R P4AD (). This is also the method used in French descriptive notation.\nNotation for moves.\nEach move is notated by a sequence of characters that is structured based on the move's type. Special indicators are added to the end of the sequence if relevant.\nTypically, the full designation for a piece or a file is shortened to just the last part (indicating type of piece) whenever this does not produce ambiguity. For example, the move KP\u2013K4 would always be written P\u2013K4 since only one pawn can move to K4 without capturing; the move Q\u2013QB4 would be written Q\u2013B4 whenever Q\u2013KB4 is not a legal move. A pawn capturing a pawn may be shown as P\u00d7P if it is the only one possible, or as BP\u00d7P if only one of the player's bishop's pawns can capture a pawn, or as QBP\u00d7P, P\u00d7RP(R6) or P\u00d7QBP or other such variations.\nDisambiguation of pieces using notations like QBP and KR becomes awkward once the pieces have left their starting positions (or for pawns, left their starting files), and is impossible for pieces created by promotion (such as a second queen). So as an alternative, moves may also be disambiguated by giving the starting square or the square of a capture, delimited by parentheses or a slash, e.g. B\u00d7N/QB6 or R(QR3)\u2013Q3. Sometimes only the rank or file is indicated, e.g. R(6)\u00d7N.\nWhen listing the moves of a game, first the move number is written, then the move by White followed by the move by Black. If there is no appropriate move by White to use (e.g. if the moves are interrupted by commentary) then an ellipsis (\"\u2026\") is used in its place.\nHistory.\nIn the earliest chess literature, natural language was used to describe moves. This is the ultimate source of all forms of descriptive notation. Over time, abbreviations became common, and a system of notation gradually evolved. For example, the common opening move 1.e4 was originally recorded as \"Pawn to King's Fourth\" or similar; by the time of Howard Staunton's \"The Chess-Player's Handbook\" (1847), this had been abbreviated to \"P. to K's 4th.\"which was later further reduced to \"P\u2013K4\".\nComparison to algebraic notation.\nWhile descriptive notation is largely regarded as obsolete, it does have a few minor advantages over algebraic notation. By identifying each square with reference to the player on move, descriptive notation better reflects the symmetry of the game's starting position (e.g. \"both players opened with P\u2013QB4 and planned to play B\u2013KN2 as soon as possible\"). Generic descriptions which refer to all four sectors of the board are also possible, e.g. \"all four bishops were developed on N2.\" Maxims such as \"a pawn on the seventh is worth two on the fifth\" make sense from both players' perspectives. Because the type of each captured piece is specified, it is easier to visualize the material balance at any point in the game when skimming over a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;game score&lt;/dfn&gt;. \nOn the other hand, algebraic notation has several advantages. The notation for any given move is almost always more concise in algebraic notation than in descriptive notation; this can reduce the length of chess books and magazines by several pages. While confusion can arise in descriptive notation because each square has two names, no such problem exists in algebraic notation. Algebraic notation specifies a capturing piece's destination square; meanwhile, because unambiguous captures lack coordinate information in descriptive notation, visualization is more taxing, since it requires remembering exactly which pieces are attacking which.\nExample.\nThe following game scores show the Evergreen Game.\nEnglish descriptive notation:\nEnglish descriptive notation with variants:\nSpanish descriptive notation:\nAlgebraic notation:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68094", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68094", "title": "Pinales", "text": "Order of seed plants, also known as conifers\nThe order Pinales in the division Pinophyta, class Pinopsida, comprises all the extant conifers. The distinguishing characteristic is the reproductive structure known as a cone produced by all Pinales. All of the extant conifers, such as Araucaria, cedar, celery-pine, cypress, fir, juniper, kauri, larch, pine, redwood, spruce, and yew, are included here. Some fossil conifers, however, belong to other distinct orders within the division Pinophyta.\nMultiple molecular studies indicate this order being paraphyletic with respect to Gnetales, with studies recovering Gnetales as either a sister group to Pinaceae or being more derived than Pinaceae but sister to the rest of the group.\nTaxonomy.\nHistory.\nBrown (1825) first discerned that there were two groups of seed plants, distinguished by the form of seed development, based on whether the ovules were exposed, receiving pollen directly, or enclosed, which do not. Shortly afterwards, Brongniart (1828) coined the term \"Phan\u00e9rogames gymnosperms\" to describe the former group. The distinction was then formalized by Lindley (1830), dividing what he referred to as the subclass Dicotyledons into two tribes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. In the gymnosperms (or Gymnospermae) Lindley included two orders, the Cycadeae and the Coniferae. In his final work (1853) he described Gymnogens as a class with four orders;\nIn contrast, Bentham and Hooker (1880) included only three orders in the class Gymnospermeae, by including taxads within Coniferae;\nIn the Engler system (1903) Gymnospermae is listed as a subdivision (\"Unterabteilung\") and adopted more of a splitter approach, including extinct taxa, with the following six classes;\nDuring this period, Gorozhankin published his treatise on Gymnosperms (1895), for which he bears the botanical authority for Pinales, . In his classification, Gymnospermae (alternatively named Archespermae) was a class of the division Archegoniatae, divided into subclasses;\nA system of two groups was maintained by the most commonly used classification in the twentieth century, the revision of the Engler system by Pilger (1926), who grouped 12 families of the Gymnospermae subdivision into 2 classes;\nThe treatment of Gymnosperms as two groups, though with varying composition and names, was followed for most of the twentieth century, including the systems of Chamberlain (1935), Benson (1957) and Cronquist (1960).\nIn the latter, Cronquist divided Gymnospermae into two divisions; \nBenson,(1957) who introduced the term Pinales, divided gymnosperms into four classes;\nIn a later revision, in collaboration with two other taxonomists (1966), Cronquist merged all the gymnosperms into a single division, Pinophyta, with three subdivisions reflecting the main lineages;\nIn the era of molecular phylogenetics, De-Zhi and colleagues (2004) once again proposed a division of 12 gymnosperm families into two classes;\nWith the development of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group came a major realignment of the linear classification of the land plants, by Chase and Reveal (2009). In this system, the land plants form a class, Equisetopsida \"s.l.\" (\"sensu lato\") or \"sensu\" Chase &amp; Reveal, also known as embryophytes or Embryophyceae \"nom. illeg.\". Class Equisetopsida \"s.l.\" is divided into 14 subclades as subclasses, including Magnoliidae (angiosperms). The gymnosperms are represented by four of these subclasses, placing them in a sister group relationship to angiosperms. Subclasses (number of orders);\nControversies.\nGymnosperm (Acrogymnospermae) taxonomy has been considered controversial, and lacks consensus. As taxonomic classification transformed from being based solely on plant morphology to molecular phylogenetics, the number of taxonomic publications increased considerably after 2008, however, these approaches have not been uniform. A taxonomic classification has been complicated by the relationship of extant to extinct taxa, and within extinct taxa, and particularly the placement of Gnetophyta. The latter have been variously classified as basal to all gymnosperms, sister group to conifers ('gnetifer' hypothesis) or sister to Pinaceae ('gnepine' hypothesis) in which they are classified within the conifers. The extant conifers most likely form a monophyletic group. In 2018, the Gymnosperm Phylogeny Group was established, analogous to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group and Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group, with the intention of reaching a consensus.\nPhylogeny.\nGymnosperms form a group of four subclasses among the spermatophytes (seed bearing plants). In turn, the seed plants together with the monilophyte fern subclasses make up the tracheophytes (vascular plants), part of the class Equisetopsida (embryophytes or land plants), as opposed to the green algae. Among the seed plants, the gymnosperms are a sister group to the subclass Magnoliidae (angiosperms or flowering plants).\nThere are about 1000 extant gymnosperm species, distributed over about 12 families and 83 genera. Many of these genera are monotypic (41%), and another 27% are oligotypic (2\u20135 species). The four subclasses have also been treated as divisions of the Spermatophytes. Alternative names and the approximate number of genera and species in each are;\nThe term Pinophyta has also been used to include all conifers, extinct and extant, with Pinales representing all the extant conifers.\nChristenhusz and colleagues extended the system of Chase and Reveal to provide a revised classification of gymnosperms in 2011, based on the above four subclades. In this scheme, the Pinidae comprise three orders, including Pinales, and 6 families;\nHowever, the exact phylogeny remained a topic that was 'hotly debated\", in particular whether the main lineages were best represented by the four subclasses of Christenhusz and colleagues or the more traditional five clades (cycads, ginkgos, cupressophytes, Pinaceae and gnetophytes). In 2014 the first complete molecular phylogeny was published, based on 90 species representing all extant genera. This established cycads as the basal group, followed by Ginkgoaceae, as sister to the remaining gymnosperms, and supporting the 'gnepine' hypothesis. This analysis favours the five clade hypothesis, the remaining clade following divergence of the Pinidae, are referred to as the conifer II clade, or cupressophytes, in distinction from the conifer I clade (Gnetidae, Pinidae). This clade, in turn, has two lineages. The first consisting of Sciadopityaceae and the Araucariales, the second being the Cupressales. In the Christenhusz scheme, the Sciadopityaceae were considered to be within Cupressales. The term Cupressaceae \"s.l.\" refers to the inclusion of Taxodiaceae. These relationships are shown in this cladogram, although no formal taxonomic revision was undertaken. \nA more comprehensive analysis was undertaken by Ran and colleagues in 2018, as part of a detailed phylogeny of all seed plants. This forms the basis of the Tracheophyte Phylogeny Poster and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.\nSubdivision.\nHistorically conifers, in the order Pinales have been considered to consist of six to seven extant families, based on the classification of class Coniferae by Pilger (1926), considered the standard through most of the twentieth century. These families were treated as a single order, in distinction to some earlier systems. His families were; \nSubsequent revisions merged the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae, and placed \"Sciadopitys\", formerly in Cupressaceae, into a separate family (Sciadopityaceae). Cephalotaxaceae had previously been recognized as a separate family, but was subsequently included in Taxaceae. Similarly Phyllocladaceae were included in Podocarpaceae. Yews (Taxaceae) have sometimes been treated as a separate order (Taxales).\nChristenhusz and colleagues (2011) included only one family in Pinales, Pinaceae, a practice subsequently followed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and the Gymnosperm Database. In this restricted model Pinales (Pinaceae) comprisea 11 genera and about 225 species, all of the other conifers originally included in this order, being included in other orders such as Cupressales.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also features Maxine Cooper and Cloris Leachman appearing in their feature film debuts. The film follows a private investigator in Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a complex mystery after picking up a female hitchhiker. The screenplay was written by Aldrich and A.I. Bezzerides, based on the 1952 crime novel \"Kiss Me, Deadly\" by Mickey Spillane.\n\"Kiss Me Deadly\" grossed $726,000 in the United States and $226,000 overseas. The film received the condemnation of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, which accused it of being \"designed to ruin young viewers\", a verdict that director Aldrich protested. Despite initial critical disapproval, it is considered one of the most important and influential film noirs of all time.\nThe film has been noted as a stylistic precursor to the French New Wave, and has been cited as a major influence on a number of filmmakers, including Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Alex Cox, and Quentin Tarantino. In 1999, \"Kiss Me Deadly\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nMike Hammer is a tough private investigator who, with the assistance of his associate and lover Velda, typically works on \"penny-ante divorce cases.\" One evening, Hammer is forced to suddenly stop his sports car by Christina, an escapee from a nearby psychiatric hospital, who is running barefoot along the road, wearing nothing but a trench coat. Hammer gives her a ride. Christina asks him, whatever happens, to \"remember me,\" alluding to a poem by Christina Rossetti. Thugs waylay them, and Hammer hears Christina screaming as she is tortured to death. The thugs then push Hammer's car off a cliff with Christina's body and an unconscious Hammer inside.\nHammer comes to in a hospital with Velda hovering over him. He decides to investigate Christina's death, believing that it \"must be connected with something big.\" He retrieves a book of poetry from the dead woman's apartment and reads aloud several lines from Rosetti's poem, \"Remember\", as he tries to figure out what that something might be.\nHammer goes to the apartment of Lily Carver, who says she was Christina's roommate. Lily tells Hammer she is in hiding and asks him to protect her. She is after a mysterious box that, she believes, has contents worth a fortune. Hammer later arrives at the lavish mansion of gangster Carl Evello, who also seeks the box. Hammer fends off Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse, two of Evello's henchmen, and then confronts Evello, who is initially impressed by Hammer's brazenness and offers to work out a deal, but swiftly retracts the offer.\nHammer's friend, Nick the auto mechanic, who helped defuse bombs planted in Hammer's car, is then murdered. Carl's thugs kidnap Hammer and take him to an isolated beach house, where another of their associates, Dr. G. E. Soberin (revealed to be responsible for the murders of Christina and Nick), injects him with sodium pentothal before interrogating him.\nCarl Evello comes in to question him, but gets nothing. Mike manages to work one hand free from the ropes. He calls out and Carl returns. He lures Carl over and knocks him out. Mike pretends to be Evello and summons Sugar in to kill Mike. Sugar enters the darkened room and stabs his boss, thinking it is Mike. Mike kills Sugar and escapes. \nMike determines that Christina had hidden a key for him to find. In a locker at the Hollywood Athletic Club, he locates the suspiciously hot box, which burns his arm. But when he goes to his friend Lieutenant Murphy for help, Murphy warns him off, hinting it has to do with a top-secret government experiment akin to the Manhattan Project.\nHammer goes back to the beach house. Before he arrives, Lily, now revealed to be an imposter named Gabrielle, is there with Soberin. They have the box, and have Velda locked in a bedroom. Gabrielle shoots Soberin to get the box for herself. With his dying words, Soberin urges the insatiably curious Gabrielle not to open it.\nWhen Hammer comes into the room, Gabrielle says, \"Kiss me, Mike,\" and shoots him. She then opens the box, which emits a blinding light and piercing sound. Gabrielle screams and bursts into flames. Hammer, wounded, struggles to his feet and looks for Velda. Together, the pair flee the burning house, helping each other along the beach to the ocean as the house explodes behind them and becomes consumed in flames.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn October 1954 Robert Aldrich announced he would produce and direct two Mickey Spillane stories the following year, for Parklane Productions, an independent company owned by Victor Saville. The stories would be \"Kiss Me, Deadly\" and \"My Gun Is Quick\". Saville turned over control to Aldrich because he was busy on \"The Silver Chalice\".\nThe screenplay was loosely adapted by A.I. Bezzerides with contributions from Aldrich, though it \"made no effort to follow the book's convoluted plot, [though] both are structured around [a] search for a mysterious box.\"\nDifferences from the novel.\n\"Kiss Me Deadly\" departs from other Mike Hammer films in that Hammer never carries a gun. This is explained when Lt. Murphy tells Hammer his PI license and gun permit have been revoked. Although he is held at gunpoint, pistol whipped, and even shot, he complies with the gun ban, relying only on his fists to hammer people into submission or worse. The screenplay also departs from Spillane's novel, replacing the mafia conspiracy at the center of the novel with an apparent case of espionage and a mysterious suitcase serving as the film's MacGuffin. The film further departs from the book by portraying Hammer not so much as a sleuth of the hardboiled school than as a sleazy, narcissistic bully, perhaps the darkest private detective in film noir.\nMuch to the derision of the local police, Hammer makes his living mostly by blackmailing adulterers, he or his secretary sometimes seducing and entrapping the targets themselves, a practice perhaps made even worse because Hammer seems to exploit the genuine affection that Velda feels for him to get her participation. He readily resorts to violence, whether he's defending himself against the thugs Evello sends to kill him, breaking a potential informant's treasured record to get him to talk,or roughing up a coroner who has the temerity to demand payment in return for a key that Christina had apparently swallowed before her death. Bezzerides wrote of the script: \"I wrote it fast because I had contempt for it... I tell you Spillane didn't like what I did with his book. I ran into him at a restaurant and, boy, he didn't like me\".\nLos Angeles locations.\n\"Kiss Me Deadly\" is a time capsule of Los Angeles, much of it filmed in the downtown neighborhood of Bunker Hill. Many of the locations disappeared in the urban development of the late 1960s, although a few remain.\nRelease.\nCritical response and analysis.\nCritics have generally viewed the film as a metaphor for the paranoia and fear of nuclear war that prevailed during the Cold War era. \"The great whatsit,\" as Velda refers to the object of Hammer's quest, turns out to be a mysterious valise, hot to the touch because of the dangerous, glowing substance it contains, a metaphor for the atomic bomb. The film has been described as \"the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science-fiction film noir of all time \u2013 at the close of the classic noir period.\" A leftist at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, Bezzerides denied any conscious intention for this metaphor in his script, saying that \"I was having fun with it. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting.\"\nFilm critic Nick Schager wrote, \"Never was Mike Hammer's name more fitting than in \"Kiss Me Deadly\", Robert Aldrich's blisteringly nihilistic noir in which star Ralph Meeker embodies Mickey Spillane's legendary P.I. with brute force savagery... The gumshoe's subsequent investigation into the woman's death doubles as a lacerating indictment of modern society's dissolution into physical/moral/spiritual degeneracy \u2013 a reversion that ultimately leads to nuclear apocalypse and man's return to the primordial sea \u2013 with the director's knuckle-sandwich cynicism pummeling the genre's romantic fatalism into a bloody pulp. 'Remember me?' Aldrich's sadistic, fatalistic masterpiece is impossible to forget\". Rotten Tomatoes reports that 97% of its critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.1/10, based on 37 reviews. The consensus states, \"An intriguing, wonderfully subversive blend of art and commerce, \"Kiss Me Deadly\" is an influential noir classic.\"\nFran\u00e7ois Truffaut wrote, \"To appreciate \"Kiss Me Deadly\", you have to love movies passionately and to have a vivid memory of those evenings when you saw \"Scarface\", \"Under Capricorn\", \"Le sang d'un po\u00e8te (Blood of a Poet)\", \"Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne\", and \"The Lady From Shanghai\". We have loved films that had only one idea, or twenty, or even fifty. In Aldrich's films, it is not unusual to encounter a new idea with each shot. In this movie the inventiveness is such that we don't know what to look at--the images are almost too full, too fertile. Watching a film like this is such an intense experience that we want it to go last for hours. It is easy to picture its author as a man overflowing with vitality, as much at ease behind a camera as Henry Miller facing a blank page. This is the film of a young director who is not yet worried about restraint.\"\nHome media.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the film on VHS as part of their \"Vintage Classics\" collection in 1999, and on DVD in 2001, with the alternative ending as a Special Feature. A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection in June 2011, and also includes the alternative ending.\nRevised ending.\nThe original ending of the American release of the film shows Hammer and Velda escaping from the burning house, staggering into the ocean as the words \"The End\" come over them on the screen. Sometime after its first release, the ending was altered on the film's negative, removing 82 seconds of footage showing the escape, and instead superimposing \"The End\" over the burning house. This implied that Hammer and Velda perished in the blaze, which some have interpreted as an apocalyptic ending. In 1997, the original ending was restored after the missing footage was discovered in the vaults of the Directors Guild by Glenn Erickson.\nInfluence.\nContemporary film scholars have named \"Kiss Me Deadly\" as one of the most influential examples of American film noir, praising its bleak and nihilistic tone, its version of pulp fiction archetypes, and its twist ending. Its apocalyptic elements earned it an entry in \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\". \"Kiss Me Deadly\" has been cited as a stylistic precursor of the French New Wave. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut has acknowledged its influence on his \"elliptic\" filmmaking style, as has Jean-Luc Godard. In the 1960s, both filmmakers touted the film as the single American film \"most responsible for the French New Wave.\" Homage is paid to the glowing suitcase MacGuffin in Alex Cox's \"Repo Man\" (1984), Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) and John Frankenheimer's \"Ronin\" (1998). The \"shiny blue suitcase\" is mentioned with other famous MacGuffins in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". When the Ark of the Covenant in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) is opened, the shot of Rene Belloq's face melting is directly inspired by that of Gabrielle opening the suitcase.\nIn \"Southland Tales\" (2006), Richard Kelly pays homage to the film, showing the main characters watching the beginning on their television; later the opening of the case is shown on screens on board the mega-Zeppelin. Two notable rock acts have borrowed the film's title for a song title. The first was the UK punk act Generation X, featuring singer Billy Idol, from their self titled debut LP (1978); this song would be also be featured on the soundtrack to \"SLC Punk!\" (1998). The second was a 1988 hit single from former Runaways lead guitarist and glam metal solo performer Lita Ford. In 1999, \"Kiss Me Deadly\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lee and Harry Lee. It stars Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson in a tale about the social complications that arise following the development of a romance between a well-to-do widow and a younger poorer man. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nCary Scott is an affluent widow in the town of Stoningham, in suburban New England, whose social life revolves around the weekend visits of her college-age son and daughter, her best friend's country-club activities, and a few men vying for her affection. Feeling stuck in a rut, she becomes interested in Ron Kirby, her arborist. He is an intelligent, down-to-earth, and respectful, yet passionate, younger man, and she discovers he is content with his simple life outside the materialistic society in which they live. Ron introduces Cary to his friends, who seem to have no need for wealth or status, and their exuberance provides a welcome contrast to her staid existence.\nRon and Cary fall in love, and Ron proposes. Cary accepts, but she has concerns about the viability of their relationship, due to their different ages, classes, and lifestyles. These concerns are magnified when she tells her children and friends about the engagement and is met with a solid wall of disapproval, and, eventually, she breaks up with Ron. Particularly influential in her change of mind are her children's protestations against Cary's plan to sell the family home and move to Ron's tree nursery, as they will not want to visit her there.\nAfter spending most of the Christmas season alone, Cary misses her life with Ron, but she thinks she has missed her opportunity for happiness because she mistakenly believes Ron is seeing another woman. On Christmas, her daughter announces she will be getting married soon and her son says that, since he is likely going to study abroad and then work overseas, they should start thinking about selling their house, which is too big for just Cary. She is overwhelmed by how pointless her sacrifice was, and her spirits are not lifted when her children give her a television set to fill her empty life.\nCary goes to see a doctor about recurrent headaches she has started having, and he suggests they are being caused by her body punishing her for ending her relationship with Ron. Leaving the appointment, she runs into one of Ron's friends, and in the course of their conversation she learns that Ron is still single. She goes to his property, but then changes her mind and leaves. Ron sees her from a precipice and excitedly, though unsuccessfully, tries to get her attention. The ground collapses out from under him, and he falls off the cliff.\nThat night, Ron's friend tells Cary about the accident, and she hurries over to his house. She decides she no longer wants to allow other people to dictate how she lives her life and settles in to nurse Ron back to health. When Ron regains consciousness, Cary tells him that she has come home.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jane Wyman as Cary Scott\nProduction.\nScreenplay.\nScreenwriter Peg Fenwick wrote the screenplay for \"All That Heaven Allows\" based on the 394-page novel of the same name by Edna L. Lee and Harry Lee. Notations made on various pages of a copy of the original screenplay owned by the New York Public Library indicate that the script was written in August 1954.\nSome scenes in the script differ from those in the finished film. For instance, in the screenplay Rock Hudson's character, Ron Kirby, lies on the grass eating his lunch, but in the final cut of the film, he has lunch with Jane Wyman's character, Cary Scott.\nSirk considered having Hudson's character die at the end of the film, but Ross Hunter, the film's producer, would not allow it, because he wanted a more positive ending.\nDevelopment.\nAfter the success of \"Magnificent Obsession\" in 1954, Universal-International Pictures wanted Sirk to make another film starring Wyman and Hudson. He found the screenplay for \"All That Heaven Allows\" \"rather impossible\", but was able to restructure it and use the big budget to film and edit the work exactly the way he wanted.\nWyman was 38 when she played the film's \"older woman\", who scandalizes society and her grown-up children by becoming engaged to a younger man. Hudson, \"the younger man\", was 29 at the time.\nFilming.\nSome exteriors for the film were shot on \"Colonial Street\", a studio backlot built by Paramount Pictures on the property of Universal Studios four years earlier and used in the film \"The Desperate Hours\". The set was re-designed to mimic an upper-middle class New England town. The film contains only one visible crane shot, when the camera scans over the fictional town of Stoningham during the opening credits. Tracking and dollying shots were used frequently for interior shots. The set was later featured on the television series \"Leave It to Beaver\".\nMusic.\nThe music that recurs throughout the film is Consolation No. 3 in D-flat major by Franz Liszt, along with frequent snatches of the finale to Brahms's First Symphony, the latter re-scored and sometimes elaborated. Also heard intermittently is \"Warum?\" (German for \"Why?\") by Robert Schumann, from the Fantasiest\u00fccke, Op. 12.\nRelease.\nThe film was released in Great Britain on August 25, 1955, several months ahead of its US premiere. In the United States, it opened in Los Angeles on Christmas Day 1955, and in New York City on February 28, 1956. The US release followed an extensive advertising campaign focusing on popular women's magazines such as \"McCall's\", \"Family Circle\", \"Woman's Day\", and \"Redbook,\" which referred to the film as a \"woman's picture\".\n\"Motion Picture Daily\" reported that the film earned $16,000 on its opening day and did \u201cabove average\u201d business in areas like Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, and Jacksonville.\nReception.\nThe film press compared the movie favorably to \"Magnificent Obsession\" (1954), which also starred Wyman and Hudson and was directed by Sirk. A review in \"Motion Picture Daily\" was generally positive and praised Sirk for his use of color and mise en sc\u00e8ne, saying: \"In a print by Technicolor, the exterior shots and the interior settings are so beautifully photographed that they point up the action of the story with telling effect.\"\nAlthough Sirk's reputation waned in the 1960s\u2014as he was dismissed as a director of dated and insubstantial Hollywood melodramas\u2014it was revived in the 1970s due to the praise of New German Cinema directors like Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the publication of Jon Halliday's \"Sirk on Sirk\" (1971), in which the filmmaker describes his aesthetic and (often-subversive) social perspective. His reputation, and that of \"All That Heaven Allows\", has grown since then, with critic Richard Brody describing him as a master of both melodrama and comedy, and the film as remarkable for its use of Henry David Thoreau's \"Walden\" as a homegrown American philosophy depicted as a \"vital and ongoing experience.\"\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"All That Heaven Allows\" has an approval rating of 91% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The consensus summarizes: \"Big heart, big drama, and even bigger colors, \"All That Heaven Allows\" is tip top Douglas Sirk.\"\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nReferences in other films.\n\"All That Heaven Allows\" inspired Fassbinder's \"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul\" (1974), in which a mature woman falls in love with an Arab man. It was spoofed by John Waters with his film \"Polyester\" (1981). Todd Haynes' \"Far from Heaven\" (2002) is an homage to Sirk's work, in particular \"All That Heaven Allows\" and \"Imitation of Life\" (1959). Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's \"8 Women\" (\"8 Femmes\", 2002) features winter scenes and deer reminiscent of this film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68110", "revid": "45984946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68110", "title": "Logging", "text": "Process of cutting, processing, and moving trees\nLogging is the process of cutting, processing, and moving trees to a location for transport. It may include skidding, on-site processing, and loading of trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars. In forestry, the term logging is sometimes used narrowly to describe the logistics of moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest, usually a sawmill or a lumber yard. In common usage, however, the term may cover a range of forestry or silviculture activities.\nLogging is the beginning of a supply chain that provides raw material for many products societies worldwide use for housing, construction, energy, and consumer paper products. Logging systems are also used to manage forests, reduce the risk of wildfires, and restore ecosystem functions, though their efficiency for these purposes has been challenged.\nLogging frequently has negative impacts. The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including the use of corrupt means to gain access to forests; extraction without permission or from a protected area; the cutting of protected species; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits. It may involve the so-called \"timber mafia\". Excess logging can lead to irreparable harm to ecosystems, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss. Infrastructure for logging can also lead to other environmental degradation. These negative environmental impacts can lead to environmental conflict. Additionally, there is significant occupational injury risk involved in logging.\nLogging can take many formats. Clearcutting (or \"block cutting\") is not necessarily considered a type of logging but a harvesting or silviculture method. Cutting trees with the highest value and leaving those with lower value, often diseased or malformed trees, is referred to as high grading. It is sometimes called selective logging, and confused with selection cutting, the practice of managing stands by harvesting a proportion of trees. Logging usually refers to above-ground forestry logging. Submerged forests exist on land that has been flooded by damming to create reservoirs. Harvesting trees from forests submerged by flooding or dam creation is called underwater logging, a form of timber recovery.\nClearcutting.\nClearcutting, or clearfelling, is a method of harvesting that removes essentially all the standing trees in a selected area. Depending on management objectives, a clearcut may or may not have reserve trees left to attain goals other than regeneration, including wildlife habitat management, mitigation of potential erosion or water quality concerns. Silviculture objectives for clearcutting, (for example, healthy regeneration of new trees on the site) and a focus on forestry distinguish it from deforestation. Other methods include shelterwood cutting, group selective, single selective, seed-tree cutting, patch cut, and retention cutting.\nOther logging methods.\nThe above operations can be carried out by different methods, of which the following three are considered industrial methods:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Tree-length logging / stem-only harvesting.\nTrees are felled and then delimbed and topped at the stump. The log is then transported to the landing, where it is bucked and loaded on a truck. This leaves the slash (and the nutrients it contains) in the cut area, where it must be further treated if wild land fires are of concern.\nWhole-tree logging.\nTrees and plants are felled and transported to the roadside with top and limbs intact. There have been advancements to the process which now allows a logger or harvester to cut the tree down, top, and delimb a tree in the same process. This ability is due to the advancement in the style felling head that can be used. The trees are then delimbed, topped, and bucked at the landing. This method requires that slash be treated at the landing. In areas with access to cogeneration facilities, the slash can be chipped and used for the production of electricity or heat. Full-tree harvesting also refers to utilization of the entire tree including branches and tops. This technique removes both nutrients and soil cover from the site and so can be harmful to the long-term health of the area if no further action is taken, however, depending on the species, many of the limbs are often broken off in handling so the result may not be as different from tree-length logging as it might seem.\nCut-to-length logging.\nCut-to-length logging is the process of felling, delimbing, bucking, and sorting (pulpwood, sawlog, etc.) at the stump area, leaving limbs and tops in the forest. Mechanical harvesters fell the tree, delimb, and buck it, and place the resulting logs in bunks to be brought to the landing by a skidder or forwarder. This method is routinely available for trees up to in diameter.\nTransporting logs.\nLogging methods have changed over time, driven by advancements in transporting timber from remote areas to markets. These shifts fall into three main eras: the manual logging era before the 1880s, the railroad logging era from the 1880s to World War II, and the modern mechanized era that began after the war.\nPre-1880s: Pre-Industrial Era.\nIn the early days, felled logs were transported using simple methods such as rivers to float tree trunks downstream to sawmills or paper mills. This practice, known as log driving or timber rafting, was the cheapest and most common. Some logs, due to high resin content, would sink and were known as deadheads. Logs were also moved with high-wheel loaders, a set of wheels over ten feet tall, initially pulled by oxen.\n1880s to World War II: Railroad Logging Era.\nAs the logging industry expanded, the 1880s saw the introduction of mechanized equipment like railroads and steam-powered machinery, marking the beginning of the railroad logging era. Logs were moved more efficiently by railroads built into remote forest areas, often supported by additional methods like high-wheel loaders, tractors and log flumes. The largest high-wheel loader, the \"Bunyan Buggie,\" was built in 1960 for service in California, featuring wheels high.\nPost-World War II: Modern Mechanized Logging.\nAfter World War II, mechanized logging equipment, including chainsaws, diesel trucks, and Caterpillar tractors, transformed the logging industry, making railroad-based logging obsolete. With the advent of these tools, transporting logs became more efficient as new roads were constructed to access remote forests. However, in protected areas like United States National Forests and designated wilderness zones, road building has been restricted to minimize environmental impacts such as erosion in riparian zones.\nToday, heavy machinery such as yarders and skyline systems are used to gather logs from steep terrain, while helicopters are used for heli-logging to minimize environmental impact. Less common forms of logging, like horse logging and the use of oxen, still exist but are mostly superseded.\nSafety considerations.\nLogging is a dangerous occupation. In the United States, it has consistently been one of the most hazardous industries and was recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.\nIn 2008, the logging industry employed 86,000 workers and accounted for 93 deaths. This resulted in a fatality rate of 108.1 deaths per 100,000 workers that year. This rate is over 30 times higher than the overall fatality rate. Forestry/logging-related injuries (fatal and non-fatal) are often difficult to track through formal reporting mechanisms. Thus, some programs have begun to monitor injuries through publicly available reports such as news media. The logging industry experiences the highest fatality rate of 23.2 per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers and a non-fatal incident rate of 8.5 per 100 FTE workers. The most common type of injuries or illnesses at work include musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which include an extensive list of \"inflammatory and degenerative conditions affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, peripheral nerves, and supporting blood vessels.\" Loggers work with heavy, moving weights, and use tools such as chainsaws and heavy equipment on uneven and sometimes steep or unstable terrain. Loggers also deal with severe environmental conditions, such as inclement weather and severe heat or cold. An injured logger is often far from professional emergency treatment.\nTraditionally, the cry of \"Timber!\" developed as a warning alerting fellow workers in an area that a tree is being felled, so they should be alert to avoid being struck. The term \"widowmaker\" for timber, typically a limb or branch that is no longer attached to a tree, but is still in the canopy either wedged in a crotch, tangled in other limbs, or miraculously balanced on another limb demonstrates another emphasis on situational awareness as a safety principle.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, the BC Forest Safety Council was created in September 2004 as a not-for-profit society dedicated to promoting safety in the forest sector. It works with employers, workers, contractors, and government agencies to implement fundamental changes necessary to make it safer to earn a living in forestry.\nThe risks experienced in logging operations can be somewhat reduced, where conditions permit, by the use of mechanical tree harvesters, skidders, and forwarders.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formerly romanized as Pusan, it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world. The surrounding \"Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region\" (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and part of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea's largest industrial area. The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million makes Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification. As of 2025, Busan Port is the primary port in Korea and the world's sixth-largest container port.\nBusan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million. The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City. Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.\nNames.\nThe name \"Busan\" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century. It officially replaced the earlier McCune\u2013Reischauer romanization \"Pusan\" in 2000. During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese reading of the city's name was \"Fuzan\".\nThe name (now written using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for \"Cauldron Mountain\", believed to be a former name of MtHwangnyeong (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; RR:\u00a0) west of the city center. The area's ancient state MtGeochil (; ; , \"Rough-Mountain Land\") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong (the later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757).\nHistory.\nThe area that Busan now occupies was inhabited during the Neolithic period. Artifacts dating to this period discovered near the coast include stone tools, pottery, sea shells, and animal bones. Fishing was a primary food source for people of this period. Bronze Age artifacts have been uncovered further inland. By this period, agriculture was being practiced.\nAround the first century, a chiefdom called Koch'ilsan-guk (; ) existed around what is now Dongnae District. At some point, it was absorbed by Silla and made an administrative division called Koch'ilsan-gun (; ). In 757, it was renamed Dongnae-gun (). In 835, the Buddhist temple Beomeosa was founded in the area.\nIn the Goryeo period (918\u20131392), the local Dongnae Jeong clan became a prominent presence in Korean politics. By this point, Dongnae's hot springs became famous, and have been attested to in writings of this period. By the end of the period, raids from \"wokou\" (Japanese pirates) intensified. One such invasion occurred in 1396. To defend against this, the fortress Dongnaeeupseong was established in the area.\nIn 1423, the port of Busan () and a \"waegwan\" (Japanese concession community) were established. During the reign of King Sejong the Great (r. 1418\u20131450), the population in Dongnae-hyeon was reportedly 2,416 people in 290 households. In Dongpyeong-hyeon, it was 627 people in 108 households. The \"waegwan\" was closed in 1510, but reopened in 1512.\nDuring the 1592\u20131598 Japanese invasions of Korea, various fortresses in the area defended Busan against the invasion. Fortresses included Busanjinseong, Dadaeposeong, and Dongnaeeupseong. Civilians formed righteous armies (volunteer militias) and joined in the fight. After the siege and capture of Busanjin in 1592, most of Busanjin's Korean prisoners and civilians were massacred. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed.\nIn 1605, the shrine Songgongsa was built to honor those who died defending Korea during the invasions. The shrine was dubbed Chungnyeolsa in 1624. In 1607, a \"waegwan\" was reestablished in Dumopo (; ); in 1678 it was moved to Choryang (; ; now around Yongdusan). In 1763, Busan became the first place in Korea to have sweet potatoes, which arrived from Tsushima Island in Japan. In 1759, the population was reportedly 25,753 people in 6,657 households.\nIn 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the Treaty of Ganghwa. In 1877, a concession was established in Busan, and consulates of Japan, Qing, and the United Kingdom were established. In 1883, the port was opened, and a Busan Customs Office (; ) was established. In 1895, Dongnae-bu was made part of South Gyeongsang Province. It was demoted to a \"gun\" in 1903, and made a \"bu\" again in 1906. After the beginning of the 1910\u20131945 Japanese colonial period, in 1914 it was made a \"gun\" again. In 1908, Busan was connected to the Gyeongbu Line via Busan station. In 1909, a ferry service was opened between Busan and Shimonoseki in Japan. In 1914, Dongnae-bu was reorganized into Busan-bu. In 1915, a tram was opened between Busanjin and the Dongnae Hot Springs. The following year, the city tram opened.\"\"\nDuring the Japanese rule, Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924.\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to \"The Korea Times\", around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a \"de facto\" capital of South Korea. UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.\nIn 1963, Busan separated from South Gyeongsang Province to become the first Directly Governed City of South Korea. In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.\nGeography.\nBusan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about . Busan borders low mountains to the north and west, and the Korea Strait to the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.\nThe closest overseas area to Busan is Tsushima, Japan, with a distance of about . The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is Fukuoka, roughly 180\u00a0km (112 miles) away. Busan and Fukuoka are also sister cities.\nClimate.\nLocated on the southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a subtropical monsoon climate influenced by East Asian monsoon (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\", bordering on \"Cwa\"). Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is on 14 August 2016, while the lowest temperature ever recorded is on 13 January 1915. May to July, late spring and early summer, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late summer, and early fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities. Typhoon Hinnamnor on September 6, 2022, caused destruction in Busan as a category 2, producing high waves, destructive winds, and flooding. Busan is the most prone city in South Korea to typhoons and other natural disasters.\nOctober and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cool and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea, except Jeju Province and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area have the least snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 4 days per year.\nAdministrative divisions.\nIn 1957, Busan adopted a division system with the creation of six \"gu\" (districts): Busanjin District, Dong District, Dongnae District, Jung District, Seo District, and Yeongdo District. Today, Busan has divided into fifteen \"gu\" and one \"gun\" (county).\nEconomy.\nBusan is the second largest city in Korea, a maritime logistics hub in Northeast Asia with its world-class mega ports, and a gateway to the Eurasian continent.

The city's economy is made up of the service industry (70.3%), manufacturing (19.8%), construction (5.9%), agriculture &amp; fisheries (0.8%), and other sectors (3.2%).\nAs the sixth largest port in the world, the port of Busan processed 21.81 million TEU of container cargo volume in 2020. The port's container terminal has 43 berths - 20 berths at the North Port, and 23 berths at the Busan New Port (including 2 multi-purpose berths).

The area was originally the location of the local Chinatown and still contains a Chinese school. The area originally served foreign sailors and American military personnel, but in the 1990s, with the growth of South Korea's ties with Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, large numbers of Russian-speaking traders and migrants arrived. This led to the emergence of cafes, shops, and services with Cyrillic signage.\nHaedong Yonggung temple is one of three sacred places related to the Goddess Buddha.\nGamcheon Cultural Village was created in the 1950s as a residential community along a mountain slope.

Special foods were prepared for the officers such as \"Dongnae pajeon\" (), a variant of \"pajeon\" (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick batter of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is \"milmyeon\" () (lit.\u2009'wheat noodle') a version of \"naengmyeon\", cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.) \"Dwaeji gukbap\" () (lit.\u2009'pork/pig soup rice') is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide. Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.\nHot spring resorts and spas.\nBusan has the largest hot spring resorts and facilities in Korea. Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea.\nIn popular culture.\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Sh\u014dhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.\nIt is frequently used as a film location, best known in the west for Marvel's \"Black Panther\" and Apple's \"Pachinko\", but also for the Korean market productions of \"Train to Busan\", \"Old Boy\", and \"Decision to Leave\", as well as the popular K-Drama \"Reply 1997\", highlighting the distinct \nGyeongsang dialect, which is comparable to a Scottish English in relation to standard British English.\nWorks set in Busan tend to be crime noirs. Additionally, Busan often appears as an escape location or disaster area. Stories where characters escape to Busan to flee accidents or disasters in Seoul and then escape overseas are quite common clich\u00e9s in Korean disaster films. Train to Busan carries out an escape to Busan, as the title suggests.\nUntil the late 1990s, most dramas, movies, commercials, and music videos were filmed in the Seoul area, making filming outside Seoul quite rare. In the early 2000s, it was relatively easy to obtain permits for road closures and explosion scenes in Busan that would have been impossible in Seoul. Thanks to active support from the city, word of mouth started in the film industry, leading to a preference for filming in the Busan area. In particular, the film \"Haeundae\" was a box office success, achieving 10 million viewers.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBetween 1945 and 1951, the city's population grew from 280,000 to 840,000. It decreased from 3,513,777 in 2015 to 3,266,598 in 2024. This decline, which accelerated in the 1990s, is attributed to South Korea's economic shift towards high-tech industries, concentrated around Seoul, and away from Busan's traditional manufacturing base.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2024, 29% followed Buddhism and 21% followed Christianity (14% Protestantism and 7% Catholicism), and 5% other religions. 45% of the population is irreligious.\nSports.\nThe city planned to bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but withdrew after the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to Pyeongchang, also located in South Korea.

While the term \"sports curse\" is not commonly used in Korean, the failures of its local teams during the 2000s and 2010s have been well-documented and their long-suffering passionate fans often been humorously highlighted by the media. KBO League team Lotte Giants have not won a Korean Series title since the 1990s while K League original member Daewoo Royals (later Busan IPark) went through ownership changes and was relegated to the second division in 2015, ending over three decades in the top division. The last time a Busan team had won a title was in 1997, when Kia won the inaugural KBL Championship and Daewoo Royals won the K League title. Professional basketball teams Busan KCC Egis (men) and Busan BNK Sum (women) ended the drought in 2024 and 2025 respectively by winning their respective championships, the latter becoming the first ever Busan-based franchise to win its championship title at home and coincidentally with a Busan native as its head coach.

He is entrusted by his father, Issac, with the family's entire fortune in money, jewels, rugs, whatever is greatest in value and transportable, including the family donkey.\nOnce successful, he is to send first for his sisters, then his brothers, and establish them safely and prosperously there as well. To do this he will invest in the carpet business of his father's cousin Odysseus by buying his way in with his family's meager accumulated wealth. Though this is his father's dream, it is not Stavros' as he is still determined to go to America.\nStavros' odyssey begins with a long voyage on donkey and on foot through the impoverished towns and villages of the Anatolian countryside. Along the way, the na\u00efve young dreamer is robbed of everything, kills the thief in retribution, and arrives at his cousin's home penniless. The older man, who had deceived Stavros' father, is deeply disappointed, as he was counting on Issac's wealth to rescue his failing carpet business. In an attempt to exploit a valuable opportunity Stavros still represents to him, Odysseus proposes that his handsome young cousin marry the plain and needy Thomna, daughter of a wealthy Greek carpet merchant, Aleko Sinnikoglou. Stavros realizes this would mean the end of his dream and adamantly refuses, abruptly leaving the angry cousin.\nNow homeless on the streets, Stavros survives by eating discarded food and working at backbreaking and hazardous jobs. He is befriended by a streetwise older man, Garabet, who helps him toward his dream. After nine months of scrimping and self-denial, Stavros has saved nine Turkish pounds towards the 110 pound third class passage to New York, but he has every penny thieved by a prostitute in his first sexual encounter.\nClinging to Garabet, he ends up at a gathering of local anarchists planning a terrorist bombing. However, before they can disburse, they are slaughtered by police gunfire. Left for dead, Stavros ends up in a hospital, only to be thrown atop a wagon filled with dead bodies headed for disposal in the sea. He accidentally slides off and all but crawls back to his cousin's.\nOdysseus takes pity on the young man and allows him to recover at his home. Broken for the moment, Stavros agrees to marry his intended bride. Before the ceremony she questions his sullen silence, and he admits that he still plans to emigrate to America by using her dowry money to buy a ticket as soon as he can slip away after they are wed.\nAt this point Stavros becomes reacquainted with Hohannes, a young Armenian whom he had aided with food and clothing before his original voyage to Constantinople. Hohannes informs him that he is being sponsored to America by an employer seeking indentured labor, two years' worth in return for passage. By good fortune, Stavros begins an affair with Sophia, the sexually neglected, middle-aged wife of wealthy Armenian-American rug merchant Artoon Kebabian, a client of his prospective father-in-law. Using money from Sophia, Stavros buys a ticket to New York and leaves Thomna heartbroken. He ends up on the same ship as the Kebabians, he in steerage, they in first class.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic the ship lies just offshore of New York City waiting to clear quarantine. Sophia sends her servant to fetch Stavros, and the two have a tryst while Artoon sleeps. He awakes, discovers the affair, and taunts Stavros, who responds by physically attacking Kebabian. Stavros is arrested and sentenced by the ship's captain to be returned to Turkey.\nHohannes, who is scarcely able to pass inspection by the visiting immigration doctor by hiding his advanced tuberculosis, realizes Stavros will die if he is sent back, and he will die anyway. Returning his friend's generosity, he jumps off the ship to his death. Now short a man, the prospective American employer simply allows Stavros to assume Hohannes' identity and slip past immigration officials on Ellis Island, gifted a straw boater by Sophia and a new 'American' name by the chief inspector, \"Joe Arness\".\nIn return, even though he had paid his own passage, \u201cJoe\u201d will have to work off Hohannes' debt by shining shoes, earning only his tips.\nA closing voiceover reveals that Joe was able to succeed in New York, and one by one brought every family member over \u2013 but his father, who, last in the line, died before his chance came.\nCast.\nUncredited:\nProduction.\nInspired by the life of his uncle, Avraam Elia Kazantzoglou, Kazan used little-known cast members, with the entire story line revolving around the central performance of Greek actor Stathis Giallelis, twenty-one years old at the time of production, who is in virtually every scene of the nearly three-hour movie. Production began in 1962.\nThe production, hampered by loss of its original financial backers, on-location hostility from Turkish authorities and onlookers, as well as other problems, continued into 1963. Powerful elements within Turkey came to be convinced that the country's national institutions and historical perspective upon turn of the 20th century events would be unfavorably portrayed by the Greek director and, when Kazan decided to transfer the troubled production to Greece, customs officials confiscated the cans of what they considered to be finished film, but owing to a prescient switch of labels between exposed and unexposed product, the valuable cargo survived.\nThe picture was filmed on location at the Alfa Studios in Athens, Greece, as well in rural Greece, Istanbul, New York City, and at the Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, in 1.66:1 aspect ratio on 35-millimeter stock. Kazan makes a voice-only introduction during the opening scenes, a short voice-only epilogue in the closing scene, followed by a recitation of the lead actors and technical personnel of the film. Tom Holland narrates the picture.\nRelease.\nThe film had its New York premiere on December 15, 1963.\nReception.\nBetween summer 1964 and spring 1965, it was seen in virtually every major Western European city. \"America America\" is one of Martin Scorsese's favorite films.\nPreservation.\nIn 2001, \"America, America\" was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.\nVHS and DVD.\nIts VHS release came on November 28, 1994, and a French (region 2) DVD boxed set (with Kazan's \"Baby Doll\" and \"A Face in the Crowd\") was released on December 3, 2002. The film was released by Warner Bros. on DVD in the US on February 8, 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a T0 space, all points are topologically distinguishable.\nThis condition, called the T0 condition, is the weakest of the separation axioms. Nearly all topological spaces normally studied in mathematics are T0 spaces. In particular, all T1 spaces, i.e., all spaces in which for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other, are T0 spaces. This includes all T2 (or Hausdorff) spaces, i.e., all topological spaces in which distinct points have disjoint neighbourhoods. In another direction, every sober space (which may not be T1) is T0; this includes the underlying topological space of any scheme. Given any topological space one can construct a T0 space by identifying topologically indistinguishable points.\nT0 spaces that are not T1 spaces are exactly those spaces for which the specialization preorder is a nontrivial partial order. Such spaces naturally occur in computer science, specifically in denotational semantics.\nDefinition.\nA T0 space is a topological space in which every pair of distinct points is topologically distinguishable. That is, for any two different points \"x\" and \"y\" there is an open set that contains one of these points and not the other. More precisely the topological space \"X\" is Kolmogorov or formula_1 if and only if:\nIf formula_2 and formula_3, there exists an open set \"O\" such that either formula_4 or formula_5.\nNote that topologically distinguishable points are automatically distinct. On the other hand, if the singleton sets {\"x\"} and {\"y\"} are separated then the points \"x\" and \"y\" must be topologically distinguishable. That is,\n\"separated\" \u21d2 \"topologically distinguishable\" \u21d2 \"distinct\"\nThe property of being topologically distinguishable is, in general, stronger than being distinct but weaker than being separated. In a T0 space, the second arrow above also reverses; points are distinct if and only if they are distinguishable. This is how the T0 axiom fits in with the rest of the separation axioms.\nExamples and counter examples.\nNearly all topological spaces normally studied in mathematics are T0. In particular, all Hausdorff (T2) spaces, T1 spaces and sober spaces are T0.\nOperating with T0 spaces.\nCommonly studied topological spaces are all T0.\nIndeed, when mathematicians in many fields, notably analysis, naturally run across non-T0 spaces, they usually replace them with T0 spaces, in a manner to be described below. To motivate the ideas involved, consider a well-known example. The space L2(R) is meant to be the space of all measurable functions \"f\" from the real line R to the complex plane C such that the Lebesgue integral of |\"f\"(\"x\")|2 over the entire real line is finite.\nThis space should become a normed vector space by defining the norm ||\"f\"|| to be the square root of that integral. The problem is that this is not really a norm, only a seminorm, because there are functions other than the zero function whose (semi)norms are zero.\nThe standard solution is to define L2(R) to be a set of equivalence classes of functions instead of a set of functions directly.\nThis constructs a quotient space of the original seminormed vector space, and this quotient is a normed vector space. It inherits several convenient properties from the seminormed space; see below.\nIn general, when dealing with a fixed topology T on a set \"X\", it is helpful if that topology is T0. On the other hand, when \"X\" is fixed but T is allowed to vary within certain boundaries, to force T to be T0 may be inconvenient, since non-T0 topologies are often important special cases. Thus, it can be important to understand both T0 and non-T0 versions of the various conditions that can be placed on a topological space.\nThe Kolmogorov quotient.\nTopological indistinguishability of points is an equivalence relation. No matter what topological space \"X\" might be to begin with, the quotient space under this equivalence relation is always T0. This quotient space is called the Kolmogorov quotient of \"X\", which we will denote KQ(\"X\"). Of course, if \"X\" was T0 to begin with, then KQ(\"X\") and \"X\" are naturally homeomorphic.\nCategorically, Kolmogorov spaces are a reflective subcategory of topological spaces, and the Kolmogorov quotient is the reflector.\nTopological spaces \"X\" and \"Y\" are Kolmogorov equivalent when their Kolmogorov quotients are homeomorphic. Many properties of topological spaces are preserved by this equivalence; that is, if \"X\" and \"Y\" are Kolmogorov equivalent, then \"X\" has such a property if and only if \"Y\" does.\nOn the other hand, most of the \"other\" properties of topological spaces \"imply\" T0-ness; that is, if \"X\" has such a property, then \"X\" must be T0.\nOnly a few properties, such as being an indiscrete space, are exceptions to this rule of thumb.\nEven better, many structures defined on topological spaces can be transferred between \"X\" and KQ(\"X\").\nThe result is that, if you have a non-T0 topological space with a certain structure or property, then you can usually form a T0 space with the same structures and properties by taking the Kolmogorov quotient.\nThe example of L2(R) displays these features.\nFrom the point of view of topology, the seminormed vector space that we started with has a lot of extra structure; for example, it is a vector space, and it has a seminorm, and these define a pseudometric and a uniform structure that are compatible with the topology.\nAlso, there are several properties of these structures; for example, the seminorm satisfies the parallelogram identity and the uniform structure is complete. The space is not T0 since any two functions in L2(R) that are equal almost everywhere are indistinguishable with this topology.\nWhen we form the Kolmogorov quotient, the actual L2(R), these structures and properties are preserved.\nThus, L2(R) is also a complete seminormed vector space satisfying the parallelogram identity.\nBut we actually get a bit more, since the space is now T0.\nA seminorm is a norm if and only if the underlying topology is T0, so L2(R) is actually a complete normed vector space satisfying the parallelogram identity\u2014otherwise known as a Hilbert space.\nAnd it is a Hilbert space that mathematicians (and physicists, in quantum mechanics) generally want to study. Note that the notation L2(R) usually denotes the Kolmogorov quotient, the set of equivalence classes of square integrable functions that differ on sets of measure zero, rather than simply the vector space of square integrable functions that the notation suggests.\nRemoving T0.\nAlthough norms were historically defined first, people came up with the definition of seminorm as well, which is a sort of non-T0 version of a norm. In general, it is possible to define non-T0 versions of both properties and structures of topological spaces. First, consider a property of topological spaces, such as being Hausdorff. One can then define another property of topological spaces by defining the space \"X\" to satisfy the property if and only if the Kolmogorov quotient KQ(\"X\") is Hausdorff. This is a sensible, albeit less famous, property; in this case, such a space \"X\" is called \"preregular\". (There even turns out to be a more direct definition of preregularity). Now consider a structure that can be placed on topological spaces, such as a metric. We can define a new structure on topological spaces by letting an example of the structure on \"X\" be simply a metric on KQ(\"X\"). This is a sensible structure on \"X\"; it is a pseudometric. (Again, there is a more direct definition of pseudometric.)\nIn this way, there is a natural way to remove T0-ness from the requirements for a property or structure. It is generally easier to study spaces that are T0, but it may also be easier to allow structures that aren't T0 to get a fuller picture. The T0 requirement can be added or removed arbitrarily using the concept of Kolmogorov quotient.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Harrison Ford and Bo Hopkins also appear. Set in Modesto, California, in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock and roll cultures popular among Lucas' age group at that time. Through a series of vignettes, it tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures throughout a single summer night.\nWhile Lucas was working on his first film, \"THX 1138\", Coppola asked him to write a coming-of-age film. The genesis of \"American Graffiti\" took place in Modesto in the early 1960s, during Lucas's teenage years. He was unsuccessful in pitching the concept to financiers and distributors but found favor at Universal Pictures after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming began in San Rafael, California, but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to Petaluma, California. It is the first film to be produced by his Lucasfilm production banner.\n\"American Graffiti\" premiered on August 2, 1973, at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland and was released in the United States on August 11, 1973. Despite low expectations from Universal Pictures, who initially planned to release it as a television film, the film was given a theatrical release after Francis Ford Coppola, fresh off the success of \"The Godfather\", agreed to attach his name as an executive producer. Completed on a modest budget of $777,000 (equivalent to about $4.1 million in 2023), \"American Graffiti\" became one of the most profitable films of all time, earning over $200 million in box office and home video revenue.\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It is widely credited with launching a wave of 1950s and early 1960s nostalgia in American pop culture, influencing the teen comedy genre and reviving interest in early rock and roll among the baby boomer generation. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nOn their last evening of summer vacation in 1962, high school graduates Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander meet their friends, confident drag-racing king John Milner and unpopular but well-meaning Terry \"The Toad\" Fields, at Mel's Drive-In in Modesto, California. Set to travel \"Back East\" with Steve in the morning to start college, Curt has second thoughts about leaving. Laurie, Steve's girlfriend and Curt's sister, is hurt when Steve suggests they see other people while he is away to \"strengthen\" their relationship.\nEn route to the high school sock hop, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white Ford Thunderbird who mouths \"I love you\", leading him to desperately search for her throughout the night. Leaving the dance, he is coerced into joining a group of greasers called \"the Pharaohs\" in stealing coins from arcade machines and hooking a chain to a police car, ripping out its back axle. During a tense ride, the Pharaoh leader tells Curt that the blonde is a prostitute, which he does not believe.\nAllowed to take care of Steve's car while he is at college, Terry cruises around the strip and picks up the rebellious Debbie. Telling her he is known as \"Terry the Tiger\", he spends the night trying to impress her, lying about the car and purchasing alcohol with no ID. The car is stolen while they share a romantic interlude and later, after the alcohol has made Terry violently sick, he attempts to steal it back. The thieves beat on Terry until John shows up and fends off the attackers. Terry eventually admits the truth to Debbie and reveals he rides a Vespa scooter; she suggests it is \"almost a motorcycle\" and says she had fun, agreeing to meet up with him again.\nSeeking cruising company, John inadvertently picks up Carol, a precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. He lies to suspicious friends that she is a cousin he is stuck babysitting, and they have a series of petty arguments until another car's young male occupants harass her as she attempts to walk home alone, and John decides to protect her. The racer, Bob Falfa, wants to compete for John's drag-racing crown. During his night of challenging anyone he comes across, Bob picks up an emotional Laurie after a long-brewing argument with Steve.\nLeaving the Pharaohs, Curt drives to the radio station to ask the omnipresent disc jockey \"Wolfman Jack\" to read a message on the air for the blonde. A station employee tells him the Wolfman does not work there and the shows are taped, claiming the Wolfman \"is everywhere\". He says the Wolfman would advise Curt to \"get your ass in gear\" and see the world but promises to have the Wolfman air the request. As Curt leaves, he realizes the employee is the Wolfman, who reads the message to the blonde asking her to call Curt at the Mel's Drive-In payphone.\nAfter taking Carol home, John is goaded by Bob into drag racing along Paradise Road outside the city with a crowd of spectators. Terry starts the race and John takes the lead but Bob's tire blows out, causing his car to swerve into a ditch and roll over before bursting into flames. Steve rushes to the wreck as Laurie and Bob crawl out before the car explodes. While John helps his rival to safety, Laurie begs Steve not to leave her and he assures her that he will stay with her in Modesto.\nAn exhausted Curt is awakened by the payphone and finally speaks to the mysterious blonde, who hints at the possibility of meeting the following night, but Curt replies that he is leaving town. In the morning at the airfield, he says goodbye to his parents and friends; after takeoff, he sees the white Thunderbird driving along the road below, and gazes thoughtfully into the sky.\nAn epilogue reveals the four male friends' fates: in 1964, John was killed by a drunk driver; in 1965, Terry was reported missing in action near An L\u1ed9c, South Vietnam; Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto, and Curt is a writer living in Canada.\nCast.\nMain credits.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Richard Dreyfuss as Curt Henderson\nNotable ensemble.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jana Bellan as Budda\nDevelopment.\nInspiration.\nDuring the production of \"THX 1138\" (1971), producer Francis Ford Coppola challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences. Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences cruising in Modesto, California. \"Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what my generation used as a way of meeting girls\", Lucas explained. As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but he ultimately dropped the idea.\nAdding in semiautobiographical connotations, Lucas set the story in his hometown of 1962 Modesto. The characters Curt Henderson, John Milner, and Terry \"The Toad\" Fields also represent different stages from his younger life. Curt is modeled after Lucas's personality during USC, while John is based on Lucas's teenaged street-racing and junior-college years, and hot rod enthusiasts he had known from the Kustom Kulture in Modesto. Terry represents Lucas's nerd years as a freshman in high school, specifically his \"bad luck\" with dating. The filmmaker was also inspired by Federico Fellini's \"I Vitelloni\" (1953).\nAfter the financial failure of \"THX 1138\", Lucas wanted the film to act as a release for a world-weary audience:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[\"THX\"] was about real things that were going on and the problems we're faced with. I realized after making \"THX\" that those problems are so real that most of us have to face those things every day, so we're in a constant state of frustration. That just makes us more depressed than we were before. So I made a film where, essentially, we can get rid of some of those frustrations, the feeling that everything seems futile.\nUnited Artists.\nAfter Warner Bros. abandoned Lucas's early version of \"Apocalypse Now\" (during the post-production of \"THX 1138\"), the filmmaker decided to continue developing \"Another Quiet Night in Modesto\", eventually changing its title to \"American Graffiti\". To co-write a 15-page film treatment, Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who also added semiautobiographical material to the story. Lucas and his colleague Gary Kurtz began pitching the \"American Graffiti\" treatment to various Hollywood studios and production companies in an attempt to secure the financing needed to expand it into a screenplay, but they were unsuccessful. The potential financiers were concerned that music licensing costs would cause the film to go way over budget. Along with \"Easy Rider\" (1969), \"American Graffiti\" was one of the first films to eschew a traditional film score and successfully rely instead on synchronizing a series of popular hit songs with individual scenes.\n\"THX 1138\" was released in March 1971, and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct \"Lady Ice\", \"Tommy\", or \"Hair\". He turned down those offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct. During this time, Lucas conceived the idea for a space opera (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his \"Star Wars\" franchise. At the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, \"THX\" was chosen for the Directors' Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by \"American Graffiti\" and Lucas's space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 (equivalent to about $ in 2024 dollars) to develop \"Graffiti\" as a screenplay.\nLucas planned to spend another five weeks in Europe and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the screenplay by the time he returned, but they were about to start on their own film, \"Messiah of Evil\", so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called \"Barry and the Persuasions\", a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm\u2014his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.\nLucas was dismayed when he returned to America in June 1971 and read Walter's script, which was written in the style and tone of an exploitation film, similar to 1967's \"Hot Rods to Hell\". \"It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with playing chicken and things that kids didn't really do\", Lucas explained. \"I wanted something that was more like the way I grew up.\" Walter's script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents' permission. Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.\nAfter paying Walter, Lucas had exhausted his development fund from United Artists. He began writing a script, completing his first draft in just three weeks. Drawing upon his large collection of vintage records, Lucas wrote each scene with a particular song in mind as its musical backdrop. The cost of licensing the 75 songs Lucas wanted was one factor in United Artists' ultimate decision to reject the script; the studio also felt it was too experimental\u2014\"a musical montage with no characters\". United Artists also passed on \"Star Wars\", which Lucas shelved for the time being.\nUniversal Pictures.\nLucas spent the rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise financing for the \"American Graffiti\" script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end \"American Graffiti\" showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that mentioning the girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.\nLucas and producer Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed \"American Graffiti\" was not violent or sexual enough for the studio's standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege on the condition that he make \"American Graffiti\" on a strict low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.\nUniversal initially projected a $600,000 budget but added an additional $175,000 once producer Francis Ford Coppola signed on. This would allow the studio to advertise \"American Graffiti\" as \"from the man who gave you \"The Godfather\"\". The proposition also gave Universal first-look deals on Lucas's next two planned projects, \"Star Wars\" and \"Radioland Murders\". As he continued to work on the script, Lucas encountered difficulties on the Steve and Laurie storyline. Lucas, Katz, and Huyck worked on the third draft together, specifically on the scenes featuring Steve and Laurie.\nProduction proceeded with virtually no input or interference from Universal since \"American Graffiti\" was a low-budget film, and executive Ned Tanen had only modest expectations of its commercial success. However, Universal did object to the film's title, not knowing what \"American Graffiti\" meant; Lucas was dismayed when some executives assumed he was making an Italian film about feet. The studio, therefore, submitted a long list of over 60 alternative titles, with their favorite being \"Another Slow Night in Modesto\" and Coppola's \"Rock Around the Block\". They pushed hard to get Lucas to adopt any of the titles, but he was displeased with all the alternatives and persuaded Tanen to keep \"American Graffiti\".\nProduction.\nCasting.\nThe film's lengthy casting process was overseen by Fred Roos, who worked with producer Francis Ford Coppola on \"The Godfather\". Because \"American Graffiti\"'s main cast was for younger actors, the casting call and notices went through numerous high-school drama groups and community theaters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Among the actors was Mark Hamill, the future Luke Skywalker in Lucas's \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\nOver 100 unknown actors auditioned for Curt Henderson before Richard Dreyfuss was cast; George Lucas was impressed with Dreyfuss's thoughtful analysis of the role, and as a result, offered the actor his choice of Curt or Terry \"The Toad\" Fields. Roos, a former casting director on \"The Andy Griffith Show\", suggested Ron Howard for Steve Bolander; Howard accepted the role to break out of the mold of his career as a child actor. Howard would later appear in the very similar role of Richie Cunningham on the \"Happy Days\" sitcom. Bob Balaban turned down Terry out of fear of becoming typecast, a decision he later regretted. Charles Martin Smith, who, in his first year as a professional actor, had already appeared in two feature films, including 20th Century Fox's \"The Culpepper Cattle Co.\" and four TV episodes, was eventually cast in the role.\nAlthough Cindy Williams was cast as Laurie Henderson and enjoyed working with both Lucas and Howard, the actress hoped she would get the part of Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark. Mackenzie Phillips, who portrays Carol, was only 12, and under California law, producer Gary Kurtz had to become her legal guardian for the duration of filming. For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not have to cut his hair, in case he was offered other film or TV roles set in the \"present day\" of the 1970s. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a Stetson to cover his hair. Producer Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. \"George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public\", Jack reflected. \"The telephone calls [heard on the broadcasts] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people.\"\nFilming.\nAlthough \"American Graffiti\" is set in 1962 Modesto, Lucas believed the city had changed too much in ten years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated at the length of time it was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses, so withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.\nPetaluma, a similarly small town about north of San Rafael, was more cooperative, and \"American Graffiti\" moved there without the loss of a single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B-movie producer Sam Katzman (\"Rock Around the Clock\", \"Your Cheatin' Heart\", and the aforementioned \"Hot Rods to Hell\") in attempting to save money using low-budget filming methods.\nIn addition to Petaluma, other locations included Mel's Drive-In in San Francisco, Sonoma, Richmond, Novato, and the Buchanan Field Airport in Concord. The freshman hop dance was filmed in the Gus Gymnasium, previously known as the Boys Gym, at Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley.\nMore problems ensued during filming; Paul Le Mat was sent to the hospital after an allergic reaction to walnuts. Le Mat, Harrison Ford, and Bo Hopkins were claimed to be drunk most nights and every weekend, and had conducted climbing competitions to the top of the local Holiday Inn sign. One actor set fire to Lucas's motel room. Another night, Le Mat threw Richard Dreyfuss into a swimming pool, gashing Dreyfuss's forehead on the day before he was due to have his close-ups filmed. Dreyfuss also complained over the wardrobe that Lucas had chosen for the character. Ford was kicked out of his motel room at the Holiday Inn. In addition, two camera operators were nearly killed when filming the climactic race scene on Frates Road outside Petaluma. Principal photography ended on August 4, 1972.\nThe final scenes in the film, shot at Buchanan Field, feature a Douglas DC-7C airliner of Magic Carpet Airlines, which had previously been leased from owner Club America Incorporated by the rock band Grand Funk Railroad from March to June 1971.\nCinematography.\nLucas considered covering duties as the sole cinematographer, but dropped the idea. Instead, he elected to shoot \"American Graffiti\" using two cinematographers (as he had done in \"THX 1138\") and no formal director of photography. Two cameras were used simultaneously in scenes involving conversations between actors in different cars, which resulted in significant production time savings. After CinemaScope proved to be too expensive, Lucas decided \"American Graffiti\" should have a documentary-like feel, so he shot the film using Techniscope cameras. He believed that Techniscope, an inexpensive way of shooting on 35 mm film and using only half of the film's frame, would give a perfect widescreen format resembling 16 mm. Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas's openness for the cast to improvise scenes. He also used goofs for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith's arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel's Drive-In. Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems. As a result, Lucas commissioned help from friend Haskell Wexler, who was credited as the \"visual consultant\".\nEditing.\nLucas had wanted his then wife, Marcia, to edit \"American Graffiti\", but Universal executive Ned Tanen insisted on hiring Verna Fields, who had just finished editing Steven Spielberg's \"The Sugarland Express\". Fields worked on the first rough cut of the film before she left to resume work on \"What's Up, Doc?\". After Fields's departure, Lucas struggled with editing the film's story structure. He had originally written the script so that the four (Curt, Steve, John, and Toad) storylines were always presented in the same sequence (an \"ABCD\" plot structure). The first cut of \"American Graffiti\" was three and a half hours long, and to whittle the film down to a more manageable two hours, many scenes had to be cut, shortened, or combined. As a result, the film's structure became increasingly loose and no longer adhered to Lucas's original \"ABCD\" presentation. Lucas completed his final cut of \"American Graffiti\", which ran 112 minutes, in December 1972. Walter Murch assisted Lucas in post-production for audio mixing and sound design purposes. Murch suggested making Wolfman Jack's radio show the \"backbone\" of the film. \"The Wolfman was an ethereal presence in the lives of young people\", said producer Gary Kurtz, \"and it was that quality we wanted and obtained in the picture.\"\nSoundtrack.\nThe choice of music was crucial to the mood of each scene; it is diegetic music that the characters themselves can hear and therefore becomes an integral part of the action. George Lucas had to be realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances, though, and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for sound-alikes. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas's first choices, but not to RCA\u2014with the consequence that Elvis Presley is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Clearing the music licensing rights had cost approximately $90,000, and as a result, no money was left for a traditional film score. \"I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama\", Lucas later explained.\nWhen it came to the ending credits, only the song's title, artist, and the record label was listed. However, the names of the composers and lyricists, as well as the publishing company and the copyright year, were completely left out. This resulted in several of the songwriters filing lawsuits against MCA for leaving their names out of the credits. A settlement was reached in which MCA paid the damages to the songwriters, as well as to the publishing companies.\nA soundtrack album for the film, \"41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti\", was issued by MCA Records. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of \"Gee\" by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film.\nRelease.\nDespite unanimous praise at a January 1973 test screening attended by Universal executive Ned Tanen, the studio told Lucas they wanted to re-edit his original cut of \"American Graffiti\". Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to \"buy the film\" from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024) that it had cost to make it. 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures made similar offers to the studio. Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have William Hornbeck re-edit the film.\nWhen Coppola's \"The Godfather\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (amounting to a few minutes) from Lucas's cut. These include an encounter between Toad and a fast-talking car salesman, an argument between Steve and his former teacher Mr. Kroot at the sock hop, and an effort by Bob Falfa to serenade Laurie with \"Some Enchanted Evening\". The studio initially thought that the film was only fit for release as a television film.\nVarious studio employees who had seen the film began talking it up, and its reputation grew through word of mouth. The studio dropped the TV film idea and began arranging for a limited release in selected theaters in Los Angeles and New York. Universal presidents Sidney Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman heard about the praise the film had been garnering in LA and New York, and the marketing department amped up its promotion strategy for it, investing an additional $500,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024) in marketing and promotion. The film was released in the United States on August 11, 1973 to sleeper hit reception. The film had cost only $1.27\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) to produce and market, but yielded worldwide box office gross revenues of more than $55\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024). It had only modest success outside the United States and Canada, but became a cult film in France.\nUniversal reissued \"Graffiti\" on May 26, 1978, with Dolby sound and earned an additional $63\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024), which brought the total revenue for the two releases to $118\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024). The reissue included stereophonic sound and a couple of minutes the studio had removed from Lucas's original cut. All home video releases also included these scenes. Also, the date of John Milner's death was changed from June 1964 to December 1964 to fit the narrative structure of the upcoming sequel, \"More American Graffiti\". At the end of its theatrical run, \"American Graffiti\" had one of the greatest profit-to-cost ratios of a motion picture ever.\nProducer Francis Ford Coppola regretted having not financed the film himself. Lucas recalled, \"He would have made $30\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) on the deal. He never got over it and he still kicks himself.\" It was the 13th-highest-grossing film of all time in 1977 and, adjusted for inflation, is currently the 43rd highest. By the 1990s, \"American Graffiti\" had earned more than $200\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) in box-office gross and home video sales. In December 1997, \"Variety\" reported that the film had earned an additional $55.13\u00a0million in rental revenue (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nUniversal Studios first released the film on DVD in September 1998, and once more as a double feature with \"More American Graffiti\" (1979) in January 2004. The 1978 version of the film was used, with an additional digital change to the sky in the opening title sequence. Additionally, the 1998 DVD and VHS releases were both THX certified as well. Universal released the film on Blu-ray with a new digitally remastered picture supervised by George Lucas on May 31, 2011. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, a 4K restoration of the film updated with a brand new 5.1 sound mix was re-released domestically on August 27 and 30 before a Ultra HD Blu-ray release on November 7, 2023.\nReception.\n\"American Graffiti\" received widespread critical acclaim. Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being \"not only a great movie, but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in remembering exactly how it was to be alive at that cultural instant\". Gene Siskel awarded three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that although the film suffered from an \"overkill\" of nostalgia, particularly with regards to a soundtrack so overstuffed that it amounted to \"one of those golden-oldie TV blurbs\", it was still \"well-made, does achieve moments of genuine emotion, and does provide a sock (hop) full of memories.\"\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"American Graffiti\" is such a funny, accurate movie, so controlled and efficient in its narrative, that it stands to be overpraised to the point where seeing it will be an anticlimax.\" A. D. Murphy from \"Variety\" felt \"American Graffiti\" was a vivid \"recall of teenage attitudes and morals, told with outstanding empathy and compassion through an exceptionally talented cast of unknown actors\". Charles Champlin of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"masterfully executed and profoundly affecting movie\". Jay Cocks of \"Time\" magazine wrote that \"American Graffiti\" \"reveals a new and welcome depth of feeling. Few films have shown quite so well the eagerness, the sadness, the ambitions and small defeats of a generation of young Americans.\" Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" was less enthused, writing that the film \"fails to be anything more than a warm, nice, draggy comedy, because there's nothing to back up the style. The images aren't as visually striking as they would be if only there were a mind at work behind them; the movie has no resonance except from the jukebox sound and the eerie, nocturnal jukebox look.\" She also noted with disdain that the epilogue did not bother to mention the fates of any of the women characters. Dave Kehr, writing in the \"Chicago Reader\", called the film a brilliant work of popular art that redefined nostalgia as a marketable commodity, while establishing a new narrative style.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . The website's critics consensus reads, \"One of the most influential of all teen films, \"American Graffiti\" is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 97, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nThemes.\n\"American Graffiti\" depicts multiple characters going through a coming of age, such as the decisions to attend college or reside in a small town. The 1962 setting represents nearing an end of an era in American society and pop culture. The early 1960s musical backdrop also links between the early years of rock 'n' roll in the mid- to late 1950s (i.e., Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Elvis Presley, and Buddy Holly), and mid-1960s, beginning with the January 1964 arrival of The Beatles and the following British Invasion, which Don McLean's \"American Pie\" and the early 1970s revival of 1950s acts and oldies paralleled during the conception and filming.\nThe setting is two months before the Cuban Missile Crisis, and before the outbreak of the Vietnam War and the John F. Kennedy assassination and before the peak years of the counterculture movement. \"American Graffiti\" evokes mankind's relationship with machines, notably the elaborate number of hot rods\u2014having been called a \"classic-car flick\", representative of the motor car's importance to American culture at the time it was made. Another theme is teenagers' obsession with radio, especially with the inclusion of Wolfman Jack and his mysterious and mythological faceless (to most) voice.\nAccolades.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nLegacy.\nInternet reviewer MaryAnn Johanson acknowledged that \"American Graffiti\" rekindled public and entertainment interest in the 1950s and early 1960s, and influenced other films such as \"The Lords of Flatbush\" (1974) and \"Cooley High\" (1975) and the TV series \"Happy Days\". Alongside other films from the New Hollywood era, \"American Graffiti\" is often cited for helping give birth to the summer blockbuster. The film's box-office success made George Lucas an instant millionaire. He gave an amount of the film's profits to Haskell Wexler for his visual consulting help during filming, and to Wolfman Jack for \"inspiration\". Lucas's net worth was now $4\u00a0million, and he set aside a $300,000 independent fund for his long-cherished space opera project, which would eventually become the basis for \"Star Wars\" (1977).\nThe financial success of \"Graffiti\" also gave Lucas opportunities to establish more elaborate development for Lucasfilm, Skywalker Sound, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. Based on the success of the 1978 reissue, Universal began production for the sequel \"More American Graffiti\" (1979). Lucas and writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz later collaborated on \"Howard the Duck\" (1986) and \"Radioland Murders\" (1994). They were both released by Universal Pictures, for which Lucas acted as executive producer. \"Radioland Murders\" features characters intended to be Curt and Laurie Henderson's parents, Roger and Penny Henderson. In 1995, \"American Graffiti\" was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1997, the city of Modesto, California (where the film largely takes place), honored Lucas with a statue dedication of \"American Graffiti\" at George Lucas Plaza. Furthermore, the city has an annual classic car festival in honor of its graffiti culture heritage.\nDirector David Fincher credited \"American Graffiti\" as a visual influence for \"Fight Club\" (1999). Lucas's \"\" (2002) features references to the film. The yellow airspeeder that Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use to pursue bounty hunter Zam Wesell is based on John Milner's yellow deuce coupe, while Dex's Diner is reminiscent of Mel's Drive-In. Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman conducted the \"rear axle\" experiment on the January 11, 2004, episode of \"MythBusters\".\nGiven the popularity of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is surprising. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ron Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow deuce coupe and the Pharaohs' red Mercury went unsold, despite the coupe being priced as low as $1500. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX\u00a0138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science-fiction film (\"THX 1138\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The plot concerns a Baptist woman who, after being accidentally shot by her husband, is sent to a crossroads, where Satan tries to lead her astray.\nThe film was very successful and, in 1991, was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn a small rural village with an African American population, a church group is holding a riverside baptismal service, and one of the faithful being immersed is the recently married Martha (Cathryn Caviness). However, Martha's husband Ras (Spencer Williams) is absent from the service \u2013 he claims he was hunting, but he actually poached a neighbor's boar. At home, Ras accidentally shoots Martha when his rifle drops on the floor and discharges. The church congregation gathers at Martha's bedside to pray for her recovery, and during this period an angel (Rogenia Goldthwaite) arrives to take Martha's spirit from her body. She is brought to the Crossroads between Heaven and Hell, and initially she is tempted by the slick Judas Green (Frank H. McClennan), who is an agent for Satan (James B. Jones). Judas takes Martha to a nightclub, where the floor show includes an acrobat and a jazz singer. Judas arranges to have Martha employed by the roadhouse owner Rufus Brown, but the angel returns and advises Martha to flee. As she is escaping, a nightclub patron mistakenly believes Martha is a pickpocket who robbed him. A chase ensues and Martha races back to the Crossroads between Hell and Zion, where Satan (along with a jazz band on a flatbed truck) is waiting for her arrival. The voice of Jesus Christ challenges the mob who go away. The sign at the Crossroad is transformed into the vision of Jesus Christ being crucified, and Christ's blood drips down on Martha's face. She awakens to discover she is home and her health is restored. Martha is reunited with her husband, who has now embraced religion. The angel who took Martha on her journey returns to bless the marriage.\nProduction.\n\"The Blood of Jesus\" was the second film directed by Spencer Williams, who was one of the few African American directors active in the 1940s. \"The Blood of Jesus\" was produced in Texas on a budget of US$5,000. To present the afterlife, Williams used scenes from a 1911 Italian film called \"L'Inferno\" that depicted souls entering Heaven and in addition to Williams, the cast was made up of amateur actors and members of Reverend R. L. Robinson's Heavenly Choir, who sang the film's gospel music score.\nMusic.\nThe film's soundtrack includes a variety of spirituals and hymns. All songs arranged by Henry Thacker Burleigh, unless otherwise noted, and performed by R.L. Robertson and The Heavenly Choir.\nRelease, reception and legacy.\n\"The Blood of Jesus\" was screened in cinemas and in black churches. The film's commercial success enabled Williams to direct and write additional feature films for Sack Amusement Enterprises, including two films with religious themes: \"\" (1942) and \"Go Down Death\" (1944).\nFor years, \"The Blood of Jesus\" was considered a lost film until prints were discovered in the mid-1980s in a warehouse in Tyler, Texas.\nCritical appraisal of \"The Blood of Jesus\" has been positive, with Dave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" calling the film \u201cmagnificent\u201d and J. Hoberman of \"The Village Voice\" stating it is \u201ca masterpiece of folk cinema that has scarcely lost its power to astonish.\u201d \"Time\" magazine counted it among its \u201c25 Most Important Films on Race.\u201d Historian Thomas Cripps, in his book \"Black Film as Genre\", praised \"The Blood of Jesus\" for providing \u201ca brief anatomy of Southern Baptist folk theology by presenting Christian myth in literal terms. From its opening voiceover, the film became an advocate for the most enduring traditions of Afro-American family life on Southern ground.\u201d\nFilmmaker Julie Dash cited the baptismal sequence in \"The Blood of Jesus\" as the inspiration for a similar scene from her 1991 feature film \"Daughters of the Dust\". In 1991, \"The Blood of Jesus\" became the first race film to be added to the U.S. National Film Registry.\nIt was also featured on Thom Andersen's 2015 film essay \"\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, and follows Holly Sargis (Spacek), a 15-year old who goes on a killing spree with her partner, Kit Carruthers (Sheen). The film also stars Warren Oates and Ramon Bieri. While the story is fictional, it is loosely based on the real-life murder spree of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, in 1958.\n\"Badlands\" was released in 1973 to positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised its cinematography, soundtrack\u2014which includes pieces by Carl Orff\u2014and the lead performances. At the 28th British Academy Film Awards, Spacek was nominated for the Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles award, and Sheen won the Best Actor award at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival.\nIn 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn 1959, Holly Sargis narrates the film as a 15-year-old living in Fort Dupree, a dead-end South Dakota town. She has a strained relationship with her father, a sign painter, since her mother's death from pneumonia years earlier. Holly meets Kit Carruthers, a 25-year-old garbage collector, troubled greaser and Korean War veteran. He resembles James Dean, an actor whom Holly admires. After Kit charms Holly, he takes her virginity. As they become closer, his violent and antisocial tendencies are gradually revealed.\nHolly's father disapproves of Kit and kills her dog as punishment for seeing him. Kit breaks into Holly's house and insists she run away with him. When her father threatens to call the police, Kit fatally shoots him. After Kit and Holly fake suicide by burning the house, they head for the badlands of Montana. They build a tree house in a remote area and fish and steal chickens for food. They flee when found by three men (who Kit later tells Holly were bounty hunters) whom Kit shoots dead. They seek refuge with Kit's former co-worker, Cato, but when he attempts to summon help, Kit shoots him, too. A young couple arrive and are forced into the storm cellar. Kit shoots into the closed cellar door and leaves without knowing if they are dead.\nLaw enforcement pursue Kit and Holly across the Northern Plains. They stop at a rich man's mansion and take supplies, clothing, and his Cadillac, sparing the man and his deaf housemaid. As they drive across Montana towards Canada, the police find and chase them.\nHolly, who has grown tired of Kit and life on the run, refuses to go with him and turns herself in. Kit leads the police on a car chase, but is soon caught. He charms the arresting officers and National Guard troops, tossing them his personal belongings as souvenirs of his crime spree. Holly reveals at the end that she received probation and married her defense attorney's son. Kit was executed for his crimes.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Martin Sheen as Kit\nDirector Terrence Malick makes a cameo as the man at the rich man's door, while Sheen's sons\u00a0\u2013 Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez\u00a0\u2013 appear briefly as two boys sitting under a lamppost outside Holly's house.\nProduction.\nWriting and casting.\nMalick, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Arthur Penn (whom he thanked in the film's end credits), began work on \"Badlands\" after his second year attending the American Film Institute. In 1970, Malick, at age 27, began working on the screenplay during a road trip. \"I wrote and, at the same time, developed a kind of sales kit with slides and video tape of actors, all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot,\" Malick said. \"To my surprise, they didn't pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith. I raised about half the money and executive producer Edward Pressman the other half.\" Malick paid $25,000 of his own funds. The remainder of his share was raised from professionals such as doctors and dentists. \"Badlands\" was the first feature film that Malick had written for himself to direct.\nSissy Spacek, in only her second film, was the first actor cast. Malick found her small-town Texas roots and accent were perfect for the part of the naive impressionable high school girl. The director included her in his creative process, asking questions about her life \"as if he were mining for gold.\" When he found out she had been a majorette, he worked a twirling routine into the script. Several up-and-coming actors were auditioned for the part of Kit Carruthers. When Martin Sheen was suggested by the casting director, Malick was hesitant, thinking he was too old for the role. Spacek wrote in her autobiography that \"the chemistry was immediate. He \"was\" Kit. And with him, I was Holly.\" Sheen based his characterization of Kit on the actor James Dean.\nFilming and set design.\nPrincipal photography took place in Colorado starting in July 1972, with a non-union crew and a low budget of $300,000 (excluding some deferments to film labs and actors). The film had a somewhat troubled production history: several members of the crew clashed with Malick, and another was severely injured when an explosion occurred while filming the fire scene. Malick's first cinematographer, Brian Probyn, quit mid-shoot after balking at the director's unorthodox methods. He was replaced by Tak Fujimoto then by Stevan Larner who finished the film. \"Amazingly, despite the input of these different hands, the film looks remarkably seamless,\" said producer Edward R. Pressman.\nThe Frank G. Bloom House in Trinidad, Colorado, was used for the rich man's house. Malick himself had an uncredited cameo after the actor hired to play 'Caller at Rich Man's House' failed to show up. The script's beginning was mostly filmed in the southeastern Colorado towns of La Junta and Las Animas, including the scene in which Holly runs out of the latter town's Columbian Elementary School. The closing credits thank the people of Otero County \"for their help and cooperation.\"\nJack Fisk served as art director for the film in his first of several collaborations with the director. During production, Sissy Spacek and Fisk fell in love and were married on April 12, 1974. The film was edited by Robert Estrin. Estrin remains credited as the sole editor. Both Weber and art designer Jack Fisk worked on all of Malick's subsequent features through 2016 (\"The Tree of Life\", \"To the Wonder\", \"Knight of Cups\").\nThough Malick paid close attention to period detail, he did not want it to overwhelm the picture. \"I tried to keep the 1950s to a bare minimum,\" he said. \"Nostalgia is a powerful feeling; it can drown out anything. I wanted the picture to set up like a fairy tale, outside time.\" At a news conference coinciding with the film's festival debut, Malick called Kit \"so desensitized that [he] can regard the gun with which he shoots people as a kind of magic wand that eliminates small nuisances.\" Malick also pointed out that \"Kit and Holly even think of themselves as \"living\" in a fairy tale\", and he felt this was appropriate since \"children's books like \"Treasure Island\" were often filled with violence.\" He also hoped a fairy tale tone would \"take a little of the sharpness out of the violence but still keep its dreamy quality.\"\nSoundtrack.\nThe film makes repeated use of the short composition Gassenhauer from Carl Orff's and Gunild Keetman's \"Schulwerk\", and also uses other tunes by Erik Satie, Nat \"King\" Cole, Mickey &amp; Sylvia and James Taylor.\nRelease.\nWarner Bros. purchased and distributed the film for just under $1 million. Warner Bros. initially previewed the film on a double bill with the Mel Brooks comedy \"Blazing Saddles\", resulting in very negative audience response. The production team was forced to book the film into several other theaters, in locations such as Little Rock, Arkansas, to demonstrate that the film could make money. The film has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an average score of 8.9/10 based on the reviews of 59 critics, with the general consensus being \"Terrence Malick's debut is a masterful slice of American cinema, rife with the visual poetry and measured performances that would characterize his work.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted score of 94 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Variety stated that the film was an \"impressive\" debut. Roger Ebert added it to his \"Great Movies\" list in 2011.\n\"Badlands\" was the closing feature film at the 1973 New York Film Festival, reportedly \"overshadowing even Martin Scorsese's \"Mean Streets\".\" Vincent Canby, who saw the film at the festival debut, called it a \"cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American film\"; according to Canby, \"Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our time, as are the members of the supporting cast, including Warren Oates as Holly's father. One may legitimately debate the validity of Malick's vision, but not, I think, his immense talent. Badlands is a most important and exciting film.\"\nIn April 1974, Jay Cocks wrote that the film \"might better be regarded less as a companion piece to \"Bonnie and Clyde\" than as an elaboration and reply. It is not loose and high-spirited. All its comedy has a frosty irony, and its violence, instead of being brutally balletic, is executed with a dry, remorseless drive.\" According to executive producer Edward Pressman, apart from Canby's \"New York Times\" review, most initial reviews of the film were negative, but its reputation with critics improved over time. David Thomson conversely reported that the work was \"by common consent [...] one of the most remarkable first feature films made in America.\" Writing years later for \"The Chicago Reader\", Dave Kehr wrote: \"Malick's 1973 first feature is a film so rich in ideas it hardly knows where to turn. Transcendent themes of love and death are fused with a pop-culture sensibility and played out against a midwestern background, which is breathtaking both in its sweep and in its banality.\"\nSpacek later said that \"Badlands\" changed the whole way she thought about filmmaking. \"After working with Terry Malick, I was like, 'The artist rules. Nothing else matters.' My career would have been very different if I hadn't had that experience\". In 2003, Bill Paxton said: \"It had a lyricism that films have only once in a while, moments of a transcendental nature... There's this wonderful sequence where the couple have been cut adrift from civilisation. They know the noose is tightening and they've gone off the road, across the Badlands. You hear Sissy narrating various stories, and she's talking about visiting faraway places. There's this strange piece of classical music [an ethereal orchestration of Erik Satie's \"Trois Morceaux en forme de Poire],\" and a very long-lens shot. You see something in the distance \u2013 I think it's a train moving \u2013 and it looks like a shot of an Arabian caravan moving across the desert. These are moments that have nothing to do with the story, and yet everything to do with it. They're not plot-orientated, but they have to do with the longing or the dreams of these characters. And they're the kind of moments you never forget, a certain kind of lyricism that just strikes some deep part of you and that you hold on to.\"\nMartin Sheen commented in 1999 that \"Badlands\" \"still is\" the best script he had ever read. He wrote that \"It was mesmerising. It disarmed you. It was a period piece, and yet of all time. It was extremely American, it caught the spirit of the people, of the culture, in a way that was immediately identifiable.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His work spans more than six decades of television and film, and his accolades include three Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nSheen rose to prominence in his breakthrough roles in Terrence Malick's crime drama \"Badlands\" (1973) and Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War drama \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979). Sheen is also known for such notable films as \"The Subject Was Roses\" (1968), \"Catch-22\" (1970), \"The California Kid\" (1974), \"Gandhi\" (1982), \"Wall Street\" (1987), \"Gettysburg\" (1993), \"The American President\" (1995), \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), \"The Departed\", \"Bobby\" (both 2006), and \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" (2021). He also portrayed Robert F. Kennedy in \"The Missiles of October\" (1974), Eddie Slovik in \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1974), John Dean in \"Blind Ambition\" (1979), and John F. Kennedy in \"Kennedy\" (1983) and Uncle Ben in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (2012).\nSheen received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in \"Murphy Brown\" (1994), and later received widespread acclaim portraying President Josiah \"Jed\" Bartlet in \"The West Wing\" (1999\u20132006), for which he received six nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series tying the record for most nominations without a win in the category. He later played Robert Hanson in the Netflix series \"Grace and Frankie\" (2015\u20132022).\nBorn and raised in the United States by a Spanish father and an Irish mother, he adopted the stage name Martin Sheen to help him gain acting parts. He is the father of four children, all of whom are actors. Sheen has directed one film, \"Cadence\" (1990), in which he appears alongside his sons Charlie and Ram\u00f3n. He has narrated, produced, and directed documentary projects and has been active in liberal politics.\nEarly life and education.\nSheen was born in Dayton, Ohio, on August 3, 1940, to Mary-Ann (n\u00e9e Phelan) (1903\u20131951) and Francisco Est\u00e9vez Mart\u00ednez (1898\u20131974). During birth, Sheen's left arm was crushed by forceps, giving him limited lateral movement of that arm (Erb's palsy) and resulting in the arm being shorter than his right arm. Both of Sheen's parents were immigrants; his mother was Irish, from Borrisokane, County Tipperary, and his father, who was Spanish, was born in Salceda de Caselas, Galicia. After moving to Dayton in the 1930s, his father was a factory worker/machinery inspector at the National Cash Register Company. Sheen's maternal uncle, Michael Phelan, fought in the Irish Civil War as a volunteer in the Anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army, and was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin. Sheen grew up on Brown Street in the South Park neighborhood, the seventh of ten children (nine boys and a girl). Due to his father's work, the family lived on the island of Bermuda on St. John's Road, Pembroke Parish, where five of his brothers were born. Martin was the first child to be born in Dayton, Ohio, after the family returned from Bermuda. Sheen contracted polio as a child and had to remain bedridden for a year. His doctor's treatment using Sister Kenny's method helped him regain use of his legs.\nWhen Sheen was ten years old, his mother died, and the children faced the possibility of living in an orphanage or foster homes. The family was able to remain together with the assistance of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dayton. Raised as a Catholic, he graduated from Chaminade High School (now Chaminade Julienne Catholic High School). At fourteen years old he organized a strike of golf caddies while working at a private golf club in Dayton, Ohio. He complained about the golfers, saying: \"They often used obscene language in front of us... we were little boys and they were abusive... anti-Semitic... And they, for the most part, were upstanding members of the community.\"\nSheen was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father disapproved of his interest in the field. Despite his father's opposition, Sheen borrowed money from a Catholic priest and moved to New York City in his early twenties, hoping to make it as an actor. He spent two years in the Living Theatre company. It was in New York that he met Catholic activist Dorothy Day. Working with her Catholic Worker Movement, he began his commitment to social justice, and would one day go on to play Peter Maurin, cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement, in \"\". Sheen deliberately failed the entrance examination for the University of Dayton so that he could pursue his acting career.\nHe adopted his stage name, Martin Sheen, from a combination of the CBS casting director, Robert Dale Martin, who gave him his first big break, and Catholic archbishop and broadcaster, Fulton J. Sheen. In a 2003 \"Inside the Actors Studio\" interview, Sheen explained, Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen. It's still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad.\nCareer.\n1963\u20131979: Rise to prominence.\nSheen was greatly influenced by the actor James Dean. Speaking of the impact Dean had on him, Sheen stated, \"All of his movies had a profound effect on my life, in my work and all of my generation. He transcended cinema acting. It was no longer acting, it was human behavior.\" Sheen developed a theatre company with other actors in hopes that a production would earn him recognition. In 1963, he made an appearance in \"Nightmare\", an episode of the television science fiction series \"The Outer Limits\". In 1964, he co-starred in the Broadway play \"The Subject Was Roses\"; he later reprised his role in the 1968 film of the same name, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sheen also starred in the television production \"Ten Blocks on the Camino Real\" (1966), an adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play \"Camino Real\" directed by Jack Landau and presented by NET, a PBS predecessor. In 1968, he played the titular role in \"Hamlet\", directed by Joseph Papp at The Public Theater, with dialogue mostly in English and some in Spanish as Hamlet's alter ego.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s Sheen appeared as a guest star in many popular television series, including \"Insight\" (1960s\u20131980s), \"My Three Sons\" (1964), \"Flipper\" (1967), \"The F.B.I.\" (1968), \"\" (1969), \"Hawaii Five-O\" (1970), \"Dan August\" (1971), \"The Rookies\", \"Columbo\", and \"The Streets of San Francisco\" (all 1973).

He portrayed Dobbs in the 1970 film adaptation of \"Catch-22\". He then co-starred in the controversial Emmy Award-winning 1972 television film \"That Certain Summer\", said to be the first television movie in America to portray homosexuality in a sympathetic light.\nHis next important feature film role was in 1973 when he starred with Sissy Spacek in the crime drama \"Badlands\", playing an antisocial multiple murderer. Sheen has stated that his role in \"Badlands\" was one of his two favorites, the other being his role as a U.S. Army special operations officer in \"Apocalypse Now\".

Eddie Slovik in the television film \"The Execution of Private Slovik\". Based on an incident that occurred during World War II, the film told the story of the only U.S. soldier to be executed for desertion since the American Civil War.\nSheen's performance led to Francis Ford Coppola's casting him in a lead role as U.S. Army Captain Benjamin L. Willard in 1979's \"Apocalypse Now\", gaining him wide recognition. Filming in the Philippine jungle in the typhoon season of 1976, Sheen later said that he was not in good physical condition and was drinking heavily. For the film's opening sequence in a Saigon hotel room, Sheen's portrayal of Willard as heavily intoxicated was aided by Sheen's celebrating his 36th birthday on-set that day, and being actually drunk. Twelve months into filming, Sheen suffered a minor heart attack and had to crawl out to a road for help. While he was recovering, his younger brother Joe Estevez stood in for him in a number of long shots and in some of the voice-overs.

Sheen is known for his outspoken support of liberal political causes, such as opposition to United States military actions and a hazardous-waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Sheen has dismissed calls for him to run for office, saying: \"There's no way that I could be the President. You can't have a pacifist in the White House... I'm an actor.

James Antle III, writing in \"The American Conservative\", Sheen is a follower of the consistent life ethic, which opposes abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment and war.

He started his career as a singer, actor, and dancer on \"\" before rising to prominence as a member of the boy band NSYNC in the late 90s and early 2000s. The band has sold over 70 million records, becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Chasez released his debut single \"Blowin' Me Up (With Her Love)\" in 2002, following NSYNC's decision to go on a hiatus earlier that year. \"Schizophrenic\", his debut solo album, was released in 2004. Chasez has written and produced for a wide variety of music acts such as Liam Payne, Diplo, Backstreet Boys, McFly, The Cheetah Girls, Sugababes, Victoria Duffield, and Matthew Morrison. He also served as a judge on the first seven seasons of \"America's Best Dance Crew.\"\nEarly life.\nJoshua Scott Chasez was born on August 8, 1976, in Washington, D.C. When he was five years old, his biological mother entrusted guardianship of her son to her own former foster parents Roy and Karen Chasez, who worked as a technology company consultant and an editor, respectively. He was adopted by the couple who lived in Bowie, Maryland, and was raised Mennonite along with his younger siblings, Tyler and Heather. Chasez attended the former Robert Goddard Middle School and Bowie High School. He then got transferred to Dr. Phillips High School after moving to Florida to film The All New Mickey Mouse Club.\nCareer.\nAs a child, Chasez was extremely shy, but became interested in dance and got involved in competitive dance troupes. When he was 13, he entered a talent contest on a dare from a friend. He sang \"Right Here Waiting\" by Richard Marx and won first place. In 1990, his mother saw auditions for the Disney movie \"Newsies\" advertised in The Washington Post and encouraged him to try out. At the audition, Chasez was told that he was not the correct age for the character role they were casting for that day and was turned down. He was then told that there were auditions for Disney Channel's revival of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" next door. After successfully auditioning for , Chasez was cast as a Mouseketeer in the fourth season and subsequently moved to Orlando to film the show. He went by his initials because there was already another cast member named Josh (Ackerman). Chasez was on the show from 1991 to 1995, seasons 4 through 7. During his time on the show, he befriended future bandmate Justin Timberlake and performed alongside Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling, Rhona Bennett, and Tony Lucca. In 1995, it was announced that the show would not return for a new season.\nAfter , Chasez attempted to pursue a solo music career in Los Angeles, but decided to return home to Maryland after he was left feeling cheated. On his drive back he stopped at Justin Timberlake's house in Memphis, Tennessee, where they wrote demos together. Chasez and Timberlake eventually went to Nashville to continue writing songs and demo tracks with Robin Wiley, who had been a songwriter and vocal coach on .\nTimberlake then got a phone call from Chris Kirkpatrick, who was asking him to join what would become the boy band NSYNC. Timberlake decided to join the group and recommended Chasez as well. Chasez was still back home in Maryland saving up to return to Nashville. Together the three of them then decided to go to Orlando to look for a baritone. There they ran into Joey Fatone, who already knew Kirkpatrick from their time working together at Universal Studios Florida and was already acquainted with Chasez and Timberlake through friends from their time on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". After several auditions, the group recruited Jason Galasso as their bass singer. Timberlake's mother created the name NSYNC after she took the last letter of each of the initial members' names: JustiN, ChriS, JoeY, JasoN, and JC and commented on how \"in sync\" the group's singing voices were. After Galasso decided to permanently leave the group, he was soon replaced by Lance Bass.\n1995\u20132002: NSYNC.\nChasez and Timberlake served as the two lead singers of the boy band NSYNC. The group was formed in 1995 by Chris Kirkpatrick, and they began recording and performing the following year in Europe. In 1998, the band released its debut album \"*NSYNC\" which sold 11 million copies, earning them popularity in the United States with four number one singles including Tearin' Up My Heart and (God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You. After the band had a series of legal struggles with manager Lou Pearlman, they signed with Jive Records. They released their third studio album \"No Strings Attached\" in 2000, which became the fastest-selling album of all time, selling 2.4\u00a0million copies in the first week. They held this record until 2015 when Adele surpassed the single-week sales record with her third album \"25\". Singles from the \"No Strings Attached\" album include \"Bye Bye Bye\", \"This I Promise You\", and the number one hit \"It's Gonna Be Me\". The band produced their fourth studio album, \"Celebrity\" in 2001, which sold 1.8\u00a0million copies in the first week. NSYNC performed at the Academy Awards in 2000, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. The group sold more than 70 million records globally, making them the fifth-best selling boy band in history.\nAfter their Celebrity Tour in 2002, NSYNC went on an indefinite hiatus but never formally disbanded.\n2002\u20132007: Solo years.\nWhile still a member of NSYNC, Chasez appeared on the remix and album versions of the 1999 single \"Bring It All to Me\" by the girl group Blaque, though his vocals were credited to NSYNC as a whole. During the band's time Chasez became involved with songwriting and production for his group and other artists, including Wild Orchid.\nDuring NSYNC's hiatus, Chasez continued to work as a songwriter and producer. Producer Dallas Austin asked Chasez to record the song \"Blowin' Me Up (With Her Love)\" for the \"Drumline\" soundtrack, which was later released as a single. Chasez subsequently began work on a solo album with Jive Records, with tracks written and produced by Austin, Basement Jaxx, Robb Boldt and Riprock 'n' Alex G as well as Chasez. After numerous delays, his debut album \"Schizophrenic\" was released in February 2004. Promotion for the album was affected by former bandmate Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, after which Chasez was dropped from performing at half-time at the 2004 Pro Bowl. With the NFL unhappy with the lyrics of the single \"Some Girls (Dance with Women)\" expressing too much sexuality, Chasez agreed to alter his performance but was met with too much resistance from the organizers, who ultimately replaced Chasez's act with Hawaiian hula dancers.\nAt the same time, Chasez sang vocals on the Basement Jaxx track, \"Plug It In\", which reached number one in the UK Dance Charts. Following the release of \"Schizophrenic\", Chasez began work on his second album, \"The Story of Kate\". The album featured production from Chasez's former NSYNC bandmate Timberlake, Timbaland, Dallas Austin, Jimmy Harry, and Emanuel Kiriakou. Timberlake, who produced a few songs for the album, said, \"In my opinion, (JC) had the best voice out of all of us...Out of all the boy bands, call 'em what you will, he was the one that could out-sing all of us. And I've known him since I was twelve, so it was fun to sit behind the board and push him.\"\nThough slated for release in 2006, \"The Story of Kate\" was delayed to the following year. The two lead singles, \"Until Yesterday\" and \"You Ruined Me\" were released online. Chasez performed material from the new album during guests spots on TV shows \"Ghost Whisperer\", \"Las Vegas\", and \"\". After the album's release was further stalled, it was effectively cancelled when Chasez and Jive parted ways through mutual decision in September 2007.\n2008\u20132024: \"America's Best Dance Crew\", songwriting and occasional NSYNC reunions.\nThough the \"Story of Kate\" was never released, Chasez continues to work as a songwriter and producer, with songs written for David Archuleta, Matthew Morrison and Backstreet Boys. He has written for Taemin, Liz, and NU'EST. In 2008 he became a judge on Randy Jackson's \"America's Best Dance Crew\" on MTV, serving on the panel for the first seven seasons of the show's original run.\nIn November 2010, the song \"IF U C Kate\" written by Dallas Austin, Taio Cruz, Alan Nglish, and Chasez was featured on the British band McFly's album, \"Above the Noise\". Chasez wrote and produced two songs on AJ McLean's debut album \"Have It All\", released in the US in February 2011.\nIn February 2012, Chasez and producer Jimmy Harry held auditions for an all-girl group which was formed in November the same year under the name Girl Radical. Girl Radical was an eleven-member pop musical act inspired by large Asian pop supergroups.\nNSYNC performed for the first time together again at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards to mark Timberlake winning the Video Vanguard Award.\nIn 2014, Chasez was selected to join the North American tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" as Pontius Pilate. Other cast members included \"Superstar\" winner Ben Forster and other well-known artists, including Incubus' Brandon Boyd, Destiny's Child's Michelle Williams, and Public Image Ltd's John Lydon. However, on May 30, 2014, the entire North American tour was abruptly canceled, with poor projected ticket sales cited as the reason.\nAlong with Miguel and Aloe Blacc, Chasez was featured on a new version of \"My Girl\" with Smokey Robinson on the album \"Smokey &amp; Friends\". In 2015, Chasez appeared, along with 3OH!3, on the title track of the Blues Traveler album \"Blow Up the Moon\", and on the song's accompanying music video. In 2016, Chasez starred in the film \"Opening Night\", in which he played a dramatized version of himself.\nIn April 2019, Chasez and bandmates Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, and Chris Kirkpatrick performed with Ariana Grande as part of headlining set at Coachella.\nIn January 2023, Chasez appeared as a guest on former bandmate Lance Bass' \"Frosted Tips\" podcast, and revealed he is currently working on a musical.\nOn September 12, 2023, following weeks of teasers and speculation regarding a potential reunion, Chasez and the other four members of NSYNC appeared together at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards to present the award for Best Pop to Taylor Swift. On September 14, it was confirmed the group recorded a new song titled \"Better Place\" for the DreamWorks Animation film \"Trolls Band Together\".

It was formed out of four territories of former French India, namely Pondich\u00e9ry (now Puducherry), Karikal (Karaikal), Mah\u00e9 and Yanaon (now Yanam), excluding Chandannagar (Chandernagore), and it is named after the largest district, Puducherry, which was also the capital of French India. Historically known as Pondicherry, the territory changed its official name to Puducherry on 1 October 2006.\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry lies in the southern part of the Indian Peninsula. The areas of Puducherry district and Karaikal district are bound by the state of Tamil Nadu, while Yanam district and Mah\u00e9 district are enclosed by the states of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Puducherry is the 29th most populous of the 36 states and union territories of India, and the third most densely populated union territory. It has a gross domestic product (GDP) of () and ranks 25th in India.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Puducherry\" is a compound of the Tamil words () and () meaning 'new settlement'; its old name \"Pondicherry\" is a gallicised version of () meaning 'settlement of Pandis'.\nHistory.\nThe earliest recorded history of the municipality of Puducherry can be traced to the second century CE. The \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" mentions a marketplace named \"Poduke or Poduka\" (ch 60). G. W. B. Huntingford suggested this might be a site about 2 miles from the modern Puducherry, which was possibly the location of Arikamedu (now part of Ariyankuppam). Huntingford noted that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937. In addition, archaeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century\" Subsequent investigation by Vimala Begley from 1989 to 1992 modified this assessment, and now place the period of occupation from the third or second century BCE to the eighth century CE.\nIn 1674, the municipality of Pondicherry (Pondich\u00e9ry) became a colony in the French colonial empire. Together with Chandernagor (already French since 1673), Mah\u00e9 (since 1721), Yanam (Yanaon) (since 1723), Karaikal (Karikal) (since 1739) and Masulipatam (1760), it formed the colony of French India, under a single French governor in Pondicherry, although French rule over one or more of these enclaves was repeatedly interrupted by British occupations. The territories of French India were completely transferred to the Republic of India \"de facto\" on 1 November 1954, and \"de jure\" on 16 August 1962, when French India ceased to exist, becoming the present Indian union territory of Pondicherry, combining four coastal enclaves. The fifth, Chandannagar, merged with the state of West Bengal in 1954. Immediately after the \"de facto\" transfer, the area was renamed the 'State of Pondicherry' by the \"French Establishments (Change of Name) Order, 1954\" issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of India. The State of Pondicherry continued to be under the direct control of the Government of India under the aegis of the Ministry of External affairs until 31 August 1964. Meanwhile, with effect from 1 July 1963, the State of Pondicherry officially became the Union Territory of Pondicherry and after 31 August 1964 it came under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nUntil 2016, the \"de jure transfer day\" (i.e. 16 August) was a public holiday with no official celebrations taking place. In 2016, Lt. Governor of Puducherry, Kiran Bedi, made it a holiday as \"De Jure Transfer Day.\"\nSince 2010, \"de facto transfer day\" (i.e. 1 November) has been celebrated as Liberation day throughout Puducherry. In 2014, Liberation day was declared as a public Holiday. This initiative was taken shortly after the NDA government came to power in 2014 and newly appointed Lt. Governor A. K. Singh issued a notification regarding that decision of the central government.\nGeography.\nThe Union Territory of Puducherry consists of four small unconnected districts: Puducherry district (), Karaikal district () and Yanam district () on the Bay of Bengal and Mah\u00e9 district () on the Laccadive Sea, covering a total area of . Puducherry and Karaikal have the largest areas and population, and are both enclaves of Tamil Nadu. Yanam and Mah\u00e9 are enclaves of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, respectively. Its population, as per the 2011 Census, is 1,394,467. Puducherry is the smallest union territory in terms of sea coastline with 30.6\u00a0km length.\nSome of Puducherry's regions are themselves amalgamations of non-contiguous enclaves, often called \"pockets\" in India. The Puducherry region is made of 11 such pockets, some of which are very small and entirely surrounded by the territory of Tamil Nadu. Mah\u00e9 region is made up of three pockets. This unusual geography is a legacy of the colonial period with Puducherry retaining the borders of former French India.\nAll four regions of Puducherry are located in the coastal region. Five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mah\u00e9 district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2011 census, Hinduism is the major religion, adhered to by 87.3% of the population. Other religions practiced in the territory include Christianity (6.3%) and Islam (6.1%).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2011 census, Tamil is the major language spoken by 88.22% of the population. Other languages spoken in the territory include Telugu (5.96%) and Malayalam (3.84%).\nGovernment and administration.\nPuducherry is a union territory of India rather than a state, which implies that governance and administration fall directly under federal authority. It is one of three union territories (with the National Capital Territory of Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir) entitled by a special constitutional amendment to an elected legislative assembly and cabinet of ministers, thereby conveying partial statehood. There has been some interest by the territory's government in receiving full statehood, but budgetary issues remain a consideration. Also, Mahe and Yanam may oppose such a change of status.\nThe central government is represented by the Lieutenant Governor, who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory's financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer. Consequently, Puducherry has at various times, enjoyed lower taxes, especially in the indirect category.\nSpecial administration status.\nAccording to the Treaty of Cession of 1956, the four territories of former French India territorial administration are permitted to make laws with respect to specific matters. In many cases, such legislation may require ratification from the federal government or the assent of the President of India.\nArticle II of the Treaty states:\n (The Establishments will keep the benefit of the special administrative status which was in force prior to 1 November 1954. Any constitutional changes in this status which may be made subsequently shall be made after ascertaining the wishes of the people).\nLanguages.\nThe most widely spoken first language is Tamil, which is native to % of the population. There are also speakers of Telugu (%), Malayalam (%) and Urdu (%). The official languages of Puducherry are French, Tamil, Telugu (in Yanam), Malayalam (in Mahe) and English. An official mention in Rajya Sabha Parliamentary debates during 2006 confirms that Puducherry has all these five languages as official.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nContinuation of French.\nEven after the de facto transfer of the French Indian settlements in November 1954, French continued to remain as the official language according to Article XXVIII of the (Treaty of Cession) of 1956.\nArticle XXVIII of the Treaty states:\n (The French language shall remain the official language of the Establishments so long as the elected representatives of the people shall not decide otherwise).\nThe 1963 Pondicherry representative assembly resolution also voted for continuance of French as official language and addition of other languages spoken in Puducherry such as Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam along with English and Hindi.\nInclusion of other languages.\nConsidering the 1956 Treaty of cession and 1963 Assembly resolution, the 1963 Union Territories Act reconfirmed the 1963 resolution that French shall continue to be used as an official language unless the legislative assembly decides otherwise. The 1963 act allowed provision for inclusion of more official languages. Two years later, new official languages were recognised by The Pondicherry Official Language Act, 1965 which makes no mention of French (but also not officially denying it) implying the implicit continuation of its official language status. The same act stated that the Tamil language shall be the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the Union territory and the same official recognition is given for English. The same act also recognized officially Malayalam and Telugu in the Mah\u00e9 and Yanam districts respectively.\nThe widespread anti-Hindi agitations in the mid-1960s in South India would have prompted for inclusion of all the languages suggested in the 1963 assembly resolution except Hindi in the list of official languages of Puducherry. While the Union Territory official gazette's name is in French (), it is published exclusively in English.\nJudiciary.\nThe jurisdiction of the Madras High Court has been extended to Pondicherry with effect from 6 November 1962. The Chief Justice of the Madras High Court is the head of the judiciary of Puducherry. The present chief justice is S. V. Gangapurwala.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product of Puducherry, at market prices estimated by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation with figures in millions of Indian rupees grew from 1,840 to 258,190 million rupees from 1980 to 2014.\nFisheries.\nThe potential for fisheries is substantial in the Union Territory. The four regions of the Union Territory have a coastline of 45\u00a0km with 675 of inshore waters, of inland water and 800 ha of brackish water. 27 marine fishing villages and 23 inland fishing villages host a fishermen population of about 65,000 of which 13,000 are actively engaged in fishing. Tanks and ponds are also tapped for commercial fish rearing.\nTourism.\nPuducherry is one of the most popular tourist spots in India for national and international tourists. Puducherry was the residence of Sri Aurobindo (1872\u20131950) and the Sri Aurobindo Ashram still operates from Puducherry. A unique experimental city Auroville, the brainchild of the Mother, whose inhabitants are drawn from all parts of the world is situated on the outskirts of the city. There are several temples, churches, monuments, parks, and mosques which attract tourists.\nTransportation.\nRail.\nPuducherry is connected by a railway branch line from the five-way junction at Viluppuram and Chennai. The railway line is a broad gauge line with 16 originating trains and 17 terminating trains.\nMeanwhile Karaikal and Mahe also well connected by railway lines. Several railway lines are also under construction in Karaikal district. The nearest major railway station to Yanam is Kakinada (CCT) in Andhra Pradesh (33 KM).\nAir.\nPuducherry has an airport called Puducherry Airport. It has flight operations between Puducherry and Hyderabad. A new airport is proposed in Karaikal which is called as Karaikal Airport. The nearest airport to Yanam is Rajahmundry Airport (IATA: RJA, ICAO: VORY), 90 KM away.\nSea.\nPuducherry U.T. has several ports namely Karaikal port, Puducherry port, Mahe port. Among them, the largest port is Karaikal Port.\nRoad.\nPuducherry has a network all-weather metalled roads connecting the territory. Puducherry has a road length of 2,552\u00a0km (road length per 4.87\u00a0km2), the highest in the country. PRTC buses play a vital role in Puducherry U.T.\nEducation.\nAccording to the 2011 census, Puducherry had a literacy rate of 86.55. Pondicherry University is a university centrally located in Puducherry.\nTourism.\nPondicherry is the capital city of The Union Territory of Puducherry and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South India. A French colony until 1954, its old town retains a number of colonial architecture buildings, churches, statues, and systematic town planning, as well great influences from the local Tamil architecture. Due to its coastal situation, this town offers a vast array of watersport events and watersport based tourism such as boating, kayaking, etc.\nTourism in Karaikal.\nThirunallar Temple\nThe Dharbaranyeswarar Temple, popularly known as Tirunallar Saniswaran Temple, is one of the Navagraha shrines of Tanjore.

Its release heralded the commercial ascendance of sound films and effectively marked the end of the silent film era with the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system, featuring six songs performed by Al Jolson. Based on the 1925 play of the same title by Samson Raphaelson, the plot was adapted from his short story \"The Day of Atonement\".\nThe film depicts the fictional story of Jakie Rabinowitz, a young man who defies the traditions of his devout Jewish family. After singing popular tunes in a beer garden, he is punished by his father, a hazzan (cantor), prompting Jakie to run away from home. Some years later, now calling himself Jack Robin, he has become a talented jazz singer, performing in blackface. He attempts to build a career as an entertainer, but his professional ambitions ultimately come into conflict with the demands of his home and heritage.\nDarryl F. Zanuck won an Academy Honorary Award for producing the film; Alfred A. Cohn was nominated for Best Writing (Adaptation) at the 1st Academy Awards. In 1996, \"The Jazz Singer\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the American Film Institute as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety. The film's copyright expired on January 1, 2023, when all works published in the U.S. in 1927 entered the public domain.\nPlot.\nCantor Rabinowitz wants his 13-year-old son, Jacob \"Jakie\" Rabinowitz, to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Jakie has instead taken a liking to singing jazz at the local beer garden. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, \"I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!\" Jakie threatens: \"If you whip me again, I'll run away\u2014and \"never come back!\"\" After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, \"My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight\u2014but now I have no son.\" As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.\nAbout ten years later, Jakie has anglicized his name to Jack Robin. Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage (\"Dirty Hands, Dirty Face\").\nJack wows the crowd with his energized rendition of \"Toot, Toot, Tootsie\". Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer. \"There are lots of jazz singers, but \"you\" have a tear in your voice\", she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical \"April Follies\".\nBack at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz is instructing a young student in the traditional cantorial art. Jack appears, attempting to explain his perspective and his love for modern music, but the appalled cantor dismisses him, saying, \"I never want to see you again\u2014you jazz singer!\" As Jack leaves, he makes a prediction: \"I came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. Someday you'll understand, just as Mama does.\"\nTwo weeks after Jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before the opening night of \"April Follies\" on Broadway, Jack's father falls gravely ill. Jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the Kol Nidre for Yom Kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere.\nThat evening, the eve of Yom Kippur, Yudelson tells the Jewish elders, \"For the first time, we have no Cantor on the Day of Atonement.\" Lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, Cantor Rabinowitz tells Sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: \"My son came to me in my dreams\u2014he sang Kol Nidre so beautifully. If he would only sing like that tonight\u2014surely he would be forgiven.\"\nAs Jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying blackface makeup, he and Mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. Sara and Yudelson come to Jack's dressing room to plead for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. Jack is torn. He delivers his blackface performance (\"Mother of Mine, I Still Have You\"), and Sara sees her son on stage for the first time. She has a tearful revelation: \"Here he belongs. If God wanted him in His house, He would have kept him there. He's not \"my\" boy anymore\u2014he belongs to the whole world now.\"\nAfterward, Jack returns to the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: \"My son\u2014I love you.\" Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can not decide. Mary challenges him: \"Were you lying when you said your career came before \"everything?\"\" Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: \"I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy.\" His mother tells him, \"Do what is in your heart, Jakie\u2014if you sing and God is not in your voice\u2014your father will know.\" The producer cajoles Jack: \"You're a \"jazz singer\" at heart!\"\nAt the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. Jack sings the Kol Nidre in his father's place. His father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: \"Mama, we have our son again.\" The spirit of Jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. Mary has come to listen. She sees how Jack has reconciled the division in his soul: \"a jazz singer\u2014singing to his God.\"\n\"The season passes\u2014and time heals\u2014the show goes on.\" Jack, as \"The Jazz Singer\", is now appearing at the Winter Garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called \"Back Room\". In the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside Yudelson. Jack, in blackface, performs the song \"My Mammy\" for her and for the world.\nProduction.\nConcept and development.\nOn April 25, 1917, Samson Raphaelson, a native of New York City's Lower East Side and a University of Illinois undergraduate, attended a performance of the musical \"Robinson Crusoe, Jr.\" in Champaign, Illinois. The star of the show was a thirty-year-old singer, Al Jolson, a Lithuanian-born Jew who performed in blackface. In a 1927 interview, Raphaelson described the experience: \"I shall never forget the first five minutes of Jolson\u2014his velocity, the amazing fluidity with which he shifted from a tremendous absorption in his audience to a tremendous absorption in his song.\" He explained that he had seen emotional intensity like Jolson's only among synagogue cantors.\nA few years later, pursuing a professional literary career, Raphaelson wrote \"The Day of Atonement\", a short story about a young Jew named Jakie Rabinowitz, based on Jolson's real life. The story was published in January 1922 in \"Everybody's Magazine\". Raphaelson later adapted the story into a stage play, \"The Jazz Singer\". A straight drama, all the singing in Raphaelson's version takes place offstage. With George Jessel in the lead role, the show premiered at the Warner Theatre in Times Square in September 1925 and became a hit. Warner Bros. acquired the movie rights to the play on June 4, 1926, and signed Jessel to a contract. \"The Moving Picture World\" published a story in February 1927 announcing that production on the film would begin with Jessel on May 1.\nBut the plans to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for multiple reasons. Jessel's contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he'd made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warner had hits with two Vitaphone, though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, \"The Jazz Singer\" production had been reconceived. Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel's description in his autobiography, Harry Warner \"was having a tough time with the financing of the company... He talked about taking care of me if the picture was a success. I did not feel that was enough.\" In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner\u2014the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio\u2014had sold $4 million of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent. Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter Alfred A. Cohn's adaptation \"threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy's leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the Winter Garden as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this.\"\nAccording to performer Eddie Cantor, as negotiations between Warner Bros. and Jessel floundered, Jack L. Warner and the studio's production chief, Darryl Zanuck, called to see if he was interested in the part. Cantor, a friend of Jessel's, responded that he was sure any differences with the actor could be worked out and offered his assistance. Cantor was not invited to participate in the Jessel talks; instead, the role was then offered to Jolson, who had inspired it in the first place. Describing Jolson as the production's best choice for its star, film historian Donald Crafton wrote, \"The entertainer, who sang jazzed-up minstrel numbers in blackface, was at the height of his phenomenal popularity. Anticipating the later stardom of crooners and rock stars, Jolson electrified audiences with the vitality and sex appeal of his songs and gestures, which owed much to black american sources.\" As described by film historian Robert L. Carringer, \"Jessel was a vaudeville comedian and master of ceremonies with one successful play and one modestly successful film to his credit. Jolson was a superstar.\" Jolson took the part, signing a $75,000 contract on May 26, 1927, for eight weeks of services beginning in July. There have been several claims but no proof that Jolson invested some of his own money in the film. Jessel and Jolson, also friends, did not speak for some time after\u2014on the one hand, Jessel had been confiding his problems with the Warners to Jolson; on the other, Jolson had signed with them without telling Jessel of his plans. In his autobiography, Jessel wrote that, in the end, Jolson \"must not be blamed, as the Warners had definitely decided that I was out.\"\nIntroduction of sound.\nWhile many earlier sound films had dialogue, all were short subjects. D. W. Griffith's feature \"Dream Street\" (1921) was shown in New York with a single singing sequence and crowd noises, using the sound-on-disc system Photokinema. The film was preceded by a program of sound shorts, including a sequence with Griffith speaking directly to the audience, but the feature itself had no talking scenes. On April 15, 1923, Lee De Forest introduced the sound-on-film system Phonofilm, which had synchronized sound and dialogue, but the sound quality was poor, and the films produced in this process were short films only.\nThe first Warner Bros. Vitaphone features, \"Don Juan\" (premiered August 1926) and \"The Better 'Ole\" (premiered October 1926), like three more that followed in early 1927 (\"When a Man Loves\", \"Old San Francisco\", and \"The First Auto\"), had only a synchronized instrumental score and sound effects. \"The Jazz Singer\" contains those, as well as numerous synchronized singing sequences and some synchronized speech: Two popular tunes are performed by the young Jakie Rabinowitz, the future Jazz Singer; his father, a cantor, performs the devotional Kol Nidre; the famous cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, appearing as himself, sings an excerpt of another religious melody, Kaddish, and the song \"Yahrzeit Licht\". As the adult Jack Robin, Jolson performs six songs: five popular \"jazz\" tunes and the Kol Nidre. The sound for the film was recorded by British-born George Groves, who had also worked on \"Don Juan\". To direct, the studio chose Alan Crosland, who already had two Vitaphone films to his credit: \"Don Juan\" and \"Old San Francisco\", which opened while \"The Jazz Singer\" was in production.\nJolson's first vocal performance, about fifteen minutes into the picture, is of \"Dirty Hands, Dirty Face\", with music by James V. Monaco and lyrics by Edgar Leslie and Grant Clarke. The first synchronized speech, uttered by Jack to a cabaret crowd and to the piano player in the band that accompanies him, occurs directly after that performance, beginning at the 17:25 mark of the film. Jack's first spoken words\u2014\"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet\"\u2014were well-established stage patter of Jolson's. He had even spoken very similar lines in an earlier short, \"A Plantation Act\" (1926). The line had become virtually an in-joke. In November 1918, during a gala concert celebrating the end of World War I, Jolson ran onstage amid the applause for the preceding performer, the great operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, and exclaimed, \"Folks, you ain't heard nothin' yet.\" The following year, he recorded the song \"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet\". In a later scene, Jack talks with his mother, played by Eugenie Besserer, in the family parlor; his father enters and pronounces one very conclusive word, \"Stop!\", the final line of dialogue in the film.\nIn total, the movie contains barely two minutes' worth of synchronized talking, much or all of it improvised. The rest of the dialogue is presented through the caption cards, or intertitles, standard in silent movies of the era; as was common, those titles were composed not by the film's scenarist, Alfred Cohn, but by another writer\u00a0\u2013 in this case, Jack Jarmuth.\nWhile Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, production on \"The Jazz Singer\" began with the shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn come up with some lines on the spot. On September 23, \"Motion Picture News\" reported that production on the film had been completed.\nThe production cost for \"The Jazz Singer\" was $422,000 (approximately US$ in 2024 dollars), a large sum, especially for Warner Bros., which rarely spent more than $250,000. It was by no means a record for the studio, however; two features starring John Barrymore had been costlier: \"The Sea Beast\" (1926), a loose and entirely silent adaptation of \"Moby-Dick\", at $503,000 and \"Don Juan\" at $546,000. Nonetheless, the outlay constituted a major gamble in light of the studio's financial straits: while \"The Jazz Singer\" was in production, Harry Warner stopped taking a salary, pawned jewelry belonging to his wife, and moved his family into a smaller apartment.\nPremiere and reception.\nThe premiere occurred on October 6, 1927, at Warner Bros.' flagship theater in New York City. In keeping with the film's theme of a conflict within a Jewish family, the film premiered after sunset on the eve of the Yom Kippur holiday. The buildup to the premiere was tense. Besides Warner Bros.' precarious financial position, the physical presentation of the film itself was remarkably complex:Each of Jolson's musical numbers was mounted on a separate reel with a separate accompanying sound disc. Even though the film was only eighty-nine minutes long ... there were fifteen reels and fifteen discs to manage, and the projectionist had to be able to thread the film and cue up the Vitaphone records very quickly. The least stumble, hesitation, or human error would result in public and financial humiliation for the company. None of the four Warner brothers were able to attend: Sam Warner\u2014among them, the strongest advocate for Vitaphone\u2014had died the previous day of pneumonia, and the surviving brothers had returned to California for his funeral.\nAccording to Doris Warner, who was in attendance, about halfway through the film she began to feel that something exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in big close-up, and said \"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!\" Jolson's \"Wait a minute\" line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing and hearing someone speak on a film for the first time, so much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, \"the audience became hysterical.\" After the show, the audience turned into a \"milling, battling, mob\", in one journalist's description, chanting \"Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!\" Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was \"Life\" magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as \"fraught with tremendous significance... I for one suddenly realized that the end of the silent drama is in sight\".\nCritical reaction was generally, though far from universally, positive. \"The New York Times\" critic Mordaunt Hall, reviewing the film's premiere, declared that\nnot since the first presentation of Vitaphone features, more than a year ago (i.e. \"Don Juan\"), has anything like the ovation been heard in a motion-picture theatre... The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflections of the voice so that one is not aware of the mechanical features.\n\"Variety\" called it \"[u]ndoubtedly the best thing Vitaphone has ever put on the screen ... [with] abundant power and appeal.\" Richard Watts Jr. of the \"New York Herald Tribune\" called it a \"pleasantly sentimental orgy dealing with a struggle between religion and art... [T]his is not essentially a motion picture, but rather a chance to capture for comparative immortality the sight and sound of a great performer.\" The \"Exhibitors Herald\"'s take was virtually identical: \"scarcely a motion picture. It should be more properly labeled an enlarged Vitaphone record of Al Jolson in half a dozen songs.\" The film received favorable reviews in both the Jewish press and in African American newspapers such as the \"Baltimore Afro-American\", the \"New York Amsterdam News\", and the \"Pittsburgh Courier\". The headline of the \"Los Angeles Times\" review told a somewhat different story: \"'Jazz Singer' Scores a Hit\u2014Vitaphone and Al Jolson Responsible, Picture Itself Second Rate.\" \"Photoplay\" dismissed Jolson as \"no movie actor. Without his Broadway reputation he wouldn't rate as a minor player.\"\nCommercial impact and industrial influence.\nThe film developed into a major hit, demonstrating the profit potential of feature-length \"talkies\", but Donald Crafton has shown that the reputation the film later acquired for being one of Hollywood's most enormous successes to date was inflated. The movie did well, but not astonishingly so, in the major cities where it was first released, garnering much of its impressive profits with long, steady runs in population centers large and small all around the country. As conversion of movie theaters to sound was still in its early stages, the film actually arrived at many of those secondary venues in a silent version. On the other hand, Crafton's statement that \"The Jazz Singer\" \"was in a distinct second or third tier of attractions compared to the most popular films of the day and even other Vitaphone talkies\" is also incorrect. In fact, the film was easily the biggest earner in Warner Bros. history, and would remain so until it was surpassed a year later by \"The Singing Fool\", another Jolson feature. In the larger scope of Hollywood, among films originally released in 1927, available evidence suggests that \"The Jazz Singer\" was among the three biggest box office hits, trailing only \"Wings\" and, perhaps, \"The King of Kings\".\nAccording to Warner Bros. records, the film earned revenues of $1,974,000 in the United States and Canada, and $651,000 elsewhere, for a worldwide theatrical gross rental of approximately $2.6 million (the studio's share of the box office gross) and a profit of $1,196,750.\nOne of the keys to the film's success was an innovative marketing scheme conceived by Sam Morris, Warner Bros.' sales manager. In Crafton's description:\n[A] special clause in Warners' Vitaphone exhibition contract virtually guaranteed long runs. Theaters had to book \"The Jazz Singer\" for full rather than split weeks. Instead of the traditional flat rental fee, Warners took a percentage of the gate. A sliding scale meant that the exhibitor's take increased the longer the film was held over. The signing of this contract by the greater New York Fox Theatres circuit was regarded as a headline-making precedent.\nSimilar arrangements, based on a percentage of the gross rather than flat rental fees, would soon become standard for the U.S. film industry's high-end or \"A\" product.\nThough in retrospect it is understood that the success of \"The Jazz Singer\" signaled the end of the silent motion-picture era, this was not immediately apparent. Mordaunt Hall, for example, praised Warner Bros. for \"astutely realiz[ing] that a film conception of \"The Jazz Singer\" was one of the few subjects that would lend itself to the use of the Vitaphone.\" In historian Richard Koszarski's words, \"Silent films did not disappear overnight, nor did talking films immediately flood the theaters... Nevertheless, 1927 remains the year that Warner Bros. moved to close the book on the history of silent pictures, even if their original goal had been somewhat more modest.\"\nThe film had other effects that were more immediate. George Jessel, who was in his third season touring with the stage production of \"The Jazz Singer\", later described what happened to his show\u2014perhaps anticipating how sound would soon cement Hollywood's dominance of the American entertainment industry: \"A week or two after the Washington engagement, the sound-and-picture version of \"The Jazz Singer\" with Al Jolson was sweeping the country, and I was swept out of business. I couldn't compete with a picture theatre across the street showing the first great sound picture in the world ... for fifty cents, while the price at my theatre was $3.00.\"\nAs the truly pivotal event, Crafton points to the national release of the film's sound version in early 1928\u2014he dates it to January, Block and Wilson to February 4. In March, Warner announced that \"The Jazz Singer\" was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently). In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric's licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, \"Lights of New York\", a musical crime melodrama.\nOn September 27, \"The Jazz Singer\" became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The movie \"created a sensation\", according to British film historian Rachael Low. \"\"The Jazz Singer\" was a turning point [for the introduction of sound]. \"The Bioscope\" greeted it with, 'We are inclined to wonder why we ever called them Living Pictures.'\" The Paris sound premiere followed in January 1929.\nBefore the 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in May 1929, honoring films released between August 1927 and July 1928, \"The Jazz Singer\" was ruled ineligible for the two top prizes\u2014the Outstanding Picture, Production and the Unique and Artistic Production\u2014on the basis that it would have been unfair competition for the silent pictures under consideration. By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, the same was true in much of Western Europe. Jolson went on to make a series of movies for Warner, including \"The Singing Fool\", a part-talkie, and the all-talking features \"Say It with Songs\" (1929), \"Mammy\" (1930), and \"Big Boy\" (1930).\nCritical analysis.\nJack Robin's use of blackface in his Broadway stage act\u2014a common practice at the time, which is now widely condemned as racist\u2014is the primary focus of many \"Jazz Singer\" studies. Its crucial and unusual role is described by scholar Corin Willis:\nIn contrast to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in \"The Jazz Singer\" is at the core of the film's central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration of the notion of duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927\u201353 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), \"The Jazz Singer\" is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the narrative development and thematic expression.\nThe function and meaning of blackface in the film is intimately involved with Jack's own Jewish heritage and his desire to make his mark in mass American culture\u2014much as the ethnically Jewish Jolson and the Warner brothers were doing themselves. Jack Robin \"compounds both tradition and stardom. The Warner Brothers thesis is that, really to succeed, a man must first acknowledge his ethnic self,\" argues W. T. Lhamon. \"[T]he whole film builds toward the blacking-up scene at the dress rehearsal. Jack Robin needs the blackface mask as the agency of his compounded identity. Blackface will hold all the identities together without freezing them in a singular relationship or replacing their parts.\"\nSeymour Stark's view is less sanguine. In describing Jolson's extensive experience performing in blackface in stage musicals, he asserts, \"The immigrant Jew as Broadway star ... works within a blackface minstrel tradition that obscures his Jewish pedigree, but proclaims his white identity. Jolson's slight Yiddish accent was hidden by a Southern veneer.\" Arguing that \"The Jazz Singer\" actually avoids honestly dealing with the tension between American assimilation and Jewish identity, he claims that its \"covert message ... is that the symbol of blackface provides the Jewish immigrant with the same rights and privileges accorded to earlier generations of European immigrants initiated into the rituals of the minstrel show.\"\nLisa Silberman Brenner contradicts this view. She returns to the intentions expressed by Samson Raphaelson, on whose play the film's script was closely based: \"For Raphaelson, jazz is prayer, American style, and the blackface minstrel the new Jewish cantor. Based on the author's own words, the play is about blackface as a means for Jews to express a new kind of Jewishness, that of the modern American Jew.\" She observes that during the same period, the Jewish press was noting with pride that Jewish performers were adopting aspects of African American music.\nAccording to Scott Eyman, the film \"marks one of the few times Hollywood Jews allowed themselves to contemplate their own central cultural myth, and the conundrums that go with it. \"The Jazz Singer\" implicitly celebrates the ambition and drive needed to escape the \"shtetls\" of Europe and the ghettos of New York City, and the attendant hunger for recognition. Jack, Sam, and Harry [Warner] let Jack Robin have it all: the satisfaction of taking his father's place \"and\" of conquering the Winter Garden. They were, perhaps unwittingly, dramatizing some of their own ambivalence about the debt first-generation Americans owed their parents.\"\nLegacy.\nThree subsequent screen versions of \"The Jazz Singer\" have been produced: a 1952 remake, starring Danny Thomas and Peggy Lee; a 1959 television remake, starring Jerry Lewis; and a 1980 remake starring Neil Diamond, Lucie Arnaz, and Laurence Olivier. \"The Jazz Singer\" was adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of Lux Radio Theatre, both starring Al Jolson, reprising his screen role. The first aired August 10, 1936; the second, also starring Gail Patrick, on June 2, 1947.\nDisney made reference to the film, and its follow-up \"The Singing Fool\", in the title of the 1929 Mickey Mouse short, \"The Jazz Fool\".\n\"The Jazz Singer\" was parodied in the 1936 Warner Bros. cartoon \"I Love to Singa\", directed by Tex Avery. Its hero is \"Owl Jolson\", a young owl who croons popular ditties, such as the title song, against the wishes of his father, a classical music teacher. Among the many references to \"The Jazz Singer\" in popular culture, perhaps the most significant is that of the MGM musical \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952). The story, set in 1927, revolves around efforts to change a silent film production, \"The Dueling Cavalier\", into a talking picture in response to \"The Jazz Singer\"'s success. At one point Donald O'Connor's character suggests a new name for the now-musical, \"I've got it! 'The Dueling Mammy'.\" The plot of \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Like Father, Like Clown\" (1991) parallels the tale of Jakie Rabinowitz/Jack Robin. Krusty the Clown's rabbi father disapproves of his son's choice to be a comedian, telling him, \"You have brought shame on our family! Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive.\"\nAccording to film historian Krin Gabbard, \"The Jazz Singer\" \"provides the basic narrative for the lives of jazz and popular musicians in the movies. If this argument means that sometime after 1959 the narrative must belong to pop rockers, it only proves the power of the original 1927 film to determine how Hollywood tells the stories of popular musicians.\" More broadly, he also suggests that this \"seemingly unique film\" has \"become a paradigm for American success stories.\" More specifically, he examines a cycle of biopics of white jazz musicians stretching from \"Birth of the Blues\" (1941) to \"The Five Pennies\" (1959) that trace their roots to \"The Jazz Singer\".\nIn 1996, \"The Jazz Singer\" was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" motion pictures. In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the American Film Institute as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety. In 2007, a three-disc deluxe DVD edition of the film was released. The supplemental material includes Jolson's Vitaphone short, \"A Plantation Act\" (1926).\nThe phrase said by Al Jolson, \"Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothin' yet!\" was voted as the 71st best quote by the American Film Institute.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is part of the Seville metropolitan area, lying south of the city of Seville. With a population of 140,463 as of 2024, it is the second-largest municipality in the Province of Seville, the 9th-largest in Andalusia and 50th-largest in Spain.\nHistory.\nThe town\u2019s name, which means \"two sisters\", dates from its founding in 1248 by King Ferdinand III of Castile and honours Elvira and Estefan\u00eda Nazareno, the two sisters of Gonzalo Nazareno, one of the king's principal military commanders. For this reason natives of Dos Hermanas are called \"nazarenos/as\".\nIn Tirso de Molina's play \"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\" (\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\") (1612-1620), Dos Hermanas is mentioned as the place where Don Juan Tenorio manages to interpose himself in the marriage of two plebeians, Arminta and Batricio, whom he cleverly deceives. \"The Trickster of Seville and Stone Guest\" is the play from which the myth of \"Don Juan\" derives the name.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population is 7,015, equal to 5.0% of the total population. The 5 largest foreign nationalities are Moroccans (690), Colombians (666), Venezuelans (522), Germans (374) and Argentinians (357).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activities of the city today are the production and distribution of olive oil and \"Spanish olives\", together with a significant number of service industries.\nTransmitter.\nAt Dos Hermanas, south of Los Palacios (geographical coordinates: ), there is a powerful broadcasting mediumwave facility with a guyed mast, used for the transmission of the first program of RNE with 300\u00a0kW on 684\u00a0kHz. The transmitter, which is most often designated as \"RNE-1 Sevilla\" can be received easily at night throughout Europe and northern Africa.\nTransport.\nThe main area of the city is crossed by the Cercan\u00edas Sevilla commuter-rail, with lines C-1 and C-5 serving the area. The district of Montequinto has 4 stations of Seville Metro, connecting the city to the capital of the province.\nSports.\nThe town's football club, Dos Hermanas CF, was founded in 1971. It plays in the Primera Andaluza, the highest league in the region. It has had four spells playing in national leagues, including the third tier, the Segunda B, between 1999 and 2002. It returned to regional football in 2010.\nDos Hermanas has hosted an annual chess tournament since 1989.\nNotable people.\nThe members of Spanish lounge music duo Los del R\u00edo (known for their song \"Macarena\") are natives of Dos Hermanas and still reside in the city.\nSpanish popstar Melody comes from Dos Hermanas. In 2014, a controversy was sparked when an interviewer for Cuatro TV asked her about her polished accent 'despite being from Dos Hermanas', leading to debate on classism and Madrid-centric snobbery regarding Andalusian accents. Melody represented Spain at the Eurovision Song Contest 2025, coming in 24th place.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "68181", "revid": "20876515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68181", "title": "Workstation", "text": "High-end single-user computer\nA workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by a single user, they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. The term \"workstation\" has been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, Apollo Computer, DEC, HP, NeXT, and IBM which powered the 3D computer graphics revolution of the late 1990s.\nWorkstations formerly offered higher performance specifications than mainstream personal computers, especially in terms of processing, graphics, memory, and multitasking. Workstations are optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as 3D mechanical design, engineering simulations like computational fluid dynamics, animation, video editing, image editing, medical imaging, image rendering, computational science, generating mathematical plots, and software development. Typically, the form factor is that of a desktop computer, which consists of a high-resolution display, a keyboard, and a mouse at a minimum, but also offers multiple displays, graphics tablets, and 3D mice for manipulating objects and navigating scenes. Workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories, and collaboration tools like videoconferencing.\nThe increasing capabilities of mainstream PCs since the late 1990s have reduced the distinction between PCs and workstations. Typical 1980s workstations have expensive proprietary hardware and operating systems to categorically distinguish from standardized PCs. From the 1990s and 2000s, IBM's RS/6000 and IntelliStation have RISC-based POWER CPUs running AIX, versus its corporate IBM PC Series and consumer Aptiva PCs which have Intel x86 CPUs and typically run Microsoft Windows. However, by the early 2000s, this difference largely disappeared, as workstation manufacture shifted to the use of highly commoditized hardware dominated by large PC vendors, such as Dell, HP Inc., and Fujitsu, selling x86-64 systems running Windows or Linux.\nHistory.\nOrigins and development.\nWorkstations are older than the first personal computer (PC). The first computer that might qualify as a workstation is the IBM 1620, a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console. It was introduced in 1959. One peculiar feature of the machine is that it lacks any arithmetic circuitry. To perform addition, it requires a memory-resident table of decimal addition rules. This reduced the cost of logic circuitry, enabling IBM to make it inexpensive. The machine is codenamed CADET and was initially rented for $1000 per month.\nIn 1965, the IBM 1130 scientific computer became the successor to 1620. Both of these systems run Fortran and other languages. They are built into roughly desk-sized cabinets, with console typewriters. They have optional add-on disk drives, printers, and both paper-tape and punched-card I/O.\nEarly workstations were generally dedicated minicomputers, a multiuser system reserved for one user. For example, the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), is regarded as the first commercial minicomputer.\nWorkstations have historically been more advanced than contemporary PCs, with more powerful CPU architectures, earlier networking, more advanced graphics, more memory, and multitasking with sophisticated operating systems like Unix. Because of their minicomputer heritage, from the start workstations have run professional and expensive software such as CAD and graphics design, as opposed to PCs' games and text editors. The Lisp machines developed at MIT in the early 1970s pioneered some workstation principles, as high-performance, networked, single-user systems intended for heavily interactive use. Lisp Machines were commercialized beginning 1980 by companies like Symbolics, Lisp Machines, Texas Instruments (the TI Explorer), and Xerox (the Interlisp-D workstations). The first computer designed for a single user, with high-resolution graphics (and so a workstation in the modern sense), is the Alto developed at Xerox PARC in 1973. Other early workstations include the Terak 8510/a (1977), Three Rivers PERQ (1979), and the later Xerox Star (1981).\n1980s rise in popularity.\nIn the early 1980s, with the advent of 32-bit microprocessors such as the Motorola 68000, several new competitors appeared, including Apollo Computer and Sun Microsystems, with workstations based on 68000 and Unix. Meanwhile, DARPA's VLSI Project created several spinoff graphics products, such as the Silicon Graphics 3130. Target markets were differentiated, with Sun and Apollo considered to be network workstations and SGI as graphics workstations. RISC CPUs increased in the mid-1980s, typical of workstation vendors. Competition between RISC vendors lowered CPU prices to as little as $10 per MIPS, much less expensive than the Intel 80386; after large price cuts in 1987 and 1988, a personal workstation suitable for 2D CAD costing $ to $ was available from multiple vendors. Mid-range models capable of 3D graphics cost from $ to $, while high-end models overlapping with minicomputers cost from $ to $ or more.\n\"InfoWorld\" in 1989 described Sun as \"the unquestioned leader in the workstation arena\". It and other RISC workstation vendors like Hewlett-Packard (HP) were very successful in luring customers from traditional minicomputer companies like DEC and Data General with more performance per dollar, forcing them to release their own workstations that year. Apollo said that systems costing less than $ were half of all workstation sales. By then a $ \"personal workstation\" might be a high-end PC like Macintosh II or IBM PS/2 Model 80, low-end workstation, or a hybrid device like the NeXT Computer, all with similar, overlapping specifications. Workstation prices were declining by 20% annually; the Apollo DN2500 cost as little as $, which an industry analyst said was the \"magic price point\" where customers would consider workstations over PCs. \"BYTE\" predicted \"Soon, the only way we'll be able to tell the difference between traditional workstations and PCs will be by the operating system they run\", with the former running Unix and the latter running OS/2, classic Mac OS, and/or Unix. Many workstations by then had some method to run increasingly popular and powerful PC software such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft Word. Another differentiator between PC and workstation was that the latter was much more likely to have a graphics accelerator with support for a graphics standard like PHIGS or X Window, while the former usually depended on software rendering or proprietary accelerators. The computer animation industry's needs typically caused improvements in graphical technology, with CAD using the same improvements later. \"BYTE\" demonstrated that year that an individual could build a workstation with commodity components with specifications comparable to commercially available low-end workstations.\nBy 1990, when IBM announced RS/6000, workstations were the fastest-growing segment of the PC market. Competition decreased prices so quickly that Gartner Group that year advised depreciation for Unix RISC systems of 45% or more annually, twice the normal rate. Workstations often featured SCSI or Fibre Channel disk storage systems, high-end 3D accelerators, single or multiple 64-bit processors, large amounts of RAM, and well-designed cooling. Additionally, the companies that make the products tend to have comprehensive repair/replacement plans. As the distinction between workstation and PC fades, however, workstation manufacturers have increasingly employed \"off-the-shelf\" PC components and graphics solutions rather than proprietary hardware or software. Some \"low-cost\" workstations are still expensive by PC standards but offer binary compatibility with higher-end workstations and servers made by the same vendor. This allows software development to take place on low-cost (relative to the server) desktop machines.\nThin clients.\nWorkstations diversified to the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance, called the thin client or network computer. Dependent upon a network and server, this reduces the machine to having no hard drive, and only the CPU, keyboard, mouse, and screen. Some diskless nodes still run a traditional operating system and perform computations locally, with storage on a remote server. These are intended to reduce the initial system purchase cost, and the total cost of ownership, by reducing the amount of administration required per user.\nThis approach was first attempted as a replacement for PCs in office productivity applications, with the 3Station by 3Com. In the 1990s, X terminals filled a similar role for technical computing. Sun's thin clients include the Sun Ray product line. However, traditional workstations and PCs continued to drop in price and complexity as remote management tools for IT staff became available, undercutting this market.\n3M computer.\nA high-end workstation of the early 1980s with the three Ms, or a \"3M computer\" (coined by Raj Reddy and his colleagues at CMU), has one megabyte of RAM, a megapixel display (roughly 1000\u00d71000 pixels), and one \"MegaFLOPS\" compute performance (at least one million floating-point operations per second). RFC 782 defines the workstation environment more generally as \"hardware and software dedicated to serve a single user\", and that it provisions additional shared resources. This is at least one order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time. The original 1981 IBM Personal Computer has 16 KB memory, a text-only display, and floating-point performance around ( with the optional 8087 math coprocessor). Other features beyond the typical personal computer include networking, graphics acceleration, and high-speed internal and peripheral data buses.\nAnother goal was to bring the price below one \"megapenny\", that is, less than $, which was achieved in the late 1980s. Throughout the early to mid-1990s, many workstations cost from $ to $ or more.\nDecline.\nThe more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream PCs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment:\nMarket position.\nSince the late 1990s, the workstation and consumer markets have further merged. Many low-end workstation components are now the same as the consumer market, and the price differential narrowed. For example, most Macintosh Quadra computers were originally intended for scientific or design work, all with the Motorola 68040 CPU, backward compatible with 68000 Macintoshes. The consumer Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci models can be upgraded to the Quadra 700. \"In an era when many professionals preferred Silicon Graphics workstations, the Quadra 700 was an intriguing option at a fraction of the cost\" as resource-intensive software such as Infini-D brought \"studio-quality 3D rendering and animations to the home desktop\". The Quadra 700 can run A/UX 3.0, making it a Unix workstation. Another example is the Nvidia GeForce 256 consumer graphics card, which spawned the Quadro workstation card, which has the same GPU but different driver support and certifications for CAD applications and a much higher price.\nWorkstations have typically driven advancements in CPU technology. All computers benefit from multi-processor and multicore designs (essentially, multiple processors on a die). The multicore design was pioneered by IBM's POWER4; it and Intel Xeon have multiple CPUs, more on-die cache, and ECC memory.\nSome workstations are designed or certified for use with only one specific application such as AutoCAD, Avid Xpress Studio HD, or 3D Studio Max. The certification process increases workstation prices.\nModern market.\nGPU workstations.\nModern workstations are typically desktop computers with AMD or NVIDIA GPUs to do high-performance computing on software programs such as video editing, 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and rendering.\nDecline of RISC workstations.\nBy January 2009, all RISC-based workstation product lines had been discontinued:\nIn early 2018, RISC workstations were reintroduced in a series of IBM POWER9-based systems by Raptor Computing Systems. In October 2024, System 76 introduced the Thelio Astra, an ARM workstation tailored for car software development.\nx86-64.\nMost of the current workstation market uses x86-64 microprocessors. Operating systems include Windows, FreeBSD, Linux distributions, macOS, and Solaris. Some vendors also market commodity mono-socket systems as workstations.\nThese are three types of workstations:\nDefinition.\nA high-end desktop market segment includes workstations, with PC operating systems and components. Component product lines may be segmented, with premium components that are functionally similar to the consumer models but with higher robustness or performance.\nA workstation-class PC may have some of the following features:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He set world records in the 100-yard dash and 100 meters event and Olympic records in the 100 meters and 200 meters events. He was the first non-Euro-American to receive the title of the \"world's fastest human\" after winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters events at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In March 1935, Tolan won the 75, 100 and 220-yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in Melbourne to become the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships. In his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7.\nEarly years.\nTolan was born in Denver, Colorado, one of four children. Tolan's father was Thomas Tolan. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah when Tolan was young, and moved again to Detroit, Michigan in 1924, when Tolan was 15 years old. Tolan later recalled, \"My father read about better opportunities for Negroes here, so he packed up Mom and the four kids and we came here.\"\nCass Tech High School.\nTolan attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit where he was an outstanding football player and sprinter. While at Cass Tech, Tolan set state records in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. While still in high school, Tolan ran the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds and the 220-yard dash in 21.5 seconds. Aged 16, Tolan was a member of a two-man team from Cass Tech that won the 1925 National Interscholastic indoor meet in Chicago. He won his first sprint double at the state meet as a sophomore, and in 1927 he won the 100 and 220-yard dashes at the National Interscholastic Championship at Soldier Field in Chicago. Despite his accomplishments as a sprinter, Tolan's first love was football, and he often said \"the six touchdowns he scored in one game as a 131-pound quarterback at Detroit's Cass Tech High School was his greatest thrill, rather than his double win in the Olympics.\"\nUniversity of Michigan.\nFootball.\nTolan was recruited by several major universities as a football player and chose the University of Michigan. There are differing accounts as to why Tolan never played on the varsity football team at Michigan. According to a published account in The Detroit News in 2002, Tolan joined the freshman football team as a freshman in 1927. At that time, no African-American had played on Michigan's varsity football team since George Jewett in the 1890s. Tolan was initially allowed to play, but on the third day of practice, the freshman football coach told him, \"Some of the coaches are disagreeing on your chances. Some of them think that you shouldn't be allowed to play football. I'd be tickled to have you, but I'm afraid I'm going to be outvoted.\" \"The Detroit News\" noted that the freshman coach was outvoted: \"They took away Eddie Tolan's football uniform and handed him a track suit in exchange.\"\nOther accounts indicate it was an injury that prevented Tolan from playing football at Michigan. An Associated Press story on Tolan in 1958 stated: \"He would have been a football great as a quarterback, had a knee injury in his junior year in high school not forced him to channel all his energies to track.\" In his obituary, the Associated Press reported that the coaches at Michigan \"talked the pint-sized speedster into going out for track.\" Tolan was also quoted as saying, \"The track team did a lot more traveling then, so I saw the opportunity to travel on a Pullman and see the country.\"\nBig Ten and world sprint champion.\nAt Michigan, Tolan ran track under the mentorship of two of the great sprinters of their generations. Michigan's head coach, Steve Farrell, was considered \"the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known\" in the 1880s and 1890s. And Michigan's assistant coach Charles B. Hoyt, who took over from Farrell in 1930, was rated \"America's best sprinter\" in 1913, but lost his opportunity to compete in the 1916 Olympics due to World War I. Coaches at Michigan weren't supportive in the face of racism Tolan faced while traveling, and even told him he'd be the last black athlete on the team if he complained.\nAs a sophomore in May 1929, Tolan broke the Big Ten Conference record and tied the world's record for the 100 yard dash with a time of 9.6. Press coverage starting with this world record run, and throughout his career, focused on three features \u2013 Tolan's race, his eyeglasses, and his short stocky build. Tolan was one of the first African-Americans to have success in sprinting, and he raced with eyeglasses taped to his head. Various accounts put his height anywhere from 5 feet, 4\u00a0inches, to 5 feet, 7\u00a0inches. One writer noted that Tolan \"looks like a church deacon.\" Another writer described Tolan's appearance this way:\nTolan, known as the 'Midnight Express,' was tall and weighed . He smiled often, raced while chewing gum, and could be easily identified by a bandage around his left knee to protect an old football injury. In addition he wore horn-rimmed glasses held in place with adhesive tape.\nTolan's gum-chewing became part of his routine. He chewed gum before a race to relieve stress. After accidentally running with the gum in his mouth, Tolan found that he was chewing in sync with his stride. Tolan later began chewing gum as part of his routine, chewing the gum faster when he needed to accelerate his leg movements.\nAt the Big Ten championships in May 1930, Tolan broke the world's record in the 100-yard dash with a time of 9.5. Tolan's performance was accepted by the International Amateur Athletic Federation as the new official world's record.\nSeven weeks after breaking the world's record in the 100-yard dash, Tolan also broke the world's record in the 100 meters race. Competing in Vancouver, British Columbia, Tolan shaved two-tenths of a second off the record with a time of 10-1/5 seconds. Track officials in Vancouver announced after the race, that Tolan's record-setting performance was \"all the more remarkable in the fact that he ran uphill, the finish mark being thirty inches higher than the starting point.\"\nTolan's world-record performances in 1930 brought him international fame, as he became known as the \"Midnight Express.\" In May 1931, Tolan again broke the world's record in the 100 meters event with a time of 10.3 seconds in Vancouver. Southern California sprinter Frank Wykoff jumped to a slight lead, but Tolan came from behind to pass Wykoff at the 100-yard mark.\nTolan graduated from the University of Michigan in 1931.\nDouble gold medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nLead-up to the Olympics.\nAfter graduating from Michigan, Tolan enrolled at West Virginia State College, where he did \"graduate work preparatory to teaching and coaching at a Negro institution.\" Early in 1932, Tolan was not running at his prior level. Despite the slow start, Dean Cromwell, Chairman of the All American Board of Track and Field, predicted great things for Tolan in his column on 1932's \"Olympic Prospects.\" Cromwell wrote of Tolan:\nJust as spring warms into summer Tolan slides from the class of mediocre sprinters to that of the champions. He is a slow starter, but when the weather gets warm so does Eddie, and off he goes.\nWhile press reports regularly referred to Tolan as \"stocky,\" Cromwell took issue with that characterization:\nEddie is now 24 years of age, five feet six inches tall and weights about 130 pounds. Although he has always been termed 'stocky' by the press, a comparison of his weight and height will show that he cannot properly be so styled. He is well muscled, though, and in action gives the impression of great running power, with his arms and legs working smoothly and strongly in a machine piston-like manner.\nThe Olympic trials were held at Stanford University, and Ralph Metcalfe won both the 100 and 200 meters finals, with Tolan finishing second to Metcalfe in each case. The results meant that the top two American sprinters in the 1932 Olympics would for the first time be African-Americans. As a result, much of the press attention focused on race. \"Los Angeles Times\" sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote: \"Metcalfe and Tolan make the ace of spades look positively pale by comparison \u2026 But how these boys can run \u2026 And they figure to do even better here than they did at Palo Alto because it's warmer now and they enjoy the heat.\"\n100 meters race.\nThe 100 meters contest at the 1932 Olympics was one of the closest races in Olympic history. Tolan broke the Olympic record in the first heat of the second round with a time of 10.4 seconds, but Metcalfe remained the favorite. In the finals, Japanese sprinter Takayoshi Yoshioka jumped out to a four-yard lead after 40 meters. Tolan passed Yoshioka at the 60 meter mark and had a two-yard lead over Metcalfe at the 100-yard mark. But Metcalfe passed Tolan at the tape and appeared to the crowd to be the winner. Sports writer Maxwell Stiles described the last strides as follows:\nHis powerful legs churning wildly, Metcalfe swept down upon little Tolan like an avenging angel full of fury. Tolan, his left knee in an elastic bandage and his glasses taped to his head near his ears, dug in for one last desperate stride in his effort to hold the lead. Just at the tape, Metcalfe rushed past Tolan and was well ahead a yard beyond the finish. Almost everyone thought Metcalfe had won.\nIt was hours later, after review of films taken with a \"Kirby two-eyed camera,\" that officials were able to declare Tolan the winner with a time of 10.3 seconds. The films showed that Tolan and Metcalfe hit the finish line in a dead heat, but Tolan was declared the winner, because he had his entire torso past the line on the ground before Metcalfe.\n200 meters race.\nThe 200 meters race was held on the fourth day of competition, and this time the race was not close, as Tolan beat Metcalfe easily with an Olympic record time of 21.2 seconds \u2013 four-tenths of a second better than the prior record of 21.6 seconds. Tolan stumbled slightly with three yards to go, but righted himself and finished with a four-foot lead. With double wins in the 100 and 200 meters contests, Tolan was dubbed the \"world's fastest human.\" Tolan was the first African-American to have that distinction, and press coverage of his Olympic wins focused on his race. The Associated Press called him the \"spectacled little American Negro\" and \"the dusky little thunderbolt.\" Braven Dyer referred to him as \"the stubby colored boy,\" and noted that \"the chunky Detroit Negro\" had defeated Arthur Jonath of Germany, \"the white-skinned Teuton.\" Another writer described how the \"little black man with horn-rimmed glasses\" crossed the finish line, being chased by \"a white man of America, George Simpson,\" and \"a brother black, Ralph Metcalfe.\"\nCommentators also noted, that the only other two sprinters to win double gold in the 100 and 200 meters races were also University of Michigan athletes, Ralph Craig and Archie Hahn.\nReaction to Tolan's Accomplishments.\nAfter the sprint competition concluded, a reporter interviewed Tolan and Metcalfe in their shared room at the Olympic Village. When Metcalfe teased Tolan for being lucky, Tolan replied, \"Yeah, I had it all right \u2013 but it's 'bout time, Ralph; first little ol' luck I had in eight years!\" Still in bed at noon wearing pajamas and with a stocking cap on his head, Tolan said he was \"in the best condition of my life when the 200 meters final started,\" and he vowed to give his gold medals to his mother.\nBack in Detroit, Mayor Frank Murphy appointed a reception committee to meet Tolan at the train station, and Michigan Governor Wilber M. Brucker declared September 6, 1932 as \"Eddie Tolan Day\" throughout the state. The governor issued a proclamation stating that Tolan had \"brought honor to our commonwealth\" and encouraging communities throughout the state to arrange ceremonies \"as an expression of Michigan's pride in his achievement.\"\nTolan's mother noted, that she was proud of her son's accomplishments. She noted that, though she had worked hard as the sole provider for the family, it was worth it. She added, \"If my menfolk could only find jobs I could ease up a bit and a mighty big worry would be off Eddie's mind.\"\nIn April 1936, Tolan, along with many other sports champions and stand outs, were honored at a banquet in Detroit, MI. This Banquet was the first celebration of Champions Day.\nVaudeville and hard times.\nLess than six months after winning Olympic gold medals and the title of the \"world's fastest human,\" Tolan garnered national press when he fell on hard times. Syndicated columnist William H. Beatty wrote that \"the heady wine of victory has turned overnight to vinegar\" for Tolan. Tolan noted that, when he was met at the train station by a welcoming committee, his half-brother was collecting waste paper in the grass of the park in front of the train station. Tolan noted that his half-brother was \"luckier than I am,\" because he had a job. His parents had both been unemployed for many months, and it was not until January 1933 that Tolan was able to get a low-paying job as a filing clerk in a county office. Tolan's lifetime dream of becoming a physician was waning, as he had been \"unable to make enough to support himself and his parents.\"\nDesperate to earn a living, Tolan \"walked the streets of many cities, seeking work,\" and even briefly appeared in vaudeville in 1932 with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson. They made a good team; Tolan had set world records for running forwards, and Robinson had set world's records for running backwards: 50 yards backward sprint (6 seconds), 75 yards backwards sprint (8.2 seconds), and 100 yards backwards sprint (13.2 seconds).\nBecause of his brief appearance in vaudeville, the Michigan Amateur Athletic Association stripped Tolan of his amateur status in June 1933. And in April 1934, Tolan's bad luck continued as an automobile he was driving struck and seriously injured an 80-year-old pedestrian.\nProfessional sprinting career.\nIn November 1934, Tolan took a leave of absence from his job as assistant county registrar of deeds to compete in the Australian sprint program, a series of five professional races, including the Stawell Gift handicap. Tolan returned in April 1935 after having set new Australian records of 21.5 seconds in the 220-yard dash on a full curve track and 7.5 seconds for the 75-yard dash. He won the 75, 100, and 220-yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in March 1935 in Melbourne, and became the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships.\nIn his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7. Throughout his career as a sprinter, Tolan worked by a simple creed: \"Start fast, run easily, stay in your lane and finish strong.\"\nCivil service and teaching career.\nAfter returning from Australia, Tolan returned to his job in Detroit as a clerk to the Register of Deeds. During World War II he worked as a material checker for Packard Motor Car Company and worked at a variety of jobs in the 1940s and 1950s. The 1950 census shows that he owned a gas station In 1956, Tolan became a school teacher in physical and health education. He taught at the Irving Elementary School on Detroit's West Side for several years.\nDeath and family.\nTolan never married. He was, however, briefly engaged in 1938 to Johnnie Mae McConcico as was noted in the New Pittsburgh Courier on July 9, 1938.\nIn 1965, Tolan's kidneys failed, and he was required to undergo weekly dialysis treatments for the rest of his life. In 1967, Tolan died from heart failure at age 58 at Detroit's Mt. Carmel Hospital, while undergoing one of his weekly treatments. At the time of his death, Jesse Owens paid him tribute in \"Jet\" magazine:\nWhen I was in high school, Eddie and Ralph (Metcalfe) were my idols. Eddie and I later became close friends. I used to live in Detroit and every time I'd go back Eddie was one of the first ones I'd look up.\nTolan was survived by his sisters, June Brown and Martha Lombard, and a brother, Hart H. Tolan. Though the two never met, Tolan was also a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan. Eddie Tolan is interred at United Memorial Gardens in Plymouth, Michigan.\nHonors and awards.\nIn 1958, Tolan was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. He was one of the first 18 persons inducted. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1980. Only 17 individuals were inducted into the Hall before Tolan.\nTolan was one of many athletes honored in 1936 for Champions Day in Detroit, Michigan.\nTolan was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.\nEddie Tolan was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1982.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6\u00a0billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac800.1 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", written by and Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed \"Blaugrana\".\nBarcelona are one of the world's most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 80 trophies: 28 La Liga, 32 , 2 Copa de la Liga, 15 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Bar\u00e7a has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May\u00a02023[ [update]]. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as \"El Cl\u00e1sico\".\nBarcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media followings in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy\u2014Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi\u2014were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.\nBarcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, and UEFA Champions League titles, and also became the first European football club to win six competitions in a single year, by also triumphing in the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.\nHistory.\n1899\u20131922: Beginnings.\nOn 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in \"Los Deportes\" declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the \"Gimnasio Sol\u00e9\" on 29 November. Eleven players attended \u2013 Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Oss\u00f3, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons \u2013 and formed Foot-Ball Club Barcelona.\nFC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the . In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Bar\u00e7a won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware, and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1\u20132 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper \u2013 now known as Joan Gamper \u2013 became club president, attempting to prevent Barcelona from shutting down. The club was struggling financially, socially, and in performance. They had not won a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\" He was club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, spending a total of 25 years in the role. One of his main achievements was ensuring Bar\u00e7a acquired its own stadium and thus generated a stable income.\nOn 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Ind\u00fastria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears \u2013 with some minor changes \u2013 as of the present day.\nThe stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team, winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913. The Pyrenees Cup was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe. It consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia, all former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era. Notable figures of Bar\u00e7a's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.\nDuring the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ram\u00f3n Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6\u20132.\nGamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.\nIn 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer. In 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as Barcelona's first full-time manager. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alc\u00e1ntara, the Bar\u00e7a team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, F\u00e9lix Ses\u00famaga, and Franz Platko. This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.\n1923\u20131931: Primo de Rivera, and first golden age.\nOn 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the club's transition to professional football. The first time the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed to operate a professional football club was in 1926.\nOn 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.\n1931\u20131939: Republic, and Civil War: Assassination of President Sunyol.\nAlthough they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escol\u00e0, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, they did not win at a national level in this time, with the exception of their 1937 disputed title in the Mediterranean League.\nA month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of \"barcelonisme\", and his assassination was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.\nOn 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices. A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation, and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to \"Club de F\u00fatbol Barcelona\" and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.\n1940\u20131957: Post-war, and start of Franco's regime.\nIn 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del General\u00edsimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3\u20130. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11\u20131. According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11\u20131 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\" It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.\nDespite the difficult political situation, \"CF Barcelona\" enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like C\u00e9sar, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.\nOn a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2\u20131 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. A tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, and it received the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia. Many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.\nCoach Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala led the team to five different trophies in 1952. These were La Liga, the Copa del General\u00edsimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini &amp; Rossi. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del General\u00edsimo again.\n1957\u20131978: Club de F\u00fatbol Barcelona.\nWith Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Su\u00e1rez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two Hungarians recommended by Kubala, S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Zolt\u00e1n Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2\u20133 to Benfica in the final.\nThe 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fust\u00e9 and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del General\u00edsimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona beat Real Madrid 1\u20130 in the 1968 Copa del General\u00edsimo final at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to \"Futbol Club Barcelona\" and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters.\nJohan Cruyff joined in the 1973\u201374 season. He was bought for a world record \u00a3920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973\u201374 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5\u20130 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.\n1978\u20132000: N\u00fa\u00f1ez and stabilization.\nIn 1978, Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona. Since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency lasted 22 years. It deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.\nThe club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup on 16 May 1979, beating Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf 4\u20133 in Basel. More than 30,000 travelling \"blaugrana\" fans watched the final. The same year, N\u00fa\u00f1ez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.\nIn June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of \u00a35\u00a0million from Boca Juniors. In the following season, under coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona soon left to join Napoli. At the start of the 1984\u201385 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager. He won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final. The team lost on penalties to Steaua Bucure\u0219ti in Seville.\nAround this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president N\u00fa\u00f1ez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N\u00fa\u00f1ez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.\nAfter the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was fired at the beginning of the 1987\u201388 season and replaced with Luis Aragon\u00e9s. The season finished with the players rebelling against president N\u00fa\u00f1ez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1\u20130 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.\nIn 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager. He assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\". He used Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain, and signed international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Rom\u00e1rio, and Hristo Stoichkov.\nTen years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, its players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.\nUnder Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff did not win any trophies in his final two seasons, and fell out with president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez, resulting in his departure.\nReacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called \"L'Elefant Blau\", was to oppose the presidency of N\u00fa\u00f1ez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.\nCruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996\u201397. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV, and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.\nRonaldo soon left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer. However, new heroes emerged, such as Lu\u00eds Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its \"centenari\", winning the Primera Divisi\u00f3n title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and N\u00fa\u00f1ez resigning in 2000.\n2000\u20132008: Exit N\u00fa\u00f1ez, enter Laporta.\nThe departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.\nDespite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael M\u00e1rquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Xavi and V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a in 2004\u201305, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in a 3\u20130 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernab\u00e9u, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1\u20130 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2\u20131, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.\nDespite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006\u201307 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5\u20132, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4\u20130. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.\nBarcelona finished the 2007\u201308 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4\u20131 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.\n2008\u20132012: Guardiola era.\nBarcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season. Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Lionel Messi.\nBar\u00e7a beat Athletic Bilbao 4\u20131 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2\u20136 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008\u201309 La Liga champions. Bar\u00e7a finished the season by beating Manchester United 2\u20130 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup. Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a for a ninth time.\nAfter Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes. Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for \u20ac40\u00a0million and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for \u20ac19\u00a0million. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.\nIn November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5\u20130 in \"El Cl\u00e1sico\". At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010. In the 2010\u201311 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points. In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1\u20130 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia. In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3\u20131 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup. In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc F\u00e0bregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.\nLater the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2\u20130 with goals from Messi and F\u00e0bregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies. The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.\nIn December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4\u20130 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and F\u00e0bregas. As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16. Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, \"They mesmerise you with their passing\", their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections, announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova. Guardiola finished his tenure with Bar\u00e7a winning the Copa del Rey final 3\u20130, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Bar\u00e7a had won under his coaching.\nIt was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2\u20131 to them at the beginning of March. They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.\n2014\u20132020: Bartomeu era.\nOn 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013\u201314 season. Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a 1\u20131 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.\nBarcelona won the treble in the 2014\u201315 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice. On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years. On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou. On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3\u20131 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years. Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.\nOn 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015\u201316 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5\u20134 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3\u20130 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Su\u00e1rez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament. The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly. By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014. On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010\u201311 season, with a 1\u20131 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015\u201316 Copa del Rey. With a 5\u20131 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988\u20131989 season. After Bar\u00e7a reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2\u20131 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons. The front three of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.\nOn 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6\u20131 (aggregate score 6\u20135), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4\u20130. On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor. On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\". The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors. Two directors, Jordi Mon\u00e9s and Carles Vilarrub\u00ed, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played. Winning La Liga for the 2017\u201318 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5\u20131 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history. On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title. However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Bar\u00e7a losing the second leg 0\u20134 after being up 3\u20130 after a home victory.\nOn 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Seti\u00e9n replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona. Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Seti\u00e9n had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position. Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona. Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.\n2021\u2013present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era.\nOn 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote. Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4\u20130 in the final. In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of \u20ac1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Bar\u00e7a player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain. The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.\nPoor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him. Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003\u201304, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals. In the domestic league, Xavi improved Bar\u00e7a's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.\nOn 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3\u20131 in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final. On 14 May 2023, Barcelona mathematically clinched their 27th league title with four games to spare, the first in the post-Messi era.\nSupport.\nThe nickname \"culer\" for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan \"cul\" (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Ind\u00fastria, sat with their \"culs\" over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Bar\u00e7a sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003\u201304 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media. As of 2023[ [update]], the club has 150,317 memberships, called \"socis\".\nIn addition to membership, as of March 2022[ [update]] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called \"penyes\", around the world. The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona. Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103\u00a0million Facebook fans as of December\u00a02021[ [update]], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million. The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.\nClub rivalries.\n\"El Cl\u00e1sico\".\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (\"El Cl\u00e1sico\"). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\". In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the \"Coup d'\u00e9tat\" against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid). During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto \"M\u00e9s que un club\" (\"English: More than a club\") because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.\nThere's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed \"CF Barcelona\" succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del General\u00edsimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11\u20131 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del General\u00edsimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernab\u00e9u's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernab\u00e9u, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Di St\u00e9fano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di St\u00e9fano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di St\u00e9fano play the 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954\u201355 and 1956\u201357 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to \"Los Blancos\", signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di St\u00e9fano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.\nDi St\u00e9fano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959\u201360 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960\u201361. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500\u00a0million people. An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams \u2013 often involving mocking the opposition \u2013 such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing them.\n\"El derbi Barcelon\u00ed\".\nBar\u00e7a's local rival has always been Espanyol. \"Blanc-i-blaus\", being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Bar\u00e7a's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarri\u00e0.\nTraditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Bar\u00e7a's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.\nIn 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the \"derbi\" has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera divisi\u00f3n league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Bar\u00e7a on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928\u20132022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Bar\u00e7a in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6\u20130 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5\u20130 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2\u20131 win against Bar\u00e7a during the 2008\u201309 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.\nRivalry with AC Milan.\nOne of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan. The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid\u2013Juventus (21) and Real Madrid\u2013Bayern Munich (26). Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Bar\u00e7a's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups. Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.\nBarcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959\u201360 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Bar\u00e7a won the tie on a 7\u20131 aggregate score (0\u20132 in Milan and 5\u20131 in Barcelona). While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4\u20130 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs. In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0\u20132 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012\u201313 Champions League, winning 4\u20130 at Camp Nou.\nOwnership and finances.\nAlong with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Barcelona, called \"socis\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2023[ [update]], the club has 150,317 \"socis\".\nIn 2010, \"Forbes\" evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around \u20ac752\u00a0million (US$1\u00a0billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008\u201309 season. According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of \u20ac366\u00a0million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated \u20ac401\u00a0million in revenue. In 2013, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6\u00a0billion. In 2014, \"Forbes\" ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2\u00a0billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of \u20ac484.6\u00a0million. In 2017, \"Forbes\" ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64\u00a0billion. In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues. In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of \u00a310m ($13.8m) per year. However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4\u00a0billion in 2021, much of it short-term.\nOn November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsorship deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.\nIn popular culture.\nSince its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture. The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Bar\u00e7a \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\". The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.\nIn literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled \"Blau i grana\". Poet Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Bar\u00e7a with \"The unarmed army of Catalonia.\" He also wrote that \"Bar\u00e7a is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.\"\nThe great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Antoni T\u00e0pies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s, on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\", the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.\nThe Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alum\u00e0, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni T\u00e0pies or Josep Viladomat, who made the 'Avi del Bar\u00e7a' sculpture in the La Masia. Salvador Dal\u00ed paid tribute to the club's 75th anniversary with an etching.\nIn performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Bar\u00e7a fans, from the El Paralelo cupl\u00e9s from before the Civil War or skits like 'El Partido del Domingo', by Casta\u00f1os, to more recent texts, like \"El cul\u00e9kul\u00e9\", by Xavier Bosch.\nIn times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Bar\u00e7a has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the 'Bar\u00e7a Cultura' plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia. In 2022, Barcelona and \u00d2mnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.\nThere are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called \"FC Barcelona: A New Era\". It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021\u201322 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022\u201323 behind the scenes season.\nRecords.\nIn March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.\nBarcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years. In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pel\u00e9's 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club. Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions, and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga. Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez (190), Luis Su\u00e1rez (147), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108). Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the , with 64 goals.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gij\u00f3n in 1952. Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Eulogio Mart\u00ednez became Bar\u00e7a's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1957.\nBarcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s winning a record five each. Vald\u00e9s had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record, and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona. Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.\nBarcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917\u20131924) and (1931\u20131933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, with 32 trophies.\nBarcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986. The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.\n\"El Bar\u00e7a de les Cinc Copes\" is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951\u20131952). Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple). In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for \u20ac120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history. In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of \u20ac222 million.\nIn 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.\nKits and crest.\nThe club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm. The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.\nThe blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors.\nSince 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record \u20ac155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga. In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of \u20ac179 million.\nAlthough Spanish clubs first began displaying sponsor names on their shirts in 1981, Barcelona held off having a name across the front of the shirt until 2006, when the club signed an agreement to have UNICEF's name on their front. Unlike traditional deals, this was not to have paying money to the club, but instead to have the club raise money for UNICEF. In 2011, the club signed its first commercial shirt sponsorship deal, when it reached an agreement with Qatar Foundation.\nAnthems.\nThroughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Bar\u00e7a\" (The Song of Bar\u00e7a), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espin\u00e0s and composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.\nThe song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at Camp Nou before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at Camp Nou. Since the 2008\u201309 season, el Cant del Bar\u00e7a has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.\nOn the occasion of the club's 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vall\u00e8s Symphony Orchestra, the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0 choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.\nEl Cant del Bar\u00e7a is turned on before Barcelona games take place at Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.\nStadium.\nBarcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Ind\u00fastria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.\nIn 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Bar\u00e7a was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.\nAfter the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make plans for a new stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Bar\u00e7a fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288\u00a0million pesetas, 336% over budget.\nIn 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.\nIn December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the \"Espai Bar\u00e7a\" project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history. Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated \u20ac1.5 billion net funding. During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023\u201324 season to Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.\nThere are also other facilities, which include:\nPlayers.\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\n \"As of 3 September 2025\"\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReserve team and Youth Academy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nManagement.\nTechnical staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLast updated: 11 September 2025Source: https:// FC Barcelona\nFootball Sport Management.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLast updated: 16 September 2025Source: https://\nBoard of directors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLast updated: 27 March 2024Source: https://\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Riverworld is an artificial, or heavily terraformed, planet where all humans (and pre-humans) who ever lived throughout history have been resurrected. The novels (and a few shorter works) explore interactions of resurrected individuals from many different cultures and time periods. The underlying theme is quasi-religious. The motivations and ethics of the unknown intelligences that created the Riverworld and its inhabitants are explored.\nThe series' cast of characters includes (among others) Cyrano de Bergerac, Richard Francis Burton, Hermann G\u00f6ring, John, King of England, Alice Liddell, Jack London, Tom Mix, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Odysseus, and Mark Twain. \nWorks.\nOriginal, unpublished manuscript.\n\"Riverworld\" began when Farmer wrote a 150,000-word novel, calling it \"Owe for the Flesh\", over six weeks in the fall of 1952 and submitted it at the last minute to the Shasta Science-Fiction Novel Prize Contest. He won the contest, with assurances of publication, but circumstances conspired to ensure that that would not happen for many years. The complete manuscript, now believed lost, consisted of four \"books\":\nIn about 1981, and in the wake of the success of the Riverworld novels, Farmer issued a general request to anyone who might have the original manuscript. An 80,000-word document entitled \"River of Eternity\" was then discovered in a garage and returned to Farmer. This turned out to be, not the original, but a version produced in the mid-1950s by Farmer (who had entirely forgotten about it) from the third \"book\" at the request of the publisher Melvin Korshak. This document was published unaltered in 1983 by Phantasia Press as \"River of Eternity\" and is generally considered to be of mostly academic interest.\nMagazine publications.\nWith no prospect of imminent publication, Farmer moved on to other projects. But in 1963 and '64, he rewrote the material into a second version and in late 1964 into a third, which he now called \"Owe for a River\". This version was submitted to Ballantine Books, but it was rejected as being too much of an adventure story without sufficient deeper philosophical implications. Undaunted, he sent the manuscript to Frederik Pohl who at that time edited a number of prominent science fiction magazines. Pohl suggested that Farmer break the novel into several novelettes for serial publication in his periodicals. Farmer agreed, and thus the fourth version of what started out as \"Owe for the Flesh\" 13 years before finally saw publication as five novelettes:\nOf these five novelettes, four\u2014all but \"Riverworld\"\u2014were expanded and combined into the first two Riverworld novels as published by Putnam Publishing Group in 1971. Thus the fifth, and final, version of the Riverworld sequence comprises the four \"mainstream\" (Farmer's term) novels (1971-80) listed below, plus the extra \"sidestream\" book, \"Gods of Riverworld\" (1983).\nAs to the novelette that remained a \"standalone\"\u2014\"Riverworld\"\u2014it underwent a slight expansion and was included in Farmer's collection \"Down in the Black Gang\" in 1971. After one more (final) expansion and polishing, it was included in the collection \"Riverworld and Other Stories\" in 1979.\nPublished novels (and short stories).\nThe five novels in the Riverworld series are as follows:\nIn the early 1990s, it was decided to turn Riverworld into a shared universe anthology series, with numerous authors being invited to participate. Two volumes were released:\nStory.\nSetting.\nOn the Riverworld, every human who ever lived and died\u2014from the earliest Neanderthals up to 1983\u2014is resurrected on the banks of a seemingly endless river on an unknown planet. Along the river's almost 18 million twisting and turning miles, some 36.6 billion humans are miraculously provided with food, but with no clue to the possible meaning or purpose of this strange afterlife.\nSome people set sail upon the great river to quest for the meaning of their resurrection, and to find and confront their mysterious \"benefactors\". Among the denizens of the Riverworld, we meet Sir Richard Francis Burton, Mark Twain, Odysseus, Cyrano de Bergerac, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Tom Mix, and many others, including a modest alter ego of the author himself. Some characters collaborate and some embark upon solo journeys of their own in this landscape.\nOverview.\nStarting in the \"late twenty second century\", the Riverworld has been engineered by an alien race to consist solely of a single long river-valley which snakes across its entire surface. The river's source is a small North Polar sea, from which it follows a course tightly zig-zagging across one hemisphere before flowing into another, along an equally labyrinthine path, to the same sea. The river has an average depth of , and its width ranges from to . It is shallow near the shore but plunges to enormous depths towards the channel. The banks are generally smooth and gentle, expanding into wide plains on either side, then assuming jagged hills before an impenetrable mountain range. The valley averages in width, but includes narrows and occasional widenings into lakes with islands. From source to mouth, the original supposition of the river's length is 20,000,000 miles, as said by Alice Hargreaves and attributed to Peter Frigate, shortly after the defeat of Hermann Goering. (Books I, II, and III later state the river is long). There are no seasons, and daily variations are metronomic. The only animal life consists of fish and soil worms. The vegetation is lush and of great variety, including trees, flowering vines, several kinds of fast-growing bamboo, and a resilient mat of grass which covers the plains. The Riverworld has no visible moon, but a great number of stellar objects in the sky, including gas sheets and stars close enough to show a visible disk.\nThe story of Riverworld begins when 36,006,009,637 humans, varying from the first \"Homo sapiens\" until the early 21st century, are simultaneously resurrected along the river. Of these, 20% are from the 20th century, due to the high population thereof. Originally the cutoff year was given as 2008 in \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\", but this later was modified to 1983 in \"The Dark Design\". Purportedly, the cut-off indicated the point at which most of the human race had been purposefully annihilated by first contact with aliens visiting Earth. The protagonists later find this a creative fiction, produced by the masterminds of the resurrection. Undercover agents of these masters placed on the Riverworld would identify themselves as having died after 1983 so as to be recognized by fellow agents.\nIn each area are initially three groups of people: a large group from one time period and place, a smaller group from another time and place, and a very small group of people from random times and places (most of the 20th- and 21st-century humans are part of this last group).\nResurrectees.\nMost of the resurrected awaken in a body equivalent to that of their 25-year-old selves, in perfect health and free of any previous genetic or acquired defects. All heart disease, tooth decay, and blindness are gone, all amputated limbs are restored, and all scars, tattoos and other body modifications are removed; whereas certain neurological impulses (for instance, curiosity or chemical addiction) remain intact. These bodies do not age, and can regenerate nearly any non-fatal injury, including dismemberments and blindings. The new bodies are completely free of infection and seem resistant to it (albeit in the absence of hostile bacteria or viruses on the Riverworld). Initially hairless, the bodies grow cephalic hair and pubic hair at a normal rate. Men do not have foreskins or grow facial hair; whereas women have intact hymens. It is impossible to conceive children on the Riverworld; all food provided by grails (see below) contain contraceptive substances, and there is no wathan generator on the Riverworld so any babies born there would lack sapience (see below).\nAnyone who died at an age younger than 25 assumes a body equivalent to that lesser age, which then ages at a normal rate before stopping at 25. Should an individual die, they are resurrected elsewhere along the banks of the river at random. Some people even use this process to travel, though there is a limit to the number of resurrections available to each person; one of the main protagonists is warned by the creators of the Riverworld that after 777 deliberate suicides he is in danger of failing to resurrect after his next death. No one who was less than five years old at death is resurrected on the Riverworld, nor are people deemed to be incurably insane (it is eventually revealed that these people were resurrected on another planet, Gardenworld). No hominids born before the approximate year 97,000 BCE were saved for the Riverworld project and thus were never resurrected anywhere.\nOne of the themes of the series is the way historical characters change as a result of this cosmopolitan setting. For example, one of the characters depicted in the first book of the Riverworld series, \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\", is a tormented, drug-addicted Hermann G\u00f6ring who ends up as a missionary of the Church of the Second Chance, a peaceful religion. Apparently left to their own devices, the people re-create their Earthly societies.\nLanguage.\nBecause all human languages are initially in use on the Riverworld, the Ethicals are not able to explain clearly to the resurrected Humans what's happening. In order to explain without misunderstanding, they must first spread a common language. They choose Esperanto to be the common language and create a religion called the Church of the Second Chance to spread it via traveling priests.\nGrails.\nThe resurrected awaken with nearly-indestructible containers tied to their wrists, commonly called \"grails\", which produce food, drink, pieces of cloth, and luxury items, such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana (and lighters for same), hair care utensils, makeup, and a hallucinogenic chewing gum known as \"dreamgum\". To operate, grails must be placed onto large, mushroom-shaped \"grailstones\", found at intervals along the riverbanks, which produce an electrical discharge three times per day (corresponding to the times of breakfast, lunch and dinner). As agriculture is absent, and indeed impossible on the Riverworld, the grails are vital to an individual's survival, and cannot be opened except by their individual owners. Nevertheless, \"grail slavery\" is not uncommon, in which a person is held captive and the contents of his or her grail, retrieved by the owner, are taken by force by the captor. The slaver will usually provide the slave with enough food to keep him or her alive, as once a person dies their grail becomes useless.\nOf special value are \"free grails\", originally found atop each of the grailstones as a demonstration of their relationship. Free grails can be opened by any individual, and as such, are valued for an extra ration of goods at each interval. Throughout the series, several main characters lose their original grails and thus must seek free grails to survive.\nNatural resources and travel.\nThough the grails provide for all needs and the climate is hospitable, further attempts to affect the environment are frustrated by the near-complete lack of metals and ores on the planet. The only building materials available are bamboo, wood, and human or fish bones and hides. Pockets of flint (eventually depleted) provide material for tools. With technology limited to the Paleolithic level, the surrounding mountains prove impassable.\nTravel along the river is hindered by division of the Riverworld into thousands of empires, monarchies, republics, and other social systems which evolve, each only a few kilometers long and housing 90 people per square kilometer. Because the distribution of populations along the river seems random, the character of these nations can vary wildly within a very short span; one may enter dangerously unknown and potentially hostile territory in less than a day's journey.\nPurpose.\nThe reason for the existence of Riverworld is initially a complete mystery. In Farmer's books a number of historical figures\u2014including Sir Richard Burton, Alice Hargreaves, Samuel Clemens, Baron de Marbot, King John of England, Cyrano de Bergerac, Tom Mix, Mozart, Jack London, Lothar von Richthofen, and Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2014interact with fictional characters to discover the Riverworld's purpose. Another character, Peter Jairus Frigate, bears a striking resemblance to Farmer himself, and shares his initials. There are two versions of the character: one who appears early in the sequence, the third overall character to be introduced, and another, the \"real\" version, who concludes that the first was his brother who died as a baby, resurrected and used as a spy by the creators of the Riverworld.\nThe story gradually reveals that the Riverworld was created as a moral test for humanity. In the Riverworld universe sapience is the result of an artificially created soul, known as a \"wathan\", created by a generator developed and distributed among various worlds by an unknown ancient alien race. Wathan generators create wathans which attach themselves to sufficiently advanced chordates. Wathans are indestructible but become detached from the body upon physical death and wander the universe without purpose.\nThe first race to create wathans were adept tool users, but lacked individual sapience. Self-awareness increased their capabilities by an order of magnitude, and as the creators of wathan technology, they were able to \"catch\" wathans released by their own deaths, resurrecting themselves until individual resurrections became impossible. As this happened only to the wisest and most ethically advanced wathans, the people supposed a process of \"passing on\", comparable to the Indian religious concept of Moksha. With this in mind, they traveled the universe, placing wathan generators on worlds that could host wathans, thereby creating other sentient species. Once they created a species they determined they could trust, they tasked them with creating more sapient species after the whole of their own species had \"passed on\". This cycle occurred several times until the creation of humanity.\nHumanity's creators are a race of aliens known, among their human allies, as \"the Ethicals\", who brought wathan technology to Earth, installing both a generator to produce wathans and a collector to catch and store wathans\u2014and the human personas and memories accumulated by them\u2014for later retrieval. The only Ethical seen in the stories is Monat Graatut, who poses as an ally and friend of Richard Francis Burton. The reason given for the collector was that humans were both extraordinarily civilized (capable of \"passing on\" within a single lifetime, as did Gautama Buddha), and extraordinarily barbaric (capable of genocide, slavery etc.), and therefore might or might not be trusted with wathan technology; an ambiguity meant for resolution by the Riverworld. Children who died before age five are resurrected on a \"Gardenworld\": a physical paradise where the children were raised as Ethicals, who later created the Riverworld in hope of stimulating moral contemplation. The repetitive physical environment was to encourage a concern with inward rather than outward circumstances, while the poverty of natural resources was to prevent the development of a higher technology, and the food provided by the grails, the presence of abundant water and potential shelter, and the resurrections were to obviate economy. Alcohol, marijuana, and the LSD-like dreamgum were provided for recreational purposes and to assist contemplation.\nAcademic study.\nThree books of the Riverworld series are analyzed in Mary Turzillo's book \"Reader's Guide to Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer\".\nAntoine Ruiz of the Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon (France) wrote a master's degree memoir entitled \"Redemption in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's Riverworld\" in 1995.\nElaborations and adaptations.\nRole playing game (1989).\nA licensed guidebook outlining the setting for use in the GURPS role-playing game, \"GURPS Riverworld\" was released in 1989 by Steve Jackson Games. Copies of this guidebook were provided to the authors of the stories published in \"Tales of Riverworld\" and \"Quest to Riverworld\", as this book summarizes the chronology, characters, geography and technical details of the Riverworld universe.\n\"Shared Universe\" stories (1992 and later).\nSince the publication of the original books, several authors have been licensed to use the \"Riverworld\" setting for their own stories\u2014see \"Works\" towards the top of this page.\nVideo game (1998).\nA PC computer game version of \"Riverworld\" was released in October 1998 by Cryo Interactive.\nTelevision series (2003).\nA television series loosely based on the \"Riverworld\" saga went into production for the Sci-Fi channel in 2001 but only the feature-length pilot episode \"Riverworld\" was completed. It was first aired in 2003. It used elements from \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\" and \"The Fabulous Riverboat\", though it replaced the books' hero, Sir Richard Francis Burton, with an American astronaut, and King John of England with Nero as the villain.

Persson has served as chairman of Swedbank since 2019.\nPersson was first elected to the Riksdag for S\u00f6dermanland County in 1979, but left in 1985 and became a Municipal Commissioner of Katrineholm, serving until 1989. In 1991, he was re-elected to Parliament for the same constituency. He served as Minister for Schools from 1989 to 1991 in Ingvar Carlsson's first and second cabinets. From 1994 to 1996, Persson served as the Minister for Finance in Carlsson's third cabinet.\nAfter Carlsson announced his retirement as head of government, Persson was selected to become his successor. Persson began his premiership from where he left as Minister for Finance \u2014 by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden's chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about thirteen percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). But after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6 percent of GDP in 1997, which placed Sweden in a position to qualify for the European Economic and Monetary Union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around thirteen percent, then suddenly fell to about 6.5 that same year. In the 1998 general election, the Social Democrats gained even fewer votes than in the 1991 general election, in which they lost their government position. Persson could remain as prime minister due to the support of the Green Party and the Left Party. In the 2002 general election, the Social Democrats increased their number of seats in the parliament. Following the 2006 general election defeat, Persson immediately filed a request for resignation, and declared his intentions to resign as party leader after the party congress in March 2007.\nSince leaving office, Persson has been a consultant for the Stockholm-based PR firm JKL. He published a book in October 2007, \"Min v\u00e4g, mina val\" (My path, my choices). In 2008, he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Sveaskog by the Swedish Government. He has been a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation since 2007, and a member of the board of World Resources Institute since 2010.\nPersonal life.\nPersson was born in Ving\u00e5ker in S\u00f6dermanland, Sweden, in a working-class home. He has in recent years revealed that he wanted to become a priest as a young man; however, he applied to the college in \u00d6rebro where he took courses in social science (main sociology). He completed 80 college credits (120 ECTS credits) in the subject before he left the college in 1971 without graduating. As the college later received credentials as a full university, the renamed \u00d6rebro University gave him an honorary Ph.D. in medicine in February 2005, an award that provoked some controversy.\nHe first married Gunnel (n\u00e9e Claesson) in 1978, with whom he has two daughters. They divorced in 1994. On 10 March 1994, he married Annika Barthine, whom he divorced in December 2003. On 6 December 2003, Persson married Anitra Steen, who became his third wife. In 2004, Persson and Steen purchased the 190-hectare agricultural property, \u00d6vre Torp, by Lake B\u00e5ven in S\u00f6dermanland. During 2006 the couple started the construction of a large house on the property.\nBesides his native Swedish, Persson also speaks English.\nHe has maintained his Christian faith and is a member of Swedish Association of Christian Social Democrats.\nHealth problems.\nOn 8 July 2002, Persson fell while riding his bicycle at Harpsund and broke his left clavicle. Following this accident he was unable to lift his left arm for some time and almost fainted during a speech in Almedalen on 10 July 2002 and after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on 15 July 2002. Present with him during the accident was P\u00e4r Nuder, Minister for Finance, and Sten Olsson, State Secretary. P\u00e4r Nuder wrote in his book \"Stolt men inte n\u00f6jd\" (\"proud but not satisfied\"), released in 2008, that Persson had fallen while riding his bicycle because he was drunk after consuming large amounts of alcoholic beverages. Persson said in response to these claims: \"I can't exactly recapitulate the event but I can say as much that I'm surprised that P\u00e4r Nuder remembers anything\".\nIn September 2003 Persson was diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis and surgery was recommended. He chose to go through Sweden's public health-care system instead of seeking private treatment; he was put on a waiting list, and finally received a hip replacement operation in June 2004. During that 9-month period, he walked with a limp and reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.\nPolitical career.\nPersson was in office for more than ten years, making him the second-longest continuously-governing prime minister of Sweden second to Tage Erlander. He is known for his oratorical prowess, often dispensing with prepared speeches or preparing them without the aid of his staff. During his time, he has faced several shocking incidents, such as the Gothenburg riots in June 2001, the murder of Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in September 2003, Asian tsunami disaster in December 2004 during the Boxing Day, and the conflict over the publication of satirical Muhammed cartoons in Danish newspapers, leading to threats of violence against Scandinavians and burning of embassies in the Middle East and the resignation of Swedish Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds.\nIn the early seventies he worked for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (\"SSU\"), and was a member of the national board from 1972 to 1975. Later, he served as a city council politician at the small municipality of Katrineholm. In 1979 he was elected Member of Parliament, but went back to local politics to serve as Municipal Commissioner (\"kommunalr\u00e5d\") of Katrineholm from 1985 to 1989.\nNational politics.\nIn 1989, he was made minister of schools in the Ministry of Education during the first Ingvar Carlsson cabinet, until the election in 1991 when the Social Democrats were voted out of office. Persson was one of the brains behind the \"Persson-plan\" which was presented in 1994 targeting the prevailing economic situation. Sweden at the time still suffered from the recession which began during the early nineties, high unemployment rates and a huge budget deficit. Prime minister Carl Bildt relied at the time on a fragile coalition between the Moderate Party and three other liberal or conservative parties with a strained degree of cooperation. The outcome of the 1994 election proved a success for the Social Democrats when they gained more than 45 per cent of the votes.\nUpon returning to government in 1994, Persson was made minister for finance, a post he held until 1996. As minister for finance much of his job was focused on attaining a sound financial balance in the economy. Persson often emphasizes that he \"cleaned up\" after the Bildt government.\nDuring his time at the Finance Ministry he followed 10 \"Commandments\" as his guiding lights in his job. Among of these \"Commandments\" was one in particular which became famous in Sweden, \"one who is in debt is not free\" ( in Swedish : \"Den som \u00e4r satt i skuld \u00e4r icke fri\" )\nParty leader and Prime Minister.\nIn 1996, Persson was chosen over Mona Sahlin, the Deputy Prime Minister, to lead the country after Carlsson retired. Persson began where he left off as finance minister\u00a0\u2013 by continuing to spearhead government efforts to alleviate Sweden's chronic budget deficit. In 1994, the annual shortfall was about 13 per cent of GDP. But, after implementing welfare cuts and tax increases, it fell to a projected 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1997, which put Sweden in a position to qualify for the European economic and monetary union. However, the cost was high: unemployment rose, hovering persistently around 13 per cent, then suddenly fell to about 6.5 per cent the same year.\nFrom 1998 to 2002.\nIn the 1998 election the Social Democrats gained even fewer votes than in the 1991 election, when they got voted out of office. Thanks to support that came primarily from the Green and Left parties, he managed to retain office but had to rely on support from at least two parties in the parliament. Later the same year, the government announced proposals for far-reaching cutbacks in Sweden's military spending.\nThe year 1999 was seen by the Social Democrats as the vindication for the tough fiscal policies pursued since they came to office in 1994: GDP growth was estimated at 3.6 per cent, well above the European average, inflation remained subdued, and the budget was in surplus for the first time in the 1990s. The party proposed income tax cuts for 2000.\nIn 2000, a strong economy, falling unemployment, and the impact of the Internet appeared to breathe new life into the \"Swedish model\" of a welfare society, one that had seemed dead and buried during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4 per cent, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Around this time, the Persson government began reversing cuts by boosting child support. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36 per cent approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.\nEconomically, the bursting of the dot-com boom by 2001 had marked implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's once fast-expanding Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups.\nGross domestic product growth of 3.6 per cent in 2000 was expected to have fallen to around 1.5 per cent in 2001, and only a minor recovery was forecast for 2002. The government was hoping that tax cuts, subsidies on child-care expenses, and wage increases would boost consumer confidence with real disposable income to increase by 5.4 per cent. Exports were also expected to pick up in 2002, helped by the weakness of the Swedish krona, which hit record lows against both the dollar and the Euro in 2001.\nIn 2001, Persson became the first Western leader to visit North Korea when heading European Union delegation talks with then-leader Kim Jong-Il.\n2002 election.\nIn the 2002 election the Social Democrats increased their number of seats in the parliament primarily at the expense of the Left Party. Persson continued to lead a minority government instead of forming a coalition, despite earlier demands from his supporting parties to participate in the government.\n2006 election.\nAfter the defeat at the general elections of 17 September 2006, Persson immediately filed a request for resignation, and declared his intentions to resign as party leader after a special party congress in March 2007.\nOn 13 April 2007, Persson also announced his resignation from the Riksdag (where he had served 1979\u20131985 and from 1991) to be succeeded by Caroline Helmersson Olsson from his native Ving\u00e5ker.\nAfter leaving office.\nIn October 2007, Persson released his memoirs, \"Min v\u00e4g, mina val\" (My path, my choices). http://\nIn March 2007 a documentary series consisting of four one-hour episodes aired on SVT, chronicling Persson's time in office. The documentary became controversial due to Persson's negative comments about both his party members and staff and against his political opponents.\nPersson left his seat in the Riksdag in April 2007. In May 2007 he announced that he would be working as a consultant for the Stockholm-based PR firm JKL in the future. In April 2008 he was installed as chairman of the board of Sveaskog, a forestry business group owned by the Swedish government. He held the post until 2015. In 2019 he became chairman of Swedbank, one of Sweden's largest banks.\nIn late 2008, he became a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit organization established to monitor tolerance in Europe and prepare recommendations on fighting xenophobia and intolerance on the continent.\nIn March 2010, Persson was elected to the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute.\nForeign policy.\nRegarding Sweden's membership in the European Union, Persson has been an advocate of an expanded Swedish role in the organization. During Sweden's presidency of the EU in the first half of 2001, Persson with assistance from foreign minister Anna Lindh presided over the organization and contributed towards the enlargement which took place in 2004. He advocated for a Swedish entry into the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), however in a 2003 referendum a majority of Swedes voted against joining the EMU.\nITF: Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research.\nIn 1998, Prime Minister Persson initiated international talks on the establishment of an inter-governmental organisation for Holocaust education, which resulted in the founding of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research (ITF). The ITF now has 27 Member States.\nHe had already raised the issue of Holocaust education within the Swedish Parliament, initiating a national information campaign with the aim for 'facts about the Holocaust to form the platform for a discussion on democracy, tolerance and the fact that every human was of equal value.' The Campaign was entitled Living History, or Levande Historia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Also known as the Vi\u1ec7t Minh Front (), it was created by the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) as a united front to achieve the independence for the nation of Vietnam and later established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV), being the predecessor of the contemporary Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\nThe was previously formed by H\u1ed3 H\u1ecdc L\u00e3m in Nanjing, China, at some point between August 1935 and early 1936, when Vietnamese nationalist parties formed an anti-imperialist united front. This organization soon lapsed into inactivity, only to be taken over by Ho Chi Minh and the ICP in 1941. They presented the organization as inclusive of political groups, with a founding charter more nationalist than communist. It exhorted \"soldiers, workers, peasants, intellectuals, civil servants, merchants, young men and women\" to overthrow \"French jackals\" and \"Japanese fascists\", while the group's first chairman was a non-communist. In general, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh established itself as the only organized anti-French and anti-Japanese resistance group.\nFollowing the Japanese occupation, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh opposed Japan with support from the Republic of China, and later from the US Office of Strategic Services. After World War II, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and opposed the re-occupation of Vietnam by the French Union, resulting in the First Indochina War. It also opposed non-communist Vietnamese nationalists, such as the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng, during the civil conflicts, and later opposed the State of Vietnam as well as its successor, the Republic of Vietnam. Until 1948, this organization advocated putting aside the issue of class struggle and dictatorship of the proletariat to focus on gaining sovereignty for Vietnam. However, the organization's stance changed after being recognized by communist China and the Soviet Union in January 1950.\nThe political leader of Vi\u1ec7t Minh was Ho Chi Minh. The military leadership was under the command of V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. Other founders were L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n and Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng.\nThe \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c l\u1eadp \u0110\u1ed3ng minh\" is not to be confused with the \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u00e1ch m\u1ec7nh \u0110\u1ed3ng minh H\u1ed9i\" (League for the Vietnamese Revolution, abbreviated as \"Vi\u1ec7t C\u00e1ch\") which was founded by Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1ea3i Th\u1ea7n. Vi\u1ec7t C\u00e1ch later briefly joined the Vietnamese National Coalition in 1946.\nToday, the Vietnam Fatherland Front \u2013 a socio-political coalition led by the Communist Party of Vietnam forming the Vietnamese government \u2013 is recognized as the modern incarnation of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh front in current Vietnamese politics.\nFoundation.\nThe League for Independence of Vietnam (Viet Minh) was founded on 19 May 1941 in P\u00e1c B\u00f3, Cao B\u1eb1ng province (in northern Vietnam). Ho Chi Minh was the founder and his Indochinese Communist Party was the main leadership organization within Viet Minh.\nLeadership.\nHo Chi Minh was the highest leader. Nguy\u1ec5n L\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u1eb1ng was appointed as the Direct of the General Department (from 1941 to 1951). Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u1ee5 was appointed as the Secretary of the General Department (from 1941 to 1943 when he was captured by colonial French), and then Ho\u00e0ng Qu\u1ed1c Vi\u1ec7t took over the position (from 1943 to 1951).\nNguyen Luong Bang, Hoang Van Thu and Hoang Quoc Viet were members of the Communist Party.\nOrganization.\nAt the national level, Viet Minh is governed by the General Department (\"T\u1ed5ng b\u1ed9\"). Further down there were executive committees in provinces and cities; and executive commissions in communes.\nHowever, due to political turmoil and civil unrest at the time, plus conflicts with Japanese and French forces, the Viet Minh's General Department was not completely elected. Hence the details about members of the General Department were very scarce and not fully understood.\nViet Minh established strongholds in northern and central Vietnam. But in southern Vietnam, Viet Minh faced many challengers such as Cao \u0110\u00e0i, H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o (religious sects) and B\u00ecnh Xuy\u00ean (armed group).\nComponents.\nMain members.\nThe founding and core members of Viet Minh were the communists. Other non-communists also joined the front.\nOther opposite parties.\nEven though many opposite parties fought against Viet Minh, many of their members joined Viet Minh and worked with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nReligious organizations.\nThe majority of Buddhists supported Viet Minh. The majority of Catholics, Cao \u0110\u00e0i, and H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o initially supported the Viet Minh but later split into pro\u2013Viet Minh, pro\u2013State of Vietnam, and neutral factions.\nPeripheral wings.\nViet Minh established many youth wing, woman wing and military wing. They aimed to draw supports from people of different backgrounds, classes, races, genders and religions.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Japan occupied French Indochina. As well as fighting the French in the battles of Khai Phat and Na Ngan, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh started a military campaign against the Japanese. For instance, a raid at Tam Dao internment camp in Tonkin on 19 July 1945 saw 500 Viet Minh kill fifty Japanese soldiers and officials, freeing French civilian captives and escorting them to the Chinese border. The Viet Minh also fought the Japanese 21st Division in Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, and regularly raided rice storehouses to alleviate the ongoing famine.\nAs of the end of 1944, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh claimed a membership of 500,000, of which 200,000 were in Tonkin, 150,000 in Annam, and 150,000 in Cochinchina. After the Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina, the Viet Minh and ICP prolifically expanded their activities. They formed national salvation associations (cuu quoc hoi) that, in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province alone, enlisted 100,000 peasants by mid-1945. This was backed by the Vanguard Youth (Thanh Nien Tien Phong) in Cochinchina, which expanded to 200,000 by early summer. In the northern provinces of Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc, their armed forces seized control, after which they distributed lands to the poor, abolished the corv\u00e9e, established qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef classes, local village militias, and declared universal suffrage and democratic freedoms.\nDue to their opposition to the Japanese, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh received funding from the United States, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. After the August Revolution's takeover of nationalist organizations and Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's abdication to the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence by proclaiming the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on 2 September 1945.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[A]\nFirst Indochina War.\nWithin days, the Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalist) Army arrived in Vietnam to supervise the repatriation of the Imperial Japanese Army in the North. In the South, Franco-British armies had attacked the Viet Minh since 23 September 1945. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam therefore existed only in theory and effectively controlled no territory. A few months later, the Chinese, Vietnamese and French came to a three-way understanding. The French gave up certain rights in China, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed to the return of the French in exchange for promises of independence within the French Union, and the Chinese agreed to leave. Negotiations between the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh broke down quickly in December 1946. What followed was nearly ten years of war against France. This was known as the First Indochina War or, to the Vietnamese, \"the French War\". The Viet Minh had also been in conflict with the nationalists and Trotskyists since August 1945.\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh, who were short on modern military knowledge, created a military school in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i province in June 1946. More than 400 Vietnamese were trained by Japanese defectors in this school. These soldiers were considered to be students of the Japanese. Later, some of them fought as generals against the Republic of Vietnam in the Vietnam War or, to the Vietnamese communists, \"the American War\". Young insurgents of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh also received training in the use of modern firearms by some foreign volunteers, such as Stefan Kubiak.\nFrench General Jean \u00c9tienne Valluy quickly pushed the Vi\u1ec7t Minh out of Hanoi. His French infantry with armored units went through Hanoi, fighting small battles against isolated Vi\u1ec7t Minh groups. The French encircled the Vi\u1ec7t Minh base, Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc, in late 1947, they caused great damage to the Viet Minh but failed to decisively defeat the Vi\u1ec7t Minh forces, and retreated soon after. According to the communists, the campaign was a Vi\u1ec7t Minh \"victory\" over the well-equipped French force. While the war with the Viet Minh was ongoing, France decided to seek an alternative political solution by negotiating with the anti-communist nationalists led by former emperor Bao Dai, leading to the establishment of the unified and \"independent\" State of Vietnam within the French Union in June 1949. However, the new state remained indirectly controlled by France and was only gradually given power. The United States recognized the new country in February 1950 to help the French fight communism (but opposed colonialism) and opposed the Viet Minh's government that got recognized by the USSR and communist China in January.\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh continued fighting lonely against the French until 1950 when they got a massive and important help from the Chinese communists, and later the border of China and Vietnam was linked together as a result of the campaign called \"Chi\u1ebfn d\u1ecbch Bi\u00ean gi\u1edbi\" (\"Borderland Campaign\"/Battle of Route Coloniale 4) that year. The newly communist People's Republic of China gave the Vi\u1ec7t Minh both sheltered bases and heavy weapons with which to fight the French. With the additional weapons, the Vi\u1ec7t Minh were able to take control over many rural areas of the country.\nVictory and dissolution.\nOn 7 March 1951, Viet Minh and National United League of Vietnam (\"H\u1ed9i Li\u00ean Vi\u1ec7t\") merged to form the Vietnamese United Front (M\u1eb7t tr\u1eadn Li\u00ean Vi\u1ec7t). Nonetheless, people continued to call the new front as Viet Minh. In late 1953, the Viet Minh began a land reform that turned out to be a disaster.\nLater the United Front changed into the current Vietnam Fatherland Front (\"M\u1eb7t tr\u1eadn T\u1ed5 qu\u1ed1c Vi\u1ec7t Nam\") on 10 September 1955.\nFollowing their defeat at the Battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, the French began negotiations to end the conflict. As a result of peace accords worked out at the Geneva Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Vietnam was divided into North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the 17th Parallel with the French army retreating to the South and the Viet Minh army retreating to the North as a temporary measure until unifying elections could take place in 1956. Transfer of civil administration of North Vietnam to the Viet Minh was given on 11 October 1954. Ho Chi Minh was appointed Prime Minister of North Vietnam, which would be run as a socialist state. Ngo Dinh Diem, who was previously appointed Prime Minister of South Vietnam by Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, eventually assumed control of South Vietnam.\nThe Geneva Accords promised elections in 1956 to determine a national government for a united Vietnam. Neither the United States government nor Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. With respect to the question of reunification, the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam, but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegate Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng, who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of \"local commissions\". The United States countered with what became known as the \"American Plan\", with the support of South Vietnam and the United Kingdom. It provided for unification elections under the supervision of the United Nations, but was rejected by the Soviet delegation. From his home in France, Vietnamese Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i appointed Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m as Prime Minister of South Vietnam. With United States support in rigging the referendum of 1955 using secret Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funding, Di\u1ec7m removed the Emperor and declared himself the president of the Republic of Vietnam. A year later, the republic's constitution was promulgated.\nThe United States believed Ho Chi Minh would win the nationwide election proposed at the Geneva Accords. In a secret memorandum, Director of CIA Allen Dulles acknowledged that \"The evidence [shows] that a majority of the people of Vietnam supported the Viet Minh rebels.\" Diem refused to hold the elections by citing that the South had not signed and were not bound to the Geneva Accords and that it was impossible to hold free elections in the communist North. Vietnam wide elections never happened and Vi\u1ec7t Minh cadres in South Vietnam secretly kept by the communists launched an insurgency against the government. North Vietnam also occupied portions of Laos to assist in supplying the insurgents known as the National Liberation Front (\"Viet Cong\") in South Vietnam. As part of the global Cold War, the war gradually escalated into the Second Indochina War, called the \"Resistance War against America\" by Vietnamese communists and commonly known as the \"Vietnam War\" internationally.\nInfluences on neighbouring countries.\nKhmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh.\nThe Khmer Vi\u1ec7t Minh were the 3,000 to 5,000 Cambodian communist cadres, left-wing members of the Khmer Issarak movement regrouped in the United Issarak Front after 1950, most of whom lived in exile in North Vietnam after the 1954 Geneva Conference. Khmer Issarak and United Issarak Front were under leadership of Son Ngoc Minh, Tou Samouth, Sieu Heng, etc. It was a derogatory term used by Norodom Sihanouk, dismissing the Cambodian leftists who had been organizing pro-independence agitations in alliance with the Vietnamese. Sihanouk's public criticism and mockery of the Khmer Issarak had the damaging effect of increasing the power of the hardline, anti-Vietnamese, but also anti-monarchist, members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), led by Pol Pot.\nThe Khmer Issarak and United Issarak Front were instrumental in the foundation of the Cambodian Salvation Front (FUNSK) in 1978. The FUNSK invaded Cambodia along with the Vietnamese Army and overthrew the Democratic Kampuchea Pol Pot state.

The club itself has stated that it should always be called \"Tottenham Hotspur\" or \"Spurs\", as Tottenham is the area of London and not the name of the club. It competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The team have played their home matches in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.\nFounded in 1882, Tottenham Hotspur's emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football, with the Latin motto \"Audere est Facere\" (\"to dare is to do\"). The team have traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898\u201399 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross, Enfield. After its inception, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960\u201361 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition \u2013 the European Cup Winners' Cup. They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s, an achievement matched only by Manchester United.\nIn domestic football, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, and seven FA Community Shields. In European football, they have won one European Cup Winners' Cup and three UEFA Cup/Europa League titles. Tottenham were also runners-up in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby, as well as a contested rivalry with Chelsea. Tottenham is owned by ENIC Group, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be worth \u00a32.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in 2024, and it was the ninth-highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u00a3615 million in 2024.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1882\u20131908).\nOriginally named Hotspur Football Club, the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by Bobby Buckle. They were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months. A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at All Hallows Church, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club. In April 1884 the club was renamed \"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\" to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London. Nicknames for the club include \"Spurs\" and \"the Lilywhites\".\nInitially, the north London side played games between themselves and friendly matches against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2\u20130. The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5\u20132 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company's works team called St Albans. The club's fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived Southern Alliance.\nThe club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the Southern League (the third tier at the time). On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company. Soon after, Frank Brettell became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed John Cameron, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the Southern League title in the 1899\u20131900 season. The following year Spurs won the 1901 FA Cup by beating Sheffield United 3\u20131 in a replay of the final, after the first game ended in a 2\u20132 draw. In doing so they became the only non-League club to achieve the feat since the formation of The Football League in 1888.\nEarly decades in the Football League (1908\u20131958).\nIn 1908, the club was elected into the Football League Second Division and won promotion to the First Division in their first season, finishing runners-up. In 1912, Peter McWilliam became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the 1914\u201315 season when football was suspended due to the First World War. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the 1919\u201320 season.\nOn 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 1\u20130 in the final. After coming second to Liverpool in the league in 1922, they would finish mid-table in the next five seasons, being relegated in the 1927\u201328 season after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 1940s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335 seasons.\nFormer Spurs player Arthur Rowe became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as \"push and run\", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the 1949\u201350 season. In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top-tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the 1950\u201351 season. Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club. Before he left, he signed one of Spurs' most celebrated players, Danny Blanchflower, who won the FWA Footballer of the Year twice while at Tottenham.\nBill Nicholson and the glory years (1958\u20131974).\nBill Nicholson took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the Double in 1961, the FA Cup in 1962 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963. Nicholson signed Dave Mackay and John White in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and Jimmy Greaves in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the top tier of English football.\nThe 1960\u201361 season started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football. The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2\u20131, with three more games still to play. The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2\u20130 against Leicester City in the final of the 1960\u201361 FA Cup. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since Aston Villa achieved the feat in 1897. The next year Spurs won their consecutive FA Cup after beating Burnley in the 1962 FA Cup final.\nOn 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the 1962\u201363 European Cup Winners' Cup when they beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 5\u20131 in the final. Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the 1971\u201372 UEFA Cup with a rebuilt team that included Martin Chivers, Pat Jennings, and Steve Perryman. They had also won the FA Cup in 1967, two League Cups (in 1971 and 1973), as well as a second place league finish (1962\u201363) and runners-up in the 1973\u201374 UEFA Cup. In total, Nicholson won eight major trophies in his 16 years at the club as manager.\nBurkinshaw to Venables (1974\u20131992).\nSpurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the 1974\u201375 season. The team was then relegated at the end of the 1976\u201377 season with Keith Burkinshaw as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included Glenn Hoddle as well as two Argentinians, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, which was unusual as players from outside the British Isles were rare at that time. The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in 1981 and 1982 and the UEFA Cup in 1984.\nThe 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. Irving Scholar took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises. Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur plc. Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker. Under Venables, Spurs won the 1990\u201391 FA Cup, making them the first club to win eight FA Cups.\nPremier League football (1992\u2013present).\nTottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the Premier League, created with the approval of The Football Association, replacing the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football. In February 2001, Sugar sold his shareholding in Spurs to ENIC Sports plc, run by Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy, and stepped down as chairman. Lewis and Levy would eventually own 85% of the club, with Levy responsible for the running of the club. Despite a succession of managers and players such as Teddy Sheringham, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and David Ginola, for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the League Cup in 1999 under George Graham, and again in 2008 under Juande Ramos. Performance improved under Harry Redknapp with players such as Gareth Bale and Luka Modri\u0107, and the club finished in the top five in the early 2010s.\nAfter Redknapp left, Mauricio Pochettino was appointed head coach, who was in the role between 2014 and 2019. Under Pochettino, with new stars such as academy graduate Harry Kane and Korean import Son Heung-min, Tottenham solidified their position as part of an emerging group of clubs known as the Big Six. Spurs finished second in the 2016\u201317 season, their highest league finish since the 1962\u201363 season, and advanced to the UEFA Champions League final in 2019, the club's first, where they ultimately lost to Liverpool 2\u20130. The club's home games during the last few seasons of Pochettino's tenure were played at Wembley Stadium while the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was constructed.\nPochettino was dismissed after a poor start to the 2019\u201320 season and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who was head coach from November 2019 to April 2021. His successor, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, lasted just four months. The next manager, Antonio Conte, guided Spurs to fourth during the 2021\u201322 season and back to a Champions League place. After exiting both the Champions League and FA Cup, he departed the club by mutual agreement in March 2023. In February 2023, Harry Kane displaced Jimmy Greaves as the club's all-time record goalscorer before leaving Spurs at the end of the season for Bayern Munich.\nAnge Postecoglou took over as head coach on 1 July 2023 and the club qualified for the 2024\u201325 UEFA Europa League after a fifth-place finish in the Premier League. The next season, the club ended their 17-year trophy drought by winning the 2025 Europa League final with a 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United. They did, however, finish only 17th in the Premier League, their worst league campaign in the Premier League era, which resulted in Postecoglou's sacking. Thomas Frank was brought in as a replacement.\nOn 4 September 2025, the club announced Daniel Levy had stepped down as executive chairman and was succeeded by Peter Charrington, who holds the role in a non-executive capacity. \nStadiums.\nEarly grounds.\nSpurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of Tottenham Marshes, where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch. Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground. The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9\u20130. It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2\u20131 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.\nAs they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park at a cost of \u00a317 per annum, where spectators were charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894\u201395 season at a cost of \u00a360. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired. In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs looked for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.\nWhite Hart Lane.\nThe White Hart Lane ground was built on an unused plant nursery owned by the Charrington Brewery and located behind a public house named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators. Notts County were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding \u00a3115 in receipts; Spurs won 4\u20131. Queens Park Rangers became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1\u20130 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the freehold to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.\nAfter Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by Archibald Leitch being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over \u00a33,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost \u00a360,000.\nStarting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. In the 1997\u201398 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen. Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.\nBy the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using the 2012 London Olympic Stadium in Stratford. Eventually the club settled on the Northumberland Development Project, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in 2016\u201317 at Wembley Stadium. Domestic fixtures of the 2016\u201317 season continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season, and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nIn October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane. This proposal would become the Northumberland Development Project. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by Haringey Council in September 2010, and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed on 20 September 2011.\nAfter a long delay over the compulsory purchase order of local businesses located on land to the north of the stadium and a legal challenge against the order, resolved in early 2015, planning application for another new design was approved by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015. Construction started in 2016, and the new stadium was scheduled to open during the 2018\u201319 season. While it was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the 2017\u201318 season as well as all but five in 2018\u201319 were played at Wembley Stadium. After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019 with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace which Spurs won 2\u20130. The new stadium is called Tottenham Hotspur Stadium while a naming-rights agreement is reached.\nTraining grounds.\nAn early training ground used by Tottenham was located at Brookfield Lane in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The club bought the 11-acre ground used by Cheshunt F.C. in 1952 for \u00a335,000. It had three pitches, including a small stadium with a small stand used for matches by the junior team. The ground was later sold for over \u00a34\u00a0million, and the club moved the training ground to the Spurs Lodge on Luxborough Lane, Chigwell in Essex, opened in September 1996 by soon-to-be Prime Minister Tony Blair. The training ground and press centre in Chigwell were used until 2014.\nIn 2007, Tottenham bought a site at Bulls Cross in Enfield, a few miles south of their former ground in Cheshunt. A new training ground was constructed at the site for \u00a345\u00a0million, which opened in 2012. The 77-acre site has 15 grass pitches and one-and-a-half artificial pitches, as well as a covered artificial pitch in the main building. The main building on Hotspur Way also has hydrotherapy and swimming pools, gyms, medical facilities, dining and rest areas for players as well as classrooms for academy and schoolboy players. A 45-bedroom players lodge with catering, treatment, rest and rehabilitation facilities was later added at Myddleton Farm next to the training site in 2018. The lodge is mainly used by Tottenham's first team and Academy players, but it has also been used by national football teams \u2013 the first visitors to use the facilities at the site were the Brazilian team in preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nCrest.\nSince the 1921 FA Cup Final, the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur, after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and spurs are also associated with fighting cocks. The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock. A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of \u00a335 (), and this figure was then placed on top of the West Stand at the end of the 1909\u201310 season. Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity. The club badge on the shirt used in 1921 featured a cockerel within a shield, but it was changed to a cockerel sitting on a ball in the late 1960s.\nBetween 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux heraldic shield featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The castle is Bruce Castle, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the Seven Sisters. The arms featured the Latin motto \"Audere Est Facere\" (to dare is to do).\nIn 1983, to overcome unauthorised \"pirate\" merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions to flank the shield (which came from the arms of the Northumberland family, of which Harry Hotspur was a member), as well as the motto scroll. This device appeared on Spurs' playing kits for three seasons 1996\u201399.\nIn 2006, in order to rebrand and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem. This revamp displayed a sleeker and more elegant cockerel standing on an old-time football. The club claimed that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only on playing kits. In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club Fleet Spurs to change their badge because its new design was \"too similar\" to the Tottenham crest.\nIn 2017, Spurs added a shield around the cockerel logo on the shirts similar to the 1950s badge, but with the cockerel of modern design. The shield was however removed the following season.\nKit.\nThe first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches. In 1884 or 1885, the club changed to a \"quartered\" kit similar to Blackburn Rovers after watching them win in the 1884 FA Cup Final. After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the 1889\u201390 season. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'. Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.\nIn the 1898\u201399 season, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for Preston North End. White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname \"The Lilywhites\". In 1921, the year they won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt for the final. A club crest has featured on the shirt since, and Spurs became the first major club to have its club crest on the players shirt on every match apart from the war years. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.\nIn the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on Seven Sisters Road, HR Brookes. In the 1920s, Bukta produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, Umbro was the supplier for forty years. In 1959, the V-neck shirt replaced the collared shirts of the past, and then in 1963, the crew neck shirt appeared (the style has fluctuated since). In 1961, Bill Nicholson sent Spurs players out to play in white instead of navy shorts for their European campaign, starting a tradition which continues to this day in European competitions.\nIn 1977, a deal was signed with Admiral to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold to football fans since 1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off. Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer's logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges. Admiral was replaced by Le Coq Sportif in the summer of 1980. In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with Hummel, who then supplied the strips. However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro. In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee. Umbro was followed by Pony in 1995, Adidas in 1999, Kappa in 2002, and a five-year deal with Puma in 2006. In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012\u201313, with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012. The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the biometric data to the coaching staff. In June 2017, it was announced that Nike would be their new kits supplier, with the 2017\u201318 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960\u201361 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup. In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth \u00a330\u00a0million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.\nShirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club Kettering Town F.C. in 1976 despite it being banned by the FA. The ban was soon lifted and the practice spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and then on televised games from 1983. In December 1983, after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt. When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal. In 2006, Tottenham secured a \u00a334\u00a0million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com. In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy said to be worth \u00a320\u00a0million. A month later they unveiled a \u00a35\u00a0million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years. Since 2014, AIA has been the main shirt sponsor, initially in a deal worth over \u00a316\u00a0million annually, increased to a reported \u00a340 to \u00a345\u00a0million per year in 2019 in an eight-year deal that lasts until 2027. In 2023, Tottenham provisionally agreed a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with South Africa Tourism (SAT) starting in 2023/24 and ending in the 2026/27 season.\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFinances and ownership.\nTottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at \u00a31 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. 4,892 shares were sold in total by 1905. A few families held significant shares; they included the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s, as well as the Richardson and the Bearman families. From 1943 to 1984, members of these families were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. after Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died.\nIn the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to accumulating debts. In November 1982, a fan of the club Irving Scholar bought 25% of Tottenham for \u00a3600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. In order to bring in funds, Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market, and became the first sports company to go public. Fans and institutions alike can now freely buy and trade shares in the company; a court ruling in 1935 involving the club (\"Berry and Stewart v Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd\") had previously established a precedent in company law that the directors of a company can refuse the transfer of shares from a shareholder to another person. The share issue was successful with 3.8\u00a0million shares quickly sold. However, ill-judged business decisions under Scholar led to financial difficulties, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing \u00a33.25\u00a0million. Sugar increased his stake to \u00a38\u00a0million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute. By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.\nThe majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner at ENIC, was Executive Chairman of the club. They first acquired 29.9% share of the club in 1991, of which 27% was bought from Sugar for \u00a322\u00a0million. Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for \u00a325 million, and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc. in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30\u00a0million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8\u00a0million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC. The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital. The remaining shares are held by over 30,000 individuals. Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that the club had delisted its shares from the stock market, taking it into private ownership.\nLewis' shares are owned by the Lewis Family Trusts. In October 2022, Lewis ceased to be a person with significant control of the club, following a reorganisation of the Trusts. The club continues to be owned by ENIC, which is controlled by the Lewis trusts and Levy, and, in the summer of 2022, ENIC intended to inject up to \u00a3150 million into the club by the issuing of new shares. Only \u00a3100 million of shares were subscribed for and this took ENIC's shareholding up to 86.58%.\nIn September 2025, Tottenham Hotspur reaffirmed its ownership status, stating that the club is not for sale. ENIC Sports &amp; Developments Holdings Ltd, Tottenham\u2019s majority owner, \u201cunequivocally rejected\u201d two preliminary takeover approaches from \"PCP International Finance Limited\" (led by Amanda Staveley) and a consortium fronted by Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng via \"Firehawk Holdings\". The offer period ends on 5 October 2025 under the UK's Takeover Code, allowing either bidder to submit a formal offer or withdraw.\nOn 9 October 2025, ENIC injected a further \u00a3100 million into the club to provide additional resources and further strengthen the financial position. The investment was by way of fresh capital and did not affect the shareholding. A source was reported as describing this as \"initial additional funding\" and said that \"more money will be available\".\nSupport.\nTottenham has a large fan base in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from North London and the Home counties. The attendance figures for its home matches, however, have fluctuated over the years. Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England. Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008\u201309 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons between 1992\u201393 and 2010\u201311. In the 2017\u201318 season when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second-highest attendance in the Premier League. It also holds the record for attendance in the Premier League, with 83,222 attending the North London derby on 10 February 2018. Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher A. J. Ayer. There are many official supporters' clubs located around the world, while an independent supporters club, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, is recognised by the club as the representative body for Spurs supporters.\nHistorically, the club had a significant Jewish following from the Jewish communities in east and north London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s. Due to this early support, all three chairmen of the club since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club. The club no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), though it is nevertheless still identified as a Jewish club by rival fans. Antisemitic chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the 1960s, with words such as \"Yids\" or \"Yiddos\" used against Tottenham supporters. In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the \"Yids\" or \"Yid Army\" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s. Some fans view adopting \"Yid\" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult. The use of \"Yid\" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans \"legitimis[es] references to Jews in football\", and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football. Both the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews have denounced the use of the word by fans. Others, such as former Prime Minister David Cameron, argued that its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively, and therefore cannot be considered hate speech. Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the Crown Prosecution Service considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally \"threatening, abusive or insulting\".\nFan culture.\nThere are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as \"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the Double in 1960\u201361, and entered the European Cup for the first time. Their first opponents were G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4\u20132 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to write that \"they were no angels\". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing biblical-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of \"Glory Glory Hallelujah\", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds. The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8\u20131. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A new sound was heard in English football in the 1961\u201362 season. It was the hymn Glory, Glory Hallelujah being sung by 60,000 fans at White Hart Lane in our European Cup matches. I don't know how it started or who started it, but it took over the ground like a religious feeling.\u2014\u200a\nThere had been a number of incidents of hooliganism involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in Rotterdam at the 1974 UEFA Cup final against Feyenoord, and again during the 1983\u201384 UEFA Cup matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and Anderlecht in Brussels. Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported.\nRivalries.\nTottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with north London rivals Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the Manor Ground, Plumstead to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.\nTottenham also share rivalries with fellow London clubs Chelsea and West Ham United. The rivalry with Chelsea is secondary in importance to the North London derby and began when Spurs beat Chelsea in the 1967 FA Cup final, the first ever all-London final. West Ham fans view Tottenham as a bitter rival, although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by Tottenham fans.\nSocial responsibility.\nThe club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with Haringey Council and the Metropolitan Housing Trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation. The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the prime minister when it was launched at 10 Downing Street in February 2007.\nIn March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity SOS Children's Villages UK, whereby player fines would go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 2006\u201307, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms and as a percentage of turnover by giving \u00a34,545,889, including a one-off contribution of \u00a34.5\u00a0million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. In recent years, the foundation has, in conjunction with its partners, run business creation \"bootcamps\" and provided funding to young entrepreneurs to help with the launch of their start-ups.\nIn contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing, but this requirement was later waived, and a payment of \u00a316 million for community infrastructure was reduced to \u00a3500,000. This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area. The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated \u00a3293\u00a0million into the local economy annually, and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area. In other developments in Tottenham, the club has built 256 affordable homes and a 400-pupil primary school.\nLondon Academy of Excellence.\nAs part of the development of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the club built an elite educational facility to sit alongside its club offices. The London Academy of Excellence Tottenham (LAET) is a state-funded Sixth Form, sponsored by the Club and Highgate School \u2013 the principle academic sponsors who deliver expert teaching. LAET was named the Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year, 2020 by Parent Power, The Sunday Times School Guide. In 2022, LAET achieved an \"Outstanding\" Ofsted rating across all areas.\nEnvironmental sustainability.\nSpurs are one of the high-profile participants in the project, which they joined in 2009. In a year, the carbon emissions were reduced by 14%, an estimated 400 tonnes of carbon. The club further said it is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its activities across all operations, setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.\nIn September 2021, the club partnered with Sky Sports to host the world's first net-zero carbon top-level football game. The initiative won in the Sustainability category at the 2022 Football Business Awards. In 2023, the club was ranked No. 1 in the Premier League's \"Sustainability Rankings\" for the fourth year in a row.\nHonours.\n\"Sources: Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 History\"\nStatistics and records.\nSteve Perryman holds the appearance record for Spurs, having played 854 games for the club between 1969 and 1986, of which 655 were league matches.

The club's record cup victory came on 3 February 1960 with a 13\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup. Spurs' biggest top-flight victory came against Wigan Athletic on 22 November 2009, when they won 9\u20131 with Jermain Defoe scoring five goals. The club's record defeat is an 8\u20130 loss to 1. FC K\u00f6ln in the Intertoto Cup on 22 July 1995.\nThe record home attendance at White Hart Lane is 75,038 for a cup tie on 5 March 1938 against Sunderland. The highest attendance at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is 62,027 for a Premier League match against Arsenal on 12 May 2022. The highest recorded home attendances were at their temporary home, Wembley Stadium, due to its higher capacity \u2013 85,512 spectators were present on 2 November 2016 for the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen, while 83,222 attended the North London derby against Arsenal on 10 February 2018, the highest attendance recorded for any Premier League game.\nIn the UEFA rankings, the club slipped from 21st in 2023 with a UEFA club coefficient of 80.00 to 34th in the 2023\u201324 season with a club coefficient of 54.00 thanks to its absence from UEFA football that season.

It borders the Basque provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa to the north, the community of La Rioja to the south, the province of Burgos (in the community of Castile and Le\u00f3n) to the west and the community of Navarre to the east. The Enclave of Trevi\u00f1o, surrounded by Alavese territory, is however part of the province of Burgos, thus belonging to the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n, not \u00c1lava.\nIt is the largest of the three provinces in the Basque Autonomous Community in geographical terms, with 3,037 km2, but also the least populated with 331,700 inhabitants (2019).\nEtymology.\nBuilt around the Roman mansion Alba located on the road ab Asturica Burdigalam (possibly the current village of Alb\u00e9niz near Agurain), it has sometimes been argued the name may stem from that landmark. However, according to the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, the origin may be another: The name is first found on Muslim chronicles of the eighth century referring to the Alavese Plains (Spanish \"Llanada Alavesa\", Basque \"Arabako Lautada\"), \"laua\" in old Basque (currently \"lautada\") with the Arab article added (al + laua), developing into Spanish \u00c1lava and Basque Araba (a typical development of l to r between vowels).\nPhysical and human geography.\n\u00c1lava is an inland territory and features a largely transitional climate between the humid, Atlantic neighbouring northern provinces and the dry and warmer lands south of the Ebro River. According to the relief and landscape characteristics, the territory is divided into five main zones: \nUnlike Biscay and Gipuzkoa, but for Ayala and Aramaio, the waters of \u00c1lava pour into the Ebro and hence to the Mediterranean by means of two main waterways, i.e. the Zadorra (main axis of \u00c1lava) and Bayas Rivers. In addition, the Zadorra Reservoir System harvests a big quantity of waters that supply not only the capital city but other major Basque towns and cities too, like Bilbao.\nWhile in 1950 agriculture and farming shaped the landscape of the territory (42.4% of the working force vs 30.5% in industry and construction), the trend shifted gradually during the 60s and 70s on the grounds of a growing industrial activity in the Alavese Plains (\"Llanada Alavesa\"), with the main focus lying on the industrial estates of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Gamarra, Beto\u00f1o and Ali Gobeo) and, to a lesser extent, Salvatierra-Agurain and Araia. At the turn of the century, only 2% of the working Alavese people was in agriculture, while 60% was in the tertiary sector and 32% in manufacturing. Industry associated with iron and metal developed earlier in the Atlantic area much in tune with Bilbao's economic dynamics, with droves of people flocking to and clustering in Amurrio and Laudio, which have since become the third and second main towns of \u00c1lava.\nDemography and rural landscape.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nLordship of \u00c1lava.\nList of rulers (modern Spanish names) :\nThe title is attributed to the Castilian kings after 1332.\nBishopric.\nThe Arab invasion of the Ebro valley in the eighth century, many Christians of the Diocese of Calahorra sought refuge in areas further north free of Arab rule. The diocese called \u00c1lava or Armentaria was established in 870 on territory split off from the Diocese of Calahorra. From then until the 11th century the names of several bishops of this see are recorded, the best known being the last, Fort\u00fan, who in 1072 went to Rome to argue before Pope Alexander II in defence of the Mozarabic Rite, which King Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile had decreed should be replaced by the Roman Rite.\nThe see was suppressed in 1088, when it was merged into the Diocese of Naj\u00e9ra, another suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tarragona. \nThe territory of the diocese of \u00c1lava, which corresponded more or less to that of the present Diocese of Vitoria, was reabsorbed into that of Calahorra when Naj\u00e9ra was suppressed in 1170, when King Alfonso VIII of Castile conquered La Rioja.\nTitular see.\nNo longer a residential bishopric, \u00c1lava is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see since the diocese was nominally restored in 1969 as Titular bishopric of \u00c1lava.\nIt has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank:\nSpanish Civil War.\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War \u00c1lava and Vitoria were easily captured by the rebel Nationalists led by General Angel Garc\u00eda Ben\u00edtez, assisted by Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega. Vitoria was captured on 19 July 1936. In November 1936 an attempt by Republicans to retake Vitoria was thwarted after being spotted by Nationalist reconnaissance aircraft. The 1937 Nationalist campaign in Vizcaya was supported by 80 German aircraft based at Vitoria, where the Condor Legion fighter wing was concentrated.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68201", "revid": "9155723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68201", "title": "Richard II (play)", "text": "History play by William Shakespeare\nThe Life and Death of King Richard the Second (1595), also Richard II, is a Shakespearean history play about the lifetime and reign of King Richard II of England (r. 1377\u20131399). As a dramatised period history of the English monarchy, \"Richard II\" chronicles the machinations of the noblemen of the royal court who conspire, precipitate, and realise the downfall and death of the King of England.\nAs the first work in the Henriad tetralogy of English history plays, the political narrative of \"Richard II\" is thematically followed throughout the stories of \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", and \"Henry V\", which also are histories of the reigns of his royal successors to the Throne of England. Although the First Folio (1623) classifies \"The Life and Death of Richard the Second\" as an English history play, the earlier Quarto edition (1597) classifies \"Richard II\" as a tragedy, under the title \"The Tragedie of King Richard the Second\".\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSynopsis.\nThe play spans only the last two years of Richard's life, from 1398 to 1400. It begins with King Richard sitting majestically on his throne in full state, having been requested to arbitrate a dispute between the nobles Thomas Mowbray and Richard's cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, who has accused Mowbray of high treason for stealing money that had been raised for the English army and of murdering Bolingbroke's uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, meanwhile, believes Richard himself was responsible for his brother's murder. After several attempts to calm both men, Richard acquiesces and it is determined that the matter be resolved in the established method of trial by battle between Bolingbroke and Mowbray, despite Gaunt's objections.\nThe tournament scene is very formal, with a long, ceremonial introduction, but as the combatants are about to fight, Richard interrupts and sentences both men to banishment from England. Bolingbroke is originally sentenced to ten years' banishment, but Richard reduces this to six years upon seeing John of Gaunt's grieving face. Mowbray is banished permanently. The king's decision can be seen as the first mistake in a series leading eventually to his overthrow and death, since the error highlights many of his character flaws, including indecisiveness (in terms of whether to allow the duel to go ahead), abruptness (Richard waits until the last possible moment to cancel the duel), and arbitrariness (there is no apparent reason Bolingbroke should be allowed to return and Mowbray not). In addition, the decision fails to dispel the suspicions surrounding Richard's involvement in the death of the Duke of Gloucester\u2014in fact, by handling the situation in such a cavalier and arbitrary manner, Richard only appears more guilty. Mowbray correctly predicts that the king will sooner or later fall at the hands of Bolingbroke.\nAfter an impassioned invective against the visiting king from his sick-bed, John of Gaunt dies and Richard seizes all his land and money. This angers the nobility, who accuse Richard of wasting England's money, of illegally depriving John's heir Bolingbroke of his rightful inheritance to fund war in Ireland, of imposing unjust taxes on the commoners, and of enriching himself by fining the nobles for crimes their ancestors committed. The conspirators help Bolingbroke return secretly to England, with a plan to overthrow Richard. There remain, however, subjects loyal to the king. Among them are the courtiers Bushy, Bagot, and Green, as well as the Duke of Aumerle (son of the Duke of York), cousin of both Richard and Bolingbroke. When Richard leaves England to attend to the war in Ireland, Bolingbroke seizes the opportunity to assemble an army and invades the north coast of England. Executing both Bushy and Green, Bolingbroke wins over the Duke of York, whom Richard has left in charge of his government in his absence.\nUpon Richard's return, Bolingbroke reclaims his lands and lays claim to the English throne; Richard's Welsh allies desert him and he is taken captive. After a dramatic public ceremony where Bolingbroke has the captive king publicly renounce his crown, he crowns himself King Henry IV, and has Richard imprisoned in the castle of Pomfret. Aumerle orchestrates an uprising against the new king, only to be thwarted by his father, York. The King executes every conspirator except Aumerle, who is spared after the Duchess of York intervenes on his behalf. After misinterpreting King Henry's \"living fear\" as a reference to the still-living Richard, the ambitious Sir Piers Exton murders him in his cell to gain favour. King Henry is appalled by the murder, dismisses Exton from his court, and vows a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to cleanse himself of his part in Richard's death. In his final lines, Henry completes the tragic structure of the play by mourning over Richard's coffin and affording the deposed king forgiveness.\nSources.\nThe \"Chroniques\" of Jean Froissart, a fourteenth-century account of the Hundred Years' War translated into English by John Bouchier in c.\u20091524, includes a sympathetic account of the deposition of King Richard. It is likely that this was one of Shakespeare's sources for the play.\nShakespeare's primary source for \"Richard II\", as for most of his chronicle histories, was Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande\"; the publication of the second edition in 1587 provides a \"terminus post quem\" for the play. Edward Hall's \"The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York\" appears also to have been consulted, and scholars have also supposed Shakespeare familiar with Samuel Daniel's poem on the civil wars.\nA somewhat more complicated case is presented by the anonymous play sometimes known as \"The First Part of Richard II\". This play, which exists in one incomplete manuscript copy (at the British Museum), is subtitled \"Thomas of Woodstock\", and scholars since F. S. Boas have usually called it by that name. This play treats the events leading up to the start of Shakespeare's play (though the two texts do not have identical characters). This closeness, along with the manuscript's anonymity, have led certain scholars to attribute all or part of the play to Shakespeare, though many critics view it as a secondary influence on Shakespeare, not as his work.\nShakespeare may have drawn from his contemporary Christopher Marlowe's historical play \"Edward II\" for \"Richard II\". The two plays have similar structures, and critics have drawn parallels between particular passages and themes, such as the contradiction between the king's theoretical absolute power and the actual restraints placed on him by his subjects. Charles Lamb opined that \"The reluctant pangs of abdicating Royalty in \"Edward\" furnished hints which Shakespeare scarce improved in his \"Richard the Second\"\".\nDate and text.\nThe earliest recorded performance of \"Richard II\" was a private one, in Canon Row, the house of Edward Hoby, on 9 December 1595. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 29 August 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise; he published the first quarto later that year, printed by Valentine Simmes. The second and third quartos followed in 1598\u2014the only time a Shakespeare play was printed in three editions in two years. Q4 followed in 1608 and Q5 in 1615. The play was next published in the First Folio in 1623.\n\"Richard II\" exists in a number of variations. The quartos vary to some degree, and the folio presents further differences. The first three quartos (printed in 1597 and 1598, commonly assumed to have been prepared from Shakespeare's holograph) lack the deposition scene. The fourth, published in 1608, includes a version of the scene shorter than the one later printed, presumably from a prompt-book, in the First Folio. The scant evidence makes explaining these differences largely conjectural. Traditionally, it has been supposed that the quartos lack the deposition scene because of censorship, by either the playhouse or the Master of the Revels Edmund Tylney, and that the Folio version may better reflect Shakespeare's original intentions. But there is no external evidence for this hypothesis, and the title page of the 1608 quarto refers to a \"lately acted\" deposition scene (although, again, this could be due to earlier censorship that was later relaxed).\nAnalysis and criticism.\nStructure and language.\nThe play is divided into five acts and its structure is as formal as its language. It has a double complementary plot describing Richard II's fall and the rise of Bolingbroke, later known as Henry IV. Critic John R. Elliott Jr. notes that this play can be distinguished from the other history plays because it has an ulterior political purpose. Shakespearean tragedy's normal structure is modified to portray a central political theme: the rise of Bolingbroke to the throne and the conflict between Richard and Bolingbroke over the kingship. In Acts IV and V, Shakespeare includes incidents irrelevant to Richard's fate that are resolved in the future plays of the \"Richard II\"\u2013\"Henry V\" tetralogy.\nThe literary critic Hugh M. Richmond notes that Richard's beliefs about the divine right of kings tend to fall more in line with the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke, on the other hand, represents a more modern view of statecraft, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political skill qualify a king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God: not subject to human frailty, he is entitled to absolute authority over his subjects. Elliott argues that this conceited notion of his role ultimately leads to Richard's failure, adding that Bolingbroke's ability to relate and speak with the middle and lower classes allows him to take the throne.\nAlthough it is largely historically accurate, \"Richard II\" is a tragedy. \"Richard II\" follows the arc of most of Shakespeare's tragedies: a series of catastrophes lead to a death, which resolves in forgiveness. A long line of mistakes, mostly on the part of Richard himself, lead to his incarceration and murder. But when his body is presented to Henry IV, the now-king declares, \"although I did wish him dead, I hate the murderer, love the murder\u00e8d.\" This line affords Richard absolution and cements this play's place among Shakespeare's tragedies.\nUnusually for Shakespeare, \"Richard II\" is written entirely in verse, one of only four of his plays, the others being \"King John\" and the first and third parts of \"Henry VI\". There are also great differences in the characters' use of language. Traditionally, Shakespeare distinguishes social classes by having the upper classes speak in poetry while the lower classes speak in prose. In \"Richard II\", there is no prose, but Richard uses flowery, metaphorical language in his speeches, whereas Bolingbroke, also of the noble class, uses a more plain and direct language. Besides the usual blank verse (unrhymed pentameters), there are long stretches of heroic couplets (pairs of rhymed pentameters). The play contains a number of memorable metaphors, including the extended comparison of England with a garden in Act III, Scene iv and of its reigning king to a lion or to the sun in Act IV.\nThe language of \"Richard II\" is more eloquent than that of the earlier history plays, and serves to set the tone and themes of the play. Shakespeare uses lengthy verses, metaphors, similes and soliloquies to delineate Richard's character as analytical rather than active. He always speaks in tropes, using analogies such as the sun as a symbol of his kingly status. Richard is obsessed with symbols: his crown, the symbol of his royal power, is of more concern to him than his actual kingly duties.\nHistorical context.\nThe play was performed and published late in the reign of Elizabeth I, at a time when the queen's advanced age made succession an important political concern. The historical parallels in the succession of \"Richard II\" may not have been intended as political comment on the contemporary situation, with the weak Richard II analogous to Queen Elizabeth and an implicit argument in favour of her replacement by a monarch capable of creating a stable dynasty, but lawyers investigating John Hayward's historical work \"The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IV\", a book previously believed to have taken from Shakespeare's \"Richard II\", made this connection. Samuel Schoenbaum contests that Hayward had written his work before \"Richard II\", joking that \"there is nothing like a hypothetical manuscript to resolve an awkwardness of chronology\", as Hayward noted he had written the work several years before its publication. Hayward dedicated his version to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and when Essex was arrested for rebellion in February 1601 Hayward had already been imprisoned, to strengthen the case against the earl for \"incitement to the deposing of the Queen\". That Hayward had made his dedication was fortunate for Shakespeare; otherwise he too might have lost his liberty over the affair.\nShakespeare's play appears to have played a minor role in the events surrounding the final downfall of Essex. On 7 February 1601, just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the Earl of Northumberland), paid for a performance at the Globe Theatre on the eve of their armed rebellion. By this agreement, reported at the trial of Essex by the Chamberlain's Men actor Augustine Phillips, the conspirators paid the company forty shillings \"above the ordinary\" (i.e., above their usual rate) to stage this play, which the players felt was too old and \"out of use\" to attract a large audience. Eleven of Essex's supporters attended the Saturday performance.\nElizabeth was aware of the political ramifications of the story of Richard II: according to a well-known but dubious anecdote, in August 1601 she was reviewing historical documents relating to the reign of Richard II when she supposedly remarked to her archivist William Lambarde, \"I am Richard II, know ye not that?\" In the same historical report the Queen is said to have complained that the play was performed forty times in \"open streets and houses\" but there is no extant evidence to corroborate this tale. At any rate, the Lord Chamberlain's Men do not appear to have suffered for their association with the Essex group; but they were commanded to perform it for the Queen on Shrove Tuesday in 1601, the day before Essex's execution.\nThemes and motifs.\n\"The King's Two Bodies\".\nIn his analysis of medieval political theology, \"The King\u2019s Two Bodies\", Ernst Kantorowicz describes medieval kings as containing two bodies: a body natural, and a body politic. The theme of the king's two bodies is pertinent throughout \"Richard II\", from the exile of Bolingbroke to the deposition of King Richard II. The body natural is a mortal body, subject to all the weaknesses of mortal human beings. On the other hand, the body politic is a spiritual body which cannot be affected by mortal infirmities such as disease and old age. These two bodies form one indivisible unit, with the body politic superior to the body natural.\nMany critics agree that in \"Richard II\", this central theme of the king's two bodies unfolds in three main scenes: the scenes at the Coast of Wales, at Flint Castle, and at Westminster. At the coast of Wales, Richard has just returned from a trip to Ireland and kisses the soil of England, demonstrating his kingly attachment to his kingdom. This image of kingship gradually fades as Bolingbroke's rebellion continues. Richard starts to forget his kingly nature as his mind becomes occupied by the rebellion. This change is portrayed in the scene at Flint Castle during which the unity of the two bodies disintegrates and the king starts to use more poetic and symbolic language. Richard's body politic has been shaken as his followers have joined Bolingbroke's army, diminishing Richard's military capacity. He has been forced to give up his jewels, losing his kingly appearance. He loses his temper at Bolingbroke, but then regains his composure as he starts to remember his divine side. At Flint Castle, Richard is determined to hang onto his kingship even though the title no longer fits his appearance. However, at Westminster the image of the divine kingship is supported by the Bishop of Carlisle rather than Richard, who at this point is becoming mentally unstable as his authority slips away. Biblical references are used to liken the humbled king to the humbled Christ. The names of Judas and Pilate are used to further extend this comparison. Before Richard is sent to his death, he \"un-kings\" himself by giving away his crown, sceptre, and the balm that is used to anoint a king to the throne. The mirror scene is the final end to the dual personality. After examining his plain physical appearance, Richard shatters the mirror on the ground and thus relinquishes his past and present as king. Stripped of his former glory, Richard finally releases his body politic and retires to his body natural and his own inner thoughts and griefs. Critic J. Dover Wilson notes that Richard's double nature as man and martyr is the dilemma that runs through the play eventually leading to Richard's death. Richard acts the part of a royal martyr, and due to the spilling of his blood, England continually undergoes civil war for the next two generations.\nThe rise of a Machiavellian king.\nThe play ends with the rise of Bolingbroke to the throne, marking the start of a new era in England. According to historical research, an English translation of Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" might have existed as early as 1585, influencing the reigns of the kings of England. Critic Irving Ribner notes that a manifestation of Machiavellian philosophy may be seen in Bolingbroke. Machiavelli wrote \"The Prince\" during a time of political chaos in Italy, and writes down a formula by which a leader can lead the country out of turmoil and return it to prosperity. Bolingbroke seems to be a leader coming into power at a time England is in turmoil, and follows closely the formula stated by Machiavelli. At the start of \"Richard II\", Bolingbroke accuses Mowbray and ulteriorly attacks the government of King Richard. He keeps Northumberland by his side as a tool to control certain constituents. From the minute Bolingbroke comes into power, he destroys the faithful supporters of Richard such as Bushy, Green and the Earl of Wiltshire. Also, Bolingbroke is highly concerned with the maintenance of legality to the kingdom, an important principle of Machiavellian philosophy, and therefore makes Richard surrender his crown and physical accessories to erase any doubt as to the real heir to the throne. Yet, Irving Ribner still notes a few incidents where Bolingbroke does not follow true Machiavellian philosophy, such as his failure to destroy Aumerle, but such incidents are minuscule compared with the bigger events of the play. Even Bolingbroke's last statement follows Machiavellian philosophy as he alludes to making a voyage to the Holy Land, since Machiavellian philosophy states rulers must appear pious. Therefore, this particular play can be viewed as a turning point in the history of England as the throne is taken over by a more commanding king in comparison to King Richard II.\nPerformance history.\nOn 9 December 1595, Sir Robert Cecil enjoyed \"K. Richard\" at Sir Edward Hoby's house in Canon Row, and it might have been Shakespeare's \"Richard II\", although some suspected that it was a different play, a painting, or a historical document.\nAnother commissioned performance of a different type occurred at the Globe Theatre on 7 February 1601. This was the performance paid for by supporters of the Earl of Essex's planned revolt (see above).\nIt is said that on 30 September 1607, the crew of Capt. William Keeling performed \"Richard II\" aboard the British East India Company ship \"The Red Dragon\", off Sierra Leone, but the authenticity of this record is doubted.\nThe play was performed at the Globe on 12 June 1631.\nThe play retained its political charge in the Restoration: a 1680 adaptation at Drury Lane by Nahum Tate was suppressed for its perceived political implications. Tate attempted to mask his version, called \"The Sicilian Usurper\", with a foreign setting; he attempted to blunt his criticism of the Stuart court by highlighting Richard's noble qualities and downplaying his weaknesses. Neither expedient prevented the play from being \"silenc'd on the third day\", as Tate wrote in his preface. Lewis Theobald staged a successful and less troubled adaptation in 1719 at Lincoln's Inn Fields; Shakespeare's original version was revived at Covent Garden in 1738.\nThe play had limited popularity in the early twentieth century, but John Gielgud exploded onto the world's theatrical consciousness through his performance as Richard at the Old Vic Theatre in 1929, returning to the character in 1937 and 1953 in what ultimately was considered as the definitive performance of the role. Another legendary Richard was Maurice Evans, who first played the role at the Old Vic in 1934 and then created a sensation in his 1937 Broadway performance, revived it in New York in 1940 and then immortalised it on television for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1954. In England, Paul Scofield, who played the role at the Old Vic in 1952, was considered the definitive Richard of more modern times. In the 1968\u20131970 seasons of the Prospect Theatre Company, Ian McKellen made a breakthrough performance as Richard, opposite Timothy West as Bolingbroke. The production, directed by Richard Cottrell, toured Britain and Europe, featuring in the Edinburgh Festival in 1969 and on BBC TV in 1970. In 1973 Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco alternated the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke in a production from John Barton at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre; nearly fifty years later this was still a standard by which performances were being judged. One of the most accessible versions was the 1978 television production by the BBC of the play, shown as part of \"The Shakespeare Plays\" (a several years-long project to put all of Shakespeare's plays on videotape). This version, still available on DVD, starred Derek Jacobi as Richard, with John Gielgud making an appearance as John of Gaunt. In 1997, Fiona Shaw played the role as a man. More recently, the play was staged by Trevor Nunn in modern costume at the Old Vic in 2005, with Kevin Spacey in the title role, and by Michael Grandage at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011\u201312 with Eddie Redmayne in the title role.\nThe role was played by Mark Rylance in an all-male production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2003. The play returned to the Globe in 2015 with Charles Edwards in the title role.\nIn summer 2012, BBC Two broadcast a filmed adaptation together with other plays in the Henriad under the series title \"The Hollow Crown\" with Ben Whishaw as Richard II.\nNo film version for cinema release has ever been made; however, the 1949 film \"Train of Events\" includes a sub-plot featuring an amateur dramatics society performing the last scenes of \"Richard II\".\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company produced the play with David Tennant in the lead role in 2013. It has been released as a Cineplex Odeon special worldwide movie event. Tennant reprised the role for his U.S. stage debut, at BAM, in April 2016.\nThe Almeida Theatre, Islington, London, produced the play with Simon Russell Beale in the lead role in 2019.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Divided into eight \"comarcas\" (counties), the autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by Cantabria to the east, by Le\u00f3n (Castile and Le\u00f3n) to the south, by Lugo (Galicia) to the west, and by the Cantabrian Sea to the north.\nAsturias is situated in a mountainous setting with vast greenery and lush vegetation, making it part of Green Spain. The region has a maritime climate. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderate seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20s Celsius. Heat waves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level.\nThe most important cities are the communal capital, Oviedo, the seaport and largest city Gij\u00f3n, and the industrial town of Avil\u00e9s. Other municipalities in Asturias include Cangas de On\u00eds, Cangas del Narcea, Goz\u00f3n, Grado, Langreo, Llanera, Laviana, Lena, Llanes, Mieres, Siero, Vald\u00e9s, Vegadeo and Villaviciosa (\"see also List of municipalities and comarcas in Asturias\").\nHistory.\nAsturias was inhabited first by \"Homo erectus\", then by Neanderthals. Since the Lower Paleolithic era, and during the Upper Paleolithic, Asturias was characterized by cave paintings in the eastern part of the area. In the Mesolithic period, a native culture developed, that of the \"Asturiense\", and later, with the introduction of the Bronze Age, megaliths and tumuli were constructed. In the Iron Age, the territory came under the cultural influence of the Celts; the local Celtic peoples, known as the Astures, were composed of tribes such as the \"Luggones\", the \"Pesicos\", and others, who populated the entire area with \"castros\" (fortified hill towns). Today the Astur Celtic influence persists in place names, such as those of rivers and mountains.\nWith the conquest of Asturias by the Romans under Augustus (29\u201319 BC), the region entered into recorded history. The Astures were subdued by the Romans, but were never fully conquered. After several centuries without foreign presence, they enjoyed a brief revival during the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, resisting Suebi and Visigoth raids throughout the 5th century AD, ending with the Moorish invasion of Spain. However, as it had been for the Romans and Visigoths, the Moors did not find mountainous territory easy to conquer, and the lands along Spain's northern coast never became part of Islamic Spain. With the beginning of the Moorish conquest in the 8th century, this region became a refuge for Christian nobles, and in 722, a \"de facto\" independent kingdom was established, the \"Regnum Asturorum\", which was to become the cradle of the incipient \"Reconquista\" (Reconquest).\nIn the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, and during the Middle Ages the geographic isolation of the territory made historical references scarce. Through the rebellion of Prince Henry (the later Henry II of Castile) in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. The most famous proponents of independence were Gonzalo Pel\u00e1ez and Queen Urraca, who, while achieving significant victories, were ultimately defeated by Castilian troops. After its integration into the Kingdom of Spain, Asturias provided the Spanish court with high-ranking aristocrats and played an important role in the colonisation of America. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled Prince (or Princess) of Asturias. In the 16th century, the population reached 100,000 for the first time, and within another century that number would double due to the arrival of American corn.\nIn the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the Spanish Enlightenment. The renowned Galician thinker Benito de Feij\u00f3o settled in the Benedictine Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo. Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, a polymath and prominent reformer and politician of the late 18th century, was born in the seaside town of Gij\u00f3n.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Asturias was the first Spanish province to rise up against the French following the abdication of King Ferdinand VII on 10 May 1808. Riots began in Oviedo and on 25 May the local government formally declared war on Napoleon with 18,000 men called to arms to resist invasion.\nThe Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of Nal\u00f3n and Caudal. At the same time, there was significant migration to the Americas (especially Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as \"Indianos\", for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: the region is dotted with many large \"modernista\" villas, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.\nAsturias played an important part in the events that led up to the Spanish Civil War. In October 1934, Asturian miners and other workers staged an armed uprising (see Revolution of Asturias) to oppose the coming to power of the right-wing CEDA party, which had obtained three ministerial posts in the centralist government of the Second Spanish Republic. For a month, a Popular Front Committee exercised control in southern Asturias, while local workers committees sprang up elsewhere in the region. A defense committee led by anarcho-syndicalist supporters took power in Oviedo. Troops under the command of a then-unknown general named Francisco Franco Bahamonde were brought from Spanish Morocco to suppress the revolt. Franco applied tactics normally reserved for overseas colonies, using troops of the Spanish Legion and Moroccan troops; ferocious oppression followed.\nAs a result, Asturias remained loyal to the republican government during the Spanish Civil War, and was the scene of an extraordinary defence in extreme terrain, the Battle of El Mazuco. With Franco eventually gaining control of all of Spain, Asturias \u2014 traditionally linked to the Spanish Crown \u2014 was known merely as the \"Province of Oviedo\" from 1939 until Franco's death in 1975. The province's name was restored fully after the return of democracy to Spain in 1977. In the 50s and 60s the industrial progress of Asturias continued with the constitution of national enterprises like Ensidesa and Hunosa, but the 80s was the decade of a dramatic industrial restructuring.\nOn 30 December 1981, Asturias became an autonomous community within the decentralised territorial structure established by the Constitution of 1978. Rafael Luis Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez, who had previously served as the President of the Regional Council since 1978, became the first President of the Principality of Asturias, upon the adoption of autonomy. The Asturian regional government holds comprehensive competencies in important areas such as health, education and protection of the environment. The current president, elected in 2019, is Adri\u00e1n Barb\u00f3n (PSOE).\nAdministrative and territorial division.\nAsturias is organised territorially into 78 municipalities, further subdivided into parishes.\nAsturias is also divided into eight \"comarcas\", which are not administrative divisions. They are only used as a system to homogenize the statistical data made by the Principality.\nMunicipalities of Asturias.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nParishes.\nThe or parish is the subdivision of the Asturian municipalities. Currently, there are 857 parishes integrating the 78 municipalities in the region, and they usually coincide with the ecclesiastic divisions.\nGeography and climate.\nThe Cantabrian Mountains (\"Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica\") form Asturias's natural border with the province of Le\u00f3n to the south. In the eastern range, the Picos de Europa National Park contains the highest and arguably most spectacular mountains, rising to at the Torrecerredo peak. Other notable features of this predominantly limestone range are the Parque Natural de Redes in the central east, the central Ubi\u00f1as south of Oviedo, and the Parque Natural de Somiedo in the west. The Cantabrian mountains offer opportunities for activities such as climbing, walking, skiing and caving, and extend some in total, as far as Galicia province to the west of Asturias and Cantabria province to the east. Similar opportunities are available for the interested traveler of Asturias in Caldoveiro Peak.\nThe Asturian coastline is extensive, with hundreds of beaches, coves and natural sea caves. Notable examples include the Playa del Silencio (\"Beach of Silence\") near the fishing village of Cudillero (west of Gij\u00f3n), as well as the many beaches surrounding the summer resort of Llanes, such as the Barro, Ballota and Torimbia (the latter a predominantly nudist beach). Most of Asturias's beaches are sandy, clean, and bordered by steep cliffs, on top of which it is not unusual to see grazing livestock.\nThe key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior.\nThe climate of Asturias is heavily marked by the Gulf Stream. Falling within the Cantabrian belt known as Green Spain it has high precipitations all year round. Summers are mild and, on the coast, winters also have relatively benign temperatures, rarely including frost. The cold is especially felt in the mountains, where snow is present from October till May. Both rain and snow are regular weather features of Asturian winters. In coastal or near-coastal areas, daytime high temperatures generally average around \u2013 during winter and \u2013 in summer.\nPollution and conservation.\nThis part of Spain is one of the best conserved in the entire country, and full of vegetation and wild spaces. It holds two of the most important natural parks in Spain, and is very renowned for the Picos de Europa and Somiedo areas.\nThe Gij\u00f3n area was marked and singled out as one of the pollution hotspots in Western Europe in a 2015 report from the International Institute for Applied Science Systems, where predictions for 2030 conditions were made. Gij\u00f3n was marked much higher than any other Spanish metro area, in spite of the much larger populations in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. This was attributed to heavy industrial activities. Since outdoor air pollution is a major cause of premature death in Europe, the excessive pollution is a major concern for Asturias. The majority of Asturias population live within a range from the port of Gij\u00f3n, so pollution would be likely to heavily affect the population.\nA Spanish government study conducted in 2010 regarding life expectancy in relative communities, Asturias was ranked lowest (tied with Andalucia) for male life expectancy with 76.7 years from 2007 readings. However, female life expectancy was 84 years and normal among autonomous communities. However, even the male life expectancy is only just below Western European standards, and exaggerated by the high Spanish life expectancy. Considering that many Asturians live in relatively close proximity to Gij\u00f3n's heavily industrial areas, these figures (especially for female relative health) still contribute to a position that Gij\u00f3n is a safe location to live. The numbers for \"disability-free\" life expectancy has risen significantly both for males and females in the area since 1986, according to the report.\nThe coal fired electric generating plant, Abo\u00f1o, completed a Spanish government/EU demand to install equipment to drastically reduce its emissions. Also, the other two major polluters - Arcelor Gij\u00f3n and Arcelor Avil\u00e9s - have announced an investment of 100 million euros to do the same. These factories have been a major cause of the area's high airborne pollution.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of 2024, Asturias has a population of 1,009,599 which constitutes 2.1% of the population of Spain, with the population density numbering 95.2 people per square kilometer.\nThe Asturian population has the highest mortality rate in Spain and the lowest total fertility rate (1.03), the lowest in the European Union.\nImmigration is not as high as in the rest of Spain, as immigrants only represent 3.65% of the population as of 2017.\nLanguages.\nThe only official language in Asturias is Spanish. The Asturian language, also known as Bable, is also spoken, and is protected by law (\"Ley 1/1998, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoci\u00f3n del bable/asturiano\" \u2014 \"Law 1/1998, of 23 March, of Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian\"). It is sometimes used by the Asturian civil service. In the western part of Asturias, Eonavian is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998. Eonavian is intermediate between Asturian and Galician, though it is often regarded as just a variety of Galician; its use in the Asturian Administration is minor compared to the use of the Asturian language. Within Asturias, there is an ongoing process to establish place names in Asturian and Eonavian dialects.\nReligion.\nIn 2019, the Centre for Sociological Research carried a study showing the population of Asturias was 65.2% Catholic (25.1% practicing), 13.5% agnostic, and 12.8% atheist.\nPolitics.\nThe organisation and political structure of Asturias is governed by the Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of Asturias, in force since 30 January 1982. According to the Statute, the institutional bodies of the Principality of Asturias are three: the Council of Government, the General Junta and President. The form of government of the Principality is Parliament: The General Junta is the legislature to choose, on behalf of the Asturian people, the President of the Principality of Asturias. The president of the Principality is also the president of the Council of Government, the head of executive power, and politically answerable to the General Junta.\nThe functions of the General Junta are the approval of budgets, and the direction and control of the action of the Council of Government. It is composed of 45 deputies, elected for four years through the universal suffrage within a system proportional representation that the allocation of deputies is based on D'Hondt method.\nEconomy.\nFor centuries, the backbone of the Asturian economy was agriculture and fishing. Milk production and its derivatives was also traditional, but its big development was a byproduct of the economic expansion of the late 1960s. Nowadays, products from the dairy cooperative Central Lechera Asturiana are being commercialised all over Spain.\nThe main regional industry in modern times, however, was coal mining and steel production: in the times of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, it was the centre of Spain's steel industry. The then state-owned ENSIDESA steel company is now part of the privatised Aceralia, now part of the ArcelorMittal Group. The industry created many jobs, which resulted in significant migration from other regions in Spain, mainly Extremadura, Andalusia and Castile and Le\u00f3n.\nThe steel industry is now in decline when measured in terms of number of jobs provided, as is the mining. The reasons for the latter are mainly the high costs of production to extract the coal compared to other regions. Regional economic growth is below the broader Spanish rate, though in recent years growth in service industries has helped reduce Asturias's high rate of unemployment. Large out-of-town retail parks have opened near the region's largest cities (Gij\u00f3n and Oviedo), whilst the ever-present Spanish construction industry appears to continue to thrive.\nAsturias has benefited extensively since 1986 from European Union investment in roads and other essential infrastructure, though there has also been some controversy regarding how these funds are spent, for example, on miners' pensions.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 23.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 24,400 euros or 81% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 98% of the EU average. This makes the region the 10th richest in Spain, a big decrease from the 1970s/1980s - the heyday of the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in Southern Europe. Asturias has been growing below the Spanish national average since the decline of the mining industry, and grew just 0.82% in 2008, the lowest of all regions in Spain. On the plus side, unemployment in Asturias is below the average of Spain; it stood at 13.7% in 2017.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nAsturias is served by Asturias International Airport (OVD), from Oviedo, near the northwest coast and the industrial town of Avil\u00e9s.\nEastern Asturias is also easily accessible from Santander Airport. Recent improvements introduced in the road network permit flying into Santander and later driving into Asturias, which can be entered in less than an hour's drive. The Irish airline Ryanair operates flights to Santander Airport from Frankfurt Hahn, Liverpool, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Rome Ciampino.\nSea.\nEl Musel (the Port of Gij\u00f3n) is able to receive cruise ships of any size. Companies such as P&amp;O, Swan Hellenic or Hapag Lloyd choose the Port of Gij\u00f3n every year for their calls in the Atlantic European Coast. The following areas are available for cruise vessels:\nThese locations allow a high degree of access control, with security guaranteed for both vessels and passengers alike. The city centre is only away and the Port Authority provides dedicated coach connection allowing passengers to take advantage of the cultural, gastronomic and commercial opportunities that Gij\u00f3n has to offer.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the city of Gij\u00f3n was connected by ferry with the French city of Nantes. This connection was also known as the \"sea highway\" and it had a frequency of two ferries per day in both directions. The route was cancelled in September 2014.\nTrain.\nSpain's national Renfe rail network also serves Asturias well; trains regularly depart to and from the Spanish interior as well as Eastern and Western Asturias. Major stops are the regional capital, Oviedo, and the main coastal city, Gij\u00f3n. Under the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pajares Base Tunnel opened for commercial services end of November 2023, introducing AVE high speed trains.\nBus.\nThere is also a comprehensive bus service run by the ALSA company. It links Avil\u00e9s, Gij\u00f3n, Oviedo and Mieres with Madrid and other major towns, several times a day. These include services to Barcelona, Salamanca, Le\u00f3n, Valladolid, A Coru\u00f1a, Bilbao, Seville, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Paris, Brussels and Nice, to name just a few.\nMain sights.\nKey attractions.\nOviedo is the capital city of Asturias and contains Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo, a pre-Romanesque church and a palace respectively, which were built by the first Asturian kings on Mount Naranco, to the north of the city (World Heritage Site). In modern architecture, the \"Palacio de Congresos de Oviedo\" (or \"Modoo\") was designed by Santiago Calatrava.\nGij\u00f3n, the biggest city of Asturias, is a coastal city known for cultural and sports events, and a beach tourism centre in northern Spain. It also is known for the traditional Asturian gastronomy and for being an Asturian cider production spot. Museums in the city include the Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n, including a modern art museum and theatre.\nAvil\u00e9s is the third largest city in Asturias, where \"La villa del adelantado\" (as locals call it, in reference of Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s) is a meeting point. \"Saint Nicholas of Bari\" or \"Capilla de los Alas\" in Romanesque and Romanesque-Gothic style, respectively; Palacio de Balsera, in Modernist style or St. Thomas of Canterbury church (dating from the 13th century) are examples which show the historical patrimony to be found in the city. The Centro Niemeyer, designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, is an example of contemporary architecture in Asturias.\nThe Picos de Europa National Park, and other parts of the Asturian mountain range: The Picu Urriellu mountain (2519 m or 8262\u00a0ft), also known as \"El Naranjo de Bulnes\", is a molar-shaped peak which, reputedly, glows orange in the evening sun, hence its name. Weather permitting, it can be viewed from Camarme\u00f1a village, near Poncebos, south of Arenas de Cabrales.\nThe shrine to the Virgin of Covadonga and the mountain lakes (\"Los Lagos\"), near Cangas de On\u00eds: Legend has it that in the 8th century, the Virgin blessed Asturian Christian forces with a well-timed signal to attack Spain's Moorish conquerors, thereby taking the invaders by surprise in the Battle of Covadonga. The \"Reconquista\" and eventual unification of all Spain is therefore said to have started in this very location.\nThe Paleolithic art in the caves of Asturias is a declared World Heritage Site with the Paleolithic Art of Northern Spain.\nAsturias also has examples of industrial heritage as a consequence of its industrial activities in the 19th and 20th centuries. It had metallurgical and chemical factories, mines, bridges and railways, including in the towns of Langreo, Mieres and Avil\u00e9s.\nThe Asturian coast: especially the beaches in and around the summer resort of Llanes, the Playa del Silencio near Cudillero fishing village, or the \"white\" village of Luarca (Severo Ochoa hometown).\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nAsturias has a rich artistic legacy that emphasizes Romanesque (\"Asturias Arts\") indigenous architecture with monuments like Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco, Santa Cristina de Lena and San Miguel de Lillo. These monuments have a Ramirense Romanesque style (due to Ramiro I) or San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados, known as Santullano (Oviedo) of the Alfonsino pre-Romanesque style (due to Alfonso II), which are all in Oviedo. Other examples of architecture are Villaviciosa's church, San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s (commonly known by the Asturians as \"Convent\u00edn\"), and the church of San Salvador de Priesca. Another example is Cabranes' San Julian de Vi\u00f1\u00f3n.\nThe Romanesque style is very present, since all Asturias is crossed by one of the Camino de Santiago routes, which highlights the Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva (near Cangas de Onis), the churches of San Esteban de Aramil (Siero), San Juan de Amandi (Villaviciosa) and Santa Mar\u00eda de Junco (Ribadesella).\nThe Gothic style is not as abundant, but there are good examples of this style, such as the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo.\nThe Baroque style is more present by means of palace architecture, with such notable examples as the Palace of Camposagrado and Velarde - the latter seat of Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias. The Baroque style stands out in public civil engineering and bridge tolls (Olloniego); the milestones, the chairs or seats present along the road to Madrid and the resort of Caldas de Priorio (Oviedo) building.\nIn 1985, the UNESCO declared the pre-Romanesque monuments and the Cathedral of Oviedo as World Heritage Sites.\nIn popular architecture, the traditional granaries in Asturias, called \"h\u00f3rreos\", are known for their demographic extension and their functional evolution, its basic characteristic being its mobility: it can be easily dismounted and transported to another location. The Panera is the evolution of the h\u00f3rreo, with examples exceeding of area covered. The purpose of the horreo is to store objects and crops. With the arrival of maize and the beans, they were endowed with exterior corridors and railings for drying the harvests.\nAsturias is home to the only architectural work in Spain (as well as the largest in Europe) of the Brazilian architect and disciple of Le Corbusier; Oscar Niemeyer: the Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre. The architectural project was donated to the Principality by the architect, who was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts, in the XXV edition of these awards. Niemeyer's project combined several different elements, and projected an open space, a place for education, culture and peace.\nIn the capital of the Principality stands one of the most representative buildings of modern architecture, the Palace of Congresses of Oviedo, by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who also awarded the Prince of Asturias of Award for the Arts in 1999.\nSpecial importance has been placed in recent years on the recovery of industrial heritage through various routes and industrial museums, especially in the central area of the region.\nFestivals and holidays.\nSome of the most famous festivals in Asturias take place in the small town of Llanes. These festivals celebrate the important saints and the Virgin Mary adored by the town. The associations that prepare the festivals have a rivalry between them and each year they try to outdo each other with more impressive shows. The three most important are the festival of San Roque (St. Roque) held on the 16th of August, the festival of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de La Guia (Our Lady, Virgin Mary, the Guide) held on the 8th of September, and the festival of Santa Maria Magdalena (St. Mary Magdalene) held on the 22nd of July. The Magdalena is well known for its march of logs where boys as young as 3 and men carry logs through the town until they reach the end point and start a large bonfire.\nFood and drink.\nWhile Asturias is especially known for its seafood, the most famous regional dish is \"fabada asturiana\", a rich stew typically made with large white beans (\"fabes\"), shoulder of pork (\"lac\u00f3n\"), black pudding (\"morcilla\"), and spicy sausage (\"chorizo\").\nApple groves foster the production of the region's traditional alcoholic drink, a natural cider (\"sidra\"). Since it is natural and bottled without gas, it produces a weak carbonation, and when Asturian cider is served, it is poured in a particular way, \"el escanciado\": the bottle is held above the head allowing for a long vertical pour, causing the cider to be aerated as it splashes into the glass below. After drinking most of the content, it is customary to splash a little out onto the ground, as a way to clean the glass of any lees for the next serving. Traditionally, the same glass is refilled and passed around, with everyone drinking from it in turn.\nAsturian cheeses, especially Cabrales, are also eaten throughout Spain and beyond; Asturias is often called \"the land of cheeses\" (\"el pa\u00eds de los quesos\").\nSport.\nAsturias has two main football teams: Sporting de Gij\u00f3n and Real Oviedo, which have played over 35 seasons in La Liga. Other current notable sports teams are Oviedo CB (basketball) and AB Gij\u00f3n Jovellanos (handball).\nRacing driver Fernando Alonso is a two-time Formula One world champion, two-time Le Mans winner and FIA World Endurance winner. He races with Asturias' flag colours and the Asturian cross on his helmet. Cyclist Samuel S\u00e1nchez won a gold at the Olympic games. Football players from Asturias include World Cup winner David Villa as well as Quini, Luis Enrique, Juan Manuel Mata, and Santiago Cazorla, among others.\nLiterature.\nThese are some notable people of Asturian Literature:\nMusic.\nThe music of Asturias is varied. The most characteristic instrument in traditional music is the Asturian bagpipe, or \"Gaita asturiana\", which has a single drone. The bagpipe is often accompanied by the hand drum, whistles and accordion.\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional folk music, and several music ensembles have gained regional and international recognition for their ethnomusicological study and presentation of indigenous Asturian music. Notable examples include traditional pipers such as Xuacu Amieva and Tejedor and fusionist Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Hevia (whose music video provides views of both the gaita and the Asturian landscape), and the groups Llan de Cubel, Xera, Nuberu and Felpeyu. Additionally, numerous rock, ska and heavy metal groups have also found relative success within Asturias, many of which incorporate elements of traditional Asturian music into their sound.\nAnthem.\nThe Asturian anthem Asturias, patria querida (Asturias, beloved fatherland), which was a popular song adopted as the region's anthem and formalised by \"Ley 1/1984, de 27 de Abr\u00edl\".\nOrquesta Sinf\u00f3nica del Principado de Asturias.\nThe Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica del Principado de Asturias is the premier orchestra in the Principality of Asturias. It is based in the Auditorio Pr\u00edncipe Felipe in Oviedo, but also performs in the main concert venues in Gij\u00f3n and Avil\u00e9s. Rossen Milanov is the Music Director.\nOther.\n\"Asturias\" is also the name of the fifth movement of the \"Suite Espa\u00f1ola, Op. 47\" by Spanish composer Isaac Alb\u00e9niz. Nevertheless, the music has little in common with the region's own folklore. Another famous piece of classical music more authentically inspired by the Asturian musical heritage is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Capriccio Espagnol\", which prominently features a theme from an \"alborada\", a dance tune traditionally played to celebrate the rising of the sun.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;ns&gt;10&lt;/ns&gt;\n &lt;id&gt;22914325&lt;/id&gt;\n &lt;revision&gt;\n &lt;id&gt;1147815959&lt;/id&gt;\n &lt;parentid&gt;953494070&lt;/parentid&gt;\n &lt;timestamp&gt;2023-04-02T10:44:43Z&lt;/timestamp&gt;\n &lt;contributor&gt;\n &lt;username&gt;Randy Kryn&lt;/username&gt;\n &lt;id&gt;4796325&lt;/id&gt;\n &lt;/contributor&gt;\n &lt;comment&gt;Minor arts, removed Sudarium of Oviedo (not an artwork)&lt;/comment&gt;\n &lt;origin&gt;1147815959&lt;/origin&gt;\n &lt;model&gt;wikitext&lt;/model&gt;\n &lt;format&gt;text/x-wiki&lt;/format&gt;"}
{"id": "68203", "revid": "51054006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68203", "title": "Hove", "text": "Seaside town in East Sussex, England\nHove ( ) is a seaside town in East Sussex, England. Alongside Brighton, it is one of the two main parts of the city of Brighton and Hove.\nOriginally a fishing village surrounded by open farmland, it grew rapidly in the 19th century in response to the development of its eastern neighbour Brighton; by the Victorian era it was a fully developed town with borough status. Neighbouring parishes such as Aldrington and Hangleton were annexed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The neighbouring urban district of Portslade was merged with Hove in 1974. In 1997, as part of local government reform, the borough merged with Brighton to form the Borough of Brighton and Hove; this unitary authority was granted city status in 2000.\nName and etymology.\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou (Domesday Book, 1086), la Houue (1288), Huua (13th century), Houve (13th and 14th centuries), Huve (14th and 15th centuries), Hova (16th century) and Hoova (1675). The etymology was disputed at length during the 20th century as academics offered several competing theories. Suggestions included an Old Norse word meaning \"hall\", \"sanctuary\" or \"barrow\", in reference to the Bronze Age barrow near the present Palmeira Square; an Old English phrase \"\u00e6t \u00fe\u00e6m hofe\" meaning \"at the hall\"; the Old English \"hufe\" meaning \"shelter\" or \"covering\"; and the Middle English \"hofe\" meaning \"anchorage\". No other places in Britain are called Hove, and single-syllable names as a whole are rare in Sussex. The modern name was originally pronounced \"Hoove\" (). The present pronunciation () \"is comparatively recent\".\nGeography and topography.\nNorthern parts of Hove are built on chalk beds, part of the White Chalk Subgroup found across southeast England. There are also extensive areas of clay and sandy soil: areas of Woolwich Formation and Reading Formation clay, pockets of clay embedded with flint, and a large deposit of brickearth in the Aldrington area. Hove's beaches have the characteristics of a storm beach, and at high tide are entirely shingle, although low tide exposes sand between the sea-defence groynes, varying in extent from beach to beach. The water is then very shallow and suitable for paddling. On spring tides a greater expanse of sand is exposed beyond the end of the sea defences. The mean height above sea level of land in the old parish of Hove varied between . After Hove became a borough and expanded to incorporate land from neighbouring parishes, the highest point was approximately above sea level. There are no rivers in Hove, but Westbourne Gardens at the western boundary of the old parish is named after the \"West Bourne\", which was still visible in the 19th century but which now runs underground, and a map of 1588 shows another stream called East Brook.\nUntil the 19th century the parish was mostly agricultural. Three farms\u2014Wick, Goldstone and Long Barn\u2014dominated the area and owned most of the land, which was of good quality: agricultural writer Arthur Young described it as \"uncommonly rich\". Crops including oats, barley, corn and various vegetables were grown. Only in the 1870s were the last of the market gardens near Hove Street built over, and barley was grown near Eaton Road until the county cricket ground was built. Water was provided by wells west of Hove Street and between the coast road and the sea (the latter was destroyed in the Great Storm of 1703). The chalybeate spring on the Wick Farm estate was also used, especially by shepherds who drove their sheep between Hove, the South Downs and nearby villages along ancient drove roads. Some local shepherds supplemented their income by catching larks and northern wheatears and selling them for their meat; the latter were popular among fashionable visitors to Brighton. The birds were common on the hills and valleys around Hove, such as Goldstone Bottom. The practice died out when wheatears became a protected species in the late 18th century. The urban growth of Hove has shifted sheep-farming to more isolated parts of the South Downs, but several drove roads survive today as roads or footpaths. Hove Street and its northward continuation Sackville Road were originally known as \"Hove Drove\" and led on to the Downs. A long west\u2013east route which crossed West Blatchington, Hove and Preston parishes on its way to Lewes now bears the names The Droveway, The Drove and Preston Drove. The section called The Droveway, on which the Goldstone Waterworks was built in the 1860s, had to be maintained as a right of way when Hove Park was built. A long diagonal footpath once known as Dyer's Drove runs for several miles from Portslade-by-Sea on to the Downs, and Drove Road in Portslade village may have been used since Roman times.\nA large Sarsen stone called the Goldstone stood on farmland northwest of the village, now part of Hove Park. Links with druids were claimed; and some 19th-century sources stated it was part of a ring of stones similar to Stonehenge, and that the others were buried in a pond at Goldstone Bottom, one of the coombes (small dry valleys) between the Downs and the sea. The Goldstone was dug up and buried by a farmer, but was unearthed and re-erected in a new position in the park in 1906.\nHove has little ancient woodland. Only two small areas survive: one in St Ann's Well Gardens, and The Three Cornered Copse in the Tongdean area. The latter covers and belonged to the Marquess of Abergavenny until Hove Borough Council bought it in January 1935. Trees in the copse include ash, beech, elm and sycamore, although more than 120 mature beech trees were blown down in the Great storm of 1987.\nMuch of Hove is urbanised, but in 1994 there were of downland\u2014about 37.5% of the total acreage of the then borough. In common with other parts of the South Downs, much of land has been used as sheep pasture, but crop farming also takes place and large areas of land were claimed for military training during World War II. Toads Hole Valley, a triangular site south of the Brighton Bypass, is \"the last piece of unspoiled downland in Hove\". It has been privately owned since 1937 and has been proposed for urban development for many years: in 2002 it was stated that \"controversy rages over the future use of this land\".\nClimate.\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\nHistory and development.\nPre-Roman evidence.\nFossilised remains from the Pleistocene era have been found in three locations in Hove: an molar from \"Elephas antiquus\", excavated from the garden of a house in Poplar Avenue; teeth from a juvenile elephant deep in the soil at Ventnor Villas; and a prehistoric horse's tooth in the soil near Hove Street.\nDuring building work near Palmeira Square in 1856\u201357, workmen uncovered a substantial burial mound. A prominent feature of the landscape since 1200 BC, the -high tumulus yielded, among other treasures, the Hove amber cup. Made of translucent red Baltic amber and approximately the same size as a regular china tea cup, the artefact can be seen in the Hove Museum and Art Gallery. Only one other has been found in Britain. Also buried in the coffin in which the amber cup was found were a stone battle-axe, a whetstone and a bronze dagger whose appearance is characteristic of the Wessex culture.\nDomesday Book.\nThere are entries for Brighton and Portslade (Bristelmestune and Porteslage) and small downland settlements like Hangleton (Hangetone), but nothing for the location of Hove itself.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nThe first known settlement in Hove was around the 12th century when St Andrew's Church was established. Hove remained insignificant for centuries, consisting of just a single street running north\u2013south some 250\u00a0m from the church, which by the 16th century was recorded as being in ruins.\nHangleton Manor is a well-preserved 16th-century flint manor building. It is believed to have been built c.\u20091540 for Richard Bel(l)ingham, twice High Sheriff of Sussex, whose initials are carved into a fireplace, and whose coat of arms adorns a period plaster ceiling. The Manor is currently serving as a pub-restaurant and whilst it was once on open downland, it is now surrounded by the 20th-century Hangleton housing estate.\n18th century.\nIn 1723 a traveller, the antiquary John Warburton, wrote, 'I passed through a ruinous village called Hove which the sea is daily eating up and is in a fair way of being quite deserted; but the church being quite large and a good distance from the shore may perhaps escape'. Nevertheless, in around 1702 The Ship Inn had been built at the seaward end of the main street, and was therefore vulnerable to erosion of the coast.\nIn 1724, Daniel Defoe wrote in reference to the south coast, 'I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the Land's End in Cornwall.\"\nThe fertile coastal plain west of the Brighton boundary had significant deposits of brickearth and by c.1770 a brickfield had been established on the site of what would become Brunswick Square. Later, other brickfields were established further west, remaining until displaced by housing development.\nRegency and Victorian developments.\nThe census of 1801 recorded only 101 residents to Brighton's 7,339. By 1821, the year the Prince Regent was crowned George IV, the population had risen to 312, while that of Brighton, which became a highly fashionable resort during the Regency, had also trebled, to 24,429. The dwellings were then still clustered on Hove Street, surrounded by an otherwise empty landscape of open farmland. This relative isolated location of Hove, compared to Brighton, was ideal for smuggling and there was considerable illicit activity. Hove smugglers became notorious, with contraband often being stored in the now partially repaired St. Andrew's Church. Tradition has it that The Ship Inn was a favourite rendezvous for the smugglers, and in 1794 soldiers were billeted there. In 1818 there was a pitched battle on Hove beach between revenue men and smugglers, from which the latter emerged as the victors. As part of the concerted drive by Parliament to combat smuggling, a coastguard station was opened at the southern end of Hove Street in 1831, next to The Ship Inn.\nBull-baiting took place on Saint Andrew's Day and on the Tuesday after Easter Sunday, but the practice ceased after 1810 when a bull broke free and ran through the crowd. The bullring was between the coast road and the beach, southwest of Hove Street, and the fights were promoted by the Ship Inn\u2014which also organised cockfighting matches, even after this activity was made illegal.\nIn the years following the Coronation of 1821 the Brunswick estate of large Regency houses with a theatre, riding schools and their own police was developed on the seafront near the boundary with Brighton. Although within Hove parish the residents of these elegant houses avoided the name of the impoverished village a mile to the west as an address. Straggling development along the coast loosely connected the estate to fashionable Brighton, so that name was used instead.\nDating from 1822, the Brighton to Shoreham turnpike crossed the north of Hove parish along the route of the present Old Shoreham Road.\nThe Brighton and Hove Gas Company was established in 1825 and built a gasworks next to St Andrew's Church in 1832. Houses in Brunswick Terrace were the first to be lit by gas. Production moved to a new gasworks at Portslade in 1871 and the Hove works became a storage facility. The site at Portslade was close to Shoreham Harbour, so coal could be transported to it directly. Increasing demand for gas meant a new gasholder, one of the largest in Sussex, was built on the Hove site in 1877. Of novel construction for the time, it was used until September 1994.\nBy 1831 the development of the eastern end of the parish had increased the population to 1,360 but this brought few economic benefits to Hove village itself, with the historian Thomas Horsfield describing it in 1835 as 'a mean and insignificant assemblage of huts'.\nSt Andrew's Church was reconstructed and enlarged to its present form in 1836, to the design of the architect George Basevi (1794\u20131845), and features prominently in the background of paintings of the period. About this time, a very substantial and tall wall was built between the churchyard and adjoining gasworks, remaining in place to this day.\nThe flat coastal plain was useful for sport as from 1848 to 1871 England's oldest county club, Sussex County Cricket Club, used the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, situated roughly on the site of present-day Third and Fourth Avenues. In 1872 the club moved to the present County Cricket Ground, Hove.\nTwo further large estates were developed between Hove village and Brunswick, and both avoided using the name Hove: Cliftonville was designed, laid out and initially developed under Frederick Banister from the late 1840s; and West Brighton Estate in the 1870s.\nWest of Brunswick, the seafront of West Brighton Estate forms the end of a series of avenues, in numerical order beginning with First Avenue, mostly composed of fine Victorian villas built as another well-integrated housing scheme featuring mews for artisans and service buildings. Grand Avenue, The Drive, and the numbered avenues were developed through the 1870s and 1880s, with many of the buildings constructed by William Willett.\nHove's wide boulevards contrast with the bustle of Brighton, although many of the grand Regency and Victorian mansions have been converted into flats. Marlborough Court was once the residence of the Duchess of Marlborough, aunt of Winston Churchill. The Irish nationalist leader and Home Rule MP Charles Stewart Parnell used to visit his lover, the already married Kitty O'Shea at the house she rented in 1883 in Medina Villas, Hove. In the subsequent divorce action the cook alleged that Captain O'Shea returned home unexpectedly and Parnell beat a hasty retreat by climbing over the balcony and down a rope ladder. Parnell died at Hove in 1891 after marrying Kitty following her divorce.\nThe Hove Club, a private members' club located at 28 Fourth Avenue, was founded in 1882.\nTwentieth century.\nIn the 1910s eleven cottages were built on the beach on the Western Esplanade between Hove Lagoon and Portslade. Named Seaside Villas, these houses have attracted a number of famous residents. War poets David Jones and Robert Graves spent time there, as did the playwright Joe Orton. More recently it has been home to celebrities such as Adele, David Walliams, Zoe Ball and Heather McCartney. Another resident, DJ Fat Boy Slim, owns the nearby Big Beach Cafe.\nIn 1966 Hove Town Hall designed by eminent architect Alfred Waterhouse burned down. It was replaced by a Brutalist building designed by local architect John Wells-Thorpe.\nFirst World War.\nOver 600 men from Hove were killed in the First World War. After the armistice, the town established a war memorial committee to decide on commemoration of the dead. The committee commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect responsible for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall which became the focus of national remembrance services. Lutyens proposed a similar cenotaph for Hove and went as far as constructing a wooden mock-up which was displayed on Hove Lawns but the committee rejected the design. The eventual result was a statue of Saint George atop a column, situated in the centre of Grand Avenue. The memorial does not contain the names of the fallen, which are instead recorded on a bronze plaque in Hove Library.\nSecond World War.\nAt the outbreak of war, the recently completed Hove Marina leisure centre was immediately requisitioned as a training base for new officers of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) and was given the title . The establishment opened on 11 September 1939 and later expanded into Lancing College. By the end of the war, the base had trained 22,508 British, Commonwealth and allied officers for active sea service.\nOn 22 September 1939, the second Anglo-French Supreme War Council was held at Hove Town Hall to discuss the progress of the war and define future strategy. The British delegation included the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, while the French party was led by the Minister of Defence and Prime Minister of France, \u00c9douard Daladier and Commander-in-Chief of the Armies, Maurice Gamelin. Also present was Sir Alexander Cadogan who related that the town hall staff had only been told to expect some government officials, with the result that the prime minister was greeted with the exclamation; \"Chamberlain! !\".\nThe Brighton and Hove area was subjected to heavy bombing by the \"Luftwaffe\" between 1940 and 1944, known collectively as the \"Brighton Blitz\", which resulted in the deaths of 198 civilians.\nGovernance and politics.\nFormer Hove borough.\nThe ancient parish of Hove originally consisted of only and in 1801 had a population of just 101. In 1829, local landowners petitioned parliament for powers to improve the Brunswick Town area of Hove with paving, lighting and drainage, resulting in the appointment of a body known as the Brunswick Commissioners in the following year. Subsequently, further commissioners were appointed for West Hove and to administer the Hove Police, all three bodies being united by the Hove Commissioners Act of 1873. In 1893 the civil parish of Aldrington was joined to Hove and in 1894, the Hove Commissioners were replaced by an Urban District Council. Finally in 1898 the Municipal Borough of Hove received its royal charter. This was enlarged in 1927 by the addition of the parishes of Preston Rural and Hangleton along with parts of West Blatchington and Patcham. The corporation consisted of a mayor, ten aldermen, and thirty councillors, elected from ten wards. The first town hall was built in 1882. On 1 April 1997 Brighton Borough Council and Hove Borough Council were merged to form Brighton and Hove City Council.\nCoat of arms.\nWhile it was still a separate entity, Hove had its own coat of arms. The escutcheon's official heraldic description is \"Tierced in pairle: 1. Or a saltire azure voided argent; 2. Gules two pairs of leg-irons interlaced argent; 3. Checky or and azure three martlets or, all in a border ermine charged with six martlets or\". The design incorporates several features relevant to Hove's history. The ships of the French raiders who repeatedly attacked the coast in the Brighton and Hove area in the 16th century are represented by the crest. The saltire of Saint Andrew and the leg-shackles of Leonard of Noblac refer to the ancient parish churches of Hove and Aldrington, St Andrew's and St Leonard's respectively. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey held land in the Rape of Lewes at the time of the Norman Conquest including the territory covered by Hove; his colours were blue and gold, represented by the chequerboard pattern in the background of the shield.\nCommercial.\nThe town centre received substantial renovation in the late 1990s when the popular George Street was pedestrianised. Some concern about the pedestrianisation and its impact (supposedly killing trade) was expressed by residents, the local newspaper \"The Argus\", and small locally owned shops. However, these fears proved unfounded. In 2003 these small shops were joined by the centre's first large supermarket (a Tesco), built on the site of a former gasometer.\nLandmarks and attractions.\nPlaces of worship.\nEcclesiastically, Hove was part of a joint parish with Preston between 1531 and 1879. The newly separate parish of Hove was then split several times in the late 19th and 20th centuries as the population grew and more Anglican churches were built. St Andrew's Church near the top end of Hove Street was the ancient parish church but was in ruins by the 1830s, when it was rebuilt in a Neo-Gothic style. St Helen's Church at Hangleton, lightly restored in the 1870s, retains the style of a simple Sussex downland church. St Peter's Church was abandoned and fell to ruins in the 17th century when West Blatchington became depopulated, but it was rebuilt in the 1890s. St Leonard's, the parish church of Aldrington, was also ruinous until 1878 when local population growth necessitated its restoration.\nA second church dedicated to St Andrew opened on the Brunswick estate in 1828. St John the Baptist's was built on Palmeira Square in 1852, followed by St Patrick's nearby in 1858 and Holy Trinity in central Hove in 1864. St Barnabas served the poorer areas around Sackville Road from 1883; All Saints on Eaton Road dates from 1889 to 1891; St Philip's was built in 1895 as a second church for Aldrington, and opened a mission hall (now Holy Cross Church) in the Poets' Corner area in 1903; St Thomas the Apostle opened on Davigdor Road in 1909; St Agnes was built north of Hove station in 1913; Bishop Hannington Memorial Church opened in West Blatchington in 1939; and The Knoll estate has been served by St Richard's Church since 1961, replacing a 1930s church hall. Four of these churches have closed: St Agnes in 1977, St Andrew's in Brunswick Town in 1990, St Thomas in 1993 and Holy Trinity in 2007. All Saints Church, a Grade I-listed building by John Loughborough Pearson, became the parish church of Hove in 1892.\nThe Church of the Sacred Heart was Hove's first Roman Catholic church. It was founded in 1876 by St Mary Magdalen's Church in Brighton, whose first priest left money in his will for a church in Hove. Work was delayed by disputes over the site, but after land on Norton Road was secured construction started in 1880 and the west end was finished in 1887. The Sacred Heart in turn founded a mission church in 1902 to serve the Aldrington and Portland Road areas of Hove. St Peter's Hall was used until the \"startling\" basilica-style red-brick St Peter's Church was opened in 1915. Mass was said in Hangleton from the 1940s in a hall and at the Grenadier pub, but in the 1950s land on Court Farm Road was bought for a church and St George's Church opened in 1968. It serves West Blatchington and Hangleton, and is now part of a joint parish with Southwick and Portslade.\nHove was included in the Lewes and Brighton Methodist Circuit from 1808, although at times during the 19th century no Methodists (Wesleyan, Primitive or Bible Christian) lived in the area. A secondhand tin tabernacle was erected on Portland Road for Wesleyans in 1883, and the present Hove Methodist Church was built on the site in 1896. A Bible Christian chapel was built in 1905 on Old Shoreham Road but never thrived; it closed in 1947 and was sold to a charity. Primitive Methodists worshipped at a large chapel on Goldstone Villas from 1878 until 1933. It was converted into offices in 1968.\nHove's General Baptist congregation developed in the 1870s and met in a gymnasium and a tin tabernacle until Holland Road Baptist Church opened in 1887. A deacon from the church started holding Baptist meetings in a new church building on the Hangleton estate in 1957. It now has the name Oasis Church. A former Congregational mission hall in Aldrington, built in 1900, is home to the Baptist-aligned New Life Christian Church. Stoneham Road Baptist Church was founded in 1904 by the Holland Road church to serve the Poets' Corner area. It closed and was demolished in 2008. Baptists also met in Connaught Terrace from 1879, and Strict Baptists worshipped at Providence Chapel on Haddington Street from 1880 until 1908.\nA Congregational chapel was built on Ventnor Villas in 1870, and 41 years later St Cuthbert's Presbyterian Church opened on Holland Road. After the two denominations merged in 1972 to form the United Reformed Church, the congregations came together in 1980 at the Ventnor Villas premises. These were renamed Central United Reformed Church and continue to serve as the main centre for that denomination in Hove. St Cuthbert's was demolished in 1984. In 1938 trustees of the Congregational chapel founded another on the Hangleton estate. Hounsom Memorial Church is also now part of the United Reformed Church.\nThe Salvation Army have worshipped in Hove since 1882 and occupy a citadel built in 1890 on Sackville Road. Jehovah's Witnesses meet in Aldrington at a Kingdom Hall which was built in 1999 to replace a hall of 1950. A non-denominational gospel hall stands on Edward Avenue in the Goldstone Valley area. The Christian Arabic Evangelical Church meets in a converted bungalow on Old Shoreham Road in Aldrington. A former Anglican church of 1909 on Davigdor Road has served Coptic Orthodox Christians from a wide area since 1994, when it was rededicated as St Mary and St Abraam Church by Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria. Buddhists have a cultural centre and place of worship at a former convent near Furze Hill. Other former churches in Hove include an Elim Pentecostal chapel (in use 1929\u20131994) on Portland Road, the Seventh-day Adventist chapel on Hove Place, whose congregation now meet at Hove Methodist Church, and a former mission hall in the Poets' Corner area which was used until c. 1981 as a chapel for the local Society of Dependants sect.\nHove Museum of Creativity.\nHove Museum of Creativity is a municipally owned museum which houses a permanent collection of toys, contemporary crafts, fine art and local history artefacts, as well as holding temporary exhibitions of contemporary crafts.\nEducation.\nHove's primary schools are: West Blatchington Primary and Nursery School, St. Andrew's CE School, Hove Junior School, Benfield Junior School, Goldstone Primary School, Hangleton Junior School, Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School, Mile Oak Primary School, Bilingual Primary School, Brunswick Primary School and Aldrington CE School. There are four secondary schools serving the area: Blatchington Mill School, Cardinal Newman Catholic School, Hove Park School and King's School.\nBrighton Hove &amp; Sussex Sixth Form College (BHASVIC), formerly Brighton, Hove &amp; Sussex Grammar School, is a dedicated place of further education, along with the Connaught Centre, Hove Park Sixth Form Centre and Blatchington Mill Sixth Form College.\nBrighton is also the location of private colleges such as Hove College. Founded in 1977, Hove College is a non-profit private higher education institution and offers courses accredited by OCN London.\nHove has a number of private schools including Deepdene School, Lancing College Preparatory School (formerly Mowden School) The Montessori Place, The Drive Prep School and St Christopher's School (now part of Brighton College). There are also language schools for foreign students.\nSport and leisure.\nThe home of Sussex County Cricket Club is at County Cricket Ground, Hove. It is used for county, national and international matches, music concerts, fireworks displays, and has found resurgent popularity with the introduction of Twenty20.\nUntil 1997 Hove was home to the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.'s Goldstone Ground. The football club is known as The Seagulls and a seagull crest has been used since 1977. In September 2007, planning permission was confirmed for the club's new ground, at Falmer, still within the city limits but on the Brighton side. The new stadium started development in late 2008, with the first game being played in August 2011.\nHove is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.\nBrighton &amp; Hove Hockey Club is a field hockey club and its home ground is based in Hove.\nThere are a number of parks in Hove including Hove Park and St. Anne's Well Gardens which has many native and exotic trees and a scented garden. The King Alfred Centre which is currently a leisure centre with swimming pool and a couple of gyms on the seafront. In March 2007 Brighton and Hove City Council gave planning permission for a \u00a3290 million development designed by Frank Gehry. This project was scrapped in January 2009 when the developer pulled out. \nHove Promenade parkrun, situated by Hove Lawns started in July 2015 and is one of five such free, timed 5\u00a0km runs across the city. Hove Lawns is a stretch of lawns along the seafront divided into two parts \u2013 Brunswick Lawns and King's Lawns.\nThe Monarch's Way long-distance footpath threads south-eastwards across the town from the Downs, before heading west along the seafront towards its terminus at Shoreham-by-Sea.\n\"Hove, actually\".\nA well-known reply by residents of Hove, usually humorous, when asked if they live in Brighton is \"Hove, actually\" thus maintaining a distinction with their neighbour. One source has identified the locally resident actor Laurence Olivier (who lived in Brighton) as the origin of the phrase. In the 1990s the Hove borough council used the slogan \"Hove, actually\" to promote the town for tourism.\nTransport.\nHove has several A-roads. The A259 runs along Kingsway, forming the main seafront road in Hove. The A270 Old Shoreham Road, another major west\u2013east route further north, was originally part of the A27 trunk road before the Brighton bypass was built. The A2023 runs north from the A259 through central Hove and West Blatchington, meeting the A2038 on the edge of Hangleton and continuing to a junction with the A23 London\u2013Brighton road. Other main routes, all with B-road status, include Grand Avenue and The Drive (B2185), Cromwell Road and Davigdor Road (B2120) and New Church Road, Church Road and Western Road (B2066).\nThere were of roads in Hove borough in 1906, rising to in 1948. Even in the latter year some were still paved with wood.\nBuses.\nMany bus routes serve central Hove, and Church Road/New Church Road and Blatchington Road/Portland Road are important bus corridors. Most services are operated by Brighton &amp; Hove, a bus company which has been owned by the Go-Ahead Group since November 1993. Routes include the 1 and 1X to Whitehawk and Mile Oak, the 2 to Shoreham-by-Sea, Steyning and Rottingdean, the 5, 5A and 5B to the Hangleton estate and the Hollingbury and Patcham estates in Brighton, the 6 to Brighton railway station, the 7 to Brighton Marina, the 21 to the Goldstone Valley estate and Brighton Marina, the 25 to the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, the 46 to Southwick and Hollingbury and the 49 to Moulsecoomb. The Big Lemon operates a circular route serving Portslade, the Knoll Estate and Hangleton and another serving Knoll Estate and Hangleton and continuing to Brighton railway station, central Brighton, Brighton Marina, Rottingdean and Saltdean. Stagecoach South operates the Coastliner 700 route through Hove, serving Brighton to the east and Shoreham-by-Sea, Worthing and Littlehampton to the west, with connections to Bognor Regis, Chichester and Portsmouth. Several National Express coaches on route 025 (Worthing\u2013London) serve Hove each morning, calling at a stop on the A259 near the King Alfred Leisure Centre.\nHove's first bus service ran from the Ship Inn on Hove Street to Black Rock near Rottingdean and started on 11 May 1853. Seven return journeys ran daily. Local businessman A.C. Elliott became a licensed bus operator in 1879 with ten vehicles, 12 conductors and 13 drivers, running services between Hove and central Brighton. Other operators soon started running buses in competition, and the Hove Commissioners \"[kept] a tight rein on things\" by issuing and renewing licences once a year. From 1901, horse-drawn buses began to be replaced with petrol-driven vehicles and, from 1908, by experimental electric buses as well. Thomas Tilling became a major operator in Hove after gaining licences for Portslade\u2013Brighton routes in 1912. He operated from premises on Holland Road until new garages and offices were built on Conway Street in 1916. The company was renamed the Brighton, Hove and District Omnibus Company in 1935, and the Conway Street premises were rebuilt in 1939\u201340 to the design of H.R. Starkey. By 1927 Southdown Motor Services was another major local operator: Hove Council licensed 100 of its vehicles for local and longer-distance work, and the company's main works was at Portslade. It became part of the National Bus Company in 1968 along with the Brighton, Hove and District Omnibus Company. As a result, the latter's works at Conway Street closed in 1969. The companies separated again in 1986 and the former Tilling operations became the Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company, now the city's main operator. The Conway Street premises were retained as a bus garage.\nRailways.\nThe first railway station named Hove opened at the top of Holland Road on 12 May 1840 on the Brighton to Shoreham-by-Sea line (now the West Coastway line). It closed on 1 March 1880, but a new station named Holland Road Halt opened on approximately the same site on 3 September 1905. Its two timber platforms were still in place when it closed permanently on 7 May 1956.\nThe present Hove railway station, west of Brighton station, opened at the top of Goldstone Villas on 1 October 1865 with the name Cliftonville; it was renamed West Brighton in 1879, Hove and West Brighton in 1894, and received its present name in 1895. Further west, from Brighton, Aldrington railway station opened with the name Dyke Junction Halt on 3 September 1905, taking the name Aldrington Halt from 17 June 1932 when the platforms were resited and rebuilt. Portslade railway station, serving Aldrington and West Hove as well as Portslade village and Portslade-by-Sea, opened with the line on 12 May 1840 but was closed between 1847 and 1857. Its original station buildings survive, but goods facilities were withdrawn in 1968. It is west of Brighton. There is a level crossing at the west end. All three stations are managed and served by Southern.\nAs of 2024, during the off-peak Monday -Saturday, Hove station sees half hourly services to London Victoria (via Haywards Heath), at least quarter hourly service to Brighton, services every half an hour to Southampton, at least half hourly to Littlehampton and at least hourly services to Bognor Regis and Portsmouth and Southsea.\nImmediately west of Aldrington station, the Brighton and Dyke Railway branched off and headed north through West Blatchington and Hangleton to a terminus at Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. Golf Club Halt opened in 1891 to serve Brighton and Hove Golf Course, and Rowan Halt opened in 1933 on Rowan Avenue to serve the Hangleton and West Blatchington areas. The branch line opened on 1 September 1887; it closed permanently on 31 December 1938, having already been closed for three years from 1917.\nThe Cliftonville Curve opened in 1879 to connect the West Coastway line with the Brighton main line, allowing trains to travel between the lines without reversing at Brighton station. It passes through a tunnel. There is also a tunnel between Brighton and Hove stations.\nTaxis.\nThe first Hackney carriage licences were issued by the Hove Police Commissioners in 1859. Within 30 years passengers could choose between a wide range of vehicles, including first- and second-class cabs, hand-pulled invalid carts, goat-drawn chaises, landaus and broughams. The first motor cab was licensed in 1908, but horse-drawn carriages persisted until after 1925. Hackney carriages are now licensed by the city council are coloured white and aqua. Fares are also regulated by the council. There are 17 taxi ranks in Hove, including two which operate at night only.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68204", "revid": "9755426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68204", "title": "Extremadura", "text": "Autonomous community of Spain\nExtremadura ( ; ; ; ; Fala: \"Extrema\u00fara\") is a landlocked autonomous community of Spain. Its capital city is M\u00e9rida, and its largest city is Badajoz. Located in the central-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, it is crossed from east to west by the Tagus and Guadiana rivers. The autonomous community is formed by the two largest provinces of Spain: C\u00e1ceres and Badajoz. Extremadura is bordered by Portugal to the west and by the autonomous communities of Castile and Le\u00f3n (north), Castilla\u2013La Mancha (east), and Andalusia (south).\nIt is an important area for wildlife, particularly with the major reserve at Monfrag\u00fce, which was designated a National Park in 2007, and the International Tagus River Natural Park (\"Parque Natural Tajo Internacional\"). The regional government is led by the president of the Regional Government of Extremadura, a post currently held by Mar\u00eda Guardiola of the People's Party.\nThe Day of Extremadura is celebrated on 8 September. It coincides with the Catholic festivity of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The region, featuring an enormous energy surplus and hosting lithium deposits, is at the forefront of Spain's plans for energy transition and decarbonisation.\nGeography.\nPhysical environment.\nExtremadura is contained between and latitude, and and longitude.\nThe area of Extremadura is , making it the fifth largest of the Spanish autonomous communities. It is located in the Southern Plateau (a subdivision of the Spanish Central Plateau).\nThe region is crossed from West to East by two large rivers, the Tagus and the Guadiana, lining up three basic areas from North to South by combining mountain ranges and rivers: the territory spanning from the Sistema Central to the Tagus, the so-called \"Mesopotamia extreme\u00f1a\" in between the Tagus and the Guadiana and the territory from the Guadiana to Sierra Morena. Besides the catchment basins of the Tagus and the Guadiana covering most of the territory by far, fringe areas of the region are drained by the Douro (north) and the Guadalquivir (south). Notable Tagus tributaries include the Ti\u00e9tar and the Alag\u00f3n (rightbank) and the Almonte, Ibor, Salor and the Sever (leftbank). Regarding the Guadiana, important leftbank tributaries include Guadarranque and Ruecas and rightbank tributaries include the Z\u00fajar River and the Matachel.\nThe highest point in Extremadura, the high Calvitero (or El Torre\u00f3n), is located in the Sistema Central, in the northeastern end of the region, bordering with Castile and Le\u00f3n. The main subranges of the Sistema Central in Extremadura are the Sierra de Gata and Sierra de B\u00e9jar.\nThe modest heights of Sierra de las Villuercas (topping at on the Pico de las Villuercas) rise in the \"Mesopotamia extreme\u00f1a\". Other notable ranges include the Sierra de Mont\u00e1nchez and the Sierra de San Pedro, part of the larger Montes de Toledo system.\nThe Sierra Morena\u2014the limit between Extremadura and Andalusia\u2014and the Sierra de Tentud\u00eda (topping at on the Pico Tentud\u00eda) rise in the south.\nThere are four different hydrographic basins:\nClimate.\nThe climate of Extremadura is predominantly hot-summer Mediterranean (\"Csa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with some regions being cold semi-arid (\"BSk\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Extremadura generally presents average annual temperatures somewhat warmer than most of the hinterland of the Iberian Peninsula, featuring nonetheless a north\u2013south gradient. Annual thermal amplitude generally ranges from 16 to 19\u00a0\u00b0C. Average annual temperature is around , while the average annual precipitation stands at around 588 mm. Parts of the Sistema Central presents more than 1,500\u00a0mm while it barely rains 400\u00a0mm in parts of the province of Badajoz. Summers are very hot and dry, with the rain concentrated in the cold months instead, leading to a high degree of water stress during the summer months.\nHistory.\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire, the area that is known today as Autonomous Community of Extremadura was part of Lusitania, a Roman province that included most of current day Portugal (except for the northern area today known as Norte Region) and the central western portion of the current day Spain. M\u00e9rida (now capital of Extremadura) became the capital of the Roman province of Lusitania, and one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire.\nLike the bulk of the Iberian Peninsula, the territory was conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century. As part of the Emirate and later Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, it largely constituted a territorial subdivision (\"k\u016bra\") of the former polities centered on M\u00e9rida. Following the collapse of the Caliphate in the early 11th century during the so-called Fitna of al-Andalus and its ensuing fragmentation into ephemeral statelets (taifas), the bulk of the territory of current day Extremadura became part of the (First) Taifa of Badajoz (\"Ba\u1e6dalyaws\"), centered around the namesake city and founded by Sapur, a saqaliba previously freed by Al-Hakam II.\nConversely, the kingdoms of Le\u00f3n, Castile and Portugal (most notably the first one) made advances in the 11th and 12th centuries across the territory (with for example the successive Leonese conquests of Coria in 1079 and 1142, the Portuguese attempts at expanding across the Guadiana basin in the second half of the 12th century, or the Castilian founding of Plasencia in 1186) not free from setbacks either caused by the Almoravid and Almohad impetus, which also entailed the demise of the first and second taifa of Badajoz in 1094 and 1150, respectively. In the Almohad case, their 1174 offensive removed Leonese control from every fortress south of the Tagus (including C\u00e1ceres). After the Almohad disaster at the 1212 Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, the remaining part of current-day Extremadura under Muslim control fell to the troops led by Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n\u2014Alc\u00e1ntara (1214), C\u00e1ceres (1227\u20131229), M\u00e9rida (1230), Badajoz (1230)\u2014and later to the military orders of Santiago and Alc\u00e1ntara\u2014Trujillo (1232), Medell\u00edn (1234)\u2014on behalf of Ferdinand III of Castile. The last fortresses in the Lower Extremadura were conquered by Christians by 1248.\nBy the late Middle Ages, the territory of the current-day region consisted of mayorazgos of the military orders of Santiago and Alc\u00e1ntara (about half the territory), nobiliary lordships (about a quarter of the territory) and royal demesne towns (the other quarter of the territory).\nIn between the 15th and 16th centuries, the concept of the Leonese and Castilian \"extremaduras\" diluted and the name eventually came to refer to the territory of the current-day region. The territory lacked nonetheless shared government and administration institutions.\nIn between 1570 and 1572, the Crown forcibly relocated about 11,000 \"moriscos\" into the territory as part of the deportation of Granadans that followed the defeat of the Alpujarras revolt. The distribution was somewhat chaotic although some places with an already \"threatening\" population of old moriscos (such as Hornachos, Magacela and Benquerencia) were avoided as resettlement locations for the Granadan moriscos.\nTwo generations later, the expulsion of the moriscos from the region began in 1609, starting with the moriscos of Hornachos, the first expulsion in the Crown of Castile. By September 1610 about two thirds of the moriscos of Extremadura had been already expelled and by 1611 the number amounted to 12,776. Those who avoided the early orders of expulsion abided to reports of being 'good Christians' or claimed a status as 'old moriscos'. At the height of 1612, there were reports of remaining moriscos in Trujillo, M\u00e9rida and Plasencia.\nLocated in the most able path from the Meseta Central to Portugal, the territory suffered greatly due to warfare from the 1640\u20131668 Portuguese Restoration War, characterised not by the movement of large armies but for pillage, skirmishes, raids, and destruction of economic resources and settlements across both sides of the \"Raya\". The growing role of the fortified place of Badajoz (halfway between Lisbon and Madrid), in the wake of the installment of the Captaincy General of Extremadura consolidated the clout of the military in the region.\nBy the late 18th century, the Extremaduran countryside languished, experiencing a deep crisis. There was a diminishing share of land dedicated to crops. The growing cattle sector induced the creation of yet more pastures, adding up to the structural problem stemmed from the extraordinary degree of concentration of land ownership. By the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, the clergy, municipal councils and the royal army mattered more than the lesser role of the entitled nobility.\nRailways were developed in the second half of the 19th century. In September 1863, a passenger train arrived to Badajoz from Elvas, Portugal. It was the first train in the region and the first international service in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1866, the Badajoz\u2013Ciudad Real line was completed, enabling the link with Madrid. The Madrid\u2013Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara line, a new connection passing through the province of C\u00e1ceres, was fully completed in 1881.\nDuring the 1936\u20131939 Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist faction Columna Madrid advanced quickly across the province of Badajoz in August 1936 and left merciless repression and mass casualties behind. Badajoz was the Spanish province where the Francoist repression comparatively took the highest relative toll of victims during the war and the immediate Post-War period; there were around 12,000 executions in the province (out of the 14,000 in the whole region), compared to around 1,600 victims of the Republican repression.\nIn the mid 20th century, the Francoist dictatorship pursued a policy of colonization and agrarian reform in the region to foster the economy, transforming thousands of hectares of dryland crops into irrigated lands, also favouring the erection of 63 new settlements by the Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci\u00f3n (INC). The second half of the 20th century saw a massive rural flight out of the region, both to the industrialised areas of Spain (already started in 1955) as well as to richer European countries (such as Germany, France and Switzerland), both of which notably intensified after 1961, in the wake of the 1959 Stabilization Plan (and in the second case also after bilateral agreements reached with destination countries). The region henceforth was handed a demographic blow in the ensuing years, with the effective expulsion of nearly a 40% of the population, particularly young people.\nA pre-autonomous government entity in Extremadura (the \"Junta Regional de Extremadura\") with jurisdiction over the provinces of Badajoz and C\u00e1ceres was created by means of a 1978 law. The draft of the regional Statute of Autonomy began in 1980, the first step toward Extremadura becoming one of the Spanish autonomous communities. The text passed its final hurdle as it was enshrined as Organic Law in 1982. The first election to the Assembly of Extremadura took place in May 1983.\nGovernment and administration.\nAutonomous.\nThe Statute of Autonomy of Extremadura (enacted in 1983) is the fundamental organic law regulating the autonomous government, and it establishes the institutions through which the autonomous community exerts its powers:\nProvincial.\nThe government body for each of the provinces is the deputation (\"diputaci\u00f3n\"): the Provincial Deputation of Badajoz and the Provincial Deputation of C\u00e1ceres. The members of the plenary of the deputation are indirectly elected from among the municipal councillors based on the results of the municipal elections. In turn, the plenary elects the president of the deputation from among its members.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of Extremadura was 20 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.7% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,100 euros or 67% of the EU27 average in the same year. Extremadura was the community with the second lowest GDP per capita in Spain before Melilla.\nExport goods (mostly consisting of food and semimanufactures) are primarily sent to the European market, but there has been a growing share of non-EU export destinations throughout the 2010s. Balance of trade is generally positive.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 17.3% in 2022, significantly lower than in the previous decade.\nAgriculture.\nWild Black Iberian pigs roam in the area and consume acorns from oak groves. These pigs are caught and used for the cured ham dish \"jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico\". The higher the percentage of acorns eaten by the pigs, the more valuable the ham. For example, \"jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico\" from pigs whose diet consists of 90% acorns or more can be sold for more than twice as much as ham whose pigs ate on average less than 70% acorns. In the US, \"jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico\" directly from Extremadura, with bone, was illegal until around 2005. At that time, enough US restaurants were in demand for the delicacy that Spain decided to export it as boneless, which the US Department of Agriculture's health codes would approve (and continue to do).\n85 Extremaduran municipalities constitute the jurisdiction of the \"Dehesa de Extremadura\" Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), which protects \"jamones\" and \"paletas\" (hind and front pig legs) originated from Iberian pigs and mixed Iberian/Duroc-Jersey pigs.\nAs of 2021, Extremadura produces about 98% of the tobacco produced in Spain, also being the leading European producing region. Tobacco production concentrates in La Vera and Campo Ara\u00f1uelo.\nTomato production (2,122,000 tonnes in 2017) primarily concentrates in the riverbanks of the Guadiana and the Alag\u00f3n-\u00c1rrago.\nA large part of the region falls within the scope of the Ribera del Guadiana PDO, which is further divided in the Ribera Alta, Tierra de Barros, Matanegra, Ribera Baja, Mont\u00e1nchez, and Ca\u00f1amero wine subregions. The PDO protects the wines made of several varieties of black and white grapes.\nAs of 2021, Extremadura is the second largest rice producing region in Spain, after Andalusia. Due to drought and high water demands from rice fields, non-irrigated rice fields have been favoured since the late 2010s. Together with Murcia, Extremadura is a major producer of paprika, primarily destined to the Spanish market. Peppers are grown in the \"Piment\u00f3n de la Vera\" PDO, consisting of the \"comarcas\" of La Vera, Campo Ara\u00f1uelo, Valle del Ambroz and Valle del Alag\u00f3n. The PDO produced 3,860 tonnes in 2020.\nEnergy.\nAbout half the value of the regional industrial production belongs to the energy sector. Extremadura presents a huge energy surplus, producing about four times the energy it consumes. This situation has led to the characterization of Extremadura as a potential \"colony\" of the private electricity companies, which are not taxed in the region and employ a relatively low share of the industrial workforce. The Tagus is dammed in the reservoirs of Alc\u00e1ntara, Torrej\u00f3n and Valdeca\u00f1as whereas the Guadiana is dammed in the reservoirs of C\u00edjara, Puerto Pe\u00f1a, Orellana and Z\u00fajar. Due to the orographic conditions, the Tagus is better suited for hydroelectric use than the Guadiana. As of 2021, the region has around 2,193.84 MW of installed hydroelectric power, primarily controlled by Endesa and Iberdrola, with a lesser role of Grupo Pitarch.\nThe two reactors of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant (which were put in operation in 1981 and 1983, respectively) are jointly operated by Endesa, Iberdrola and Naturgy. They generate a power of 1,048.43 MW and 1,044.45 MW.\nThe region is at the forefront of Spain's plans for energy transition and a decarbonisation, thanks to the installation of large solar power plants and the granting of lithium mining licenses. Such prospects sparked criticism and concern regarding how to avoid a \"third energy colonisation\" after those of the construction of reservoirs for hydroelectric use and the building of nuclear power plants. Two of the largest photovoltaic power plants in Europe are located in the region: Francisco Pizarro (590 MW) in Torrecillas de la Tiesa and N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa (500 MW) in Usagre; both are operated by Iberdrola, which is developing another 6 photovoltaic plants collectively amounting to 1,300 MW. The first solar thermal power plant in the region, Alvarado I, (50 MW) opened in 2009.\nA project to build a lithium-ion battery factory participated by Envision in Navalmoral de la Mata was announced in June 2022.\nTransport.\nAir.\nBadajoz Airport is the only airport in the Extremadura region which provides direct routes to Madrid, Barcelona, Gran Canaria and Palma de Mallorca which are operated by Iberia. Generally, residents in the region would also use other nearby airports such as Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport, Seville Airport, and Humberto Delgado Airport in the nearby border of Portugal.\nPopulation.\nAs of January 1, 2012, the population of Extremadura is 1,109,367 inhabitants, representing 2.36% of the Spanish population (46,745,807).\nThe population density is very low\u2014\u2014compared to Spain as a whole.\nThe urban network is dominated by three municipalities between 50,000 and 200,000 inhabitants (Badajoz, C\u00e1ceres and M\u00e9rida), followed by Plasencia, the Don Benito-Villanueva de la Serena conurbation and Almendralejo. Other municipalities with a population above 10,000 inhabitants include Zafra, Montijo, Villafranca de los Barros, Navalmoral de la Mata and Coria.\nThe most populous province is that of Badajoz, with a population of 691,715 and a population density of . With an area of , it is the largest province in Spain. 413,766 people live in the province of C\u00e1ceres at a density of , having an area of , making it the largest province in Spain after Badajoz.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nForeign.\nAs of 2022, The largest immigrant community is Moroccan with 9,218 people, followed by Romanian with 4,324. There are 98 Icelanders and 6 Liechtensteiners. Brazilians account for 1,676 and Colombians make up 1,409. Of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, the largest community is Senegalese with 88 people. Of those from Asia, the Chinese make up the largest group with 631 people. There are also 3,492 Portuguese neighbours living within the region..\nHistorical.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Extremaduran population, according to the 1591 census of the provinces of the Kingdom of Castile, was around 540,000 people, making up 8% of the total population of Spain. No other census was performed until 1717, when 326,358 people were counted as living in Extremadura.\nFrom this period, the population grew steadily until the 1960s (1,379,072 people in 1960). After 1960, emigration to more prosperous regions of Spain and Europe drained the population.\nAdministrative divisions.\nExtremadura is divided into 383 municipalities. 164 are part of the Province of Badajoz and the other 219 are part of the Province of C\u00e1ceres.\nThere are also traditional comarcas in Extremadura, like Las Villuercas and Las Hurdes, but these do not have much official recognition.\nLanguages.\nThe only official language is Spanish (whose local dialects are collectively called Cast\u00fao), but other languages and dialects are also spoken. The Fala, a Galician-Portuguese language, is a specially protected language and is spoken in the valley of J\u00e1lama. The Extremaduran language, the collective name for a group of vernacular dialects related to Leonese is endangered. Local variants of Portuguese are native to Cedillo and Herrera de Alc\u00e1ntara. Portuguese has also been accounted to be spoken as well by some people (mainly those born before the 1940s) in Olivenza.\nReported phonological distinctive features of the Spanish dialectal variants spoken in the region include instances of (in some areas of the province of Badajoz), loss of intervocalic /d/, j and word-initial h aspiration, r \u2192 l substitution, and .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is often stated as \"DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein\", although this is not its original meaning. It was first stated by Francis Crick in 1957, then published in 1958:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Central Dogma. This states that once \"information\" has passed into protein \"it cannot get out again.\" In more detail, the transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information here means the \"precise\" determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein.\nHe re-stated it in a \"Nature\" paper published in 1970: \"The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.\"\nA second version of the central dogma is popular but incorrect. This is the simplistic DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein pathway published by James Watson in the first edition of \"The Molecular Biology of the Gene\" (1965). Watson's version differs from Crick's because Watson describes a two-step (DNA \u2192 RNA / RNA \u2192 protein) process as the central dogma. While the dogma as originally stated by Crick remains valid today, Watson's version does not.\nBiological sequence information.\nThe biopolymers that comprise DNA, RNA, and (poly)peptides are linear heteropolymers (i.e.: each monomer is connected to at most two other monomers). The sequences of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information from one molecule to another are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence is used as a template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence. When DNA is transcribed to RNA, its complement is paired to it. DNA codes are transferred to RNA codes in a complementary fashion. The encoding of proteins is done in groups of three, known as codons. The standard codon table applies for humans and mammals, but some other lifeforms (including human mitochondria) use different translations.\nGeneral transfers of biological sequential information.\nDNA replications.\nIn the sense that DNA replication must occur if genetic material is to be provided for the progeny of any cell, whether somatic or reproductive, the copying from DNA to DNA arguably is the fundamental step in information transfer. A complex group of proteins called the replisome performs the replication of the information from the parent strand to the complementary daughter strand.\nTranscription.\nTranscription is the process by which the information contained in a section of DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells, the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.\nTranslation.\nThe mature mRNA finds its way to a ribosome, where it gets translated. In prokaryotic cells, which have no nuclear compartment, the processes of transcription and translation may be linked together without clear separation. In eukaryotic cells, the site of transcription (the cell nucleus) is usually separated from the site of translation (the cytoplasm), so the mRNA must be transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it can be bound by ribosomes. The ribosome reads the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine\u2212uracil\u2212guanine), or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribosome binding site. Complexes of initiation factors and elongation factors bring aminoacylated transfer RNAs (tRNAs) into the ribosome-mRNA complex, matching the codon in the mRNA to the anti-codon on the tRNA. Each tRNA bears the appropriate amino acid residue to add to the polypeptide chain being synthesised. As the amino acids get linked into the growing peptide chain, the chain begins folding into the correct conformation. Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, or UAG triplet.\nThe mRNA does not contain all the information for specifying the nature of the mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. For one thing, the correct folding process is complex and vitally important. For most proteins it requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product. Some proteins then excise internal segments from their own peptide chains, splicing the free ends that border the gap; in such processes the inside \"discarded\" sections are called inteins. Other proteins must be split into multiple sections without splicing. Some polypeptide chains need to be cross-linked, and others must be attached to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.\nAdditional transfers of biological sequential information.\nReverse transcription.\nReverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). This is known to occur in the case of retroviruses, such as HIV, as well as in eukaryotes, in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis. It is the process by which genetic information from RNA gets transcribed into new DNA. The family of enzymes involved in this process is called Reverse Transcriptase.\nRNA replication.\nRNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The enzymes that copy RNA to new RNA, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, are also found in many eukaryotes, where they are involved in RNA silencing.\nRNA editing, in which an RNA sequence is altered by a complex of proteins and a \"guide RNA\", could also be seen as an RNA-to-RNA transfer.\nActivities unrelated to the central dogma.\nThe central dogma of molecular biology states that, once sequential information has passed from nucleic acid to protein, it cannot flow back from protein to nucleic acid. Some people believe that the following activities conflict with the central dogma.\nPost-translational modification.\nAfter protein amino-acid sequences have been translated from nucleic acid chains, they can be edited by appropriate enzymes. This is a form of protein affecting protein sequence, not protein transferring information to nucleic acid.\nNonribosomal peptide synthesis.\nSome proteins are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases, which can be big protein complexes, each specializing in synthesizing only one type of peptide. Nonribosomal peptides often have cyclic or branched structures and can contain non-proteinogenic amino acids \u2013 both of these factors differentiate them from ribosome synthesized proteins. An example of nonribosomal peptides are some of the antibiotics.\nInteins.\nAn intein is a \"parasitic\" segment of a protein that is able to excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the ribosome and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond in such a manner that the main protein \"backbone\" does not fall apart. This is a case of a protein changing its own primary sequence from the sequence originally encoded by the DNA of a gene. Additionally, most inteins contain a homing endonuclease or HEG domain, which is capable of finding a copy of the parent gene that does not include the intein nucleotide sequence. On contact with the intein-free copy, the HEG domain initiates the DNA double-stranded break repair mechanism. This process causes the intein sequence to be copied from the original source gene to the intein-free gene. This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.\nPrions.\nPrions are proteins of particular amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein with the same amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding, it changes function. In turn, it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi, this change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Protein.\nSome scientists such as Alain E. Bussard and Eugene Koonin have argued that prion-mediated inheritance violates the central dogma of molecular biology. However, Rosalind Ridley in \"Molecular Pathology of the Prions\" (2001) has written that \"The prion hypothesis is not heretical to the central dogma of molecular biology\u2014that the information necessary to manufacture proteins is encoded in the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acid\u2014because it does not claim that proteins replicate. Rather, it claims that there is a source of information within protein molecules that contributes to their biological function, and that this information can be passed on to other molecules.\"\nUse of the term \"dogma\".\nIn his autobiography, \"\", Crick wrote about his choice of the word \"dogma\" and some of the problems it caused him:\n\"I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, the use of the word dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief \"that cannot be doubted\". I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that \"all\" religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support.\"\nSimilarly, Horace Freeland Judson records in \"The Eighth Day of Creation\":\n\"My mind was, that a dogma was an idea for which there was \"no reasonable evidence\". You see?!\" And Crick gave a roar of delight. \"I just didn't \"know\" what dogma \"meant\". And I could just as well have called it the 'Central Hypothesis,' or \u2014 you know. Which is what I meant to say. Dogma was just a catch phrase.\"\nComparison with the Weismann barrier.\nThe Weismann barrier, proposed by August Weismann in 1892, distinguishes between the \"immortal\" germ cell lineages (the germ plasm) which produce gametes and the \"disposable\" somatic cells. Hereditary information moves only from germline cells to somatic cells (that is, somatic mutations are not inherited). This, before the discovery of the role or structure of DNA, does not predict the central dogma, but does anticipate its gene-centric view of life, albeit in non-molecular terms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "68208", "revid": "4788526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68208", "title": "Ayrshire", "text": "Ayrshire (, ) is an historic county and registration county, in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde. The lieutenancy area of Ayrshire and Arran covers the entirety of the historic county as well as the island of Arran, formerly part of the historic county of Buteshire. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine and it borders the counties of Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire to the north-east, Dumfriesshire to the south-east, and Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire to the south. Like many other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800.\nThe electoral and valuation area named Ayrshire covers the three council areas of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire, therefore covering the whole historic county of Ayrshire but also including the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae from the historic county of Buteshire. The three council areas together also form the \"Ayrshire and Arran\" lieutenancy area.\nThe largest settlement in Ayrshire by population is Kilmarnock, closely followed by Ayr, the county town.\nGeography.\nAyrshire is roughly crescent-shaped and is a predominantly flat county with areas of low hills; it forms part of the Southern Uplands geographic region of Scotland. The north of the county contains the main towns and bulk of the population. East of Largs can be found the Renfrewshire Heights, which continue south to the hill-country around Blae Loch.\nSouthern Ayrshire shares with the Galloway counties some rugged hill country known as the Galloway Hills. These hills lie to the west of the A713 (Ayr to Castle Douglas road) and they run south from the Loch Doon area almost to the Solway Firth. To the east of this route through the hills lie the Carsphairn and Scaur Hills which lie to the south east of Dalmellington and south of New Cumnock. Glen Afton runs deep into these hills.\nAyrshire is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Scotland. Potatoes are grown in fields near the coast, using seaweed-based fertiliser, and in addition the region produces pork products, other root vegetables, and cattle (see below); and summer berries such as strawberries are grown abundantly.\nA number of small islands in the Firth of Clyde are part of Ayrshire, the chief of these being Horse Isle, Lady Isle and Ailsa Craig.\nRivers.\nThe main rivers flowing to the Clyde coast are, from north to south, the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nThe area that today forms Ayrshire was part of the area south of the Antonine Wall which was briefly occupied by the Romans during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius (see: Roman Britain#Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland). It was inhabited by the Damnonii, who are presumed to have been Britons. Later, it formed part of the British Kingdom of Strathclyde, which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Scotland during the 11th century. In 1263, the Scots successfully drove off the Norwegian \"leidang\"-army in a skirmish known as the Battle of Largs.\nA notable historic building in Ayrshire is Turnberry Castle, which dates from the 13th century or earlier, and which may have been the birthplace of Robert the Bruce.\nThe historic shire or sheriffdom of Ayr was divided into three districts or \"bailieries\" which later made up the county of Ayrshire. The three districts were:\nThe area used to be heavily industrialised, with steel making, coal mining and in Kilmarnock numerous examples of production-line manufacturing, most famously Johnnie Walker whisky. In more recent history, Digital Equipment had a large manufacturing plant near Ayr from about 1976 until the company was taken over by Compaq in 1998. Some supplier companies grew up to service this site and the more distant IBM plant at Greenock in Renfrewshire. Scotland's aviation industry has long been based in and around Prestwick and its international airport, and although aircraft manufacture ceased at the former British Aerospace plant in 1998, a significant number of aviation companies are still based on the Prestwick site. However, unemployment in the region (excluding the more rural South Ayrshire) is above the national average.\nThroughout the 17th century, huge numbers of people from Ayrshire moved to Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, as part of the Plantation of Ulster, many of them with surnames such as Burns, Hamilton, Morrow, Stewart, Flanagan, Kennedy and Cunningham. Today, the Ulster Scots dialect is largely an offshoot of the version of Lowland Scots spoken in Ayrshire. The Ulster Scots dialect is still widely spoken throughout County Antrim and in parts of County Down and County Londonderry, as well as still being widely spoken in West T\u00edr Eoghain and parts of County Donegal (chiefly East Donegal and Inishowen).\nLocal government.\nCommissioners of Supply were created in 1667 for each shire, and formed the main administrative body for the area until county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries of many of Scotland's counties; in the case of Ayrshire the two parishes of Beith and Dunlop, which had both straddled Ayrshire and Renfrewshire, were brought entirely within Ayrshire. The burghs of Ayr and Kilmarnock were both excluded from the area controlled by the county council when it was created in 1890, being deemed capable of running their own services.\nIn 1930 the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 was implemented. This brought Ayr and Kilmarnock under the control of the county council, and re-designated all burghs as either large burghs or small burghs. Ayr and Kilmarnock were both classed as large burghs, allowing them to retain control of many functions, whilst the county's other burghs were all classed as small burghs, ceding many functions to the county council. The 1929 act also abolished the parish councils. In Ayrshire in excess of 30 parishes were consolidated into ten district councils. The District Councils were Ayr, Cumnock, Dalmellington, Girvan, Irvine, Kilbirnie, Kilmarnock, Maybole, Troon and Saltcoats. Ayrshire County Council was based at County Buildings in Wellington Square in Ayr.\nIn May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions were transferred to Strathclyde Regional Council. The county area was divided between four new districts within the two-tier Strathclyde region: Cumnock and Doon Valley, Cunninghame, Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Kyle and Carrick. The Cunninghame district included the Isle of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae, which had until then been administered as part of the County of Bute. For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Ayrshire was made lord-lieutenant for the combined area of the four districts when the reforms came into effect in 1975, with the lieutenancy area being renamed Ayrshire and Arran in 1996.\nIn 1996 the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the unitary council areas of East Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock &amp; Loudoun District and Cumnock &amp; Doon Valley District), North Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and South Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).\nThe boundaries of the historic county of Ayrshire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.\nParliamentary constituencies.\nThere was an Ayrshire constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 until 1868, when the constituency was divided into Ayrshire North and Ayrshire South.\nDuring the whole of the 1708 to 1868 period, and until 1950, the burghs of Ayr and Irvine were parliamentary burghs, represented as components of Ayr Burghs. In 1832 Kilmarnock became a parliamentary burgh, to be represented as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs until 1918. Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs were districts of burghs, and quite different in character from later Ayr and Kilmarnock constituencies.\nFrom 1918 to 1983 Ayrshire and Buteshire were treated as if a single area for purposes of parliamentary representation, with their combined area being divided into different constituencies at different times. Scottish local government counties were abolished in 1975, in favour of regions and districts, but the next reform of constituency boundaries was not until 1983.\nConstituencies covering Ayrshire may be listed by periods as below, but the story is somewhat more complicated than the lists may imply: until 1918, Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs included burghs lying outside both Ayrshire and Buteshire; a particular constituency name may represent different boundaries in different periods; in 1974, there were boundary changes without the creation of any new constituency names.\nTransport.\nA number of railway lines connect the towns of northern Ayrshire to each other and also to Glasgow, as well as south to Stranraer and south-east to Dumfries.\nFerries link Ayrshire to the islands of Arran and Great Cumbrae in Buteshire.\nGlasgow Prestwick International Airport, serving Glasgow and the west of Scotland more generally, is located away from Glasgow in Ayrshire; it provides various passenger flights to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Poland. The name \"Glasgow\" was added in front of Prestwick as per American military airport naming conventions, as the airport was in the past oft-used as a stopover by US military personnel on their way to and from military bases in Germany. Moreover, it is known in rock history as the only place in Britain visited by Elvis Presley, on his way home from army service in Germany in 1960.\nTowns and villages in Ayrshire.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlaces of interest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPeople from Ayrshire.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was voted best DJ in the world by \"DJ Mag\" in 1995.\nEducation.\nO'Riordan was educated at Highgate Wood Secondary School, a state school in Highgate Wood in North London and at University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead (also in North London), followed by the London School of Economics (LSE), where he earned a degree in law. During his time at university, O'Riordan started hosting small parties where he was the DJ and earned the nickname \"Judge Jules\" due to his field of study.\nDJ career and radio shows.\nO'Riordan became a professional DJ in 1987. As a young DJ he became known for his interpretation of beat at the Club Valentino venue in Colchester, Essex, drawing capacity attendance. He was quickly hired by the then-pirate radio station Kiss.\nHe began his show with Radio 1 in October 1997. When he first arrived, the show went out between 17:00 and 19:00 on Saturday evenings, ahead of Danny Rampling's show. From 31 July 2004, after the departure of Seb Fontaine from the station, his show was moved to 19:00 \u2013 21:00 on Saturday nights, ahead of Tim Westwood. The show was advertised as \"The UK's Saturday Warmup\", or \"The Weekend Warm-Up\". The show kept this slot until September 2007.\nDuring those years, his music policy ranged from playing commercial to underground tracks, and much in between. The first segment of the show was taken by the Cut-Up Boys, who did a five or ten-minute mix featuring several dance tracks and a cappella tracks playing simultaneously. The rest of the first hour was generally taken up by house music and the second hour featured trance music, although if they were broadcasting the show outside the studio, the music might vary.\nIn September 2007, the show was moved to 01:00 \u2013 03:00 on Saturday mornings. Because of his DJ commitments on Friday evenings, it was now pre-recorded instead of being broadcast live. From September 2008, the show was moved forward to 23:00 \u2013 01:00 on Friday evening. The reason for the move was the departure of Dave Pearce, whose Dance Anthems show was moved to BBC Radio 6 Music. His show attracted a wide audience from around the world due to Radio 1's online presence and the Sirius Satellite Radio network in the United States and Canada. Through the radio show, he was responsible for launching many popular trance tunes and acts in the UK, and was a pioneer for commercial contemporary dance music. Many people send their unreleased tracks to him: according to his own website, during the time when his show was being produced, he received between 250 and 300 promos per week. His Radio 1 show was produced by independent production company Somethin' Else.\nO'Riordan was also a substitute presenter for the long-running Radio 1 weekend show \"The Essential Mix\", which included hosting the Benga mix in 2008. He presented his last show on Radio 1 on 30 March 2012.\nHe also has an internationally syndicated radio show called \"The Global Warm Up\" (also produced by Somethin' Else) which can be heard across the US, Russia, Europe (including RT\u00c9 2fm) and the Middle East or via podcast. As of May 2019, there have been 792 episodes of the Global Warm Up.\nAlongside his full-time job as an entertainment lawyer, in 2019, O'Riordan still tours frequently as a DJ and continues to play at notable venues such as Zero Gravity Dubai and Ministry of Sound, and at events such as Luminosity Beach Festival, Creamfields and Dreamstate USA.\nJudge Jules: Live.\nIn March 2019, O'Riordan announced his 'Judge Jules: Live' project which features O'Riordan playing dance classics alongside a 10-piece jazz band and two vocalists. The show debuted at The Plug in Sheffield on Saturday 22 March, with four further dates announced in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. The live project differs heavily from other comparable shows because the tracks are all re-written for the band to play from the ground up in a different style, specifically for this show.\nJournalism.\nO'Riordan was a contributor to the UK-based black music magazine \"Soul Underground\" between 1988 and 1990. He contributed both as 'Judge Jules' and as 'The Dark Knight', using the anonymity of this identity to provide inside information on the music scene.\nLegal work.\nO'Riordan was an Associate in the Music Group at the law firm Sheridans from 2012 to 2018. In March 2018, he joined Sound Advice LLP as an entertainment lawyer. Jules' legal expertise centres around the entertainment areas in which he has over 30 years experience.\nIn 2015, O'Riordan wrote a series of six articles for the 'Industry Insider' section of \"Mixmag\" which outlined basic legal advice for a number of music industry topics, including management, publishing and recording contracts.\nJudgement Ibiza.\nO'Riordan had a regular club night in Ibiza that started out as Judgement Sundays at Eden night club; in 2013 this became Judgement Fridays. In 2014, Eden nightclub was rebranded \"Gatecrasher\" and Judgement Fridays moved over the road to Es Paradis and combined with the Fiesta del Agua (water party). In 2015, the \"Gatecrasher\" brand had disappeared from Eden and the nightclub was re-launched with a new logo; this also saw the return of O'Riordan's night, now branded \"Judgement\". Previously advertised as \"San Antonio's busiest night\" it was later advertised as \"San Antonio's most legendary night\". The night ran for most of the summer season, generally starting in June and running through mid September, and as well as DJing at this night he also promoted it.\nIn 2016, Judgement returned to Eden for its 16th season, taking place every Friday from June to September. In 2017, Judgement took a break from Ibiza, but O'Riordan still played at various events including Acid 88/89 at Sankeys Ibiza. Judgement returned to Ibiza in September 2018 for a one-off reunion show at Eden featuring Marco V alongside O'Riordan. In 2019 O'Riordan returned once again to Judgement for a one-off workers' reunion in October also at Eden, alongside Dermot C, Dirty Rotten DJs and Tristan Ingram and Vicky Devine.\nRecorded works.\nO'Riordan's wife provided vocals for the group Angelic, consisting of O'Riordan and Darren Tate, which had two hits, \"It's My Turn\" in 2000 and \"Can't Keep Me Silent\" in 2001. In 2005, she appeared on the track \"Without Love\", which was by O'Riordan himself. This track was eventually released, with remixes, on the Maelstrom Records label in 2007. O'Riordan has also released two albums via this label, \"Proven Worldwide\" in 2006 and \"Bring The Noise\" in 2009. In 2012, O'Riordan signed with Paul Van Dyk's label VANDIT Records, releasing \"The Attack\" and \"Give Me A Reason\". Elsewhere, he has collaborated several times with Paul Masterson under the Hi-Gate name.\nIn 2016, O'Riordan launched his record label, Judgement Recordings. The label serves as an outlet for his own original productions, as well as a platform for O'Riordan to push new and upcoming talent. The first release was 'Burn in the Sun' with Richard Bedford in June 2016. In December 2016, the label released a remixed edition of Hi-Gate's 'Caned &amp; Unable' and 'I Can Hear Voices'.\nIn August 2017, O'Riordan released an original Loopmasters sample pack called \"Judge Jules \u2013 Essential Big Room House\".\nInvolvement in 'Classical Dance' events.\nO'Riordan has been heavily involved in at least ten of the popular \"classical\" dance events, involving orchestras playing dance music. In March 2017, he helped curate the Club Class Classical show. In June 2017, he played at the Cream Classical show. He played at the Colours Classical events in September 2017 and March 2018. He played the Gatecrasher Classical events in October 2017, June 2018, August 2018 and February 2019. In January 2019, he played at and helped curate the Ministry of Sound Classical event.\nTV appearances.\nO'Riordan appeared on the \"Richard &amp; Judy\" chat show in 2003 with his counterpart Paul Masterson and singer/DJ Boy George, promoting their Hi-Gate album, on which Boy George made a cameo singing contribution.\nO'Riordan appeared on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" show (2000) with Masterson, to perform the single \"Pitchin'\", from their album \"Hi-Gate\". O'Riordan also appeared in a UK series called \"Superstar DJs\", and a series called \"Ibiza Uncovered\". He had his own short series \"Spin Cities\" on Play UK.\nO'Riordan appeared on Channel Five's \"Fifth Gear\" in 2005 and 2009. In 2005 he was filmed while at the Global Gathering dance music festival where he was interviewed in a Bentley, and again by the same presenter in 2009 whilst being chauffeured in an Aston Martin to a gig in Bournemouth. He also appeared on Channel Five's \"The Gadget Show\", reviewing DJ equipment including a remote handheld DJing device known as a \"pacemaker\".\nIn 2019 he appeared in Series 4 of the BBC's Celebrity MasterChef competition. He exited at the fourth round of the show.\nCharity work.\nIn 2009 O'Riordan started supporting the UK charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, joining the Breakthrough Running Club as the club DJ. In 2022, O'Riordan played a show at The Pioneer Club in St Albans in aid of Herts Young Homeless.\nClothing range.\nIn 2008 O'Riordan worked with designers to produce his own clothing range 'Heroes and Villains'.\nProduction aliases.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPersonal life.\nHe has lived in North London for the majority of his life, now settled in the Hampstead area with his wife Amanda, their son Jake and daughter Phoebe. Jules has a villa in Ibiza and during the summer months he and his family split their time between there and North London. His father, Shaun O'Riordan, starred as Eddie Larkin in the sitcom \"The Larkins\", which aired on British television between 1958 and 1960. Jules is the nephew of celebrity chef Rick Stein. His wife, Amanda, is the cousin of techno DJ Tommy Four Seven.\nHis net worth was estimated to be US$42 million as of 2023, making him one of the Top 30 highest net worth DJ/producers in the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(previously called Helix Code and originally named International Gnome Support) was an American company that developed, sold and supported application software for Linux and Unix based on the GNOME platform. It was founded by Miguel de Icaza and Nat Friedman in 1999 and was bought by Novell in 2003. Novell continued to develop Ximian's original products, while adding support for its own GroupWise and ZENworks software.\nHistory.\nMiguel de Icaza had a job interview at Microsoft in 1997 shortly before he started the GNOME project. At Microsoft he met Nat Friedman, who worked there as an intern. Afterwards they became good friends. In April 1999 Friedman came up with the idea to create a company to work on GNOME. The company was founded on 19 October 1999 as International GNOME Support, but its name was changed to Helix Code later. Because that name could not be trademarked the name was changed to Ximian on 10 January 2001.\nNat Friedman was the CEO of Ximian from its founding to 2001 when Ximian brought in David Patrick as CEO and President. Friedman became Vice President of Product Management. The company's business model was based on providing a mix of free and proprietary software, solutions and services. Ximian was a founding member of the GNOME Foundation and the Desktop Linux Consortium.\nXimian was acquired by Novell on 4 August 2003 to improve its offerings of Linux for the enterprise. Novell was in turn acquired by The Attachmate Group on 27 April 2011. In May 2011 The Attachmate Group laid off all its US staff working on Mono, which included De Icaza. He and Friedman then founded Xamarin on 16 May 2011, a new company to continue the development of Mono. On 24 February 2016, Microsoft announced that they had signed an agreement to acquire Xamarin.\nProducts.\nXimian both developed new products and \"polished\" existing free software projects to provide more consistent operation. These projects were packaged into its Ximian Desktop product \u2014 a range of integrated applications intended to provide all the tools a typical business user might require. So-called \"Ximianized\" versions of GNOME, OpenOffice.org, and Gaim were released, along with the following completely new products:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68227", "revid": "20935787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68227", "title": "OpenOffice.org", "text": "Office suite software\nOpenOffice.org was an open-source office productivity software suite. It originated from the proprietary StarOffice, developed by Star Division, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999. Sun open-sourced the software in July 2000 as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, and released OpenOffice.org version 1.0 on 1 May 2002.\nFollowing Sun\u2019s acquisition by Oracle Corporation, development of OpenOffice.org slowed and eventually ended. In 2011, Oracle donated the project to the Apache Software Foundation, which continues it as Apache OpenOffice, although that project has been largely dormant since 2015. A more actively developed fork, LibreOffice, was created in 2010 by members of the OpenOffice.org community.\nOpenOffice included applications for word processing (Writer), spreadsheets (Calc), presentations (Impress), vector graphics (Draw), database management (Base), and formula editing (Math). Its default file format was the OpenDocument Format (ODF), which it originated. It could also read a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office. OpenOffice.org was primarily developed for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Solaris, and later for Mac OS X, with ports to other operating systems. It was distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPL); early versions were also available under the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL).\nHistory.\nOpenOffice.org originated from StarOffice, a proprietary office productivity software suite developed by German company Star Division beginning in 1985. In August 1999, Star Division was acquired by Sun Microsystems for US$ (equivalent to US$million in 2024), reportedly because the acquisition was less expensive than licensing Microsoft Office for Sun's 42,000 employees.\nOn 19 July 2000, at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, Sun announced that it would release the StarOffice source code to encourage the development of a free and open-source office suite. The project, officially named OpenOffice.org, with the \".org\" added to avoid trademark conflicts, officially released its source code on 13 October 2000. The first public preview, Milestone Build 638c, followed in October 2001 and quickly surpassed one million downloads. OpenOffice.org 1.0 was officially released on 1 May 2002.\nOpenOffice.org became the default office suite on many Linux distributions and quickly emerged as a significant competitor to Microsoft Office, reportedly achieving 14% penetration in the large enterprise market by 2004. Sun designed the suite\u2019s OpenOffice.org XML file format, compressed in a ZIP archive, for easier data interchange and machine processing, intending it to replace proprietary binary formats. In 2002, Sun submitted the format to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards leading to the creation of the OpenDocument file format standard in 2005, which was ratified as ISO/IEC 26300 in 2006. OpenDocument became OpenOffice's default format beginning with version 2.0 and other organizations would adopt the OpenDocument format.\nDevelopment of OpenOffice.org was led by Sun, which continued to use the codebase as the upstream source for StarOffice, which it continued to sell commercially. Sun also licensed the codebase to third parties, including IBM, which used it as the foundation for IBM Lotus Symphony (originally IBM Workplace). This dual role led to criticism that Sun prioritized commercial interests over community collaboration. For example, building OpenOffice.org on many Linux distributions proved difficult, prompting the creation of projects like ooo-build to improve compatibility and incorporate unaccepted community patches. Sun was also criticized for being slow to accept outside contributions and controversially required contributors to sign a Contributor Agreement granting joint ownership of submitted code, enabling the company to continue selling proprietary versions of the software.\nFollowing Sun\u2019s acquisition by Oracle Corporation in January 2010, development continued under the a new brand, Oracle Open Office. However, Oracle significantly reduced the number of developers assigned to the project, and its commitment to the project was widely questioned. In September 2010, the majority of community OpenOffice contributors left the project, and formed The Document Foundation (TDF), citing concerns over Oracle\u2019s management of the project and its broader approach to open-source software. TDF launched a fork called LibreOffice in January 2011, which was quickly adopted by most Linux distributions.\nIn April 2011, Oracle ceased development of OpenOffice and laid off the remaining team. While Oracle did not publicly state its reasons, speculation ranged from the project's declining community support to commercial considerations. In June 2011, Oracle donated the OpenOffice.org trademarks and codebase to the Apache Software Foundation. The code was relicensed under the Apache License at the request of IBM, which existing contractual interests in the code and preferred a permissive license. This donation became the foundation for the ongoing Apache OpenOffice project.\nGovernance.\nDuring Sun's sponsorship, the OpenOffice.org project was governed by the \"Community Council\", comprising OpenOffice.org community members. The Community Council suggested project goals and coordinated with producers of derivatives on long-term development planning issues.\nBoth Sun and Oracle are claimed to have made decisions without consulting the Council or in contravention to the council's recommendations, leading to the majority of outside developers leaving for LibreOffice. Oracle demanded in October 2010 that all Council members involved with the Document Foundation step down, leaving the Community Council composed only of Oracle employees.\nNaming.\nAlthough the project was commonly called \"OpenOffice\", the official name was \"OpenOffice.org\" because \"OpenOffice\" was already a registered trademark in the Benelux region, owned by the company Open Office Automatisering since 1999. A similar trademark conflict in Brazil led to the suite being distributed there as \"BrOffice.org\" starting in 2004. The name was also adopted by a supporting nonprofit organization founded in 2006. The BrOffice.org nonprofit transitioned to supporting LibreOffice in December 2010.\nFeatures.\nOpenOffice.org 1.0 was launched under the following mission statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The mission of OpenOffice.org is to create, as a community, the leading international office suite that will run on all major platforms and provide access to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and an XML-based file format.\nComponents.\nThe suite contained no personal information manager, email client or calendar application analogous to Microsoft Outlook, despite one having been present in StarOffice 5.2. Such functionality was frequently requested. The OpenOffice.org Groupware project, intended to replace Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server, spun off in 2003 as OpenGroupware.org, which is now SOGo. The project considered bundling Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Lightning for OpenOffice.org 3.0.\nSupported operating systems.\nThe last version, 3.4 Beta 1, was available for IA-32 versions of Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later, Linux (IA-32 and x64), Solaris and Mac OS X 10.4 or later, and the SPARC version of Solaris.\nThe latest versions of OpenOffice.org on other operating systems were:\nFonts.\nOpenOffice.org included OpenSymbol, DejaVu, the Liberation fonts (from 2.4) and the Gentium fonts (from 3.2). Versions up to 2.3 included the Bitstream Vera fonts. OpenOffice.org also used the default fonts of the running operating system.\n\"Fontwork\" is a feature that allows users to create stylized text with special effects differing from ordinary text with the added features of gradient colour fills, shaping, letter height, and character spacing. It is similar to WordArt used by Microsoft Word. When OpenOffice.org saved documents in Microsoft Office file format, all Fontwork was converted into WordArt.\nExtensions.\nFrom version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org supported third-party extensions. As of April 2011, the OpenOffice Extension Repository listed more than 650 extensions. Another list was maintained by the Free Software Foundation.\nOpenOffice Basic.\nOpenOffice.org included OpenOffice Basic, a programming language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). OpenOffice Basic was available in Writer, Calc and Base. OpenOffice.org also had some Microsoft VBA macro support.\nConnectivity.\nOpenOffice.org could interact with databases (local or remote) using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or SDBC (StarOffice Database Connectivity).\nFile formats.\nFrom Version 2.0 onward, OpenOffice.org used ISO/IEC 26300:2006 OpenDocument as its native format. Versions 2.0\u20132.3.0 default to the ODF 1.0 file format; versions 2.3.1\u20132.4.3 default to ODF 1.1; versions 3.0 onward default to ODF 1.2.\nOpenOffice.org 1 used OpenOffice.org XML as its native format. This was contributed to OASIS and OpenDocument was developed from it.\nOpenOffice.org also claimed support for the following formats:\nDevelopment.\nOpenOffice.org converted all external formats to and from an internal XML representation.\nThe OpenOffice.org API was based on a component technology known as Universal Network Objects (UNO). It consisted of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA-like interface description language.\nNative desktop integration.\nOpenOffice.org 1.0 was criticized for not having the look and feel of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.org used native widget toolkit, icons, and font-rendering libraries on GNOME, KDE and Windows.\nThe issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X. Early versions of OpenOffice.org required the installation of X11.app or XDarwin (though the NeoOffice port supplied a native interface). Versions since 3.0 ran natively using Apple's Aqua GUI.\nUse of Java.\nAlthough originally written in C++, OpenOffice.org became increasingly reliant on the Java Runtime Environment, even including a bundled JVM. OpenOffice.org was criticized by the Free Software Foundation for its increasing dependency on Java, which was not free software.\nThe issue came to the fore in May 2005, when Richard Stallman appeared to call for a fork of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website. OpenOffice.org adopted a development guideline that future versions of OpenOffice.org would run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.org 2.0 from using free-software Java implementations.\nOn 13 November 2006, Sun committed to releasing Java under the GNU General Public License and had released a free software Java, OpenJDK, by May 2007.\nSecurity.\nIn 2006, Lt. Col. Eric Filiol of the Laboratoire de Virologie et de Cryptologie de l'ESAT demonstrated security weaknesses, in particular within macros. In 2006, Kaspersky Lab demonstrated a proof of concept virus, \"Stardust\", for OpenOffice.org. This showed OpenOffice.org viruses are possible, but there is no known virus \"in the wild\".\nAs of October 2011, Secunia reported no known unpatched security flaws for the software. A vulnerability in the inherited OpenOffice.org codebase was found and fixed in LibreOffice in October 2011 and Apache OpenOffice in May 2012.\nVersion history.\nOpenOffice.org 1.\nThe source code for OpenOffice.org was released on 13 October 2000. The first public preview, known as milestone build 638c, was made available in October 2001. The first stable release, OpenOffice.org 1.0, was launched on 1 May 2002, under both the LGPL and SISSL licenses for Windows, Linux, and Solaris platforms. A Mac OS X version, using an X11 interface, was released on 23 June 2003. OpenOffice.org 1.0.3.1, released in April 2003, was the last version to officially support Windows 95. \nThe subsequent major release, OpenOffice.org 1.1, launched on 2 September 2003, introduced several new features, including one-click export to PDF, export to Flash (.SWF), macro recording, and a basic extension mechanism for third-party add-ons.\nVersion 1.1.1, released on 29 March 2004, was notable for being included in the OpenCD project, a curated collection of open-source software for Windows users.\nOn 2 September 2005, Sun announced it would retire the SISSL to help reduce license proliferation, though some analysts speculated the move was also intended to prevent IBM from reusing the code without contributing back. The 1.1.4 update, released on 22 December 2004, was the last version distributed under the dual SISSL and LGPL licenses. The change also applied to beta versions of OpenOffice.org 2, already under development.\nThe final release in the OpenOffice.org 1 series, version 1.1.5, arrived on 9 September 2005. It introduced the ability to edit documents in the OpenDocument format (ODF) and was the last version to officially support Windows NT 4.0.\nOpenOffice.org 2.\nDevelopment of version 2.0 began in early 2003, guided by the \"Q Product Concept\", which aimed to improve Microsoft Office compatibility, performance, scripting support, GNOME integration, database usability, digital signatures, and overall user experience. It also marked the transition to ODF as the default file format. The first beta was released on 4 March 2005.\nThe final version 2.0 was released on 20 October 2005, followed by version 2.0.1 eight weeks later, which included bug fixes and new features. With version 2.0.3, the project switched from an 18-month release cycle to quarterly updates.\nVersion 2.1, released on 12 December 2006, included minor enhancements and bug fixes. This was followed by version 2.2 on 29 March 2007, which added further refinements, security updates, and small usability improvements. Version 2.3, released on 17 September 2007, introduced a redesigned charting component, enhanced the extension manager, and made several additional minor upgrades.\nOn 27 March 2008, version 2.4 was released with new features and bug fixes, incorporating enhancements from RedOffice, a Chinese derivative of OpenOffice.org. The final maintenance release in the OpenOffice.org 2 series, version 2.4.3, arrived on 4 September 2009 and was the last version to officially support Windows 98 and Windows ME.\nVersion 2 received significant media attention. \"PC Pro\" gave it a perfect 6-star rating, noting that it now rivaled Microsoft Office in features. \"Federal Computer Week\" listed it among the \"5 stars of open-source products,\" citing the importance of the ODF standard. \"Computerworld\" reported that migrating to OpenOffice.org 2.0 cost some large government agencies just a tenth of the price of upgrading to Microsoft Office 2007.\nOpenOffice.org 3.\nVersion 3.0 was released on 13 October 2008, introducing several major changes, including the ability to import (though not export) documents in Microsoft's Office Open XML format, compatibility with ODF 1.2, improved handling of Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications macros, and a native Mac OS X interface. It also introduced the \"Start Center\" and adopted the LGPL version 3 license.\nThe 3.1 update, released on 7 May 2009, added support for overlining text and transparent dragging of objects.\nVersion 3.2, released on 11 February 2010, improved support for PostScript-based OpenType fonts, added integrity checks for ODF files with repair options, and reduced \"cold start\" times by 46% compared to version 3.0. This release also introduced new features and performance enhancements.\nVersion 3.2.1 followed on 4 June 2010,[1] featuring bug fixes, refreshed OpenDocument icons, and an updated \"Oracle Start Center.\" It was the first stable release under Oracle's ownership.\nThe final Oracle-sponsored version, 3.3, was released on 26 January 2011. It added new spreadsheet functions and parameters, a revised print form, a FindBar, and usability improvements in Impress. Version 3.3 was also the last stable release to support Windows 2000 and Mac OS X on PowerPC systems.\nVersion 3.3, the last Oracle version, was released in January 2011. New features include an updated print form, a FindBar and interface improvements for Impress. In parallel, Oracle released a commercial variant Oracle Open Office 3.3 (formerly named StarOffice) on 15 December 2010, along with a proprietary cloud-based suite called Oracle Cloud Office, built on a separate codebase.\nA beta of OpenOffice.org 3.4 was released on 12 April 2011, featuring SVG import, improved support for ODF 1.2, and enhanced spreadsheet functionality. However, before a final release could be issued, Oracle withdrew its support for the project, disbanding the remaining development team.\nMarket share.\nProblems arise in estimating the market share of OpenOffice.org because it could be freely distributed via download sites (including mirror sites), peer-to-peer networks, CDs, Linux distributions and so forth. The project tried to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis, listing known distribution totals, known deployments and conversions and analyst statements and surveys.\nAccording to Valve, as of July 2010, 14.63% of Steam users had OpenOffice.org installed on their machines.\nA market-share analysis conducted by a web analytics service in 2010, based on over 200,000 Internet users, showed a wide range of adoption in different countries: 0.2% in China, 9% in the US and the UK and over 20% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany.\nAlthough Microsoft Office retained 95% of the general market \u2014 as measured by revenue \u2014 as of August 2007, OpenOffice.org and StarOffice had secured 15\u201320% of the business market as of 2004 and a 2010 University of Colorado at Boulder study reported that OpenOffice.org had reached a point where it had an \"irreversible\" installed user base and that it would continue to grow.\nThe project claimed more than 98 million downloads as of September 2007 and 300 million total to the release of version 3.2 in February 2010. The project claimed over one hundred million downloads for the OpenOffice.org 3 series within a year of release.\nNotable users.\nLarge-scale users of OpenOffice.org included Singapore's Ministry of Defence, and Banco do Brasil. As of 2006[ [update]] OpenOffice.org was the official office suite for the French Gendarmerie.\nIn India, several government organizations such as Employees' State Insurance, IIT Bombay, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Supreme Court of India, ICICI Bank, and the Allahabad High Court, which use Linux, completely relied on OpenOffice.org for their administration.\nIn Japan, conversions from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org included many municipal offices: Sumoto, Hy\u014dgo, in 2004, Ninomiya, Tochigi in 2006, Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, in 2008 (and to LibreOffice as of 2012), Shikokuch\u016b\u014d, Ehime, in 2009, Minoh, Osaka, in 2009 Toyokawa, Aichi, Fukagawa, Hokkaido, and Katano, Osaka, in 2010 and Ry\u016bgasaki, Ibaraki, in 2011. Corporate conversions included Assist in 2007 (and to LibreOffice on Ubuntu in 2011), Sumitomo Electric Industries in 2008 (and to LibreOffice in 2012), Toho Co., Ltd. in 2009 and Shinsei Financial Co., Ltd. in 2010. Assist also provided support services for OpenOffice.org.\nRetail.\nIn July 2007, Everex, a division of First International Computer and the 9th-largest PC supplier in the U.S., began shipping systems preloaded with OpenOffice.org 2.2 into Wal-Mart, K-mart and Sam's Club outlets in North America.\nForks and derivative software.\nA number of open source and proprietary products derive at least some code from OpenOffice.org. Major derivatives include:\nActive.\nApache OpenOffice.\nIn June 2011, Oracle donated the OpenOffice.org codebase and trademarks to The Apache Software Foundation. The resulting project, Apache OpenOffice project was expected to be developed by contributors from IBM, Linux distributors, and public sector agencies. In practice, most of the development was carried out by IBM, which had hired several former project developers from Oracle.\nTo comply with Apache's licensing policies, the project removed or replaced components from OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta 1 whose licenses were incompatible with the Apache License. The first Apache release, OpenOffice 3.4.0, was published in May 2012.\nLater that year, IBM donated the codebase of Lotus Symphony, its customized version of OpenOffice.org, which was merged into Apache OpenOffice 4.0. Symphony was then discontinued. After IBM's withdrawal, the project has struggled to maintain a sustainable contributor base. Since 2015, Apache OpenOffice has faced ongoing difficulties delivering timely security patches. The most recent major feature release was version 4.1 in 2014, with the latest maintenance release, 4.1.16, issued on 10 November 2025.\nIn September 2016, discussions began about possibly retiring the project entirely, though no final decision was made. As of July 2025, Apache OpenOffice remains available for download, but the Apache Software Foundation acknowledges that the software contains multiple unresolved security vulnerabilities.\nAlthough the Apache project considers itself the direct continuation of OpenOffice.org, others have described it as a fork or at least a separate project, due to its different governance model, licensing, and development direction.\nLibreOffice.\nSun had stated in the original OpenOffice.org announcement in 2000 that the project would be run by a neutral foundation, and put forward a more detailed proposal in 2001. There were many calls to put this into effect over the ensuing years. On 28 September 2010, in frustration at years of perceived neglect of the codebase and community by Sun and then Oracle, members of the OpenOffice.org community announced a non-profit called The Document Foundation and a fork of OpenOffice.org named LibreOffice. Go-oo improvements were merged, and that project was retired in favour of LibreOffice. The goal was to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements.\nOracle was invited to become a member of the Document Foundation and was asked to donate the OpenOffice.org brand. Oracle instead demanded that all members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council involved with the Document Foundation step down, leaving the Council composed only of Oracle employees.\nMost Linux distributions promptly replaced OpenOffice.org with LibreOffice; Oracle Linux 6 also features LibreOffice rather than OpenOffice.org or Apache OpenOffice. The project rapidly accumulated developers, development effort and added features, the majority of outside OpenOffice.org developers having moved to LibreOffice. In March 2015, an LWN.net development comparison of LibreOffice with Apache OpenOffice concluded that \"LibreOffice has won the battle for developer participation\".\nCollabora Online is a version of LibreOffice with a web interface and real-time collaborative editing. It is developed by Collabora Productivity. Collabora Online also has local client applications for Android, Chromebooks, iOS, iPadOS, Linux, Mac and Windows.\nDiscontinued.\nNeoOffice.\nNeoOffice, an independent commercial port for Macintosh that tracked the main line of development, offered a native Mac OS X Aqua user interface before OpenOffice.org did. Later versions are derived from Go-oo, rather than directly from OpenOffice.org. All versions from NeoOffice 3.1.1 to NeoOffice 2015 were based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1, though latter versions included stability fixes from LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. NeoOffice 2017 and later versions are fully based on LibreOffice.\nGo-oo.\nThe ooo-build patch set was started at Ximian in 2002, because Sun was slow to accept outside work on OpenOffice.org, even from corporate partners, and to make the build process easier on Linux. It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork. Most Linux distributions used, and worked together on, ooo-build.\nSun's contributions to OpenOffice.org had been declining for a number of years and some developers were unwilling to assign copyright in their work to Sun, particularly given the deal between Sun and IBM to license the code outside the LGPL. On 2 October 2007, Novell announced that ooo-build would be available as a software package called Go-oo, not merely a patch set. (The go-oo.org domain name had been in use by ooo-build as early as 2005.) Sun reacted negatively, with Simon Phipps of Sun terming it \"a hostile and competitive fork\". Many free software advocates worried that Go-oo was a Novell effort to incorporate Microsoft technologies, such as Office Open XML, that might be vulnerable to patent claims. However, the office suite branded \"OpenOffice.org\" in most Linux distributions, having previously been ooo-build, soon in fact became Go-oo.\nGo-oo also encouraged outside contributions, with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice. When LibreOffice forked, Go-oo was deprecated in favour of that project.\nOpenOffice Novell edition was a supported version of Go-oo.\nIBM Lotus Symphony.\nThe Workplace Managed Client in IBM Workplace 2.6 (23 January 2006) incorporated code from OpenOffice.org 1.1.4, the last version under the SISSL. This code was broken out into a separate application as Lotus Symphony (30 May 2008), with a new interface based on Eclipse. Symphony 3.0 (21 October 2010) was rebased on OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the code licensed privately from Sun. IBM's changes were donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice and its code was merged into Apache OpenOffice 4.0.\nStarOffice.\nSun used OpenOffice.org as a base for its commercial proprietary StarOffice application software, which was OpenOffice.org with some added proprietary components. Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice to Oracle Open Office. Oracle discontinued development in April 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. He was awarded the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize in 1951.\nBiography and work.\nFamily and beginnings.\nGottfried Benn was born in a Lutheran country parsonage, a few hours from Berlin, the son and grandson of pastors in Mansfeld, now part of Putlitz in the district of Prignitz, Brandenburg. He was educated in Sellin in the Neumark and Frankfurt an der Oder. To please his father, he studied theology at the University of Marburg and military medicine at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin. After being laid off as a military doctor in 1912, Benn turned to pathology, where he dissected over 200 bodies between October 1912 and November 1913 in Berlin. Many of his literary works reflect on his time as a pathologist.\nIn the summer of 1912, Benn started a romantic relationship with the Jewish poet Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler.\nGottfried Benn began his literary career as a poet when he published a booklet titled \"Morgue and Other Poems\" in 1912, containing expressionist poems dealing with physical decay of flesh, with blood, cancer, and death \u2014 for example No III \u2014 \"Cycle\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Der einsame Backzahn einer Dirne, / die unbekannt verstorben war, / trug eine Goldplombe. / Die \u00fcbrigen waren wie auf stille Verabredung / ausgegangen. / Den schlug der Leichendiener sich heraus, / versetzte ihn und ging f\u00fcr tanzen. / Denn, sagte er, / nur Erde solle zur Erde werden.\"\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The solitary molar of a hooker, / who had died a missing person, / held a gold filling. / As if by silent agreement, the rest / had fallen out. / The mortician knocked out the filling, / pawned it and went dancing. / Because, he said, / only earth should return to earth.\"\u2014\u200a\nPoems like this \"were received by critics and public with shock, dismay, even revulsion.\" In 1913 a second volume of poems came out, titled \"Sons. New Poems\".\nBenn's poetry projects an introverted nihilism, that is, an existentialist outlook that views artistic expression as the only purposeful action. In his early poems Benn used his medical experience, often using medical terminology, to portray humanity morbidly as just another species of disease-ridden animal.\nWorld War I and Weimar Republic.\nAfter the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in 1914, and spent a brief period on the Belgian front, then served as a military doctor in Brussels. Benn attended the court-martial and execution of Nurse and British spy Edith Cavell. He also worked as a physician in a hospital for prostitutes. After the war, he returned to Berlin and practiced as a dermatologist and venereal disease specialist.\nDuring the 1920s, he continued having a close relationship with Jewish poet Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler who addressed love poems to him. This bond to her is the subject of the film \"Mein Herz-niemandem\" (1997) by Helma Sanders-Brahms.\nDuring the Third Reich.\nHostile to the Weimar Republic, and rejecting Marxism and Americanism, Benn was upset with ongoing economic and political instability, and sympathized for a short period with the Nazis, whom he incorrectly saw as a Conservative Revolutionary force. He hoped that National Socialism would exalt his aesthetics and that expressionism would become the official art of Germany, as Futurism had become in Italy. Benn was elected to the poetry section of the Prussian Academy in 1932 and appointed head of that section in February 1933. In May, he defended the new regime in a radio broadcast, saying \"the German workers are better off than ever before.\" He later signed the \"Gel\u00f6bnis treuester Gefolgschaft\", that is, the \"vow of most faithful allegiance\" to Adolf Hitler.\nThe cultural policy of the new State didn't turn out the way he hoped, and in June Hans Friederich Blunck replaced Benn as head of the academy's poetry section. Appalled by the Night of the Long Knives, Benn turned away from the Nazis. He lived quietly, refraining from public criticism of the Nazi Party, but wrote that the bad conditions of the system \"gave me the latter punch\" and stated in a letter that the developments presented a \"dreadful tragedy\". He decided to perform \"the aristocratic form of emigration\" and joined the Wehrmacht in 1935, where he found many officers sympathetic to his disapproval of the r\u00e9gime. In May 1936 the SS magazine \"Das Schwarze Korps\" attacked his expressionist and experimental poetry as degenerate, Jewish, and homosexual. In the summer of 1937, Wolfgang Willrich, a member of the SS, lampooned Benn in his book \"S\u00e4uberung des Kunsttempels\"; Heinrich Himmler, however, stepped in to reprimand Willrich and defended Benn on the grounds of his good record since 1933 (his earlier artistic output being irrelevant). In 1938 the Reichsschrifttumskammer (the National Socialist authors' association) banned Benn from further writing.\nAfter the war.\nDuring World War II, Benn was posted to garrisons in eastern Germany where he wrote poems and essays. After the war, his work was banned by the Allies because of his initial support for Hitler. In 1951 he was awarded the Georg B\u00fcchner Prize. In 1953 he released the poem \"Nur zwei Dinge\", which appeared in the Benn's collection of poems \"Destillationen.\" He died of cancer in West Berlin in 1956, and was buried in Waldfriedhof Dahlem, Berlin.\nReception.\nBenn had a great influence on German poetry immediately before World War I (as an expressionist), as well as after World War II (as the 'Static' poet).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68229", "revid": "134766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68229", "title": "StarOffice", "text": "Discontinued office suite software\nStarOffice is a discontinued proprietary office productivity software suite. Its source code continues today in derived free and open-source office suites Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. StarOffice supported the OpenOffice.org XML file format, as well as the OpenDocument standard, and could generate PDF and Flash formats. It included templates, a macro recorder, and a software development kit (SDK).\nThe software originated in 1985 as StarWriter by Star Division, which marketed the suite with some success, primarily in Europe. StarOffice was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999, which released the source code the following year as a free and open source office suite called OpenOffice.org, which subsequent versions of StarOffice were based on, with additional proprietary components. Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010, and the product was known briefly as Oracle Open Office before being discontinued in 2011, with Oracle turning OpenOffice.org into a \"purely community-based project\".\nHistory.\nStarWriter 1.0 was written by Marco B\u00f6rries in 1985 for the Zilog Z80. B\u00f6rries formed Star Division in L\u00fcneburg the following year. It was later ported to the Amstrad CPC (marketed by Schneider in Germany) under CP/M and later ported to the 8086-based Amstrad PC-1512, running under MS-DOS 3.2. Later, the integration of the other individual programs followed as the development progressed to an office suite for MS-DOS, OS/2 Warp, and Windows. Star Division marketed its suite under the name \"StarOffice\".\nUntil version 4.2, Star Division based StarOffice on the cross-platform C++ class library StarView. In 1998 Star Division began offering StarOffice for free.\nSun Microsystems acquired the company, copyright and trademark of StarOffice in 1999 for US$, as it was supposedly cheaper than 42,000 licenses of Microsoft Office.\nIn March 2009, a study showed that StarOffice only had a 3% market share in the corporate market.\nNaming.\nStarSuite was the version of StarOffice with Asian language localization. It included Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese interfaces. It also included additional fonts for the East Asian market, resulting in slightly larger installation footprint. Otherwise the features were identical to StarOffice.\nThe two brands existed because a StarOffice brand was owned by another company in certain Asian countries. Currently NEC produces StarOffice collaborative software (unrelated to the one discussed here) in Japan. After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems (in January 2010) it renamed both StarOffice and StarSuite as \"Oracle Open Office\".\nSun ONE Webtop.\nIn 2001, Sun Microsystems announced \"Sun ONE Webtop\"\u00a0\u2013 formerly known as project StarPortal\u00a0\u2013 a limited release. It was based on StarOffice components.\nComponents.\nProprietary components.\nFor StarOffice Enterprise Edition only:\nOther differences.\nThere are also differences in the documentation, training and support options, and some minor differences in the look and icons between StarOffice and OpenOffice.org.\nOther differences are that StarOffice only supports 12 languages, compared to over 110 for OpenOffice.org.\nVersion history.\nStarOffice 2.0.\nStarWriter was the first StarOffice, with the successor being StarOffice 2.0 which included StarWriter compact, StarBase 1.0, StarDraw 1.0.\nSupported platforms included MS-DOS.\nStarOffice 3.\nStarOffice 3.0 included StarWriter 3.0, StarCalc 3.0, StarDraw 3.0, StarImage, StarChart.\nSupported platforms included MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, OS/2, Solaris on SPARC. Power Mac beta support was introduced in 1996.\n3.1.\nSupported platforms included Windows 3.1/95, OS/2 (16-bit), Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86, Mac OS 7.5\u00a0\u2013 8.0.\nCaldera, Inc. supported the Linux-port of StarOffice 3.1 with approximately 800,000\u00a0DM in order to offer the product with their forthcoming OpenLinux distribution in 1997.\nStarOffice 4.0.\nSupported platforms included Windows 3.1/95, OS/2, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86, classic Mac OS (beta).\nStarOffice 5.\n5.0 was released late November 1998. Supported platforms included Windows 95/NT 3.51, OS/2, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86.\n5.1.\n5.1 was released 20 May 1999. Supported platforms included Windows 95, OS/2, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86.\n5.2.\n5.2 was released 20 June 2000. Sun offered StarOffice 5.2 as a free download for personal use, and soon went through an exercise similar to Netscape's relicensing of Mozilla, by releasing most of the StarOffice source code under a free/open source license. The resultant free/open source software codebase fork continued development as older discontinued components, with contributions from both Sun and the wider OpenOffice.org community. Sun then took \"snapshots\" of the OpenOffice.org code base, integrated proprietary and third-party code modules, and marketed the package commercially.\nStarOffice 5.2 was the last version to contain the programs listed under older discontinued components. It was also the last version to support multiple virtual desktops, previously available from within the Suite.\nSupported platforms included: MS Windows 95/98/NT/2000, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86.\nStarOffice 6.\nA beta version of 6.0 (based on OpenOffice.org 638c) was released in October 2001; the final 6.0 (based on OpenOffice.org 1.0) was released in May 2002.\nSupport for OpenOffice.org XML file format.\nSupported platforms included Windows 95, Linux i386, Solaris Sparc/x86. OpenOffice.org version also supported Windows ME/2000 for Asian/CJK versions, generic Linux 2.2.13 with glibc2 2.1.3, Solaris 7 SPARC (8 for Asian version).\nStarOffice 7.\nBased on OpenOffice.org 1.1.

The OOO version added support for Mac OS X 10.3 for PowerPC, and for Mac OS X 10.4 for x86.\nProduct Updates 9-11 built on OpenOffice.org 2.2. New features included enhanced Windows Vista integration, PDF export.\nProduct Update 12 was based on OpenOffice.org 2.4. The OOO version added support for Linux x86-64, Linux MIPS, Linux S390, Mac OS X x86/PowerPC above 10.4. New features included improved input and sorting in Calc, block markings in text documents, new import filtering, improved security, access to WebDAV servers via HTTPS, and PDF export for long-term archiving.\nStarOffice 8.\nSun released StarOffice 8 (based on the code of OpenOffice.org 2.0) on 27 September 2005, adding support for the OpenDocument standard and a number of improvements.\nSupported platforms include Windows 98/2000 (Service Pack 2 or higher), Linux i386, Solaris 8 Sparc/x86.\nProduct Updates 2\u20135 are based on OpenOffice.org 2.1.\nProduct Updates 6\u20137 are based on OpenOffice.org 2.2.

New features include improved input and sorting in Calc, block markings in text documents, new import filter, improved security, access to WebDAV servers via HTTPS, PDF export for long-term archiving.\nStarOffice 9.\nStarOffice 9, released 17 November 2008, added support for version 1.2 of the OpenDocument standard and Microsoft Office 2007 files and a number of other improvements.\nIt is based on OpenOffice.org 3.0.\nSupported platforms include Windows 2000 (Service Pack 2 or higher), Mac OS X 10.4 (Intel version), Linux 2.4 i386 with glibc2 version 2.3.2 or higher, GTK version 2.2.0 or higher, Solaris 10 for Sparc/x86. OOO version supports Mac OS X PowerPC, generic Linux platforms.\nProduct Update 1 is based on OpenOffice.org 3.0.1, which adds improved extension manager, but requires extensions in the new format\nProduct Update 2 is based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.0.\nProduct Update 3 is based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1.\nProduct Update 4 is based on OpenOffice.org 3.2.\nOracle Open Office.\nOracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice as Oracle Open Office.\nOn 15 December 2010, Oracle released Oracle Open Office 3.3, based on OpenOffice.org 3.3 beta, and a web-based version called \"Oracle Cloud Office\". The suite was released in two versions, sold at \u20ac and \u20ac.\nPricing and licensing.\nTraditionally, StarOffice licenses sold for around US$, but in 2004, Sun planned to offer subscription-based licenses to Japanese customers for about \u00a5 (US$) per year (Becker, 2004). P. Ulander, a desktop products manager for Sun, acknowledged that Sun planned to expand subscription-based licenses to other countries as well. In January 2009, Sun's website offered StarOffice for US$.\nSun used a per-person license for StarOffice, compared to the per-device licenses used for most other proprietary software. An individual purchaser gains the right to install the software on up to five computers. For example, a small-business owner can have the software on laptop, office and home computers, or a user with a computer running Microsoft Windows, and another running Linux, can install StarOffice on both computers.\nIn 2010, StarOffice 9 Software was no longer offered free of charge to education customers, but StarOffice 8 could still be used without charge. The free OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the same functionality as StarOffice 9, could also be used. Sun also offered free web-based training and an online tutorial for students and teachers, free support services for teachers (including educational templates for StarOffice) and significantly discounted technical support for schools.\nFrom August 2007 to November 2008, Google offered StarOffice 8 as part of its free downloadable Google Pack application.\nDerivatives.\nOpenOffice.org was open source, and gave rise to many derivative versions and successor projects to StarOffice. As of 2024[ [update]], Collabora Online and LibreOffice are still actively developed. Apache OpenOffice is mostly dormant and has not seen a new major release for over 10 years. NeoOffice was also a derivative, but announced that it was no longer active in early 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Convention requires the word be repeated three times in a row during the initial emergency declaration (\"Mayday mayday mayday\").\nHistory.\nThe \"mayday\" procedure word was conceived as a distress call in the early 1920s by Frederick Stanley Mockford, officer-in-charge of radio at Croydon Airport, England. He had been asked to think of a word that would indicate distress and would easily be understood by all pilots and ground staff in an emergency. Since much of the air traffic at the time was between Croydon and Le Bourget Airport in Paris, he proposed the term \"mayday\", the phonetic equivalent of the French .\nThe phrase itself does sacrifice grammatical accuracy in favor of communicability and recognition. Looking through the lens of French grammar, it may be a short form of , \"come [and] help me\"). \"Venez m'aider\" is the closest phonetic phrase to \"mayday\", but the technically accurate stand alone reflexive imperative conjugation would be \"aidez-moi\". \nFollowing tests, the new procedure word was introduced for cross-Channel flights in February 1923. The previous distress call had been the Morse code signal SOS, but this was not considered suitable for voice communication, \"[o]wing to the difficulty of distinguishing the letter 'S' by telephone\". In 1927, the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington, D.C. adopted the voice call \"mayday\" as the radiotelephone distress call in addition to the SOS radiotelegraph (Morse code) signal.\nMayday calls.\nIf a mayday call cannot be sent because a radio is not available, a variety of other distress signals and calls for help can be used. Additionally, a mayday call can be sent on behalf of one vessel by another; this is known as a mayday relay.\nCivilian aircraft making a mayday call in United States airspace are encouraged by the Federal Aviation Administration to use the following format, omitting any portions as necessary for expediency or where they are irrelevant (capitalization as in the original source):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mayday, Mayday, Mayday; (Name of station addressed); Aircraft call sign and type; Nature of emergency; Weather; Pilot's intentions and/or requests; Present position and heading, or if lost then last known position and heading and time when aircraft was at that position; Altitude or Flight level; Fuel remaining in minutes; Number of people on board; Any other useful information.\nMaking a false distress call is a criminal offense in many countries, punishable by a fine, restitution, and possible imprisonment.\nOther urgent calls.\nPan-pan.\n\"Pan-pan\" (from the French: \"\", 'a breakdown') indicates an urgent situation, such as a mechanical failure or a medical problem, of a lower order than a \"grave and imminent threat requiring immediate assistance\". The suffix \"medico\" originally was to be added by vessels in British waters to indicate a medical problem (\"pan-pan medico\", repeated three times), or by aircraft declaring a non-life-threatening medical emergency of a passenger in flight, or those operating as protected medical transport in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. \"Pan-pan medico\" is no longer in official use.\nDeclaring emergency.\nSometimes the phrase \"declaring emergency\" is used in aviation, as an alternative to calling \"mayday\". For example, in 1998 Swissair Flight 111 radioed \"Swissair one-eleven heavy is declaring emergency\" after their situation had worsened, upgrading from the \"pan-pan\" which was declared earlier.\nHowever, the International Civil Aviation Organization recommends the use of the standard \"pan-pan\" and \"mayday\" calls instead of \"declaring an emergency\". Cases of pilots using phrases other than \"pan-pan\" and \"mayday\" have caused confusion and errors in aircraft handling.\nSilencing other communications traffic.\n\"Seelonce mayday\" (using an approximation of the French pronunciation of \"\") is a demand that the channel only be used by the vessel/s and authorities involved with the distress.

The series has been divided into two sub-series, known as the \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" and the \"Dark Alliance\", both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The \"Dark Alliance\" series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\nThe \"Bhaalspawn Saga\" was originally developed by BioWare for personal computers. Beamdog and its division Overhaul Games developed remakes of the original games in HD. The \"Dark Alliance\" series was originally set to be developed by Snowblind Studios, but ports were handled by Black Isle Studios, High Voltage Software, and Magic Pockets, with the second game developed by Black Isle.\nBlack Isle Studios had planned a third series to be set in the Dalelands and be a PC-exclusive hack and slash game with pausable real-time gameplay. The game would not have been connected to the Bhaalspawn Saga series. The game was cancelled when Interplay forfeited the \"D&amp;D\" PC license to Atari.\nThe series was revived in 2012 with ', an update of the original \"Baldur's Gate\" using an enhanced Infinity Engine. The release of the Enhanced Edition marked the first release in the series in eight years, and was followed by an enhanced edition of the second \"Baldur's Gate\" called '. Beamdog was granted permission to develop new games with the license, such as \"\", an expansion for \"Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition\". The license was later given to Larian Studios, who developed and published \"Baldur's Gate 3\", released in 2023.\nGames.\nThe \"Baldur's Gate\" series brought technical advancements over role-playing video games of the past. BioWare's Infinity Engine offers a pre-rendered isometric worldview, with sprite-based characters. \"Baldur's Gate\" was the third computer game to make use of the Lua scripting language. The engine was used for \"\" and the \"Icewind Dale\" series.\nThe earliest released in the series are based on a real-time modification of the second edition \"AD&amp;D\" (\"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\") ruleset. The player's party can have up to six members, either created by the player according to the \"AD&amp;D\" rules or non-player characters (NPCs) recruited by the protagonist from the game world. \n\"Baldur's Gate 3\" is based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th Edition, and the party is limited to 4 characters.\nNumerous side quests and plot twists are associated with particular NPCs and can be activated if they are found in the player's party. Through extensive, context-dependent dialogue, many characters inside and outside the player's party are fleshed out and given an added level of complexity.\nOriginal series.\nThe first game in the series was \"Baldur's Gate\" and introduces the player character as an orphan who has been raised by the sage Gorion in the fortified library-monastery of Candlekeep, south of Baldur's Gate and north of the kingdom of Amn. After an urgent departure from Candlekeep and a violent separation from their foster father, the protagonist searches for Gorion's allies and becomes involved with solving the region's iron crisis which has been mysteriously causing all metal to crumble, while avoiding or battling increasingly powerful enemies who have been tasked with taking their life. An expansion pack for Baldur's Gate called \"Tales of the Sword Coast\" did not add to the primary storyline, but presented the protagonist with more areas to explore along the Sword Coast, more powerful enemies, more spells, and better equipment. It also allows the player character to reach higher levels of experience, made some general changes to gameplay, and altered the original game's final battle.\nThe sequel to \"Baldur's Gate\" was \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\". The main character is captured by Jon Irenicus and must escape into the city of Athkatla, the capital of Amn. Here the protagonist faces several different ways to figure out the reason behind the capture, as they journey through the region of Amn and the Underdark. The game presents a number of innovations over the first \"Baldur's Gate\" game, including further specialization of character classes, better graphics, and higher power levels. It also allowed more interaction with the game's joinable NPCs, including friendships, romances, and your own party members' interactions with one another. \"Throne of Bhaal\" is an expansion pack for \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\", and includes both an expansion of the original game, such as new areas to explore, and a conclusion to the Bhaalspawn story arc started in the first \"Baldur's Gate\" game.\nThe third main title, \"Baldur's Gate 3\", was developed by Larian Studios in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, which holds the license for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" IP. It was released in 2023 for Windows PC, Mac OS, PS5, Xbox Series X/S.\n\"Dark Alliance\".\nThe action role-playing game \"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance\" was developed by Snowblind Studios and others, and released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console, and later Xbox and GameCube video game consoles. The game takes place in the city of \"Baldur's Gate\" and surrounding area and is set in the \"Forgotten Realms\" setting, with a ruleset derived from the 3rd edition of Dungeon &amp; Dragons; the plot is unrelated to previous PC games. The console version used an overhead third person view, and hack-and-slash dungeon crawl style gameplay. A Game Boy Advance version was released in 2004, with reduced graphics quality using an 2.5D isometric type perspective. While all ports were very well received, the original for the PlayStation 2 was the only one that gained universal acclaim.\nA sequel, \"\" was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox; the game used the same gameplay style as the original, and was also positively reviewed. The gameplay style was expanded to make the game more like a role-playing game, the ability to craft weapons, armor and amulets was added, \"Baldur's Gate\" became a hub city with the addition of a world map and being able to travel back to areas, making the game open world and many more side-quests were added as well as the ability to level up one's class.\nInterplay Entertainment placed its entire catalogue of video game intellectual properties (IP) and assets up for sale, including that of \"Dark Alliance\" in 2016.\nEnhanced editions.\nThe original game was remade in 2012 by Overhaul Games and Beamdog, 14 years after the release of the original game. It was re-released on multiple platforms as ', a collection of the original game and its expansion \"Tales of the Sword Coast\". A brand new expansion named ' was released in 2016.\n', a remake of the second game, was released in 2013. It was developed by Overhaul Games for PC, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux and Android, featuring a modified version of the Infinity Engine. The game features new content and widescreen compatibility, and utilized 2nd Edition D&amp;D rules. Beamdog also made enhanced versions of other Infinity Engine games, including \"Icewind Dale\", ' and \"Neverwinter Nights\".\nThe enhanced versions were released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2019.\nCancelled games.\n\"Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound\".\n\"\" (code named \"Jefferson\" and \"FR6\") was mentioned in early 2001 as a new game in the \"Baldur's Gate\" series to be made by Black Isle Studios using a new 3D engine. The game was originally announced in 2002 and was said to have used the 3rd Edition \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" ruleset. Many new gameplay features were also going to be added to fit the 3rd Edition Ruleset better, and elements from the \"Dark Alliance\" series would have also been borrowed. The game used the Jefferson Engine which featured 3D effects such as casting dynamic shadows.\n\"The Black Hound\" was originally going to be a departure from the high-powered epic of the Bhaalspawn saga to a low-key, role-playing plot. With protagonists progressing to around level four at the end of Black Isle Studios' typically large campaign and a hard cap at level eight, gameplay was refocussed to adventure, with emphasizing quests over combat. The game was only titled \"Baldur's Gate\" due to Interplay having lost the general \"D&amp;D\" license to Atari, but still retaining the right to make \"Baldur's Gate\" and \"Icewind Dale\" branded \"D&amp;D\" games (the same reason as for \"\"'s title). The game was not going to be connected to the previous \"Baldur's Gate\" series in any way and would start a new series, the \"Black Hound\" series. It was to be a sequel in terms of gameplay and not story, although it would have continued some aspects of the \"Icewind Dale II\" story.\nDevelopment on \"Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound\" was cancelled in 2003 and the third game in the \"Dark Alliance\" series was also cancelled in 2004 when Black Isle Studios was closed in the same year by parent company Interplay Entertainment Corp. The engine for \"The Black Hound\" was re-purposed for the development of the similarly ill-fated \"Van Buren\" project, the working title for the eventual \"Fallout 3\". The game was 75% finished before it was canceled. Its cancellation happened due to Interplay losing the right to publish \"Baldur's Gate\" games on the PC yet retaining the \"Baldur's Gate\" name for consoles; the result of this was \"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II\".\nIn an interview with Winterwind Productions, \"Black Hound\" developer Damien Foletto revealed the story and setting of the game, which would have been in the Dalelands. The player character would have been resting at their campsite when a woman chasing a Black Hound crashes in; she kills the hound, which dies on the player character 's lap. Accusing the player character of being in league with the dog, she is about to kill the player character as well, but the Riders of Archendale arrive and scare her off before questioning the player character. After a brief inquisition, the local magistrates tell the player character not to wander far because they may have more questions. The player's quest would involve finding out who the mad cleric was, what this has to do with them, why a black spirit hound follows them around, and why people can not leave the player character alone and do things for themselves instead.\nAtari stated in December 2008 in a press conference that the \"Baldur's Gate\" series (among others) would be revisited after 2009. As a personal side project, Sawyer continued work on \"The Black Hound\" as a module for \"Neverwinter Nights 2\" for a time.\n\"Baldur's Gate 3\" by Overhaul Games.\nAfter finishing the Enhanced Editions of \"Baldur's Gate\" and \"Baldur's Gate II\", Overhaul Games announced to develop \"Baldur's Gate 3\" with funding from Kickstarter. The studio later clarified their \"Baldur's Gate\" game to be a separate game from \"The Black Hound\". Game developer Trent Oster suggested Thay and Waterdeep as possible settings for the game. Beamdog began calling the game \"Baldur's Gate Next\" as a way to differentiate it from the Bhaalspawn Saga.\nOverhaul Games and Beamdog eventually lost the rights to develop further \"Baldur's Gate\" games and the license was later acquired by Larian Studios, the Belgian developer behind the \"\" series. Their project, \"Baldur's Gate 3\", was unveiled in 2019 and released four years later.\nCharacters.\nThe \"Baldur's Gate\" series features a wide array of characters. Some characters can be recruited by the player as party members and accompany the player character in their adventures. Other major characters influence the plot of the game but are not playable characters, serving as either antagonists or supporting characters in their interactions with the player character. The player character for the main series is fully customizable, whereas the \"Dark Alliance\" sub-series feature a choice of defined characters for the player to choose from.\nIn addition, a number of major \"Forgotten Realms\" characters make guest appearances throughout the \"Baldur's Gate\" series, such as Drizzt Do'Urden, Elminster, and Volothamp Geddarm.\nAdaptations.\nPhilip Athans, editor of the \"Forgotten Realms\" novel line, wrote the first two novels in the \"Baldur's Gate\" trilogy of novels: \"Baldur's Gate\" and \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\", both are novelizations of the video game series' storylines. The novels follow the basic outline of the original stories, but eschew several of the games' numerous subplots and include only a few of the NPCs. The Bhaalspawn main character is named Abdel Adrian in the novels. The third novel, \"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal\", was authored by Drew Karpyshyn.\nA comic titled \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Legends of Baldur's Gate\" was released in October 2014. The comic is set generations after \"Throne of Bhaal\", and features Minsc as the main character. It is written by Jim Zub and pencilled by Max Dunbar, part of the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 40th anniversary celebrations.\nReception and legacy.\nIn 1999, \"Baldur's Gate\" won the Origins Award for \"Best Role Playing Game Computer Game of 1998\", and in 2000, \"Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast\" won \"Best Role Game Playing Game Computer Game of 1999\". The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded the original \"Baldur's Gate\" the Interactive Achievement Award for PC Role-Playing Game of the Year. \"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal\" and \"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance\" also would later win Interactive Achievement Awards for Role-Playing Game of the Year for its respective PC and Console categories for the release year of 2001. \"Dark Alliance II\" won the 2004 RPG of the Year Award by \"GameFan\", and was later inducted into the \"GameFan\" Hall of Fame. By June 2001, the series sold more than 3.5 million units worldwide.\n\"PC Gamer\"'s Paul Dean noted that the series \"has always been as much about who these characters were as what they could do\". He considered \"Baldur's Gate\"'s characters as the cornerstone of the series, and that some of them were the best RPG companions ever written.\n\"Baldur's Gate 3\" received universal acclaim, and won several Game of the Year awards including from the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Awards, the D.I.C.E. Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, and the British Academy Games Awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Frankel is also the founder of Cockos Incorporated, which creates music production and development software such as the REAPER digital audio workstation, the NINJAM collaborative music tool and the Jesusonic expandable effects processor. \nIn 2002, he was named in the TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.\nEarly life.\nJustin Frankel was born in 1978 and grew up in Sedona, Arizona. Frankel had an aptitude for computers at an early age. His skill eventually led him to running the student computer network of Verde Valley School, which he attended, as well as writing an email application for the students.\nWinamp.\nAfter graduating high school with a 3.9 GPA, he attended the University of Utah in 1996, where he majored in computer science, but dropped out after two quarters. A few months later, he released the first version of WinAMP under his newly formed company's name Nullsoft. By 1998, more than fifteen million people had downloaded the program. Since many people had sent in the $10 donation suggested in return for using the program, Frankel earned tens of thousands of dollars a month.\nFrankel, along with Tom Pepper (who played a big part of the Winamp development and distribution), later completed SHOUTcast, which allowed ordinary users with an Internet connection to broadcast, or \"stream\", audio over the Internet. He also created the Advanced Visualization Studio, a plugin for Winamp which enabled users to create their own music visualizations in real-time, without any programming knowledge required.\nSale of Nullsoft to AOL.\nIn June 1999 AOL simultaneously acquired Nullsoft and Spinner.com in a combined purchase worth approximately $400 million. In a July 21, 1999 SEC filing by AOL, the transaction was recorded as a payment of 2,863,053 shares of AOL common stock to the 54 stockholders in the two companies being acquired. On July 20, 1999, the last reported sale price for AOL common stock was $113.1875 per share. Frankel's stake of 522,661 shares in the acquisition was worth approximately $59 million.\nAOL.\nOn March 14, 2000, Frankel and Nullsoft colleague Tom Pepper released \"Gnutella\", a public peer-to-peer file-sharing application, using Nullsoft's corporate web servers, without AOL's knowledge. Gnutella was a new peer-to-peer file-sharing system like the original Napster system, which was used by users to share their MP3 collections with everyone who ran a Napster client. Unlike Napster, however, Gnutella allowed users to share any type of file, not just MP3s. It also did not have the single point of failure that Napster had: centralized servers that indexed where all the shared content was stored. Whereas Napster was shut off just by turning off the centralized index servers owned by Napster, gnutella did not rely on any centralized servers to find out what users had what content, so once a Gnutella network was created, it could not be shut off.\nSince AOL was at the time merging with Time Warner, Gnutella seemed like a conflict of interest to Nullsoft's parent company, which knew that Time Warner was one of the parties taking legal action against Napster at the time. AOL ordered Gnutella to be taken off the Nullsoft corporate servers. However, thousands of people had already downloaded the software before it was removed from Nullsoft's web site. The source code was released later, supposedly under the GPL. Gnutella continued to be developed without Frankel's assistance, and became one of the most popular peer-to-peer file sharing networks of its time; compatible clients that were developed included BearShare, Morpheus, Gnucleus and LimeWire.\nAOL watched Frankel very closely after that, taking down other projects that he tried to release to the public, such as an MP3 search engine and a patch for AOL Instant Messenger to block advertisements in the application. Frankel threatened to resign on June 2, 2003, after AOL removed his program \"WASTE\", a private peer-to-peer file-sharing program, from the Nullsoft website. He stayed with AOL after that in order to complete Winamp version 5.0, a hybrid of the Winamp v2.x series and Winamp v3.\nOn December 9, 2003 AOL shut down Nullsoft's San Francisco offices and laid off 450 employees.\nFrankel announced his resignation from AOL on January 22, 2004 on his blog, stating \"Won't repeat it here (in two words: I've resigned). So begins chapter 3... or something clich\u00e9/poetic there. Or wait, does I've count as a single word? ha ha.\"\nPost-AOL.\nSome of Frankel's current projects in development are a programmable effects processor called Jesusonic and a piece of software named NINJAM which allows several musicians to make music together via the Internet.\nUnder his new company, Cockos, he has been developing REAPER, a digital audio workstation for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He adhered to Dadaism and became one of the pillars of Surrealism by opening the way to artistic action politically committed to the Communist Party.\nDuring World War II, he was the author of several poems against Nazism that circulated clandestinely. He became known worldwide as The Poet of \"Freedom\" and is considered the most gifted of French surrealist poets.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\n\u00c9luard was born on 14 December 1895 in Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis, the son of Eug\u00e8ne Cl\u00e9ment Grindel and wife Jeanne-Marie n\u00e9e Cousin. His father was an accountant when Paul was born but soon opened a real-estate agency. His mother was a seamstress. Around 1908, the family moved to Paris, rue Louis Blanc. \u00c9luard attended the local school in Aulnay-sous-Bois, before obtaining a scholarship to attend the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Colbert. At the age of 16, he contracted tuberculosis, interrupted his studies, and remained hospitalized until April 1914 in the Clavadel sanatorium near Davos.\nThere he met a young Russian girl of his age, Helena Diakonova, whom he nicknamed Gala. He confided to her his dream of becoming a poet, of his admiration for \"poets dead of hunger, sizzling dreams\" and of his parents' disapproval. She wrote to him that \"you will become a great poet\". They became inseparable. She believed in him and gave him confidence and encouragement and provided him with the sense of security he needed to write. She listened and was involved in the creation of his verses. She became his muse and the critic, always honest, and told him which images she preferred, which verses she disliked. He was then particularly inspired by Walt Whitman. In Clavadel, \u00c9luard also met the Brazilian youngster Manuel Bandeira, who would become one of the foremost poets of the Portuguese language. They became friends during their hospitalization in the sanatorium, and kept in touch by mail after returning to their respective countries.\nFirst World War.\nIn April 1914, \u00c9luard and Gala were both declared healthy again and sent home, to Paris and Moscow respectively. The separation was brutal; soon Europe was on the brink of war and \u00c9luard was mobilised. He passed his physical and was assigned to the auxiliary services because of his poor health. He suffered from migraine, bronchitis, cerebral anaemia, and chronic appendicitis and spent most of 1915 under treatment in a military hospital not far from home. \u00c9luard's mother came to visit him and he talked for hours about his beloved, opening his heart to her and slowly rallying her to his cause. Her initial hostility towards Gala slowly faded away, and she started calling her \"the little Russian\". However, \u00c9luard's father, who had also been mobilized, remained adamant that she could not come to Paris.\nIn Moscow, Gala listened to no one. Her love for \u00c9luard gave her an unshakable faith that they would be reunited again. She wrote to his mother to befriend her and finally convinced her stepfather to let her go to Paris to study French at the Sorbonne. She took a boat to Helsinki, then reached Stockholm before embarking for England. Once in London, she took a train to Southampton before taking a boat to Dieppe, and finally took a train to Paris.\nIn June 1916, \u00c9luard was sent to Hargicourt to work in one of the military evacuation hospitals, 10 kilometers from the front line. The 'poet' was given a chair, a desk, and a pen to painfully write to the families of the dead and the wounded. He wrote more than 150 letters a day. At night, he dug graves to bury the dead. For the first time since Clavadel, shaken by the horrors of the war, he started writing verses again. Gala wrote to him: \"I promise you our life will be glorious and magnificent.\"\nOn 14 December 1916, \u00c9luard turned 21 and wrote to his mother: \"I can assure you, that your approval will be infinitely precious to me. However, for all our sake, nothing will change my mind.\" He married Gala on 20 February 1917. However, he announced to his parents and newlywed wife that when he returned to the front line, he would voluntarily join the \"real soldiers\" in the trenches. Gala protested and threatened to return to Russia to become a nurse on the Russian front. But nothing would do, and for the first time, \u00c9luard resisted her. \"Let me live a tougher life,\" he wrote her, \"less like a servant, less like a domestic.\" Two days after getting married, \u00c9luard left for the front line.\nThere, living conditions were severe. \u00c9luard wrote to his parents, \"Even the strongest are falling. We advanced 50 kilometres, three days without bread or wine.\" His health suffered. On 20 March 1917, he was sent to a military hospital with incipient pleurisy.\nOn 11 May 1918, Gala gave birth to a baby girl who was eventually named C\u00e9cile (died 10 August 2016).\nInterwar period.\nIn 1919, \u00c9luard wrote to Gala: \"War is coming to an end. We will now fight for happiness after having fought for Life\". Waiting to be sent home, he published \"Duty and Anxiety\" and \"Little Poems for Peace\". Following the advice of his publisher, he sent the poems to various personalities of the literary world who took a stand against the war. Gala helped him to prepare and send the letters.\nIn 1919, Jean Paulhan, an eminent academic and writer, responded to his letter expressing his admiration. He referred him to three young writers who had started a new journal called \"Literature\". He encouraged \u00c9luard to go and meet them.\nThe three young poets Paulhan recommended to \u00c9luard were Andr\u00e9 Breton, Philippe Soupault, and Louis Aragon.\nThe meeting with \u00c9luard took place in March 1919. \u00c9luard was intimidated. He was shy and blushing. He was still a soldier and wearing his war uniform. It was the best omen for the three poets, who all showed great courage during the war. \u00c9luard brought with him his poems and read them to the \"jury\". They were seduced by the young man and liked his work. They decided to publish one of his texts in the next edition of \"Litt\u00e9rature\".\nWounded and scarred by the war, the four poets found solace in their friendship and poetry. Against a society that wanted to channel them into being good and useful citizens, they chose a life of bohemia. They refused the bourgeois middle-class aspirations of money, respectability, and comfort and rejected its moral codes. They hated politicians and the military or anyone with ambitions of power. They rejected all constraints. Their ideal was freedom and they felt they had already paid the price for it. Revolted and passionate, they were looking for a new ideal, something as far detached as possible from the current political and philosophical programmes. They found solace in the Dadaist movement, which originated in Switzerland.\nIn November 1921, \u00c9luard and Gala visited Max Ernst at his home in Cologne. \u00c9luard had an immediate and an absolute sympathy for Max. Underneath the charm, Ernst, like \u00c9luard, was a man deeply revolted, in total rupture with society. Unlike \u00c9luard, however, Ernst remained indifferent to propagating this revolt which he considered to be an intimate \"elegance\".\n\u00c9luard and Gala moved to a house just outside Paris and were joined by Max Ernst, who entered France illegally, using \u00c9luard's passport. Jean Paulhan once more helped \u00c9luard by providing Ernst with fake identity papers. \u00c9luard, Ernst, and Gala entered into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois in 1922. \u00c9luard was torn between his love for Gala and his friendship for Ernst. He refused to challenge Gala, and spent his nights in clubs: the Zelli, the Cyrano, the Parrot, and Mitchell. Gala's well-being was still what mattered to him above all, and he tried to forget his anxiety by drinking.\n\u00c9luard, depressed, wrote \"Dying of Not Dying\". On 24 March 1924, he disappeared, embarking on a journey around the world. No one knew where he was. The night before, he had had a worrisome meeting with Louis Aragon, during which \u00c9luard confessed that he wanted to put an end to a present that tortured him. For his friends, he was gone forever. But \u00c9luard wrote to Gala and four months later, she bought a ticket to go and find him and bring him back, locating him in Saigon.\n\u00c9luard supported the Moroccan Revolution, as early as 1925, and in January 1927, he joined the French Communist Party together with Aragon, Breton, Benjamin P\u00e9ret, and Pierre Unik. All explained their decision in a collective document entitled \"Au grand jour\". It was during these years that \u00c9luard published two of his main works: \"Capitale de la douleur\" (1926) and \"L'Amour la Po\u00e9sie\" (1929). \u00c9luard's poetry collection \"L'\u00c9vidence Po\u00e9tique Habitude de la Po\u00e9sie\" was translated into Arabic and published in the Egyptian magazine \"Al Tatawwur\" in 1940.\nIn 1928, he had another bout of tuberculosis and returned to the Clavadel sanatorium with Gala. It was their last winter together. Gala met Salvador Dal\u00ed soon after and remained with him for the rest of her life.\n1930s.\nIn 1934, \u00c9luard married Nusch (Maria Benz), a music hall artist, whom he had met through his friends Man Ray and Pablo Picasso.\nThe period from 1931 to 1935 were among \u00c9luard's happiest years. He was excluded from the French Communist Party. He travelled through Europe as an ambassador of the Surrealist movement. In 1936, in Spain, he learned of the Franquist counterrevolution, against which he protested violently. The following year, the bombing of Guernica inspired him to write the poem \"The Victory of Guernica\". During these two terrible years for Spain, \u00c9luard and Picasso were inseparable. The poet told the painter: \"You hold the flame between your fingers and paint like a fire.\"\nSecond World War.\nMobilized in September 1939, he moved to Paris with Nusch after the Armistice of 22 June 1940. In January 1942, he sent her to the home of some of his friends, Christian and Yvonne Zervos, near V\u00e9zelay\u2014near the maquis. \u00c9luard asked to rejoin the French Communist Party, which was illegal in Occupied France. Thousands of copies of the twenty-one stanzas of his poem \"Libert\u00e9\", first published in the \"Choix revue\", were parachuted from British aircraft over Occupied France. During the war, he also wrote \"Les sept po\u00e8mes d'amour en guerre\" (1944) and \"En Avril 1944: Paris Respirait Encore!\" (1945, illustrated by Jean Hugo).\nIn 1943, together with Pierre Seghers, Fran\u00e7ois Lachenal, and Jean Lescure, he assembled the texts of several poets of the Resistance in a controversial book called \"L'Honneur des po\u00e8tes\" (\"The Honour of Poets\"). Faced with oppression, the poets eulogised in it hope and freedom. In November 1943, \u00c9luard found refuge in the mental asylum of Saint-Alban, headed by doctor Lucien Bonnaf\u00e9, in which many resistants and Jews were hiding. At Lib\u00e9ration, \u00c9luard and Aragon were hailed as the great poets of the Resistance.\nPost-war.\nOn 28 November 1946, during a stay in Switzerland, \u00c9luard learned of Nusch's sudden death from a stroke. Distraught, he became extremely depressed. Two friends, Alain and Jacqueline Trutat (for whom \u00c9luard wrote \"Corps m\u00e9morable\"), gave him back the will to live.\nHis grief at the premature death of his wife Nusch in 1946 inspired the work \"Le temps d\u00e9borde\" in 1947, as well as \"De l'horizon \u00e0 l'horizon de tous\", which traced the path that led \u00c9luard from suffering to hope.\nThe principles of peace, self-government, and liberty became his new passion. He was a member of the Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wroc\u0142aw in April 1948, which persuaded Pablo Picasso to also join. The following year, in April, he was a delegate to the Council for World Peace, at the conference held at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. In June 1949, he spent a few days with Greek partisans entrenched on the Gramos hills to fight against Greek government soldiers. He then went to Budapest to attend the commemorative celebrations of the centenary of the death of the poet S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi. There he met Pablo Neruda. In September, he was in Mexico for a new peace conference. There he met Dominique Lemort, with whom he returned to France. They married in 1951. The same year, \u00c9luard published \"Le Ph\u00e9nix\" (\"The Phoenix\"), a collection of poems dedicated to his reborn happiness. Among his best known quotations is: \"There are other worlds, but they are all inside this one\".\nHe later eulogised Joseph Stalin in his political writings. He even wrote a poem \u2014 \"Ode \u00e0 Staline\" \u2014 for him. Milan Kundera recalled that he was shocked to hear of \u00c9luard's public approval of the hanging of \u00c9luard's friend, the Prague writer Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra in 1950.\nDeath.\nPaul \u00c9luard died from a heart attack on 18 November 1952 at his home, 52 avenue de Gravelle, in Charenton-le-Pont. His funeral was held at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, and organized by the French Communist Party; the French government having refused to organise a national funeral for political reasons. A crowd of thousands spontaneously gathered in the streets of Paris to accompany his casket to the cemetery. That day, Robert Sabatier wrote: \"the whole world was mourning\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The couple were known for their bank robberies and multiple murders, although they preferred to rob small stores or rural gas stations. Their exploits captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is occasionally referred to as the \"public enemy era\" between 1931 and 1934. On May 23, 1934, they were ambushed and killed on Louisiana Highway 154 in Bienville Parish, Louisiana by a law enforcement posse led by retired Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. They are believed to have murdered at least nine police officers and three civilians.\nThe 1967 film \"Bonnie and Clyde\", directed by Arthur Penn and starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in the title roles, despite being highly fictionalized and historically inaccurate, was a critical and commercial success which revived interest in the criminals and glamorized them with a romantic aura. The 2019 Netflix film \"The Highwaymen\" depicted their manhunt from the point of view of the pursuing lawmen.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBonnie Parker.\nBonnie Elizabeth Parker was born in 1910 in Rowena, Texas, the second of three children. Her father, Charles Robert Parker (1884\u20131914), was a bricklayer who died when Bonnie was four years old. Her widowed mother, Emma (Krause) Parker (1885\u20131944), moved her family back to her parents' home in Cement City, an industrial suburb in West Dallas where she worked as a seamstress. As an adult, Bonnie wrote poems such as \"The Story of Suicide Sal\" and \"The Trail's End\", the latter more commonly known as \"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde\".\nParker was a bright child who thrived on attention. She enjoyed performing on stage and dreamt of becoming an actress. In her second year in high school, Parker met Roy Thornton (1908\u20131937). The couple dropped out of school and married on September 25, 1926, six days before her 16th birthday. Their marriage was marred by his frequent absences and brushes with the law and proved to be short-lived. They never divorced, but their paths never crossed again after January 1929. When she died, Parker was still wearing the wedding ring Thornton had given her. Thornton was in prison when he heard of her death, commenting, \"I'm glad they jumped out like they did. It's much better than being caught.\" Sentenced to five years for robbery in 1933 and after attempting several prison breaks from other facilities, Thornton was killed while trying to escape from the Huntsville State Prison on October 3, 1937.\nAfter she left Thornton, Parker moved back in with her mother and worked as a waitress in Dallas. One of her regular customers was postal worker Ted Hinton. In 1932, he joined the Dallas County Sheriff's Department and eventually served as a member of the posse that killed Bonnie and Clyde. Parker briefly kept a diary early in 1929 when she was aged 18, writing of her loneliness, her impatience with life in Dallas, and her love of photography.\nClyde Barrow.\nClyde Chestnut Barrow was born in 1909 into a poor farming family in the town of Telico in Ellis County, Texas. He was the fifth of seven children of Henry Basil Barrow (1874\u20131957) and Cumie Talitha Walker (1874\u20131942). The family moved to Dallas in the early 1920s as part of a wider migration pattern from rural areas to the city, where many settled in the urban slum of West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon until they got enough money to buy a tent.\nBarrow was first arrested in late 1926, at age 17, after running when police confronted him over a rental car that he had failed to return on time. His second arrest was with his brother Buck Barrow soon after, for possession of stolen turkeys. Barrow had some legitimate jobs from 1927 through 1929, but he also cracked safes, robbed stores, and stole cars. He met 19-year-old Parker through a mutual friend in January 1930, and they spent much time together during the following weeks. Their romance was interrupted when Barrow was arrested by Dallas County Sheriff's Deputy Bert Whisnand and convicted of auto theft. He escaped from the McLennan County Jail in Waco, TX, on March 11, 1930, using a gun Parker smuggled into the jail.\nRecaptured on March 18, Barrow was sent to Huntsville State Prison in April 1930 and in September he was assigned to the Eastham Prison Farm at the age of 21. He was sexually assaulted while in prison, and he retaliated by attacking and killing his tormentor with a pipe, crushing his skull. This was his first murder. Another inmate who was already serving a life sentence claimed responsibility.\nTo avoid hard labor in the fields, Barrow purposely had two of his toes amputated in late January 1932, either by another inmate or by himself. Because of this, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. The amputation slowed him down physically, making it harder to outrun law enforcement and limiting his mobility during his many robberies. However, without his knowledge, his mother had successfully petitioned for his release and he was set free six days after his intentional injury. He was paroled from Eastham on February 2, 1932, now a hardened and bitter criminal. His sister Marie said, \"Something awful sure must have happened to him in prison because he wasn't the same person when he got out.\" Fellow inmate Ralph Fults said that he watched Clyde \"change from a school boy to a rattlesnake\".\nIn his post-Eastham career, Barrow robbed grocery stores and gas stations at a rate far outpacing the ten or so bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow Gang. His favorite weapon was the M1918 Browning automatic rifle (BAR). According to John Neal Phillips, Barrow's goal in life was not to gain fame or fortune from robbing banks but to seek revenge against the Texas prison system for the abuses that he had sustained while serving time.\nFirst meeting.\nThere are several different accounts of Parker and Barrow's first meeting. One of the more credible versions is that they met on January 5, 1930, at the home of Barrow's friend, Clarence Clay, at 105 Herbert Street in West Dallas. Barrow was 20 years old, and Parker was 19. Parker was out of work and staying with a female friend to assist her during her recovery from a broken arm. Barrow dropped by the girl's house while Parker was in the kitchen making hot chocolate. \nArmed robbery and murder.\n1932: Early robberies and murders.\nAfter Barrow's release from prison in February 1932, he and Ralph Fults began a series of robberies, primarily of stores and gas stations. Their goal was to collect enough money and firepower to launch a raid against Eastham prison. On April 19, Parker and Fults were captured in a failed hardware store burglary in Kaufman in which they had intended to steal firearms. Parker was released from jail after a few months, when the grand jury failed to indict her. Fults was tried, convicted, and served time. He never rejoined the gang. Parker wrote poetry to pass the time in Kaufman County jail and reunited with Barrow within a few weeks of her release.\nOn April 30, Barrow was the getaway driver in a robbery in Hillsboro during which store owner J.N. Bucher was shot and killed. Bucher's wife identified Barrow from police photographs as one of the shooters, although he had stayed inside the car.\nOn August 5, Barrow, Raymond Hamilton, and Ross Dyer were drinking moonshine at a country dance in Stringtown, Oklahoma when Sheriff C.G. Maxwell and Deputy Eugene C. Moore approached them in the parking lot. Barrow and Hamilton opened fire, killing Moore and gravely wounding Maxwell. Moore was the first law officer whom Barrow and his gang killed. They eventually murdered nine. On October 11, they allegedly killed Howard Hall at his store during a robbery in Sherman, Texas, though some historians consider this unlikely.\nW. D. Jones had been a friend of Barrow's family since childhood. He joined Parker and Barrow on Christmas Eve 1932 at the age of 16, and the three left Dallas that night. The next day, Christmas Day 1932, Jones and Barrow murdered Doyle Johnson, a young family man, while stealing his car in Temple. Barrow killed Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis on January 6, 1933, when he, Parker, and Jones wandered into a police trap set for another criminal. The gang had murdered five people since April.\n1933: Buck and Blanche Barrow join the gang.\nOn March 22, 1933, Clyde's brother Buck was granted a full pardon and released from prison, and he and his wife Blanche set up housekeeping with Bonnie, Clyde and Jones in a temporary hideout at 3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive in Joplin, Missouri. According to family sources, Buck and Blanche were there to visit; they attempted to persuade Clyde to surrender to law enforcement. The group ran loud, alcohol-fueled card games late into the night in the quiet neighborhood; Blanche recalled that they \"bought a case of beer a day\". The men came and went noisily at all hours, and Clyde accidentally fired a Browning automatic rifle (BAR) in the apartment while cleaning it. No neighbors went to the house, but one reported suspicions to the Joplin Police Department.\nThe police assembled a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers living at the Oakridge Drive address. The Barrow brothers and Jones opened fire, killing Detective Harry L. McGinnis outright and fatally wounding Constable J. W. Harryman. Parker opened fire with a BAR as the others fled, forcing Highway Patrol Sergeant G.B. Kahler to duck behind a large oak tree. The .30 caliber bullets from the BAR struck the tree and forced wood splinters into the sergeant's face. Parker got into the car with the others, and they pulled in Blanche from the street where she was pursuing her dog Snow Ball. The surviving officers later testified that they had fired only fourteen rounds in the conflict; one hit Jones on the side, one struck Clyde but was deflected by his suit-coat button, and one grazed Buck after ricocheting off a wall.\nThe group escaped the police at Joplin but left behind most of their possessions at the apartment, including Buck's parole papers (three weeks old), a large arsenal of weapons, a handwritten poem by Bonnie, and a camera with several rolls of undeveloped film. Police developed the film at \"The Joplin Globe\" and found many photos of Barrow, Parker, and Jones posing and pointing weapons at one another. The \"Globe\" sent the poem and the photos over the newswire, including a photo of Parker clenching a cigar in her teeth and a pistol in her hand. The Barrow Gang subsequently became front-page news throughout the United States.\nThe photo of Parker posing with a cigar and a gun became popular. In his book \"Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde\", writer Jeff Guinn noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;John Dillinger had matinee-idol good looks and Pretty Boy Floyd had the best possible nickname, but the Joplin photos introduced new criminal superstars with the most titillating trademark of all \u2014 illicit sex. Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were wild and young, and undoubtedly slept together.\nThe group ranged from Texas as far north as Minnesota for the next three months. In May, they tried to rob the bank in Lucerne, Indiana, and robbed the bank in Okabena, Minnesota. They kidnapped Dillard Darby and Sophia Stone at Ruston, Louisiana in the course of stealing Darby's car; this was one of several events between 1932 and 1934 in which they kidnapped police officers or robbery victims. They usually released their hostages far from home, sometimes with money to help them return.\nStories of such encounters made headlines, as did the more violent episodes. The Barrow Gang did not hesitate to shoot anyone who got in their way, whether it was a police officer or an innocent civilian. Other members of the gang who committed murder included Hamilton, Jones, Buck Barrow, and Henry Methvin. Eventually, the cold-bloodedness of their murders opened the public's eyes to the reality of their crimes and led to their ends.\nThe photos entertained the public for a time, but the gang was desperate and discontented, as described by Blanche in her account written while imprisoned in the late 1930s. With their new notoriety, their daily lives became more difficult as they tried to evade discovery. Restaurants and motels became less secure; the gang resorted to campfire cooking and bathing in cold streams. The unrelieved round-the-clock proximity of five people in one car gave rise to vicious bickering. Jones was the driver when he and Barrow stole a car belonging to Darby in late April, and he used that car to leave the others. He stayed away until June 8.\nBarrow failed to see warning signs at a bridge under construction on June 10 while driving with Jones and Parker near Wellington, Texas, and the car flipped into a ravine. Sources disagree on whether there was a gasoline fire or if Parker was doused with acid from the car's battery under the floorboards, but she sustained third-degree burns to her right leg, so severe that the muscles contracted and caused the leg to \"draw up\". Jones observed: \"She'd been burned so bad none of us thought she was gonna live. The hide on her right leg was gone from her hip down to her ankle. I could see the bone at places.\"\nParker could hardly walk; she either hopped on her good leg or was carried by Barrow. They got help from a nearby farm family, then kidnapped Collinsworth County Sheriff George Corry and City Marshal Paul Hardy, leaving the two of them handcuffed to a tree outside Erick, Oklahoma. The three rendezvoused with Buck and Blanche and hid in a tourist court near Fort Smith, Arkansas, nursing Parker's burns. Buck and Jones bungled a robbery and murdered Town Marshal Henry D. Humphrey in Alma, Arkansas. The criminals had to flee, despite Parker's grave condition.\nPlatte City.\nIn July 1933, the gang checked into the Red Crown Tourist Court south of Platte City, Missouri. It consisted of two brick cabins joined by garages, and the gang rented both. To the south stood the Red Crown Tavern, a popular restaurant among Missouri Highway Patrolmen, and the gang seemed to go out of their way to draw attention. Blanche registered the party as three guests, but owner Neal Houser could see five people getting out of the car. He noted that the driver backed into the garage \"gangster style\" for a quick getaway.\nBlanche paid for their cabins with coins rather than bills, and did the same later when buying five dinners and five beers. The next day, Houser noticed that his guests had taped newspapers over the windows of their cabin; Blanche again paid for five meals with coins. Her outfit of jodhpur riding breeches also attracted attention; they were not typical attire for women in the area, and eyewitnesses still remembered them 40 years later. Houser told Captain William Baxter of the Highway Patrol, a patron of his restaurant, about the group.\nBarrow and Jones went into town to purchase bandages, crackers, cheese, and atropine sulfate to treat Parker's leg. The druggist contacted Sheriff Holt Coffey, who put the cabins under surveillance. Coffey had been alerted by Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas law enforcement to watch for strangers seeking such supplies. The sheriff contacted Captain Baxter, who called for reinforcements from Kansas City, including an armored car. Sheriff Coffey led a group of officers toward the cabins at 11 p.m. on July 20, 1933, armed with Thompson submachine guns.\nIn the gunfight that ensued, the officers' .45 caliber Thompsons proved no match for Barrow's .30 caliber BAR, stolen on July 7 from the National Guard armory at Enid, Oklahoma. The gang escaped when a bullet short-circuited the horn on the armored car and the police officers mistook it for a cease-fire signal. They did not pursue the retreating Barrow vehicle.\nThe gang had evaded the law once again, but Buck had been wounded by a bullet that blasted a large hole in the bone of his forehead and exposed his injured brain. Blanche was also nearly blinded by glass fragments.\nDexfield Park.\nThe Barrow Gang camped at Dexfield Park, an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa, on July 24, 1933. Buck was sometimes semiconscious, and he even talked and ate, but his massive head wound and loss of blood were so severe that Barrow and Jones dug a grave for him. Residents noticed their bloody bandages, and officers determined that the campers were the Barrow Gang. Local police officers and approximately 100 spectators surrounded the group, and the Barrows soon came under fire. Barrow, Parker, and Jones escaped on foot. Buck was shot in the back, and he and his wife were captured by the officers. Buck died of his head wound and pneumonia after surgery five days later at Kings Daughters Hospital in Perry, Iowa.\nFor the next six weeks, the remaining perpetrators ranged far afield from their usual area of operations, west to Colorado, north to Minnesota, southeast to Mississippi; yet they continued to commit armed robberies. They restocked their arsenal when Barrow and Jones robbed an armory on August 20 at Plattville, Illinois, acquiring three BARs, handguns, and a large quantity of ammunition.\nBy early September, the gang risked a run to Dallas to see their families for the first time in four months. Jones parted company with them, continuing to Houston where his mother had moved. He was arrested there without incident on November 16, and returned to Dallas. Through the autumn, Barrow committed several robberies with small-time local accomplices, while his family and Parker's attended to her considerable medical needs.\nOn November 22, they narrowly evaded arrest while trying to meet with family members near Sowers, Texas. Dallas Sheriff Smoot Schmid, Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Deputy Ted Hinton lay in wait nearby. As Barrow drove up, he sensed a trap and drove past his family's car, at which point Schmid and his deputies stood up and opened fire with machine guns and a BAR. The family members in the crossfire were not hit, but a BAR bullet passed through the car, striking the legs of both Barrow and Parker. They escaped later that night.\nOn November 28, a Dallas grand jury delivered a murder indictment against Parker and Barrow for the killing \u2013 in January of that year, nearly ten months earlier \u2013 of Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis; it was Parker's first warrant for murder.\n1934: Final run.\nOn January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the \"Eastham Breakout\". The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the Texas Department of Corrections.\nBarrow Gang member Joe Palmer shot Major Joe Crowson during his escape, and Crowson died a few days later in the hospital. This attack attracted the full power of the Texas and federal government to the manhunt for Barrow and Parker. As Crowson struggled for life, prison chief Lee Simmons reportedly promised him that all persons involved in the breakout would be hunted down and killed. All of them eventually were, except for Methvin, who preserved his life by turning on the gang and setting up the ambush of Barrow and Parker.\nThe Texas Department of Corrections contacted former Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer and persuaded him to hunt down the Barrow Gang. He was retired, but his commission had not expired. He accepted the assignment as a Texas Highway Patrol officer, secondarily assigned to the prison system as a special investigator, and was given the specific task of taking down the Barrow Gang.\nHamer was tall, burly, and taciturn, unimpressed by authority and driven by an \"inflexible adherence to right, or what he thinks is right\". For twenty years, he had been feared and admired throughout Texas as \"the walking embodiment of the 'One Riot, One Ranger' ethos\". He \"had acquired a formidable reputation as a result of several spectacular captures and the shooting of a number of Texas criminals\". He was officially credited with 53 kills, and suffered seventeen wounds.\nPrison boss Simmons always said publicly that Hamer had been his first choice, although there is evidence that he first approached two other Rangers, both of whom declined because they were reluctant to shoot a woman. Starting on February 10, Hamer became the constant shadow of Barrow and Parker, living out of his car, just a town or two behind them. Three of Hamer's four brothers were also Texas Rangers. Brother Harrison was the best shot of the four, but Frank was considered the most tenacious.\nOn Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934, at the intersection of Route 114 and Dove Road, near Grapevine, Texas, now Southlake, highway patrolmen H.D. Murphy and Edward Bryant Wheeler stopped their motorcycles thinking a motorist needed assistance. Barrow and Methvin or Parker opened fire with a shotgun and handgun, killing both officers. An eyewitness account said that Parker fired the fatal shots and this story received widespread coverage. Methvin later claimed that he fired the first shot after mistakenly assuming that Barrow wanted the officers killed. Barrow joined in, firing at Patrolman Murphy.\nDuring the spring season, the Grapevine killings were recounted in exaggerated detail, affecting public perception. All four Dallas daily papers seized on the story told by the eyewitness, a farmer who claimed to have seen Parker laugh at the way that Murphy's head \"bounced like a rubber ball\" on the ground as she shot him. The stories claimed that police found a cigar butt \"with tiny teeth marks\", supposedly those of Parker. Several days later, Murphy's fianc\u00e9e wore her intended wedding dress to his funeral, attracting photos and newspaper coverage.\nThe eyewitness's ever-changing story was soon discredited, but the massive negative publicity increased the public clamor for the extermination of the Barrow Gang. The outcry galvanized the authorities into action, and Highway Patrol boss L.G. Phares offered a reward of $1,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024) for \"the dead bodies of the Grapevine slayers\"\u2014not their capture, just the bodies. Texas Governor Ma Ferguson added another reward of $500 for each of the two killers, which meant that, for the first time, \"there was a specific price on Bonnie's head since she was so widely believed to have shot H.D. Murphy\".\nPublic hostility increased five days later when Barrow and Methvin murdered 60-year-old Constable William \"Cal\" Campbell, a widower and father, near Commerce, Oklahoma. They kidnapped Commerce police chief Percy Boyd, crossed the state line into Kansas, then let him go, giving him a clean shirt, a few dollars, and a request from Parker to tell the world that she did not smoke cigars. Boyd identified both Barrow and Parker to authorities, but he never learned Methvin's name. The resultant arrest warrant for the Campbell murder specified \"Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and John Doe\". Historian Knight writes: \"For the first time, Bonnie was seen as a killer, actually pulling the trigger\u2014just like Clyde. Whatever chance she had for clemency had just been reduced.\" \"The Dallas Journal\" ran a cartoon on its editorial page, showing an empty electric chair with a sign on it saying \"Reserved\", adding the words \"Clyde and Bonnie\".\nAmbush and deaths.\nBy May 1934, Barrow had 16 warrants outstanding against him for multiple counts of robbery, auto theft, theft, escape, assault, and murder in four states. Hamer, who had begun tracking the gang on February 12, led the posse. He had studied the gang's movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five midwestern states, exploiting the \"state line\" rule that prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction. Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go. The gang's itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin's family in Louisiana. Unbeknownst to Hamer, Barrow had designated Methvin's parents' residence as a rendezvous in case they were separated. Methvin had become separated from the rest of the gang in Shreveport. Hamer's posse was composed of six men: Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M. \"Maney\" Gault, and Louisiana officers Henderson Jordan and Prentiss Morel Oakley.\nOn May 21, the four posse members from Texas were in Shreveport when they learned that Barrow and Parker were planning to visit Ivy Methvin in Bienville Parish that evening. The full posse set up an ambush along Louisiana State Highway 154 south of Gibsland toward Sailes. Hinton recounted that the lawmen were in place by 9 pm, and waited through the whole of the next day (May 22) with no sign of the perpetrators. Other accounts said that the officers set up on the evening of May 22.\nAt approximately 9:15 am on May 23, the posse was still concealed in the bushes and almost ready to give up when they heard a vehicle approaching at high speed. In their official report, they stated they had persuaded Methvin to position his truck on the shoulder of the road that morning. They hoped Barrow would stop to speak with him, putting his vehicle close to the posse's position in the bushes. The vehicle proved to be the Ford V8 with Barrow at the wheel and he slowed down as hoped. The six lawmen opened fire while the vehicle was still moving. Oakley fired first, probably before any order to do so. Barrow was shot in the head and died instantly from Oakley's first shot and Hinton reported hearing Parker scream. The officers fired about 130 rounds, emptying each of their weapons into the car. The two had survived several bullet wounds over the years in their confrontations with the law. On this day, any of Bonnie Parker's and Clyde Barrow's wounds would have proven to be fatal.\nAccording to statements made by Hinton and Alcorn:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each of us six officers had a shotgun and an automatic rifle and pistols. We opened fire with the automatic rifles. They were emptied before the car got even with us. Then we used shotguns. There was smoke coming from the car, and it looked like it was on fire. After shooting the shotguns, we emptied the pistols at the car, which had passed us and ran into a ditch about 50 yards on down the road. It almost turned over. We kept shooting at the car even after it stopped. We weren't taking any chances.\nFilm footage taken by one of the deputies immediately after the ambush shows 112 bullet holes in the vehicle, of which around one quarter struck the couple. The official report by parish coroner J. L. Wade listed 17 entrance wounds on Barrow's body and 26 on that of Parker, including several headshots to each and one that had severed Barrow's spinal column. Undertaker C. F. \"Boots\" Bailey had difficulty embalming the bodies because of all the bullet holes.\nThe deafened officers inspected the vehicle and discovered an arsenal, including stolen automatic rifles, sawed-off semi-automatic shotguns, assorted handguns, and several thousand rounds of ammunition, along with fifteen sets of license plates from various states. Hamer stated: \"I hate to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down, however if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us.\" Word of the deaths quickly got around when Hamer, Jordan, Oakley, and Hinton drove into town to telephone their bosses. A crowd soon gathered at the spot. Gault and Alcorn were left to guard the bodies, but they lost control of the jostling, curious throng; one woman cut off bloody locks of Parker's hair and pieces from her dress, which were subsequently sold as souvenirs. Hinton returned to find a man trying to cut off Barrow's trigger finger, and was sickened by what was occurring. Arriving at the scene, the coroner reported:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nearly everyone had begun collecting souvenirs such as shell casings, slivers of glass from the shattered car windows, and bloody pieces of clothing from the garments of Bonnie and Clyde. One eager man had opened his pocket knife, and was reaching into the car to cut off Clyde's left ear.\nHinton enlisted Hamer's help in controlling the \"circus-like atmosphere\" and they got people away from the car.\nThe posse towed the Ford, with the dead bodies still inside, to the Conger Furniture Store &amp; Funeral Parlor in downtown Arcadia, Louisiana. Preliminary embalming was done by Bailey in a small preparation room in the back of the furniture store, as it was common for furniture stores and undertakers to share the same space. The population of the northwest Louisiana town reportedly swelled from 2,000 to 12,000 within hours. Curious throngs arrived by train, horseback, carriage, and plane. Beer normally sold for 15 cents a bottle but it jumped to 25 cents, and sandwiches quickly sold out. Henry Barrow identified his son's body, then sat weeping in a rocking chair in the furniture section.\nH.D. Darby was an undertaker at the McClure Funeral Parlor, and Sophia Stone was a home demonstration agent, both from nearby Ruston. Both of them came to Arcadia to identify the bodies because the Barrow gang had kidnapped them in 1933. Parker reportedly had laughed when she discovered that Darby was an undertaker. She remarked that maybe someday he would be working on her; Darby did assist Bailey in the embalming.\nFuneral and burial.\nBonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it. Her mother wanted to grant her final wish to be brought home, but the mobs surrounding the Parker house made that impossible. More than 20,000 attended Parker's funeral, and her family had difficulty reaching her gravesite. Parker's services were held on May 26. Allen Campbell recalled that flowers came from everywhere, including some with cards allegedly from Pretty Boy Floyd and John Dillinger. The largest floral tribute was sent by a group of Dallas city newsboys; the sudden end of Bonnie and Clyde sold 500,000 newspapers in Dallas alone. Parker was buried in the Fishtrap Cemetery, although her body was moved in 1945 to the new Crown Hill Cemetery in Dallas.\nThousands of people gathered outside both Dallas funeral homes, hoping for a chance to view the bodies. Barrow's private funeral was held at sunset on May 25. He was buried in Western Heights Cemetery in Dallas, next to his brother Marvin. The Barrow brothers share a single granite marker with their names on it and an epitaph selected by Clyde: \"Gone but not forgotten.\"\nThe American National Insurance Company of Galveston, Texas, paid the life insurance policies in full on Barrow and Parker. Since then, the policy of payouts has changed to exclude payouts in cases of deaths caused by any criminal act by the insured.\nThe six men of the posse were each to receive a one-sixth share of the reward money. Dallas Sheriff Schmid had promised Hinton that this would total some $26,000, but most of the organizations that had pledged reward funds reneged on their pledges. In the end, each lawman earned $200.23 (the equivalent of $4,821.61 in 2025) for his efforts and collected memorabilia.\nBy the summer of 1934, new federal statutes made bank robbery and kidnapping federal offenses. The growing coordination of local authorities by the FBI, plus two-way radios in police cars, combined to make it more difficult to carry out series of robberies and murders than it had been just months before. Two months after Bonnie and Clyde were killed in Gibsland, Dillinger was killed on the street in Chicago. Three months after that, Pretty Boy Floyd was killed in Ohio. One month after that, Baby Face Nelson was killed in Illinois.\nAs of 2018, Parker's niece and last known surviving relative has campaigned to have her aunt buried next to Barrow.\nDiffering accounts.\nThe members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana. The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves, and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it. Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.\nSchmid had tried to arrest Barrow in Sowers, Texas in November 1933. Schmid called \"Halt!\" and gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, which made a quick U-turn and sped away. Schmid's Thompson submachine gun jammed on the first round, and he could not get off one shot. Pursuit of Barrow was impossible because the posse had parked their cars at a distance to prevent them from being seen.\nThe posse discussed calling \"halt\", but the four Texans Hamer, Gault, Hinton, and Alcorn \"vetoed the idea\", telling them that the killers' history had always been to shoot their way out, as had occurred in Platte City, Dexfield Park, and Sowers. When the ambush occurred, Oakley stood up and opened fire, and the other officers opened fire immediately after. Jordan was reported to have called out to Barrow; Alcorn said that Hamer called out; and Hinton claimed that Alcorn did. In another report, each said that they both did. These conflicting claims might have been collegial attempts to divert the focus from Oakley, who later admitted firing too early, but that is merely speculation.\nIn 1979, Hinton's account of the saga was published posthumously as \"Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde\". His version of the Methvin family's involvement in the planning and execution of the ambush was that the posse had tied Methvin's father Ivy to a tree the previous night to keep him from warning off the couple. Hinton claimed that Hamer made a deal with Ivy: if he kept quiet about being tied up, his son would escape prosecution for the two Grapevine murders. Hinton alleged that Hamer made every member of the posse swear that they would never divulge this secret. Other accounts place Ivy at the center of the action, not tied up but on the road, waving for Barrow to stop.\nHinton's memoir suggests that Parker's cigar in the famous \"cigar photo\" had been a ruse, and that it was retouched as a cigar by darkroom staff at the \"Joplin Globe\" while they prepared the photo for publication. Guinn says that some people who knew Hinton suspect that \"he became delusional late in life\".\nVictims.\nBonnie and Clyde killed 12 people, including nine law enforcement officers, during their two years of criminal activity from February 1932 to May 1934.\nAftermath.\nPersonal effects.\nThe posse never received the promised bounty on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car. Hamer appropriated the arsenal of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC. In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: \"You don't ever want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for.\" There is no record of any response.\nAlcorn claimed Barrow's saxophone from the car, but he later returned it to the Barrow family. Posse members took other personal items, such as Parker's clothing. The Parker family asked for them back but were refused, and the items were later sold as souvenirs. The Barrow family claimed that Sheriff Jordan kept an alleged suitcase of cash, and writer Jeff Guinn claims that Jordan bought a \"barn and land in Arcadia\" soon after the event, thereby hinting that the accusation had merit, despite the complete absence of any evidence to the existence of such a suitcase.\nDeath car.\nJordan attempted to keep the death car, but Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the vehicle's legal owner, sued him. Jordan relented and allowed her to claim it in August 1934, still covered with blood and human tissue. The engine still ran, despite the damage the vehicle took during the ambush. Warren picked up the car in Arcadia and drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state. From there, she had it trucked to Topeka.\nThe bullet-riddled Ford became a popular traveling attraction. The car was displayed at fairs, amusement parks, and flea markets for three decades, and once became a fixture at a Nevada race track. There was a charge of one dollar to sit in it.\nIn 1988, a casino near Las Vegas purchased the vehicle for about $250,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024). As of 2024[ [update]], the car and the shirt Barrow was wearing when killed are displayed behind a glass panel at the\nPrimm Valley Resort in Primm, Nevada alongside Interstate 15.\nBarrow's enthusiasm for cars was evident in a letter he wrote from Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 10, 1934, to Henry Ford: \"While I still have got breath in my lungs I will tell you what a dandy car you make. I have drove Fords exclusively when I could get away with one. For sustained speed and freedom from trouble the Ford has got every other car skinned and even if my business hasn't been strictly legal it don't hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you got in the V-8.\" There are some doubts as to the authenticity of the letter.\nGang and family members.\nIn February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried twenty family members and friends for aiding and abetting Barrow and Parker. This became known as the \"harboring trial\" and all twenty either pleaded guilty or were found guilty. The two mothers were jailed for thirty days. Other sentences ranged from two years' imprisonment for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond, to one hour in custody for Barrow's teenage sister Marie. Other defendants included Blanche, Jones, Methvin, and Parker's sister Billie.\nBlanche was permanently blinded in her left eye during the 1933 shootout at Dexfield Park. She was taken into custody on the charge of \"assault with intent to kill\". She was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison, but was paroled in 1939 for good behavior. She returned to Dallas, leaving her life of crime in the past, and lived with her invalid father as his caregiver. In 1940, she married Eddie Frasure. She worked as a taxi cab dispatcher and a beautician, and completed the terms of her parole one year later. She lived in peace with her husband until he died of cancer in 1969.\nWarren Beatty approached her to purchase the rights to her name for use in the 1967 film \"Bonnie and Clyde\", and she agreed to the original script. She objected to her characterization by Estelle Parsons in the final film, describing the actress's Academy Award-winning portrayal of her as \"a screaming horse's ass\". Despite this, she maintained a firm friendship with Beatty. She died from cancer at age 77 on December 24, 1988, and was buried in Dallas's Grove Hill Memorial Park under the name \"Blanche B. Frasure\".\nBarrow cohorts Hamilton and Palmer, who escaped Eastham in January 1934, were recaptured. Both were convicted of murder and executed in the electric chair at Huntsville, Texas on May 10, 1935. \nJones had left Barrow and Parker six weeks after the three of them evaded officers at Dexfield Park in July 1933. He reached Houston and got a job picking cotton, where he was soon discovered and captured. He was returned to Dallas, where he dictated a \"confession\" in which he claimed to have been kept a prisoner by Barrow and Parker. Some of the more lurid lies that he told concerned the gang's sex lives, and this testimony gave rise to many stories about Barrow's ambiguous sexuality. Jones was convicted of the murder of Doyle Johnson and served a lenient sentence of fifteen years.\nHe gave an interview to \"Playboy\" magazine during the excitement surrounding the 1967 movie: \"That Bonnie and Clyde movie made it all look sort of glamorous, but like I told them teenaged boys sitting near me at the drive-in showing: 'Take it from an old man who was there. It was hell. Besides, there's more lawmen nowadays with better ways of catching you. You couldn't get away, anyway. The only way I come through it was because the Good Lord musta been watching over me. But you can't depend on that, neither, because He's got more folks to watch over now than He did then.'\"\nW.D. Jones was killed on August 20, 1974, in a misunderstanding by a jealous boyfriend of a woman whom he was trying to help.\nMethvin was convicted in Oklahoma of the 1934 murder of Constable Campbell at Commerce. He was paroled in 1942 and killed by a train in 1948. He fell asleep drunk on the train tracks, although some have speculated that he was pushed by someone seeking revenge. His father Ivy was killed in 1946 by a hit-and-run driver. Parker's husband Roy Thornton was sentenced to five years in prison for burglary in March 1933. He was killed by guards on October 3, 1937, during an escape attempt from Eastham prison.\nLaw enforcement.\nHamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies. According to Guinn, \"his reputation suffered somewhat after Gibsland\" because many people felt that he had not given Barrow and Parker a fair chance to surrender. He made headlines again in 1948 when he and Governor Coke Stevenson unsuccessfully challenged the vote total achieved by Lyndon Johnson during the election for the U.S. Senate. He died in 1955 at the age of 71, after several years of poor health. Bob Alcorn died on May 23, 1964, 30 years to the day after the Gibsland ambush.\nPrentiss Oakley admitted to friends that he had fired prematurely. He succeeded Henderson Jordan as sheriff of Bienville Parish in 1940.\nOn April 1, 2011, officials of the Texas Rangers, Texas Highway Patrol, and Texas Department of Public Safety honored the memory of patrolman Edward Bryan Wheeler, who was murdered along with officer H. D. Murphy by the Barrow gang on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1934. They presented the Yellow Rose of Texas commendation to his last surviving sibling, 95-year-old Ella Wheeler-McLeod of San Antonio, giving her a plaque and framed portrait of her brother.\nIn popular culture.\nFilms.\nHollywood has treated the story of Bonnie and Clyde several times, including the movies \"The Bonnie Parker Story\" (1958), \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967), and \"The Highwaymen\" (2019).\nMusic.\nThe partnership of Bonnie and Clyde has popularized the term \"ride-or-die\" to describe unwavering loyalty between a duo. Some songs dive deeply into the story of Bonnie and Clyde, narrating their infamous romance and criminal exploits, while others merely reference their names as symbols of rebellion or loyalty, without the lyrics directly relating to their lives.

{"id": "68245", "revid": "44220063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68245", "title": "Bonnie and Clyde (film)", "text": "1967 film by Arthur Penn\nBonnie and Clyde is a 1967 American biographical crime film directed by Arthur Penn and respectively starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, outlaws and romantic partners in the Great Depression-era American South. The cast also features Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons. The screenplay was written by David Newman and Robert Benton (with uncredited contributions by Beatty and Robert Towne); Beatty also produced the film.\nThe film was released in the United States by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts on August 13, 1967. It is considered an \"American\" American film. Initial critical reception was mixed, but later swung positive, and the film became a significant commercial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1967. It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including for Best Picture, winning Best Supporting Actress (for Estelle Parsons) and Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey).\n\"Bonnie and Clyde\" is considered one of the first films of the New Hollywood era and a landmark picture. It broke many cinematic taboos and for some members of the counterculture, the film was considered a \"rallying cry\". Its success prompted other filmmakers to be more open in presenting sex and violence in their films. The film's ending became famous as \"one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history\". In 1992, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was ranked 27th on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American films of all time and 42nd on its 2007 list.\nPlot.\nDuring the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker of Texas meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued by Clyde and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative. Bonnie and Clyde turn from small-time heists to bank robbing.\nThe duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. Their exploits also become more violent. After C.W. botches parking during a bank robbery and delays their escape, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face when he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. Clyde's older brother Buck and his wife, Blanche, a preacher's daughter, also join them. The two women dislike each other at first sight, and their antipathy escalates. Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W., while Bonnie sees Blanche's flightiness as a constant danger to the gang's survival.\nIn Joplin, Missouri, local police show up at the gang's rented house after being alerted by a grocery delivery boy; two policemen are killed in a shootout. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, whom they capture and humiliate before leaving him adrift on a boat while handcuffed. The five outlaws then pull a heist, during which a police chase disables their vehicle. They steal Eugene Grizzard's car and take him and his girlfriend captive before quickly abandoning them when they learn he is an undertaker.\nBonnie wants to visit her family in Texas and give them part of the heist funds, to which Clyde reluctantly acquiesces despite the risk. The gang is caught off guard by an ambush by law enforcement overnight, resulting in many casualties. Buck is mortally wounded by a shot to his head, and Blanche is injured in one eye, losing sight in it. Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W. barely escape alive, while Blanche falls into police custody. Hamer then tricks her into revealing C.W.'s name (until then he was only an \"unidentified suspect\").\nC.W. takes the wounded Bonnie and Clyde to hide out at the house of his father Ivan, who thinks the couple have corrupted his son (as evidenced by an ornate tattoo Bonnie convinced C.W. to get). The elder Moss makes a deal with Hamer: in exchange for mercy for C.W., he sets a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, as a nearby flock of birds flies away, the posse in the bushes gun the couple down. Hamer and his men come out of hiding and gather around the couple's bodies.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Warren Beatty as Clyde Barrow\nCast notes.\nGene Wilder was in his film debut as Eugene Grizzard, one of Bonnie and Clyde's hostages. His girlfriend Velma Davis was played by Evans Evans. The family gathering scene was filmed in Red Oak, Texas where many residents gathered to watch. When the filmmakers noticed Mabel Cavitt, a local schoolteacher, among the people gathered, she was cast as Bonnie Parker's mother.\nProduction and style.\nThe film was intended as a romantic and comic version of the violent gangster films of the 1930s, updated with modern filmmaking techniques. Arthur Penn portrayed some of the violent scenes with a comic tone, sometimes reminiscent of Keystone Cops-style slapstick films, then shifted disconcertingly into horrific and graphic violence. The film has the French New Wave directors' influence, both in its rapid shifts of tone, and in its choppy editing, which is particularly noticeable in its closing sequence.\nThe first handling of the script was in the early 1960s. Influenced by the French New Wave writers and not yet completed, Newman and Benton sent Penn an early draft. He already was engaged in production decisions for \"The Chase\" (1966) and could not get involved in the script for \"Bonnie and Clyde\". The writers sent their script to Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who made contributions but passed on the project, next directing \"Fahrenheit 451\". At Truffaut's suggestion, the writers, much excited (the film's producers were less so), approached filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard.\nSome sources claim Godard did not trust Hollywood and refused. Benton claimed that Godard wanted to shoot the film in New Jersey in January during the winter. He purportedly took offense when would-be producer Norah Wright objected that his desire was unreasonable, as the story took place in Texas, which has a warm climate year-round. Her partner Elinor Jones claimed the two did not believe Godard was right for the project in the first place. Godard's retort: \u00abJe vous parle de cin\u00e9ma, vous me parlez de m\u00e9t\u00e9o. Au revoir.\u00bb (\"I'm talking cinema and you're talking weather. Goodbye.\") After the 1968 Academy Awards, Godard sent Benton and Newman a cable that read, \"Now, let's make it all over again!\"\nSoon after the failed negotiations for production, Beatty was visiting Paris and learned through Truffaut of the project and its path. On returning to Hollywood, Beatty requested to see the script and bought the rights. A meeting with Godard was not productive. Beatty changed his approach and convinced the writers that while the script at first reading was very much of the French New Wave style, an American director was necessary for the subject.\nBeatty offered the directing position to George Stevens, William Wyler, Karel Reisz, John Schlesinger, Brian G. Hutton, and Sydney Pollack, all of whom turned it down. Penn turned it down several times before Beatty finally persuaded him to direct the film. Beatty was entitled to 40% of the profits of the film and gave Penn 10%.\nWhen Beatty was on board as producer only, his sister and actress Shirley MacLaine was a strong possibility to play Bonnie. When Beatty decided to play Clyde, they needed a different actress. Considered for the role were Jane Fonda, Tuesday Weld, Ann-Margret, Sharon Tate, Leslie Caron, Carol Lynley and Sue Lyon. Cher auditioned for the part, and Beatty begged Natalie Wood to play the role. Wood declined, to concentrate on her therapy, and acknowledged that working with Beatty before had been \"difficult\". Faye Dunaway later said that she won the part \"by the skin of her teeth!\"\nThe film is forthright in its handling of sexuality, but that theme was toned down from its conception. Originally, Benton and Newman wrote Clyde as bisexual. He and Bonnie were to have a three-way sexual relationship with their male getaway driver. Penn persuaded the writers that since the couple's relationship was underwritten in terms of emotional complexity, it dissipated the passion of the title characters. This would threaten the audience's sympathy for the characters, and might result in their being written off as sexual deviants because they were criminals. Others said that Beatty was unwilling to have his character display that kind of sexuality and that the Production Code would never have allowed such content in the first place. Clyde is portrayed as heterosexual and impotent.\n\"Bonnie and Clyde\" was one of the first films to feature extensive use of squibs\u2014small explosive charges, often mounted with bags of stage blood, that detonate inside an actor's clothes to simulate bullet hits. Released in an era when film shootings were generally depicted as bloodless and painless, the Bonnie and Clyde death scene was one of the first in mainstream American cinema to be depicted with graphic realism.\nBeatty originally wanted the film to be shot in black and white, but Warner Bros. rejected the idea. Much of the studio's senior management was hostile to the film, especially Jack L. Warner, who considered the subject matter an unwanted throwback to Warner Bros.' early period when gangster films were a common product. Moreover, Warner was already annoyed at Beatty for refusing to star in \"PT 109\" and defying Warner's favorite gesture of authority of showing the studio water tower with the \"WB\" logo on it. Beatty said, \"Well, it's got your name, but it's got my initials.\" Warner complained about the costs of the film's extensive location shooting in Texas, which exceeded its production schedule and budget, and ordered the crew back to the studio backlot. It already had planned to return for final process shots.\nMusic.\nThe instrumental banjo piece \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", performed by Flatt and Scruggs, was introduced to a worldwide audience as a result of its frequent use in the movie. Additional banjo music was written and performed by Doug Dillard. The use of this music is anachronistic because bluegrass dates from the mid-1940s rather than the 1930s. But the functionally similar old-time music genre was long established and widely recorded in the period of the film's events. Long out of print in vinyl and cassette formats, the film soundtrack was released on CD in 2009.\nHistorical accuracy.\nThe film considerably simplifies the lives of Bonnie and Clyde and their gang. They were allied with other gang members, were repeatedly jailed, and committed other murders. In the part of the movie where Bonnie and Clyde escape the ambush that killed Buck Barrow and captured Blanche, Bonnie is shown being wounded by a deputy sheriff, whom Clyde then kills. Although they escaped the ambush, no lawmen were killed. Between June 1933 and April 1934, however, the Barrow gang did kill three law officers in Texas and Oklahoma.\nOn the run, they suffered a horrific auto accident in which Bonnie was severely burned and disabled. In the scene depicting their death, Bonnie and Clyde are portrayed as having stopped their automobile, with Clyde exiting the car and then looking back at Bonnie as they realize they've been trapped, but reports say the car was still moving when lawmen opened fire.\nThe sequence with Wilder and Evans is based on the Barrow gang's kidnappings of undertaker H.D. Darby and his acquaintance Sophia Stone, near Ruston, Louisiana, on April 27, 1933. The real Darby and Stone were not romantically involved. The gang also stole Darby's car.\nThe film is considered to stray far from fact in its portrayal of Frank Hamer as a vengeful bungler who was captured, humiliated, and released by Bonnie and Clyde. Hamer was a decorated Texas Ranger when he was coaxed out of semi-retirement to hunt the couple down. He had never met them before he and his posse ambushed and killed them near Gibsland, Louisiana, on May 23, 1934. In 1968, Hamer's widow and son sued the movie producers for defamation of character over his portrayal. They obtained an out-of-court settlement in 1971.\nIn 1933, police found undeveloped film in Bonnie and Clyde's hastily abandoned hideout in Joplin, Missouri. When they printed the negatives, one showed Bonnie holding a gun in her hand and a cigar between her teeth. Its publication nationwide typed her as a dramatic gun moll. The film portrays the taking of this playful photo. It implies the gang sent photos\u2014and poetry\u2014to the press, but this is untrue. The police found most of the gang's items in the Joplin cache. Bonnie's final poem, read aloud by her in the movie, was not published until after her death, when her mother released it.\nThe only two surviving members of the Barrow Gang when the film was released in 1967 were Blanche Barrow and W. D. Jones. While Barrow had approved the depiction of her in the original script, she objected to the later rewrites. At the film's release, she complained about Estelle Parsons's portrayal of her, saying, \"That film made me look like a screaming horse's ass!\"\nRelease.\nThe film premiered as the opening film of the Montreal International Film Festival on August 4, 1967.\nAt first, Warner Bros. did not promote \"Bonnie and Clyde\" for general release, but mounted only limited regional releases that seemed to confirm its misgivings about the film's lack of commercial appeal. The film quickly did excellent sustained business in select urban theatres. While Jack Warner was selling the studio to Seven Arts Productions, he would have dumped the film but for the fact that Israel, of which Warner was a major supporter, had recently triumphed in the Six-Day War. Warner was feeling too defiant to sell any of his studio's films.\nMeanwhile, Beatty complained to Warner Bros. that if the company was willing to go to so much trouble for \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" (it had changed the coloration scheme at considerable expense), their neglect of his film, which was getting excellent press, suggested a conflict of interest; he threatened to sue the company. Warner Bros. gave Beatty's film a general release. Much to the surprise of Warner Bros.' management, the film became a major box-office success.\nReception and legacy.\nThe film was controversial at the time of release because of its apparent glorification of murderers, and for its level of graphic violence, which was unprecedented at the time. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cutups in \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\".\" He was so appalled that he began to campaign against the increasing brutality of American films.\nDave Kaufman of \"Variety\" criticized the film for uneven direction and for portraying Bonnie and Clyde as bumbling moronic types. Joe Morgenstern in \"Newsweek\" initially panned the film as a \"squalid shoot-'em-up for the moron trade\", but after seeing it a second time and noting the enthusiastic audience, he wrote a second article saying he had misjudged the film and praised it. Warner Bros. took advantage of this, marketing the film as having made a major critic change his mind about its virtues.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[A]s a re-creation of reality, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" can only be described as dishonest\u00a0... neither Faye Dunaway nor Warren Beatty acts in a proper Thirties mode, nor do they seem to understand the feelings of the desperate and the underprivileged. The actress' willowy modern charm is no more appropriate to the lethal, serpentine coldness of the real Bonnie Parker than the actor's sensitive, matinee idol's looks have the right style for the shoddy vanity of Clyde Barrow.\n\u2014Film historian Charles Higham in \"The Art of the American Film: 1900\u20131971\". (1973).\nRoger Ebert gave \"Bonnie and Clyde\" a positive review, giving it four stars out of four. He called the film \"a milestone in the history of American movies, a work of truth and brilliance\", adding, \"It is also pitilessly cruel, filled with sympathy, nauseating, funny, heartbreaking, and astonishingly beautiful. If it does not seem that those words should be strung together, perhaps that is because movies do not very often reflect the full range of human life.\" More than 30 years later, Ebert added the film to his list in \"The Great Movies\", writing: \"The movie opened like a slap in the face. American filmgoers had never seen anything like it.\" Film critics Dave Kehr and James Berardinelli have praised the film. Stephen Hunter, writing in \"Commentary\" in 2009, criticized the film's failure to adhere to the historical truth about Barrow, Parker, and Hamer.\nThe fierce debate about the film is discussed at length in the documentary \"\" (2009). This film chronicles what occurred as a result: \"The New York Times\" fired Crowther because his negative review seemed so out of touch with public opinion. Pauline Kael, who wrote a lengthy freelance essay in \"The New Yorker\" in praise of the film, where she attributes the Hollywood success of the film and its unsettled spirit to that of the French New Wave. She was subsequently hired as the magazine's new staff critic.\nThe film was not expected to perform well at the box office but was a sleeper hit and by year's end had earned $2.5million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada. It continued to perform well in 1968 and by March 1968 had been in the top 12 films at the US box office for 22 weeks. By the end of 1968 it had become the studio's second highest-grossing film of all time, behind \"My Fair Lady\", with rentals of $19\u00a0million. By July 1968, the film had earned rentals of $10\u00a0million outside of the US and Canada. Listal lists it as one of the top five grossing films of 1967, with $50.7\u00a0million in US sales, and $70\u00a0million worldwide.

He entered Baldwin-Wallace College in 1941 and joined Pi Lambda Phi International Fraternity, and two years later was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving in the all-black 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalo Soldiers.\nAccording to a 1962 article written by Trinidadian Olympic sprinter Mike Agostini for Australia's \"The Age\" newspaper, Dillard was first inspired as a youngster by Charley Paddock, who Agostini says visited Dillard at his high school and encouraged him to follow his dream of becoming an Olympic champion like himself.\nDillard returned to college in 1946, and resumed athletics, inspired by Jesse Owens, who, like him, was from Cleveland and had attended East Technical High School. He won the NCAA and AAU 120-yard and 220-yard hurdles in both 1946 and 1947, tying world records in both events with a 22.3 in the 220 in 1946 and a 13.6 in the 120. Between June 1947 and June 1948, he remained unbeaten in 82 consecutive finals, a record until broken by Ed Moses.\nOlympic Games.\nAt the trials for the 1948 Summer Olympics, Dillard failed to qualify for the 110 m hurdles event, but qualified for the 100 m after finishing third.\nAt the Games, Dillard reached the final, which seemed to end in a dead heat between Dillard and another American, Barney Ewell. The finish photo showed Dillard had won, equalling the World record as well. This was the first use of a photo finish at an Olympic Games. As a member of the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team, he won another gold medal at the London Games.\nFour years later, still a strong hurdler, Dillard did qualify for the 110 m hurdles event, and won the event in Helsinki. Another 4 \u00d7 100 m relay victory yielded Dillard's fourth Olympic title. Dillard attempted to qualify for a third Olympics in 1956, but failed (finishing seventh in the trials final). Earlier he took part in and won the gold medal in the 110 m hurdles at the 1953 Maccabiah Games.\nLater years.\nDillard worked for the Cleveland Indians baseball franchise in scouting and public relations capacities, and hosted a radio talk show on Cleveland's WERE. He also worked for the Cleveland City School District for many years as its business manager. Dillard died on November 15, 2019, at the age of 96, of stomach cancer. At the time of his death he was the United States' oldest living Olympic gold medallist.\nWorld Rankings.\nDillard was ranked among the best in the world in both the 100 m/100 y sprint and 110 m/120 y sprint hurdle events from 1947 to 1953, according to the votes of the experts of \"Track and Field News\".\nWorld Records.\nDillard in his career posted the following world record and world best times.\nDillard achieved the following world records during his track career:\nHe also ran the following world best times that were never ratified by the sport's governing body, the IAAF:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"sovereignty dispute\" column indicates states having undisputed sovereignty (189 states, of which there are 188 UN member states and one UN General Assembly non-member observer state), states having disputed sovereignty (14 states, of which there are 5 UN member states, 1 UN General Assembly non-member observer state, and 8 de facto states), and states having a special political status (two states, both in free association with New Zealand).\nCompiling a list such as this can be complicated and controversial, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list, please see the \"criteria for inclusion\" section below. The list is intended to include entities that have been recognised as having \"de facto\" status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms.\nCriteria for inclusion.\nThe dominant customary international law standard of statehood is the declarative theory of statehood, which was codified by the Montevideo Convention of 1933. The Convention defines the state as a person of international law if it \"possess[es] the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) a capacity to enter into relations with the other states\" so long as it was not \"obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure\".\nDebate exists on the degree to which recognition should be included as a criterion of statehood. The declarative theory of statehood argues that statehood is purely objective and recognition of a state by other states is irrelevant. On the other end of the spectrum, the constitutive theory of statehood defines a state as a person under international law only if it is recognised as sovereign by other states. For the purposes of this list, included are all polities that consider themselves sovereign states (through a declaration of independence or some other means) and either:\nIn some cases, there is a divergence of opinion over the interpretation of the first point, and whether an entity satisfies it is disputed. Unique political entities which fail to meet the classification of a sovereign state are considered proto-states.\nOn the basis of the above criteria, this list includes the following 205 entities:\nThe table includes bullets in the right-hand column representing entities that are either not sovereign states or have a close association to another sovereign state. It also includes subnational areas where the sovereignty of the titular state is limited by an international agreement.

{"id": "68259", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68259", "title": "Communications in Argentina", "text": "Communications in Argentina gives an overview of the postal, telephone, Internet, radio, television, and newspaper services available in Argentina.\nGovernment and Communication.\nThe history of communication in Argentina dates back to 1916. Early Argentinian press outlets participated in writing journals seemingly \u201cobjectively\u201d. However, scholars such as Luc\u00eda Vincent (2009) noted covert agreements or arrangements between political authorities and communication providers. They disseminated objective information, creating an illusion of \u201cmedia independence,\u201d but, instead, communication service providers usually responded to prominent political powers. This is, from the beginning, what made communication in Argentina different from English-speaking communication media. As opposed to communication in Argentina, English-speaking countries\u2019 communication is primarily and highly independent. \nThroughout Peron\u2019s democratic period (1946-1955), media became central to the government's communication strategy. Radio and cinema were used to promote government policies, and television emerged as a new and significant medium.\nDuring the dictatorship (1976-1983), the information was centralized and coordinated propaganda was implemented. Amidst this period, the regime also imposed severe censorship, closed down media organizations, and subjected journalists to repression.\nAfter the return to democracy in 1983, Alfons\u00edn\u2019s government (1983-1989) generally promoted media pluralism and democratic practices, although reforms like the \"Ley de radiodifusi\u00f3n\" were not implemented. Government-media interactions, such as interviews, press conferences, and regular communication became more institutionalized. Television's influence grew, and media outlets began to transition from being intermediaries to independent political actors, shaping public debate.\nDuring Carlos Menem\u2019s administration (1989\u20131999), television and radio played a central role in shaping public perception. Frequent corruption scandals were prominent in media coverage, and television became a powerful tool for influencing public opinion, reinforcing the media's role in the political sphere.\nIn N\u00e9stor Kirchner's administration (2003\u20132007) and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s (2007\u20132015), the relationship between the government and the media was marked by tension. N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u2019s government publicly questioned the media for how they concentrated power and shaped public opinion. The government advocated for media pluralism and democracy, ensuring multiple voices and perspectives could reach the public, rather than leaving communication dominated by a few large outlets. This led to the 2009 Audiovisual Services Law (known in Argentina as \"Ley de medios\"), which introduced new regulations for broadcasting but did not resolve the ongoing debates about media roles, pluralism, and public communication.\nIn the course of Mauricio Macri\u2019s administration (2015-2019), there was a significant growth in digital media platforms. The widespread accessibility of the Internet empowered individuals to produce online content and actively participate in public discourse.\nNowadays, digital media plays a pivotal role in influencing citizens\u2019 perceptions and opinions regarding Argentina\u2019s political, economic, and social landscape. There are more than 30 streaming channels in Argentina, Luzu TV, La Misa, and Olga being the most important ones among young adults.\nPostal.\nThe national postal service, Correo Argentino, was established in 1826, privatized in 1997, and partly re-nationalized in 2003. There are no standard abbreviations for provinces' names; but the province name is optional and usually not needed if the postal code is correct. The format of the postal code was expanded in 1998 to include more specific information on location within cities; it now uses a letter that identifies the province, a four-digit number, and then three more letters (and slightly different numbers are used for different parts of a city, which was formerly done only in the case of Buenos Aires). See Argentine postal code for details.\nTelephone.\nThe network was initially developed primarily by ITT, and grew following the system's nationalization in 1948 and the creation of the ENTel State enterprise. Its limitations notwithstanding, ENTel gave Argentines the widest access to phone service in Latin America. Following ENTel's privatization in 1990, a new numbering plan was enacted, and the number of lines grew to cover the majority of households. A sizable minority of households, do not have land line telephone service, however. The growth of the mobile telephone market since the beginning of the economic recovery in 2003 has been impressive, with new customers now preferring a comparatively cheap cellular phone to land line household service.\nAs of January 2010, there are 9.2 million land lines, 50 million cellular phones and 143,000 public phones in the country. The domestic telephone trunk network is served by microwave radio relay and a domestic satellite system with 40 earth stations. It carries a monthly traffic of about 1.3 billion local calls, 400 million inter-city calls and around 24 million outgoing international calls.\nInternational communications employ satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); two international gateways near Buenos Aires; Atlantis II submarine cable (1999).\nThis system is largely replaced with a domestic fiber optic ring connecting the main cities (actually the main central offices). This link runs at 2.5\u00a0Gbit/s. From these head central offices, local calls are routed through 10\u00a0Gbit/s fiber optic links, or 3 \u00d7 155\u00a0Mbit/s microwave links. These links are spaced at about 30\u00a0km. Some of these links (the ones serving smaller towns) are spaced at 60\u00a0km and this makes communications unreliable in certain weather conditions.\nAccording to a report released in January 2006 by INDEC, mobile phone lines increased by 68.8% during 2005. Eleven million mobile phones were sold that year and, by then, these serviced three-quarters of the population over 14. A growing minority of users are children under 14, something that has raised concern and debate in Argentine society. A private study conducted by \"Investigaciones Econ\u00f3micas Sectoriales\" (IES), covering January\u2013October 2006, found a 51.2% growth compared to the same period of 2005; by December 2007, the number of these units (40 million) exceeded Argentina's total population. Most of the phones (almost 90%) are imported from Brazil or Mexico. The monthly volume of calls made with these units (over 4.6 billion) more than doubles the number made on land lines; a further 6 billion text messages are sent, monthly.\nCompanies.\nIn the 1990s the Argentine telephone system (which was formerly property of a state-owned company, ENTEL) was sold to two private corporations looking to invest in the local market: Telef\u00f3nica, a telco from Spain, and Telecom Argentina, owned by Telecom Italia and the Argentine Werthein family. The country was divided in two zones, within which one of the companies was the exclusive provider of the service (a state-sanctioned monopoly).\nThe service was then deregulated in several steps, first allowing the participation of other companies to provide international phone call services, then mobile services and finally the domestic service.\nTelecom has a subsidiary Internet service provider, Arnet. Other ISPs, such as Flash (property of the Clar\u00edn group), hire the facilities of Telecom and Telef\u00f3nica.\nSeveral newcomer companies in the telephone market (2005) offer high-speed broadband access, Voice over IP and other services to a restricted market group (businesses and high-level residential users).\nInternet.\nThe number of Internet users in the country as of 2011 has been estimated at 27 million (two thirds of the population), the number of registered domain names was approx. 1.7 million in August 2008 and the number of internet hosts in 2009, 6,025,000.\nBesides monthly-paid Internet connections (either flat rate or with a number of free minutes), in Argentina there are also a number of Internet service providers that have commercial agreements with the telephone companies for charging a slightly higher communication rate to the user for that communication, though without any monthly fixed fee. There were around 12 million PCs registered in Argentina in 2011. The number of residential and business internet networks totaled around 5.7 million in 2011, of which around 5.5 million were broadband connections, mainly ADSL.\nThe number of dial-up users has decreased drastically since 2005 in favor of broadband internet access. This latter service grew from under 800,000 networks in late 2005 (compared to over 500,000 dial-up connections), to nearly 2.6 million by December 2007, and to over 5 million by late 2010 (82% of which were residential and 81% of which connected at a speed of least 512\u00a0kbit/s).Wireless and satellite networks expanded markedly during 2008\u201309, and totaled over 1.5 million in March 2011. Among residential users, 38.3% were located in Buenos Aires Province (including Greater Buenos Aires), 26.0% in the city of Buenos Aires, 8.2% in C\u00f3rdoba and 7.4% in Santa Fe Province.\nAmong companies and organizations, 788,000 connection contracts were valid as of March 2011, 98% of which were broadband. Among the total (in late 2010), 44.7% correspond to the city of Buenos Aires, 21.1% to the Buenos Aires Province, 7.6% to Santa Fe Province, 6.0% to C\u00f3rdoba Province and 4.5% to Patagonia.\nThe number of e-mail accounts in March 2011 was estimated at around 4.56 million, with a monthly traffic of 3 billion messages.\nArgentina's Internet top-level domain is .ar.\nBroadband Internet access.\nADSL first appeared in Argentina in 1998, through Speedy by Telef\u00f3nica de Espa\u00f1a, a Spanish company. Fibertel, a cable provider, now offers Cablemodem service in a limited range of cities, and ADSL is monopolized by the 2 major phone companies: Telecom in the north with Arnet ADSL, and Telef\u00f3nica in the south with Speedy ADSL.\nIn 2004, Arnet announced new plans. Controversy ensued, as in small print it mentioned that it was capped to 4\u00a0GB monthly. This plans were never put in practice until late 2005, though they were modified from the original announcements. There are no longer any capped plans. As of June 2010, they currently offer from 1\u00a0Mbit/256\u00a0kbit/s download/upload at around 20 USD/mo to 20\u00a0Mbit/s / 512\u00a0kbit/s for home users at about 77 USD/mo. Arnet has been slowly recovering its reputation, which was tarnished amongst connoisseurs due to their 2004 announcement.\nCensorship.\nArgentina is not individually classified by the OpenNet Initiative, but is included in the ONI regional overview for Latin America.\nThe regulation of Internet content addresses largely the same concerns and strategies seen in North America and Europe, focusing on combating the spread of child pornography and restricting child access to age-inappropriate material. As Internet usage in Argentina increases, so do defamation, hate speech, copyright, and privacy issues.\nArgentina has strengthened intellectual property rights protections by drafting and updating laws and ratifying international agreements such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty.\nSince the 1997 presidential declaration regarding \"Free Speech on the Internet\" that guarantees Internet content the same constitutional protections for freedom of expression, Argentina has become a haven for neo-Nazi and race-hate groups around the region. In 2000 an Argentine appellate court affirmed a lower court's dismissal of a claim that a Yahoo! site selling Nazi memorabilia violated Argentina's anti-discrimination law (no. 23.592), holding that the equivalent restrictions of non-Internet speech would be unacceptable. Under Argentina's anti-discrimination law a crime is aggravated if racism is involved.\nThe defendant in the 2006 case Jujuy.com v. Omar Lozano was found liable for publishing slanderous content on his Web site after imputing adulterous conduct to a couple and failing to remove the content promptly. An injunction was imposed and damages were set at $40,000 (USD).\nProsecutors and police pursue cases of Internet child pornography. In June 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing child pornography; however, the law does not penalize possession by individuals for personal use.\nIn 2010 an appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling that found Google and Yahoo liable for defamation for including sex-related Web sites in their search results for an Argentine entertainer. The appeals court ruling said the firms could be held liable for defamation only if they were made aware of clearly illegal content and were negligent in removing it.\nIn August 2011 a judge ordered all ISPs to block the site LeakyMails, a Web site that obtains and publishes documents exposing corruption in Argentina. In response some internet service providers blocked the website IP address 216.239.32.2 which is linked to more than one million blogs hosted on Google's Blogger service disrupting the access to all of them.\nIn November 2012 the CNC () ordered the blocking of websites that contained information about bootloader unlocking of netbooks supplied by the Argentine Government. The legality of these actions in Argentina remains controversial.\nIn July 2014 the CNC () ordered local ISPs to block The Pirate Bay due an injunction of CAPIF () against the popular Torrent index.\nCAPIF is an Argentine music industry group and a member of International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The CNC is an agency of the Argentine Government created to certify wireless devices; to regulate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, cable and postal services.\nIn retaliation for the blocking, the online site of CAPIF was hacked and turned into a Pirate Bay Proxy server.\nRadio.\nRadio broadcasting in Argentina is predated only by radio in the United States, and began on August 27, 1920, when Richard Wagner's \"Parsifal\" was broadcast by a team of medical students (the \"madmen on the roof\") led Enrique Susini in Buenos Aires' Teatro Coliseo. Only about twenty homes in the city had a receiver to tune in. The world's first radio station was the only one in the country until 1922, when \"Radio Cultura\" went on the air; by 1925, there were twelve stations in Buenos Aires and ten in other cities. The 1930s were the \"golden age\" of radio in Argentina, with live variety, news, soap opera and sport shows.\nThe medium, which was nationalized by President Juan Per\u00f3n between 1947 and 1953, has historically been broadcast by a combination of state and private-sector operators, and most of the highest-rated stations are presently owned by a number of media conglomerates. Internet radio was first broadcast in Argentina in 2001 and by 2009, 61 stations did so, nationwide.\nThere are currently 260 AM broadcasting and 1150 FM broadcasting radio stations in Argentina. Radio remains an important medium in Argentina. Music and youth variety programs dominate FM formats; news, debate, and sports are AM radio's primary broadcasts. Amateur radio is widespread in the country.\nCensorship.\nThe Federal Broadcasting Committee (COMFER) has continued to apply certain broadcasting regulations that were instituted during military rule. One such article \"banning creation of permanent privately owned networks\" was used to revoke the FM radio license of Radio Continental in 2008. Critics pointed out that the relevant law had been selectively applied and accused COMFER of attempting to suppress criticism of the government.\nA 2018 court case punished Radio 10 host Baby Etchecopar for comments made in his show \"El Angel\". Prosecutors collected eight pages of allegedly sexist remarks by Etchecopar and devised a programming schedule which they say \"promotes tolerance\". To avoid a harsher sentence, Etchecopar agreed to invite twenty gender specialists onto his program to speak uninterrupted for ten minutes at a time with no criticism following the appearance.\nTelevision.\nThe Argentine television industry is large and diverse, widely viewed in Latin America, and its productions seen around the world. Many local programs are broadcast by networks in other countries, and others have their rights purchased by foreign producers for adaptations in their own markets. Argentina has five major networks. All provincial capitals and other large cities have at least one local station. Argentines enjoy the highest availability of cable and satellite television in Latin America, similar to percentages in North America. Many cable networks operate from Argentina and serve the Spanish-speaking world, including Util\u00edsima Satelital, TyC Sports, Fox Sports en Espa\u00f1ol (with the United States and M\u00e9xico), MTV Argentina, Cosmopolitan TV, and the news network Todo Noticias.\nArgentine television broadcasting began in 1951 with the inaugural of state-owned Channel 7 (since privatized). A technology jealously guarded by U.S. broadcasters at the time, this was largely the achievement of Jewish-Argentine engineer and radio pioneer Jaime Yankelevich. Color television broadcasting, however, was not widely available until after 1978, when the government launched Argentina Televisora Color (ATC), now Channel 7 (Argentina's principal public television station). The prevalence of cable television, increasing steadily since the first CATV transmitter opened in the city of Jun\u00edn in 1965, is now the third-widest in the world, reaching at least 78% of households.\nRadio and television broadcasting, whose ownership structure had become increasingly concentrated since the 1980 Media Law, is regulated by a new law advanced by President Cristina Kirchner, and signed on November 11, 2009. This new policy would restrict the number of media licences per proprietor and allocate a greater share of these to the state and NGOs, thereby limiting the influence of the \"Clar\u00edn Group\" (the largest media conglomerate in Argentina) and other media companies, such as the conservative \"La Naci\u00f3n\".\nThere are currently 42 television broadcast stations and 12.5 million television sets in Argentina.\nNewspapers.\nThe print media industry is highly developed and independent of the government, with more than two hundred newspapers. The major national newspapers are from Buenos Aires, including the centrist \"Clar\u00edn\", the best-selling daily in Latin America and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world. Other nationally circulated papers are \"La Naci\u00f3n\" (center-right, published since 1870), \"P\u00e1gina/12\" (left-wing), \"\u00c1mbito Financiero\" (business conservative), \"Ol\u00e9\" (sports) and \"Cr\u00f3nica\" (populist).\nTwo foreign language newspapers enjoy a relatively high circulation: the \"Argentinisches Tageblatt\" in German and the \"Buenos Aires Herald\", published since 1876. Major regional papers include \"La Voz del Interior\" (C\u00f3rdoba), \"R\u00edo Negro\" (General Roca), \"Los Andes\" (Mendoza), \"La Capital\" (Rosario), \"El Tribuno\" (Salta) and \"La Gaceta\" (Tucuman). The most circulated newsmagazine is \"Noticias\". The Argentine publishing industry, which includes Atl\u00e1ntida, Eudeba, and Emec\u00e9, among numerous others, ranks with Spain's and Mexico's as the most important in the Spanish-speaking world, and includes the largest bookstore chain in Latin America, El Ateneo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "68260", "revid": "24198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68260", "title": "Stock market downturn of 2002", "text": "Downturn in international stock prices\nIn 2001, stock prices took a sharp downturn (some say \"stock market crash\" or \"the Internet bubble bursting\") in stock markets across the United States, Canada, Asia, and Europe. After recovering from lows reached following the September 11 attacks, indices slid steadily starting in March 2002, with dramatic declines in July and September leading to lows last reached in 1997 and 1998. The U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the euro, reaching a 1-to-1 valuation not seen since the euro's introduction.\nBackground.\nThis downturn can be viewed as part of a larger bear market or correction that began in 2000 after a decade-long bull market had led to unusually high stock valuations, according to a report by the Cleveland Federal Reserve. The collapse of Enron is a prime example. Many internet companies (Webvan, Exodus Communications, and Pets.com) went bankrupt. Others (Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo!) went down dramatically in value, but remain in business to this day and have generally good long-term growth prospects. An outbreak of accounting scandals, (Arthur Andersen, Adelphia, Enron, and WorldCom) was also a factor in the speed of the fall, as numerous large corporations were forced to restate earnings (or lack thereof) and investor confidence suffered. The September 11 attacks also contributed heavily to the stock market downturn, as investors became unsure about the prospect of terrorism affecting the United States economy.\nThe International Monetary Fund had expressed concern about instability in United States stock markets in the months leading up to the sharp downturn. The technology-heavy NASDAQ stock market peaked on March 10, 2000, hitting an intra-day high of 5,132.52 and closing at 5,048.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a price-weighted average (adjusted for splits and dividends) of 30 large companies on the New York Stock Exchange, peaked on January 14, 2000, with an intra-day high of 11,750.28 and a closing price of 11,722.98. In 2001, the DJIA was largely unchanged overall but had reached a secondary peak of 11,337.92 (11,350.05 intra-day) on May 21.\nThe downturn may be viewed as a reversion to average stock market performance in a longer-term context. From 1987 to 1995, the Dow rose each year by about 10%, but from 1995 to 2000, the Dow rose 15% a year. While the bear market began in 2000, by July and August 2002, the index had only dropped to the same level it would have achieved if the 10% annual growth rate followed during 1987\u20131995 had continued up to 2002.\nSeeking a bottom.\nAfter falling for 11 of 12 consecutive days closing below Dow 8000 on July 23, 2002, the market rallied. The Dow rose 13% over the next four trading days, but then fell sharply again in early August. On August 5, the NASDAQ fell below its July 23 low. However, the markets rose sharply over the rest of the week, and eventually surpassed Dow 9000 during several trading sessions in late August. After that, the Dow dropped to a four-year low on September 24, 2002, while the NASDAQ reached a 6-year low. The markets continued their declines, breaking the September low to five-year lows on October 7 and reaching a bottom (below Dow 7200 and just above 1100 on the NASDAQ) on October 9. Stocks recovered slightly from their October lows to year-end, with the Dow remaining in the mid-8000s from November 2002 to mid-January 2003. The markets reached a final low below Dow 7500 in mid-March 2003.\nScale.\nAs of September 24, 2002, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 27% of the value it held on January 1, 2001: a total loss of 5 trillion dollars. The Dow Jones had already lost 9% of its peak value at the start of 2001, while the Nasdaq had lost 44%. At the March 2000 top, the sum in valuation of all NYSE-listed companies stood at $12.9 trillion, and the valuation sum of all NASDAQ-listed companies stood at $5.4 trillion, for a total market value of $18.3 trillion. The NASDAQ subsequently lost nearly 80% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 50% to reach the October 2002 lows. The total market value of NYSE (7.2) and NASDAQ (1.8) companies at that time was only $9 trillion, for an overall market loss of $9.3 trillion.\nIndex levels.\nTo put the downturn of 2002 in perspective, here is a look at annual U.S. stock market declines in 2000, 2001, and 2002:\nHere is a historical view of the stock market downturn of 2002 including figures from the stock market bubble of the late 1990s:\n\u00a7Values represent percent change from previous date listed in table.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nNB: Registration required for all links"}
