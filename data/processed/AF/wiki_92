The 76ers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Xfinity Mobile Arena located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.\nFounded in 1946 and originally known as the Syracuse Nationals, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only 8 out of 23 to survive the league's first decade. The team is owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2011.\nThe 76ers have had a prominent history, with many Hall of Fame players having played for the organization, including Dolph Schayes, Hal Greer, Wilt Chamberlain, Chet Walker, Billy Cunningham, George McGinnis, Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and Allen Iverson.\nThe 76ers have won three NBA championships. Their first came as the Syracuse Nationals, in 1955, before the franchise moved to Philadelphia. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since, in 2001, when they were led by Iverson and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. Chamberlain, Erving, Malone, Iverson, and Joel Embiid have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the 76ers, for a total of seven MVP awards.\nHistory.\n1946\u20131963: Syracuse Nationals.\nIn 1946, Italian immigrant Danny Biasone established the Syracuse Nationals of the National Basketball League (NBL) in Syracuse, New York, for $5,000. While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns, the Nationals put together a 21\u201323 record, finishing in fourth place. In the playoffs, the Nationals were beaten by the Rochester Royals in four games. In their second season, 1947\u201348, the Nationals struggled, finishing in fifth place with a 24\u201336 record. Despite their record, they made the playoffs, and were swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in three straight games.\nPrior to the 1948\u201349 season, four teams left the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger was laid. The Nationals \"recipe for success\" began by recruiting Leo Ferris. Staying in the NBL, Ferris signed Al Cervi to be player-coach and outbid the New York Knicks for the services of Dolph Schayes who made his professional debut, leading the Nationals to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40\u201323. In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the NBA, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA. From 1949 to 1956, the team would wear gold on their \"Nats\" home jersey while wearing gold \"Syracuse\" jerseys from 1953 to 1956.\nThe Nationals were an instant success in the NBA, winning the Eastern Division in the 1949\u201350 season, with a league-best record of 51\u201313. In the playoffs the Nationals continued to play solid basketball, beating the Philadelphia Warriors in two games. Moving on to the Eastern Finals, the Nationals battled the New York Knickerbockers, beating their big-city rivals in a three-game series. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals faced a fellow NBL alum in the Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nationals lost just their second home game of the season, 68\u201366. The Nationals did not recover, as they fell behind 3\u20131 before falling in six games.\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950\u201351 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, 1950\u201351, the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32\u201334. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91\u201389. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points.\nCervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951\u201352 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40\u201326 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games.\nThe Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952\u201353 season, with a record of 47\u201324. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the Boston Celtics, dropping Game 1 at home 87\u201381. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111\u2013105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.\nThe Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953\u201354 season. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title, falling two games short with a 42\u201330 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout.\nWith the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams during the 1954\u201355 season, Nationals owner Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time that could be taken for a shot, thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nationals' general manager Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter, speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The shot clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league-wide. In the first season of the shot clock, the Nationals would take first place in the East with a 43\u201329 record. After a first-round bye the Nationals would beat the Celtics in four games to reach the NBA Finals for the second straight season. In the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons. As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3\u20132 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on, the Nationals kept their championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109\u2013104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92\u201391 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\nComing off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the 1955\u201356 season, needing a tiebreaker over the Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35\u201337 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals stunned the Celtics by winning the first-round series in three games, taking the final two. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Warriors to a decisive fifth game. The Nationals' reign as defending champions ended with a 109\u2013104 loss in Philadelphia. After the season, the team dropped gold from their uniforms, wearing just red and blue for the remainder of their tenure.\nThe Nationals got off to a slow start as coach Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956\u201357 season in second place with a record of 38\u201334. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors but advanced to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957\u201358 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. Regardless, they still finished in second place with a 41\u201331 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\nDespite a mediocre 35\u201337 record for the 1958\u201359 season the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7.\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks and Elgin Baylor of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own, posting a solid 45\u201330 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959\u201360 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960\u201361 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38\u201341 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\nSchayes missed 24 games during the 1961\u201362 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41\u201339 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination, the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121\u2013104 victory.\nWith an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the 1962\u201363 season, with a record of 48\u201332. In the playoffs the Nationals faced the Cincinnati Royals, getting off to a 2\u20131 series lead. Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131\u2013127.\nRelocation to Philadelphia.\nThe playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963 would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone and moved the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors, who had moved to San Francisco. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\". The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776. \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing, particularly in headlines. The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last six decades \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, and occasionally at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n1964\u20131968: Wilt Chamberlain era.\nIn the 1964\u201365 season, the 76ers acquired the legendary Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110\u2013109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek, the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.\n1966\u20131967: First title in Philadelphia.\nLed by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46\u20134, en route to a record of 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time. Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"\u2014a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966\u201367 76ers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration in October 1980.\n1967\u20131968: First year at the Spectrum.\nIn the 1967\u201368 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the 76ers in seven games.\n1968\u20131976: Fall of the 76ers.\nAt the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the 76ers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and general manager Jack Ramsay did not want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. However Chamberlain's replacement at center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade was followed by a freefall in the 76ers' performance, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.\nWhile the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round. In 1971\u201372, only five years after winning the title, the 76ers finished 30\u201352 and missed postseason play for the first time in franchise history.\nThe bottom fell out in the 1972\u201373 season. Ramsay left for the expansion Buffalo Braves, but the 76ers had trouble finding a replacement; Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp turned them down. Kosloff was so desperate for a replacement that he took out an ad in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer.\" It was answered by Roy Rubin, longtime head coach at Long Island University. For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA on the same day Rubin was introduced as head coach. This left the 76ers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4\u201358, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9\u201373 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the \"Nine and 73-ers\". Rubin was fired after 51 games and a 4\u201347 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5\u201326 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the 1972\u201373 squad notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the 2011\u201312 Charlotte Bobcats finished 7\u201359 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. The 76ers of 1972\u201373 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. In 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the 1992\u201393 Dallas Mavericks and 1997\u201398 Denver Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers, who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975\u201376 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n1976\u20131987: Julius Erving era.\nThe 76ers finally came all the way back in 1976\u201377, in large part due to the ABA\u2013NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing a burden of $5 million to the Knicks for entering the New York metropolitan area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the 76ers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million\u2014roughly the cost of NBA membership\u2014the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the 76ers to Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. on May 28, 1976.\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2\u20130 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers\u2014who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay\u2014only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\nThat led to the 1977\u201378 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4\u20132. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3\u20133 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120\u2013106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading the series 3\u20131. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers). The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n1982\u20131983: Third NBA championship.\nHarold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982\u201383 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and All-Stars Andrew Toney and Bobby Jones, they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"\u2014in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the three rounds. Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"\nThe 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u201301 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016\u20132017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16\u20131 playoff record. The Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&amp;B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.\nArrival of Charles Barkley.\nAfter a disappointing 1983\u201384 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984\u201385 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways. The 76ers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984\u201385 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54\u201328 record and the second round of the 1986 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant, to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty.\nOn the night of the 1986\u201387 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the 76ers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45\u201337 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance.\n1987\u20131992: Charles Barkley era.\nIn 1987\u201388, with the team's record at 20\u201323, Guokas was fired and replaced by assistant coach Jim Lynam. Lynam finished the season 16\u201323, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36\u201346. For the first time since the 1974\u201375 season, the 76ers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected Charles Smith with its first pick (third overall) in the 1988 NBA draft, then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), and Hersey Hawkins. In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Dana Barros, Sidney Green and draft picks in 1993.\nIn 1988\u201389, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept in the first round by the New York Knicks. In 1989\u201390, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the 76ers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53\u201329 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991\u201392 season, the 76ers went 35\u201347 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.\n1992\u20131996: Dark ages.\nLynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991\u201392 season, and hired Doug Moe to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the 76ers posting a 19\u201337 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32\u201376 record at the helm. Following the 1993\u201394 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42\u2013122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players at the end of their careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones\u2014drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers\u2014had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.\nStarting with the 1990\u201391 season, and ending with the 1995\u201396 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995\u201396 season, when they finished with an 18\u201364 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and 76ers, took over as president.\nMany 76ers fans call these years \"The Dark Ages\". After many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Questions remained, but with the first pick, the 76ers selected Allen Iverson, who was nicknamed \"the Answer\".\n1996\u20132006: Allen Iverson era.\nWith new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center, things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22\u201360 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996\u201397 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997\u201398. Early in the 1997\u201398 season, the 76ers traded Jerry Stackhouse, who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow, was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998.\nPrior to the 1998\u201399 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28\u201322 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3\u20131, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the 76ers improved to 49\u201333, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the 76ers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000\u201301.\n2000\u20132001 season: NBA Finals loss to the Lakers.\nDuring the 2000\u201301 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41\u201314 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kuko\u010d, and Pepe S\u00e1nchez to Atlanta (S\u00e1nchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56\u201326, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989\u201390 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79\u201378, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the 76ers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121\u201388 rout, and a Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88\u201387 victory that sent the 76ers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80\u201374. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110\u2013100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34\u201325 second-quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23\u20134 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108\u201391 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11\u20130 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale with both the 76ers and the Lakers finishing with identical 56\u201326 records, though Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers, the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\nIn Game 1, the Lakers jumped out to an 18\u20135 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94\u201394 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13\u20132 run for a 107\u2013101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98\u201389. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the 76ers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96\u201391. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100\u201386 win in Game Four and a 108\u201396 victory in Game Five.\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000\u201301 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie).\nDeparture of Larry Brown.\nThe 76ers went into the 2001\u201302 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3\u20132 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002\u201303 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the 76ers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the 76ers won another playoff series.\nOn Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an assistant coach under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21\u201331. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003\u201304 season at 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season.\nArrival of Andre Iguodala.\nFor the 2004\u201305 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43\u201339 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\nThough in the 2004\u201305 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005\u201306 season. A 2\u201310 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38\u201344 record.\nWith the opening of the 2006\u201307 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3\u20130 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35\u201347, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\nOn December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: \"find players who will help support me or trade me.\" This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, Ed Snider.\n2006\u20132016: Post-Iverson era.\nOn December 19, 2006, Allen Iverson, along with Ivan McFarlin, were sent to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for guard Andre Miller, forward Joe Smith, and two first-round draft picks. Then, on January 11, the 76ers' general manager Billy King announced that the 76ers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The 76ers paid Webber $36 million over the next 1\u00bd seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the 76ers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter. The moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. They finished the year 35\u201347.\nIn 2007, the 76ers drafted small forward Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick. On December 4, 2007, the 76ers fired King and replaced him with Nets' general manager Ed Stefanski.\nWith Iguodala, the 76ers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. They were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4\u20132. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the 76ers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on make the playoffs and a 40\u201342 record.\nOn July 9, 2008, the 76ers signed power forward Elton Brand to a five-year, $79.795 million contract, after trading Rodney Carney and renouncing their rights to all their unrestricted free agents. Brand had originally opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, looking to re-sign with them. But the 76ers offered him more money (he regarded their offer as the \"Philly-Max\") and a better chance at winning an NBA championship by playing in the Eastern Conference. This move has been the subject of controversy since there were rumors that he and Baron Davis had made a friendly agreement to play together for the Clippers. The team later signed free agent point guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks, Kareem Rush from the Indiana Pacers, and then signed former Sixer Theo Ratliff after Jason Smith's injury. Donyell Marshall was signed on September 2, 2008, after he stated to his agent that he wanted to go back home and end his career in Philadelphia. Rush, Ivey, Ratliff and Marshall were all paid the veteran's minimum salary, but they were to be contributors to a team on the rise. During the off-season, they also re-signed restricted free agents Lou Williams and Andre Iguodala.\nThe 76ers started the year with a 9\u201314 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo took over, and the 76ers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41\u201341 record, with a 32\u201327 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the 76ers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the 76ers still managed to fight their way into the playoffs. However, they did not find much success, as they were knocked out of the first round by the Orlando Magic; the 76ers had led 2\u20131 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the 76ers from the playoffs. It was also during this season that the 76ers played one home game at their old home, the Wachovia Spectrum. The 76ers won 104\u2013101 over the Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009. The game was played to provide the final curtain call on the Spectrum, which was scheduled to be imploded on New Year's Eve 2009.\nFollowing the playoff loss, Tony DiLeo returned to his front office job, creating a head coaching vacancy. Former Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan was introduced as the 76ers' new coach on June 1, 2009. In the 2009 off-season, the 76ers drafted UCLA point guard Jrue Holiday with the 17th pick. The 76ers also traded power forward Reggie Evans to the Toronto Raptors for a three-point specialist, small forward Jason Kapono, who had won back-to-back three-point shootouts in 2007 and 2008. The off-season also marked the return of the 1977\u201397 76ers logo, along with a redesigned court and new uniforms updating the 1980s ones.\nIverson's brief return.\nOn December 2, 2009, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had signed Iverson to a one-year prorated $1.3 million non-guaranteed contract. The 76ers were 5\u201313 at the time and had lost Williams for at least 30 games to injury. Iverson made his \"re-debut\" for the 76ers against the team he was traded to, the Denver Nuggets, to a thunderous ovation from the sell-out crowd, scoring 11 points, with six assists and five rebounds. The euphoria that greeted Iverson's return to the 76ers faded quickly. On February 22, Iverson announced he was leaving the 76ers indefinitely to attend to his daughter's illness, and a few weeks later the 76ers announced that Iverson would not return for the rest of the season. The 76ers finished the season with a record of 27\u201355, their first 50-loss season since 1998. Most cited the reason behind this as the players' inability to play within Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense, with several players unhappy with his system. Hours after the 76ers' last game at Orlando on April 14, the team fired Jordan after one season. He was the fourth coach to be fired after one season or less since Larry Brown left the team in 2003.\nOn May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers. Collins played for the 76ers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft, and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft, and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner.\nThe 76ers started the season with an uninspiring 3\u201313 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41\u201341 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the 76ers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\nOn July 13, 2011, Comcast-Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the 76ers to an investment group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris for $280\u00a0million. Other members of the group included David Blitzer, Art Wrubel, Jason Levien, Adam Aron, Martin Geller, David Heller, James Lassiter, Marc Leder, Michael Rubin, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Erick Thohir. Harris decided to retain head coach Doug Collins and president of basketball operations Rod Thorn but fired Ed Stefanski, who served as general manager since 2007.\nFor the season, the 76ers had their best start since 2000\u201301 with a 20\u20139 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. They finished the rest of the season 15\u201322, giving them a 35\u201331 record. Attributed to their lack of offense, the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing streak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season.\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the first-seeded Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4\u20132 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4\u20133. The 76ers again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring.\nIn an effort to re-tool for the upcoming season, The 76ers selected Maurice Harkless, and Arnett Moultrie (via trade with Miami) in the 2012 NBA draft. The 76ers then used their amnesty clause on Brand, traded for Dorell Wright, signed Nick Young, Kwame Brown, and Ivey, and re-signed Spencer Hawes, while Lavoy Allen, Williams, and Jodie Meeks left through free agency. On August 9, 2012, the 76ers agreed to a four-team trade with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic, and the Nuggets. In the trade that sent six-time All-Star Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Philadelphia agreed to send 2011 first-round pick Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107, 2012 first-round draft pick Harkless, and a future first-round draft pick to Orlando, as well as All-Star swingman Iguodala to Denver. In exchange, they received Jason Richardson from the Magic and All-Star center Andrew Bynum from the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe 76ers started the 2012\u201313 season with high expectations with the help of Bynum and the growth of the young 76ers. Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the 76ers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees. Bynum was not the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery. Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Turner and Hawes were the only 76ers to play in every game during the season. The 76ers started the season 12\u20139 but stumbled through a tough stretch and could not recover. The 76ers finished the season 34\u201348, missing the playoffs for the first time since Collins had taken over as head coach.\nOn April 18, Collins resigned as 76ers coach, citing his declining health and need to spend time with his grandchildren. He stayed with the team as an adviser. Soon after, general manager DiLeo had \"cut ties\" with the team. On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie, who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets, would replace DiLeo as general manager. On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil.\n2013\u20132016: \"The Process\".\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 season, the 76ers, led by Hinkie, chose to shift in the direction of rebuilding the franchise. Tony Wroten, guard for the 76ers, referred to the major rebuilding culture surrounding Philadelphia as \"The Process\". The first move of this new plan was executed during the 2013 draft, when the 76ers agreed in principle to trade All-Star Jrue Holiday and the 42nd pick in the draft, Pierre Jackson, to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nerlens Noel and the Pelicans' 2014 first-round pick. The trade was later made official on July 12. The trade was seen by some as somewhat surprising, as Holiday had been the team's marquee player and was coming off a season that saw him make his first NBA All-Star Game. Additionally, Noel was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered while in college, strongly indicating that he would not be able to make an immediate impact for the 76ers as he would be inactive to start the season. The 76ers used the 11th pick in the draft to select Michael Carter-Williams as Holiday's replacement as the starting point guard. The 76ers chose Arsalan Kazemi with the 54th overall pick, making Kazemi the first Iranian chosen in the NBA draft.\nFollowing the Holiday trade, many of the team's returning players were either waived or left the team in free agency, most notably Andrew Bynum; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their final game of the 2012\u201313 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were a number of young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the 76ers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, and Lavoy Allen, all of whom were key rotational players.\nThe 76ers had a 3\u20130 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. The 76ers struggled heavily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record, and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season. During the middle of the season, former Orlando Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy would call the Sixers' actions \"embarrassing\" and say \"if you're putting that roster on the floor, you're doing everything you can possibly do to try to lose.\" The 76ers finished the season with a 19\u201363 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the 76ers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Milwaukee Bucks finished worse with a 15\u201367 record.\nCarter-Williams led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, joining Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to accomplish this feat. He also won the player of the week award in his first week, being the second rookie after Shaquille O'Neal to accomplish that. He went on to win the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the first rookie drafted 10th or later to win the award since Mark Jackson in 1987 for the New York Knicks.\nIn the 2014 NBA draft, the Sixers selected Joel Embiid with the third overall pick and traded with the Orlando Magic for Croatian prospect Dario \u0160ari\u0107, the twelfth pick of the draft. Neither prospect was expected to make an immediate impact for the Sixers, as Embiid was recovering from a stress fracture in the navicular bone, while \u0160ari\u0107 would likely spend one or more years playing in the Turkish Basketball League. In the second round, the Sixers selected K. J. McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Jordan McRae, and Serbian prospect Vasilije Mici\u0107. The Sixers also traded a second-round pick to re-acquire Jackson from the Pelicans.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Sixers traded Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in the Kevin Love to Cleveland trade, and received the Heat's 2015 first-round draft pick, Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved, leaving only two players with three years of experience on the Sixers remaining.\nOn November 29, 2014, the 76ers lost to the Dallas Mavericks 103\u2013110 and set a franchise record for losses to start the season, as they fell to a record of 0\u201316. After losing their next game against the San Antonio Spurs to make it 0\u201317, the 76ers were on the verge of tying the NBA record of 18 straight losses to start a season if they lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 3, but they broke their losing streak and won their first game of the 2014\u201315 season with an 85\u201377 victory at Minnesota.\nA new training complex was opened in Camden, New Jersey, in September 2016. In three deals at the 2015 NBA trade deadline, the 76ers traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for JaVale McGee, Isaiah Canaan, and three draft picks, including a protected 2015 first-round pick originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers. The Sixers finished the season with an 18\u201364 record, tied with the second-worst in franchise history since 1995\u201396. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Timberwolves fared worse with a 16\u201366 record and Knicks fared second with 17\u201365 record.\nOn May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed JP Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116\u2013114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports. During the same game, the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 three pointers made during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Lakers at home by a score of 103\u201391, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014\u201315 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then-New Jersey Nets in the 2009\u201310 season.\nOn December 8, the 76ers announced that they would hire Jerry Colangelo, chairman of the board of directors for USA Basketball, as the Special Advisor to the Managing General Partner and Chairman of Basketball Operations. In the first move the team made after hiring Colangelo, they traded two second-round draft picks to the Pelicans in return for point guard Ish Smith. On March 1, 2016, the 76ers, at the time with a record of 8\u201351, missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. The 76ers finished the season 10\u201372.\n2016\u2013present: The Joel Embiid era.\n2016\u20132017: First year.\nOn April 6, 2016, Sam Hinkie resigned by way of a 7,000 word letter of resignation. On April 10, 2016, Bryan Colangelo, the son of Jerry Colangelo, was named president of basketball operations. In the NBA Draft Lottery, the Philadelphia 76ers earned the first pick in the draft, after they had a 25% chance of earning the spot.\nOn June 23, 2016, following the 2015\u201316 season, and after the 76ers were awarded the first overall pick in the 2016 draft, the team selected LSU Point Forward Ben Simmons first overall. The Sixers also selected French basketball player Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot and Turkish basketball player Furkan Korkmaz with the 24th and 26th picks in the 2016 NBA draft respectively. Many consider the 2016 NBA Draft a turning point for the 76ers after their three seasons of not being competitive resulted in the franchise garnering the first overall pick, the first time the team owned the first since 1996 when the 76ers selected point guard Allen Iverson first overall. The Sixers subsequently traded for another number one pick in the 2017 NBA draft, choosing Markelle Fultz.\n2017\u20132018: Return to playoffs.\nThe 2017\u201318 season was the most successful season since the 2011\u201312 season as the team finished the regular season in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 52\u201330 winning record and clinched a playoff spot. The season also saw the 76ers reaching a franchise-record 16-game winning streak. In the First Round of the playoffs, the Sixers defeated the Heat in five games, to win their first playoff series since the 2011\u201312 season.\n2018\u20132019: Jimmy Butler year.\nFollowing a controversy involving fake Twitter accounts, the 76ers parted ways with general manager Bryan Colangelo on June 7, 2018. The team promoted Elton Brand from executive vice president of basketball operations to fill the vacant general manager role on September 18, 2018.\nOn November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded \u0160ari\u0107, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.\nOn February 6, 2019, the 76ers acquired forward Tobias Harris, as well as Boban Marjanovi\u0107 and Mike Scott, in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, sending Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a protected 2020 first-round pick, Miami's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and Detroit's 2021 and 2023 second-round picks to the Clippers. The 76ers completed the season as the third seed. In the playoffs, they beat the Brooklyn Nets in five games in the first round and faced the second-seeded Toronto Raptors in the second round. The series went to seven games, which the 76ers lost 4\u20133, when Kawhi Leonard made a game-winning buzzer-beater in game 7 in Toronto.\nIn the off-season, Jimmy Butler left to sign with the Miami Heat in a sign and trade that brought Josh Richardson to Philadelphia. The team also signed Al Horford.\nOn November 25, 2019, the 76ers made history by signing a sports betting partnership with Fox Bet, the joint venture of online gambling operator The Stars Group and broadcaster Fox Sports. While the NBA has struck a number of partnerships with betting operators following the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal betting ban, the Fox Bet deal marked the first partnership between a betting operator and an individual NBA team.\n2020\u20132022.\nBefore the season, the Sixers were expected to be another championship contender, as they were in the past two seasons, especially with Kawhi Leonard having left the conference. The Sixers had one of the worst away records in the NBA, but their league-best home record, with only 2 losses, kept the team afloat in the playoff race.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the 76ers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. The Sixers started the bubble in the sixth seed, tied with the Pacers, who had the tiebreaker. The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4\u20130 sweep. Head coach Brett Brown was fired on August 24, 2020.\nOn October 3, 2020, the 76ers hired Doc Rivers as their new head coach. On November 2, the 76ers hired Daryl Morey to be their president of basketball operations. The 76ers went 49\u201323 and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference, capturing the division title for the first time in 20 years. In the opening round, they defeated the Washington Wizards in five games but lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Conference Semifinals in seven games. Franchise player Joel Embiid, placed second in the voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2020\u201321 regular season behind first-placed winner Nikola Joki\u0107.\nAfter the Game 7 loss to the Hawks in which Ben Simmons controversially passed on an open dunk to tie the game, Simmons demanded a trade and held out from participating in training camp. The 76ers fined Simmons for conduct detrimental to the team, reportedly in excess of $19 million.\n2022\u20132024.\nOn February 10, 2022, the 76ers acquired James Harden and Paul Millsap from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Simmons, Andre Drummond, Seth Curry, and two first-round picks. The 2021\u201322 season finished with a 51\u201331 record, led by Embiid, Harden, and second-year shooting guard Tyrese Maxey. Embiid won the scoring title averaging 30.6 points per game. In a repeat of the previous season's MVP race, Embiid finished second in the 2021\u201322 NBA Most Valuable Player Award contest behind Nikola Joki\u0107.\nOn June 24, the Sixers traded Danny Green and the 23rd pick of the draft who would turn out to be David Roddy for De'Anthony Melton. In a four team trade, the 76ers acquired Jalen McDaniels but had to give up perimeter defender Matisse Thybulle who got traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. The 2022\u201323 season was successful for the Sixers. They clinched a Playoff Spot on March 21. They finished the season 54\u201328 as the third seed. After sweeping the Brooklyn Nets, the Boston Celtics prevailed in 7 Games and gave the Sixers another second-round exit. Despite this, Joel Embiid was named league MVP.\nOn May 16, 2023, head coach Doc Rivers was fired and replaced by Nick Nurse on June 1. The Sixers traded James Harden, P. J. Tucker and Filip Petru\u0161ev to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marcus Morris, Robert Covington, and Nicolas Batum. The Sixers started the season 29\u201313 as the second seed in the East, but Joel Embiid tore his Lateral Meniscus. Embiid returned on March 5. During Joel's absence, the Sixers fell to the 8th Seed and Tyrese Maxey made his first All-Star game. They finished the season as the 7th seed with a record of 47\u201335, qualifying for the Play-in game. The Sixers made it out of the Play-In, beating the Miami Heat to advance to the playoffs but were beaten 4\u20132 in the first round by the New York Knicks.\n2024\u2013present: Arrival of Paul George.\nThat off-season, Paul George signed a four-year max contract deal with the Sixers. They also resigned Kyle Lowry and acquired Eric Gordon. Tobias Harris also signed with the Pistons.\nTeam identity.\n1963\u20131978.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers' original logo featured a stylized red \"7\" and blue \"6\" with 13 blue stars above the \"7\" to represent the original 13 American colonies. During this period the franchise employed many uniform changes.\nThe original uniform featured \"PHILA\" in front and the aforementioned 13 stars encircling the \"76\" on the shorts and the uniform number at the back. Monochrome red letters were emblazoned on either the blue road or white home uniform, and were written in a similar manner as the logo.\nDuring the 1965\u201366 season, the Sixers experimented with a two-tone design. The home white uniform now had a thick red band across the abdomen, while the road uniform featured red tops and blue shorts. \"PHILA\" was positioned below the uniform number. Players disliked the design and was replaced after only one season.\nThe Sixers unveiled a cleaner design for the 1966\u201367 season, with \"PHILA\" in red block letters and trimmed in either white or blue. \"PHILA\" was also moved back above the number. The logo and stars were removed in favor of simple side stripes. Initially, the Sixers wore blue uniforms on the road, but in 1968, they changed back to red uniforms with \"PHILA\" in white with blue trim.\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, the Sixers tinkered with their red uniforms, switching the color scheme on the letters to blue with white trim. Meanwhile, the white uniform received a more radical makeover, featuring the full name \"Seventy Sixers\" in red cursive lettering with blue trim. This set lasted for only one season.\nThe 1971\u201372 season saw the Sixers return to wearing blue uniforms on the road. After sporting \"PHILA\" on the chest for eight seasons, the uniform now read \"Sixers\" in Art Deco style lettering, rendered in white on the road and red at home. Numbers were either white or blue with red trim. Contrasting side stripes were added and extended through the uniform, and either red or white stars were placed on each side. Prior to the 1976\u201377 season, the Sixers tweaked the uniform, now sporting a block \"Sixers\" wordmark and rounded numbers. The following season, the \"Sixers\" wordmark was changed to Bookman Old Style; on both iterations, \"Sixers\" became blue with red trim on the white uniform, with an additional outline on the latter.\n1978\u20131997.\nIn 1977, the Sixers logo was tweaked to include a white basketball with blue outlines and the suffix \"-ers\" in blue, completing the team nickname. The following season saw the team go back to basics with their uniforms.\nStarting with the 1978\u201379 season, the Sixers wore a cleaner uniform design reminiscent of their late 1960s outfits. Side stripes were eliminated and the team logo was emblazoned on the right leg. The road uniform color was changed back to red (with the lettering scheme similar to the 1968\u201370 red uniforms), and the numbers revert to a block letter style.\nBefore the 1991\u201392 season, the Sixers experimented with a more radical uniform design. The front featured a blue wave with red, white and blue stars, and \"Sixers\" in Helvetica was affixed above the blue wave. The full city name \"Philadelphia\" was also added above the team name. The numbers contained drop shadows.\nAfter wearing the graphic-laden design for three seasons, the Sixers changed to a more basic look entering the 1994\u201395 season. The design contained thick blue stripes within either thin red or white stripes, and the letters were changed to a more classic rounded style. Numbers were now rendered in blue on both uniforms with either white or red trim, and the white uniform again featured \"Sixers\" in red letters with white and blue trim.\n1997\u20132009.\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to the more youthful hip-hop-oriented culture. Red, white and blue were retained, but only as trim colors. Instead, the Sixers used black, silver and gold as its core colors, with the logo now featuring 76ers in gold, a single silver star within the 7, and a streaking basketball below the logo.\nThe black road uniforms remained largely unchanged throughout this span, with the letters in white with red trim. The white home uniform, on the other hand, featured some subtle changes. While the letters were in black with red trim, the \"Sixers\" logo was initially gold, but in 2000, the color was changed as black. Also in 2000, the black background and red outline within the \"Sixers\" logo were removed. A blue alternate uniform was introduced in the same year, with the letters in white with red trim; the arm piping was removed after only one season. All three designs contained a gold star on the neckline, added the alternate \"streaking 76\" logo on the shorts, and featured the \"Sixers\"logo written in the same manner as the logo, with the silver star affixed atop the \"I\".\nIn 2006, the Sixers replaced the blue alternates with a red one, bringing back the \"PHILA\" logo for the first time since 1971. As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping. The next season saw some minor tweaks to the black and white uniforms, which now featured the same striping patterns as the red alternate along with the silver star.\n2009\u20132015.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the 1977\u201397 Sixers logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). After that, the team decided to bring back a modern version of said logo, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used.\nThe white uniform featured \"Sixers\" in blue and numbers in red, both returning to a block letter style. The red uniform contained both the \"Sixers\" and the uniform number in white. In 2011, a blue alternate uniform was introduced, mirroring that of the red uniform. After 2013, the blue uniform became the primary road set. All three designs employed a more subtle striping along the arms and legs.\n2015\u2013present.\nA new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015\u201316 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary \"Dribbling Ben Franklin\" logo was also introduced.\nThe home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.\nThe switch to Nike in 2017 saw the Sixers make some slight tweaks to their uniform set. The blue \"Icon\" uniform and the white \"Association\" uniform now feature a red drop shadow on the lettering, and the inscription 'Brotherly Love' replaced 'PHILA TOUGH' near the manufacturer's tag. The Sixers also released their new red \"Statement\" uniform, featuring a script \"Sixers\" wordmark, off-centered numbers and blue drop shadows. Prior to the 2019\u201320 season the red uniforms were tweaked to feature a script \"Phila\" wordmark.\nCity and Earned uniforms.\nThe team's first annual \"City\" uniform features an ornate \"Phila\" lettering, blue numbers with red drop shadows, and other elements inspired from the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Their second \"City\" uniform, inspired by the 1976 film \"Rocky\", shows thirteen stars to represent the Thirteen Colonies. It was based on Rocky because it was from \"'76\".\nBy virtue of qualifying for the 2018 playoffs, the Sixers were also given an \"Earned\" uniform in the 2018\u201319 season. The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniforms were similar to the \"Rocky\" \"City\" uniforms, except that the base was white and the lettering and stars were in blue.\nThe Sixers' \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season paid homage to the Liberty Bell, featuring an ornate \"Philadelphia\" wordmark and red serifed numbers. The gold bell silhouette is prominently featured on the beltline. This design returned for the 2025\u201326 season, but recolored in navy blue.\nThe 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Allen Iverson era and the Boathouse Row landmark, featuring a black base with red, blue and white accents. The Boathouse Row illustration is drawn in white above \"Philadelphia\" in white with blue drop shadows. The numbers, also in white with blue drop shadows, are placed on the left chest.\nThe Sixers' \"Earned\" uniform for 2021 (after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs) featured a blue silhouette of the Liberty Bell on a white background, with white numbers placed in the middle.\nIn commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniforms featured elements of previous uniform designs (a.k.a. \"Mixtape\"). The Sixers' edition featured a navy blue base and red lettering taken from the 1972\u201377 uniforms. Red, orange, green and blue blocks on each side paid tribute to the team's former home, the Spectrum, and also represented fan support for each of Philadelphia's \"Big Four\" teams (red representing the Phillies, orange representing the Flyers, green representing the Eagles, and blue representing the 76ers). The Spectrum center court logo, featuring the arena silhouette at the center, adorned the shorts, and the \"S\" from that logo was placed on the waist.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform centered around Philadelphia's Greek translation of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", which was inscribed in front of the uniform. The mostly minimalist style uniform has a white base, red text and striping, and blue trim, and was inspired by the city's love of basketball in all levels.\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Sixers again went with the \"City of Brotherly Love\" theme, featuring a letter style inspired by the neon signage of the Reading Terminal Market. The navy-based uniform again incorporated the \"13 star circle\", Liberty Bell silhouette, and the \"Bicentennial 76\" insignia.\nThe \"City\" uniform for the 2024\u201325 season was based on the 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform, albeit in white with blue numbers.\nMascots.\nPreviously in the 1980s, the Philadelphia 76ers mascot was Big Shot. He was then replaced with Hip Hop, a rabbit that usually, during time-outs or halftime, would do slam dunks. After the 2011 lockout, Hip Hop would not return.\nFranklin the Dog.\nOn February 10, 2015, Franklin the Dog was introduced as the new Philadelphia 76ers mascot to 400 fans and media at The Franklin Institute. After spending the weekend in New York City for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game as the newest NBA mascot, he then was introduced at the Wells Fargo Center in his first game on February 19, 2015.\nRivalries.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe rivalry between the 76ers and Boston Celtics is the earliest dated rivalry in the NBA. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve. It is considered to be the second-greatest rivalry in the NBA, next to the Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry. The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966\u201367 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants.\nThe 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, and came back to relevance during the 1976\u201377 season, in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 1980s, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s.\nThe rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3\u20132. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4\u20133. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125\u2013124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Philadelphia 76ers seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nFacilities.\nTraining facility.\nThe 76ers' training facility and headquarters for basketball operations are located at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex in Camden, New Jersey. In 2014, the 76ers announced their plans to construct a new training complex, which was officially opened on September 23, 2016.\nThe team previously practiced at the campus of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.\nNew arena.\nIn July 2022, the 76ers announced plans to construct a $1.3 billion, privately-funded arena in Center City, Philadelphia called 76 Place. However, in January 2025, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (owners of the 76ers) and Comcast Spectacor (owners of the Philadelphia Flyers) agreed to a deal to construct a new arena inside the South Philadelphia Sports Complex that the two teams will share. The new arena is planned to open in 2031.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe 76ers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nFranchise leaders and records.\nRetired numbers.\nAll of the 76ers' retired numbers are hanging on the rafters in Xfinity Mobile Arena.\nNotes:\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nEsports ventures.\nIn September 2016, the 76ers acquired both Team Dignitas and Apex Gaming and merged them under the Dignitas brand, becoming the first North American professional sports team to own an esports team.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72858", "revid": "36761478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72858", "title": "Washington Wizards", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Washington, D.C.\nThe Washington Wizards are an American professional basketball team based in Washington, D.C. The Wizards compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Capital One Arena, in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. an arena they share with the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Georgetown University men's basketball team. The team is owned by Ted Leonsis through Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment.\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the Chicago Packers in Chicago, Illinois; they were renamed the Chicago Zephyrs in the following season. In 1963, they moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and became the Baltimore Bullets, taking the name from a previous team of the same name. In 1973, the team moved to the Washington metropolitan area and changed its name first to the Capital Bullets, then the following season to Washington Bullets. In 1997, they rebranded themselves as the Wizards.\nThe Wizards have played in four NBA Finals; they won in 1978. They have appeared in 28 playoffs, won four conference titles (1971, 1975, 1978, 1979), and won eight division titles (1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1979, 2017). Their best season record, in 1975, was 60\u201322. Wes Unseld is the only player in franchise history to be named NBA MVP (1969) and Finals MVP (1978). Four players (Walt Bellamy, Terry Dischinger, Earl Monroe, and Unseld) have won the Rookie of the Year award.\nHistory.\nTeam creation.\nThe Wizards began playing as the \"Chicago Packers\" in 1961, as the NBA's first expansion team, an expansion prompted by Abe Saperstein's American Basketball League. Rookie Walt Bellamy was the team's star, averaging 31.6 points per game, 19.0 rebounds per game, and leading the NBA in field goal percentage. During the All-Star Game, Bellamy represented the team while scoring 23 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. Bellamy was named the league Rookie of the Year, but the team finished with the NBA's worst record at 18\u201362.\nThe team's original name was a reference to Chicago's meatpacking industry; their home arena, the International Amphitheater, was next door to the Union Stock Yards. However, it was extremely unpopular since it was the same name used by the NFL's Green Bay Packers, bitter rivals of the Chicago Bears. After only one year, the organization changed its name to the \"Chicago Zephyrs\" and played its home games at the Chicago Coliseum (Saperstein's ABL Majors prevented the team from playing in the larger Chicago Stadium). In their only season as the Zephyrs, former Purdue star Terry Dischinger was on the roster, and went on to win Rookie of the Year honors. In 1963 the franchise moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and became the \"Baltimore Bullets\", taking their name from a 1940s\u20131950s Baltimore Bullets BAA/NBA franchise and playing their home games at the Baltimore Civic Center. The NBA returned to Chicago in 1966 when the Chicago Bulls began play. In their first year in Baltimore, the Bullets finished fourth in a five\u2013team Western Division.\nPrior to the 1964\u201365 season the Bullets pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending Dischinger, Rod Thorn and Don Kojis to the Detroit Pistons for Bailey Howell, Don Ohl, Bob Ferry and Wali Jones. The trade worked out well; Howell proved to be a hustler and a fundamentally sound player. He helped the Bullets reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In the 1965 NBA playoffs, the Bullets stunned the St. Louis Hawks 3\u20131, and advanced to the Western Conference finals. In the finals, Baltimore managed to split the first four games with the Los Angeles Lakers before losing the series 4\u20132.\nWithin the first two months of that season, the Bullets were purchased from original franchise managing partner Dave Trager by Abe Pollin, Earl Foreman and real estate investor and former NBA referee Arnold Heft for $1.1 million, on November 23, 1964.\n1967\u20131981: The Wes Unseld era.\nIn the late 1960s, the Bullets drafted two future Hall of Fame members: Earl Monroe, in the 1967 draft, number two overall, and Wes Unseld, in the following year's draft, also number two overall. The team improved dramatically, from 36 wins the previous season to 57 in the 1968\u201369 season, and Unseld received both the rookie of the year and MVP awards. The Bullets hosted the 1969 NBA All-Star Game and reached the playoffs with high expectations, but they were eliminated by the New York Knicks in the first round. The next season the two teams met again in the first round, and although this one went to seven games, the Knicks emerged victorious again.\nIn the 1970\u201371 season, the 42\u201340 Bullets again met the Knicks, this time though in the Eastern Conference finals. With the Knicks team captain Willis Reed injured in the finals, the injury-free Bullets took advantage of his absence, and in game seven, at New York's Madison Square Garden, the Bullets' Gus Johnson made a critical basket late in the game to lift the Bullets over the Knicks 93\u201391 and advance to their first NBA Finals. They were swept in four games by the powerful Milwaukee Bucks led by future Hall of Fame members Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (known in 1971 as Lew Alcindor) and Oscar Robertson.\nEven after the trades of Earl Monroe (to the Knicks) and Gus Johnson (to the Suns), the Bullets remained a playoff contender throughout the 1970s. Following a less than spectacular 1971\u201372 season, Baltimore acquired Elvin Hayes from the Houston Rockets and drafted Kevin Porter in the third round of the 1972 NBA draft, out of St. Francis.\nAfter a slow start in 1972\u201373, Baltimore made their charge in December, posting a 10\u20134 record on the way to capturing the Central Division title for the third straight year. The Bullets again faced the Knicks in the 1973 NBA playoffs, losing for the fourth time in five series against New York.\nMove to Washington, D.C. area.\nIn February 1973, the team announced its pending move southwest to the Capital Centre in Landover, a Washington, D.C. suburb, and became the Capital Bullets. After that 1973\u201374 season, they changed their geographic identifier name to the Washington Bullets. The Bullets would return to Baltimore to play a few home games per season during the late 1980s and 1990s.\nDuring November 1973, while waiting for the completion of their new arena in Landover, the Bullets played their home games at Cole Field House on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park. The Capital Centre (later known as the US Airways Arena) opened on December 2, 1973, with the Bullets defeating the SuperSonics.\nThe 60\u201322 Bullets made it back to the 1975 NBA playoffs. In the regular season, Washington posted a 36\u20135 home record at the Capital Centre. In the first round of the playoffs, they survived a seven-game series against the Buffalo Braves as both teams won all of their games at home. In the Eastern Conference finals, they beat the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. The Bullets were favorites to win the NBA championship, but were swept by the Al Attles-led Golden State Warriors in four games, losing games one and four at the Capital Centre.\nThe loss at the NBA Finals lingered into the 1975\u201376 season, as they won 12 fewer games than last year, and in the playoffs they were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. After the season, the Bullets fired head coach K.C. Jones, despite having a career 62 percent winning percentage as the Bullets head coach.\nIn 1976\u201377, under new head coach Dick Motta, the Bullets again fell short of the Central Division title for the second straight year. Elvin Hayes finished sixth in the league in rebounds with 12.5 rebounds per game. After opening the 1977 NBA playoffs with a three-game series victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Bullets took a 2\u20131 series lead in the second round against the Houston Rockets. With a chance to take a 3\u20131 series lead at home, the Bullets lost 107\u2013103, and the Rockets took the series in six games.\n1977\u201378: NBA championship season.\nAlthough they had future hall of famers Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld on the team, the Bullets finished the 1977\u201378 season 44\u201338 and were a longshot to win the NBA Finals, but San Antonio journalist Dan Cook used the famed phrase \"It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings\". This became the rallying cry for the Bullets as they finished a playoff run that led to the NBA Finals, defeating the Seattle SuperSonics in seven games to bring a professional sports championship to Washington, D.C. for the first time in 36 years. It remains the only NBA title won by the team as of 2025.\n1978\u201379: Finalists.\nIn the 1978\u201379 season the Bullets moved to the Atlantic Division, capturing the title in their first season there. They entered the 1979 NBA playoffs having lost eight of the final 11 games to finish the regular season at 54\u201328. In the playoffs the Bullets nearly blew a 3\u20131 series lead against the Atlanta Hawks, but managed to hold off the Hawks in seven games.\nIn the Eastern Conference finals, they trailed the San Antonio Spurs 3\u20131, but they mounted a comeback by winning two straight games to force a game seven at the Capital Centre. The Bullets rallied again, overcoming a fourth\u2013quarter deficit to beat George Gervin and the Spurs 107\u2013105 in one of the NBA's all-time greatest games and advance to the NBA Finals and a rematch with the Seattle SuperSonics.\nIn Game 1 of the finals, the Bullets defeated the SuperSonics, 99\u201397, on two game-winning free throws. They lost the next four games, and the series, to Seattle. The Bullets were the only team to play in the NBA Finals four times during the 1970s.\n1979\u20131988: Playoff disappointments.\nIn August 1979, the Bullets became the first NBA team to visit China, where they defeated the Bayi Rockets and the Shanghai Sharks.156\nAge and injuries finally caught up with the Bullets. In the 1979\u201380 season, they barely made the playoffs as they captured the sixth and final playoff spot via a tiebreaker despite posting a 39\u201343 record. In the playoffs, they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers in a two-game playoff series. The following year the Bullets failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. Wes Unseld retired and Elvin Hayes was traded back to the Houston Rockets the following season.\nIn 1981\u201382, Washington played strong under the coaching of Gene Shue and Don Moran, finishing the regular season with a 43\u201339 record, and although they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals in the playoffs, they had clearly lost the power of the late 1970s. The 1983 Bullets continued to play with the same talent they had in the previous year. They finished with a winning record, but in a highly competitive Atlantic Division they finished last and missed the playoffs.\nThe next two years saw the Bullets continue to play mediocre basketball as they finished with losing records but they made the playoffs in the new expanded NBA Playoffs format that involved the 16 best teams to make the playoffs; the Bullets were eliminated in both years in the first round.\nIn 1985, the Bullets acquired Manute Bol in the 1985 NBA draft, whose specialty was blocking shots. That year, he blocked 397 shots (a Bullets record), part of a team that blocked 716 shots (a Bullets team record). However, the Bullets finished with a disappointing 39\u201343 record, and were eliminated by the 76ers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The Bullets acquired center Moses Malone from the Philadelphia 76ers for center Jeff Ruland the following season for hope of improvement. Malone would lead the team in scoring with a 24.1 points per game as he would be joined by Jeff Malone who averaged 22.0 points per game. The Bullets' 42\u201340 record would be their last winning season until 1996\u201397. Washington was eliminated by the Detroit Pistons in three games in the playoffs.\nTwelfth overall in the 1987 NBA draft, the Bullets selected Muggsy Bogues, who at is the shortest player in NBA history. The Bullets would get off to a slow start as coach Kevin Loughery was fired 27 games into the season with the Bullets holding an 8\u201319 record. To replace Loughery, the Bullets hired former MVP Wes Unseld. Under Unseld, the Bullets improved as they were able to reach the playoffs again with a record of 38\u201344. After losing the first two games on the road in the first round of the 1988 NBA playoffs to the Detroit Pistons, the Bullets fought back and forced a fifth game with two home wins. They would lose game 5 by 21 points. It would be nine seasons before Washington would return to the NBA Playoffs.\n1989\u20131997: End of the Bullets.\nThe Bullets got off to a 5\u20131 start in 1988\u201389, but they lost 16 of 18 games from mid-December to mid-January. On January 6, 1989, the Bullets franchise played its first regular season game in Baltimore since 1973; this would be the first of 35 regular season \"home\" games the Bullets played in Baltimore from 1989 to 1997. They finished with a 31\u201351 record despite stellar seasons by Jeff Malone and Bernard King, who averaged 24.3 and 22.3 points per game respectively to lead the team.\nThe lone highlight of the Bullets' 30-win 1990\u201391 season was the successful comeback effort by Bernard King as he recovered from knee surgery he suffered while playing for the Knicks in the 1984\u201385 season to finish third in the NBA in scoring with a 28.4 points per game. In 1990, the team named Susan O'Malley as its president, the first female president of a franchise in the history of the NBA, who is the daughter of Peter O'Malley, the prominent lawyer from Maryland and former president of the Washington Capitals.\nThe Bullets continued to struggle due to injuries and inconsistent play. They posted a 25\u201357 record in the 1991\u201392 season. Pervis Ellison was named 1992 Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 20.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks per game. Undrafted rookie Larry Stewart became the first undrafted player in NBA history to make an All-Rookie Team, being selected to the All-Rookie Second Team. The Bullets drafted Tom Gugliotta with their sixth overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. They finished the 1992\u201393 season with a 22\u201360 record. Following the season, the Bullets traded Harvey Grant to the Portland Trail Blazers for former All-Star center Kevin Duckworth. In 1993, the Bullets did a rap music video of their version of Naughty by Nature's rap single \"Hip Hop Hooray\", featuring the rap trio themselves.\nInjuries continued as key players Rex Chapman and Calbert Cheaney (the club's first-round draft pick) missed significant stretches, and Ellison missed almost the entire season. The result was a 24\u201358 record for the 1993\u201394 season. Don MacLean was named 1994 Most Improved Player of the season, leading the Bullets with 18.2 points per game (tied with Chapman).\nThe Bullets selected Juwan Howard in the 1994 NBA draft and traded Gugliotta along with three first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for the rights to Chris Webber. While the season started out with promise, a shoulder injury to Chris Webber (ironically against the Warriors) caused him to miss 19 games, and the Bullets struggled through the rest of the season finishing a then franchise-worst (percentage-wise) 21\u201361. Webber averaged 20.1 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, but declined surgery for his dislocated shoulder. This would prove costly for the next season. The Bullets released a holiday video, \"You da Man, You da Man, that's the reason I'm a Bullets Fan!\" in 1994, which featured all 12 Bullets dancing in front of the Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C.\nIn the Bullets' 1995\u201396 season Webber suffered a dislocated left shoulder in a preseason game against the Indiana Pacers on October 21, and opened the season on the injured list. He was activated on November 27, but strained his shoulder against the New York Knicks on December 29. After hoping the injury would get better with rest, Webber finally underwent surgery on Feb 1 which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. The Bullets were 9\u20136 with Webber in the lineup as he averaged a team-high 23.7 points plus 7.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.80 steals in 37.2 minutes per game when he was able to play. Other players injured included Mark Price (who only played in seven games) and Robert Pack (31 games played out of 82). Bright spots of the season included the selection of Rasheed Wallace in the 1995 NBA draft and the All-Star play of Howard. Howard averaged a career-best 22.1 ppg and 8.1 rpg and kept the Bullets slim playoff hopes alive until the end of the season. Center Gheorghe Mure\u0219an was named Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. The Bullets improved to 39\u201343 but just missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.\nWashington, boasting the league's tallest player (Mure\u0219an, whose height is ), two very athletic forwards (Howard and Webber) and one of the league's top point guards (Rod Strickland), started the 1996\u201397 season at 22\u201324. That led to the dismissal of head coach Jim Lynam. Bernie Bickerstaff, an assistant coach with the Bullets when they won their only NBA championship in 1978, was called upon to resurrect his former team. The Bullets responded, winning 16 of their final 21 games to finish 44\u201338, their best record since 1978\u201379. The late surge enabled the Bullets to climb within reach of the Cleveland Cavaliers for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. In a win-or-go-home game with the Cavaliers on the season's final day, the Bullets squeezed past Cleveland 85\u201381 to end the franchise's longest playoff drought. Whilst the Bullets were swept by the Bulls in the first round, they lost the three games by a total of 18 points.\nWebber led the way in scoring (20.1 ppg), rebounding (10.3) and blocks (1.9) and shot 51.8 percent from the floor to make his first All-Star team. Howard averaged 19.1 ppg and 8.0 rpg, while Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 1.74 spg and finished fifth in the league in assists with 8.9 per game. Mure\u015fan dominated the middle and led the NBA in field goal percentage (.599). Washington received contributions from Calbert Cheaney (10.6 ppg) and Tracy Murray (10.0 ppg).\nBecoming the Wizards.\nIn November 1995, owner Abe Pollin announced he was changing the team's nickname, because \"Bullets\" had acquired violent overtones that had made him increasingly uncomfortable over the years, particularly given the high homicide and crime rate in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C. The name change was widely and incorrectly believed to be related to the assassination of Pollin's longtime friend, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.\nA contest was held to choose a new name and the choices were narrowed to the \"Dragons\", \"Express\", \"Stallions\", \"Sea Dogs\", and the \"Wizards\". On May 15, 1997, the Bullets officially became the Wizards. The new name generated some controversy because \"wizard\" is a rank in the Ku Klux Klan, and Washington has a large African American population.\nA new logo was unveiled and the team colors were changed from the traditional red, white and blue to a lighter shade of blue, black and bronze, the same colors as the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL), also owned by Pollin and changed from red, white and blue before the 1995\u201396 season. Washington forward Juwan Howard sat on the committee that decided on the logo design. That same year the Wizards moved to the then MCI Center (Capital One Arena), also home to the Capitals and the Georgetown Hoyas men's college basketball team.\nIn 1998, they became the brother team to the Washington Mystics of the Women's National Basketball Association, and remained officially thus until 2005 when the Mystics were sold to Lincoln Holdings (headed by Ted Leonsis), parent company of the Capitals. However, upon the purchase of the Wizards by Leonsis in 2010, the Wizards and Mystics again became sibling teams.\n1997\u20132001: Rebranded as the Wizards.\nThe newly named Wizards began the 1997\u201398 season playing five home games at the Capital Centre before moving to the new MCI Center on December 2, 1997. The Wizards finished the season with a 42\u201340 record including four straight victories to end the season but just missed the playoffs. Highlights of the season included Chris Webber leading the team in scoring (21.9 ppg) and rebounding (9.5 rpg). Strickland led the league in assists (10.5 apg) before suffering an injury near the end of the season. He was also named on the All-NBA Second Team. Tracy Murray averaged 15.1 ppg off the bench including a 50-point game against Golden State. Off-court distractions led to the trade of Webber to the Sacramento Kings for Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe in May 1998.\nThe Wizards finished the lockout-shortened season of 1998\u201399 with a record of 18\u201332. Mitch Richmond led the team in scoring with a 19.7 ppg average. In the 1999\u20132000 season, the Wizards finished with a 29\u201353 record. Mitch Richmond led the team with 17.4 ppg. In the 2000\u201301 season, under newly hired coach Leonard Hamilton, 1999 NBA draft pick Richard Hamilton led the team in scoring with 18.1 ppg, but the team finished with a 19\u201363 record, the most losses the team had ever suffered in one season.\nOn February 23, 2001, the Wizards were involved in a blockbuster trade days before the trading deadline. The team sent Juwan Howard, Obinna Ekezie and Calvin Booth to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, Washington received Hubert Davis, Courtney Alexander, Christian Laettner, Loy Vaught and Etan Thomas along with $3\u00a0million.\n2001\u20132003: The Michael Jordan era.\n2001\u201302 season.\nAfter retiring from the Chicago Bulls in early 1999, Michael Jordan became the Washington Wizards' president of basketball operations as well as a minority owner in January 2000. In September 2001, Jordan came out of retirement at age 38 to play for Washington. Jordan stated that he was returning \"for the love of the game\". Because of NBA rules, he had to divest himself of any ownership of the team. Before the All-Star break, Jordan was one of only two players to average more than 25 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds as he led the Wizards to a 26\u201321 record. After the All-Star break, Jordan's knee could not handle the workload of a full-season as he ended the season on the injured list, and the Wizards concluded the season with a 37\u201345 record but could not make the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n2002\u201303 season.\nJordan announced he would return for the 2002\u201303 season, and this time he was determined to be equipped with reinforcements, as he traded for All-Star Jerry Stackhouse and signed budding star Larry Hughes. Jordan even accepted a sixth-man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82-game season. A combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan's return to the starting lineup, where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early-season struggles. By the end of the season, the Wizards finished with a 37\u201345 record once again. Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games, as he averaged 20.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game. Jordan retired from playing for a third and final time after the season.\nJordan's departure.\nAfter the season, majority owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to the shock of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking that he would get his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had detrimental effects on the team, such as benching Hughes for Tyronn Lue, making poor trades, and using the team's first-round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown. The Wizards replaced Jordan's managerial role with general manager Ernie Grunfeld.\n2003\u20132010: The Gilbert Arenas era.\n2003\u201304: The arrival of Gilbert Arenas.\nWithout Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard Gilbert Arenas, in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25\u201357 record in the 2003\u201304 season.\n2004\u201305: Return to the playoffs.\nIn the off-season, the team traded Stackhouse, Christian Laettner, and the draft rights to Devin Harris to the Dallas Mavericks for Antawn Jamison. During the regular season, the scoring trio of Arenas, Jamison and Hughes was the highest in the NBA and earned the nickname of \"The Big Three\". Hughes led the NBA in steals with 2.89 per game. Arenas and Jamison were both named to the 2005 Eastern Conference All-Star team, marking the first time Washington had two players in the All-Star game since Jeff Malone and Moses Malone represented the Bullets in the 1987 All-Star Game.\nThe 2004\u201305 season saw the team (now in the new Southeast Division) post its best regular season record in 26 years (45\u201337) and marked the first time the franchise had ever made the playoffs as the Wizards. With a 93\u201382 win over the Chicago Bulls on April 13, 2005, the Wizards clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 1996\u201397. Long-suffering fans celebrated by buying over 16,000 playoff tickets in two and a half hours the day tickets went on sale. In game three of the first round against the Bulls, the Wizards won their first playoff game since 1988. Adding to the \"long-overdue\" feeling was that game three was the first NBA playoff game to be held within Washington, D.C. city limits. In the Wizards' game five victory in Chicago, Arenas hit a buzzer-beater to win the game and the Wizards took their first lead in a playoff series since 1986. In game six, at the MCI Center, Jared Jeffries picked up a loose ball and went in for an uncontested tie-breaking dunk with 32 seconds left, giving the Wizards a 94\u201391 win and the team's first playoff series win in 23 years. They were only the 12th team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being down 0\u20132. This playoff series victory ended the second longest streak with no postseason series wins in NBA history.\nIn the conference semifinals, the Wizards were swept by the Miami Heat, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.\n2005\u201306.\nThe 2005\u201306 season was filled with ups and downs. During the off-season, Washington acquired Caron Butler and Antonio Daniels. During the regular season, the Wizards again had the best scoring trio in the NBA, this time consisting of Arenas, Jamison and Butler as the \"Big Three\". The Wizards started the 2005\u201306 season at 5\u20131, but went on an 8\u201317 funk to go to 13\u201318 through 31 games. Then, they went 13\u20135 in the next eighteen games. On April 5, 2006, the team was 39\u201335 and looking to close in on the 45-win mark achieved the previous year, until Butler suffered a thumb sprain and the Wizards lost all five games without him. Butler returned and the team pulled out their final three games, against the Pistons, Cavaliers and Bucks, all playoff-bound teams, to finish the year at 42\u201340 and clinch the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They averaged 101.7 points a game, third in the NBA and best in the East and clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season for the first time since 1987.\nTheir first-round match-up with Cleveland was widely seen as the most evenly matched series in the 2006 NBA playoffs. The teams exchanged wins during the first two games in Cleveland, with game two highlighted by the Wizards holding LeBron James to 7\u201325 shooting from the floor while Brendan Haywood gave James a hard foul in the first quarter that many cited as the key to shaking up the rest of James's game. In game three at the Verizon Center, James hit a 4-footer on the way down with 5.7 seconds left to take the game and the series lead for the Cavs with a 97\u201396 win. Arenas missed a potential game-winning three-pointer on the other end to seal the win for the Cavs. Game 4 saw the Wizards heat up again, as Arenas scored 20 in the fourth quarter after claiming he changed his jersey, shorts, shoes and tights in the room and the Wizards won 106\u201396. Yet in games five and six, the Cavs took control of the series, both games decided by one point in overtime. In game five, despite the Wizards being down 107\u2013100 with 1:18 to play, the team drove back and eventually tied the game on Butler's layup with 7.5 seconds remaining to send the game to overtime, where James scored with 0.9 seconds left to send the Cavs to a 121\u2013120 win. The series returned to the Verizon Center for game six, where the game went back and forth all night. The Wizards blew a 14-point first-quarter lead, then for 24 minutes, from early in the second quarter to early in the fourth, neither team led by more than five points at any time. The Wizards blew a seven-point lead with just under five to play and needed Arenas to hit a 31-foot shot at the end of regulation to take the game to overtime. In overtime, Arenas missed two key free throws. Cleveland rebounded the ball, went downcourt and Damon Jones hit a 17-foot baseline jump shot with 4.8 seconds remaining to give the Cavs the lead for good. Butler missed a three-pointer on the other end to seal the game, and the series, for the Cavaliers.\n2006\u201307.\nThe 2006\u201307 season started out very promisingly for the Wizards. In the off-season they signed free agents DeShawn Stevenson and Darius Songaila. Etan Thomas beat out Haywood for the starting center job. After starting the season 0\u20138 on the road, Washington rebounded to win 6 of 7 away from Verizon Center. After a November 4\u20139, Washington went 22\u20139 through December and January. Arenas scored a franchise-record 60 points against the Lakers on December 17. He and Eddie Jordan were named player of the month and coach of the month for December, respectively. On January 3 and again on January 15, Arenas hit buzzer-beating three-pointers to beat Milwaukee and Utah.\nOn January 30, Jamison went down with a sprained left knee in a win against Detroit. Washington went 4\u20138 in the 12 games without him. On February 3, Songaila made his Wizards debut against the Lakers. On February 18, Eddie Jordan became the first Wizards/Bullets coach to coach in the NBA All-Star Game since Dick Motta in 1978\u20131979. Arenas played in his third straight All-Star game and Butler made his All-Star Game debut.\nOn March 14, Butler went out with a knee injury that kept him out of the lineup for six games. He returned for only three games until he fractured his right hand on April 1 against Milwaukee. On April 4, Arenas suffered a season-ending knee injury, of the meniscus. An April 15 article in \"The Washington Post\" pointed out that with Arenas and Butler gone, the team had lost 42.3% of their offensive production, quite possibly \"the most costly\" loss for any team in the midst of a playoff hunt in NBA history.\nDespite their late-season struggles without Arenas and Butler, the Wizards still managed to make the Eastern Conference playoffs, taking the 7th seed at 41\u201341. They were swept four games to none in a rematch of the previous year's first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Despite a depleted roster, the Wizards still managed to keep things close in every game in the series and only lost the final three games by a combined 20 points. The team enjoyed their best attendance figures in the post-Jordan era with a season attendance of 753,283 (18,372 per game).\n2007\u201308.\nThe Wizards retained a majority of their roster from the 2006\u201307 season, only losing Jarvis Hayes to Detroit, Calvin Booth to the Philadelphia 76ers, and Michael Ruffin to the Milwaukee Bucks as free agents. Washington signed Oleksiy Pecherov, the team's first-round pick in 2006, as well as 2007 picks Nick Young and Dominic McGuire. Etan Thomas missed the regular season after undergoing open-heart surgery.\nThe team began the season starting 0\u20135, but rebounded to win six straight. After eight games, Arenas underwent surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee, as well as a microfracture surgery. This was the same knee he had injured the previous year. The injury forced Arenas out for a total of 68 games. Midway through the season, Butler was forced to the sidelines for a total of 20 games with what initially was a strained hip flexor, but turned out to be a labral tear. Despite all of the injuries, the Wizards managed to finish 43\u201339 on the regular season, good for 5th place in the Eastern Conference and a first-round playoff matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight season. However, the Wizards lost that series in six games.\n2008\u201309.\nDuring the off-season, Arenas signed a six-year, $111\u00a0million contract, while Jamison signed a four-year, $50\u00a0million contract. The Wizards did not re-sign guard Roger Mason, who signed with the San Antonio Spurs. The Wizards added guards Dee Brown and Juan Dixon, and drafted JaVale McGee 18th overall in the 2008 NBA Draft.\nIn September, Arenas underwent a third operation on his surgically repaired left knee to clean out fluid and debris, and was expected to miss at least the first month of the season. The forecast came in longer than expected, as Arenas missed five months of action due to concerns about his knee, before returning on March 29, 2009. In the first game of the preseason, Jamison suffered a right knee contusion, and was expected to miss the rest of the preseason. Haywood announced that he would undergo surgery on his right wrist and was expected to miss four to six months. The preseason marked the return of Etan Thomas who had missed all of the 2007\u20132008 season while recovering from open-heart surgery. The Wizards added guard Fenny Falmagne from the Dakota Wizards on August 23, 2008, who was later waived by the team after a knee injury.\nThe Wizards opened the season on October 29 with a loss against New Jersey, and dropped fifteen of their first nineteen games. Head coach Eddie Jordan was fired on November 24 after a 1\u201310 start, and was replaced by interim coach Ed Tapscott. On December 10, Washington acquired guards Javaris Crittenton and Mike James in a three-team deal that sent Antonio Daniels to New Orleans. The team waived guard Dee Brown. They won just 14 of their first 60 games and in the end tied a franchise-worst record of 19\u201363.\nOne of the few high points of the season came on February 27 when recently inaugurated President Barack Obama attended a Wizards game against the Chicago Bulls, sitting in a northeast court-side seat. The Wizards produced their second-biggest victory margin of the season with a 113\u201390 win; Jamison paced the side with 27 points.\nOn April 2, the Wizards shut down the Cleveland Cavaliers, who came in with a record of 61\u201313, and ended Cleveland's franchise-best winning streak at 13.\nFlip Saunders reached an agreement to become the new coach of the team in mid-April 2009. Despite having the second-best chance at obtaining the number one overall pick in the 2009 draft, the Wizards were randomly chosen to pick fifth overall in the NBA Draft Lottery. This pick was later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with Songaila, Thomas, and Oleksiy Pecherov, in exchange for Randy Foye and Mike Miller. On May 21, 2009, Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld announced that the team had named Randy Wittman and Sam Cassell as assistant coaches.\nThen on August 11, 2009, the Wizards signed Fabricio Oberto, many weeks after he committed to signing with the team.\n2009\u201310.\nIn November, majority owner Abe Pollin died at the age of 85. At the time of his death, he was the longest-tenured owner in NBA history. Control of the franchise passed to his widow Irene, though minority owner Ted Leonsis was known to be preparing a takeover bid.\nOn December 24, 2009, it was revealed that Arenas had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at Verizon Center and had surrendered them to team security. In doing so, Arenas violated both NBA rules against bringing firearms into an arena and D.C. ordinances. On January 1, 2010, it was reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton had unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room during a Christmas Eve argument regarding gambling debts resulting in Arenas's suspension. Despite Stern's longstanding practice of not disciplining players until the legal process played out, he felt compelled to act when Arenas' teammates surrounded him during pregame introductions prior to a game with the Philadelphia 76ers and he pantomimed shooting them with guns made from his fingers. The Wizards issued a statement condemning the players' pregame stunt as \"unacceptable\".\nOn February 13, 2010, after a 17\u201333 record at the season's midway point, The Wizards traded Butler, Haywood, and Stevenson to the Mavericks in exchange for Josh Howard, Drew Gooden, Quinton Ross and James Singleton. Three days later, the Wizards traded Antawn Jamison to the Cavaliers in exchange for Zydrunas Ilgauskas and obtained Al Thornton from the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal. Ilgauskas reported long enough to take a physical (to make the trade official). His contract was immediately bought out, making him a free agent. On February 26, 2010, the Wizards signed Shaun Livingston to a 10-day contract. With Gilbert Arenas suspended and Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison being traded, the Wizards finished the season at 26\u201356, posting an abysmal 9\u201323 record to finish the season. They were the only Southeast Division team not to make the postseason.\n2010\u20132019: The John Wall era.\n2010\u201311: The arrival of John Wall.\nLeonsis completed his takeover of the Wizards and Verizon Center in June through his newly-formed holding company, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment. He had previously purchased the Washington Capitals and Mystics from the Pollin family. Leonsis took a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website. He wrote a manifesto of 101 changes he hoped to implement during his ownership, including changing the team's colors back to the red, white and blue of the Bullets era, and possibly changing the team nickname back to \"Bullets\" as well. Team president Ernie Grunfeld later confirmed that the franchise's colors would revert to red, white and blue from the 2011\u201312 season onwards. The team also adopted new uniforms that were very similar to the ones they wore from 1974 to 1987. Although the Wizards did not change their name to the Bullets again, they adopted a variation of the 1969\u20131987 Bullets logo with \"wizards\" spelled in all lowercase letters like the \"bullets\" logo was printed.\nDespite having only the fifth-best odds of obtaining the No. 1 pick (10.3%), the Wizards won the 2010 NBA draft lottery and selected All-American Kentucky point guard John Wall with the first overall pick. Later in the off-season, the team acquired the Chicago Bulls' all-time leader in three-point field goals, Kirk Hinrich and the draft rights to forward Kevin Seraphin in exchange for the draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko.\nIn a blockbuster trade, the Wizards sent Gilbert Arenas to the Orlando Magic in return for Rashard Lewis on December 18. Kirk Hinrich and Hilton Armstrong were traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans, Mike Bibby, and a 2011 first-round pick that became Chris Singleton, although Mike Bibby bought out his contract after playing two games and eventually signed with the Miami Heat. The Wizards finished with a 30\u201352 record, once again occupying the bottom of the Southeast Division.\n2011\u201312.\nAfter a poor start to the 2011\u201312 season, head coach Flip Saunders was fired and replaced by assistant Randy Wittman. On March 15, the Wizards were involved in a three-way trade that sent JaVale McGee and Ronny Turiaf to the Nuggets and Nick Young to the Clippers in exchange for Nen\u00ea and Brian Cook. After ending the season on a six-game win streak, the Wizards finished with a record of 20\u201346 (season was shortened due to the 2011 NBA Lockout) and the second-worst record in the NBA, comfortably ahead of the 7\u201359 Charlotte Bobcats who set an NBA record for the lowest win percentage in a season with .106. On June 20, the Wizards sent Lewis and a pick to the Hornets for Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza.\n2012\u201313: The arrival of Bradley Beal.\nIn the 2012 NBA Draft, the Wizards selected Bradley Beal and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd. On July 17, 2012, the Wizards exercised the amnesty provision from the 2011 CBA to release Andray Blatche. They also signed A. J. Price.\nThen, on August 29, 2012, Martell Webster was signed to the Wizards for one year on a $1.6 million contract. He played well for what he was signed for and had a .422 average for three-point shots and a .442 field goal percentage. On April 30, 2013, Jason Collins, who joined the team in February, announced his homosexuality as a member of the Wizards. His announcement made him the first openly gay member of a North American team sport. The Wizards ended the season with a 33\u201349 record, finishing 12th in the Eastern Conference and fourth in the Southeast Division, 10 games ahead of the Orlando Magic.\nOn May 21, 2013, the Wizards went up five spots in the NBA draft lottery to make the number three overall selection for the second year in a row. They used that pick to draft Consensus All-American Otto Porter of Georgetown University. On October 25, 2013, Wizards' center Emeka Okafor and a top-12 protected 2014 first-round pick were traded to the Phoenix Suns for the center Marcin Gortat, Shannon Brown, Malcolm Lee and Kendall Marshall.\n2013\u201314: Return to playoffs.\nOn February 3, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Portland Trail Blazers to improve to a 24\u201323 record. The win marked the first time the team had held a winning record since 2009.\nOn April 2, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Boston Celtics by a score of 118\u201392 to clinch the team's first playoff berth since the 2007\u201308 season. Led by first time All-Star John Wall, on April 29, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Chicago Bulls in game 5 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals by a score of 75\u201369 to win the series 4\u20131. This was the Wizards first series victory since the 2005 NBA playoffs when they defeated the same team in 6 games. The Wizards advanced to the Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers. The Wizards won game one 102\u201396. In Game 2, the Wizards lost a 19-point second-half lead, as they dropped the game 88\u201382. After being routed by Indiana in game three 85\u201363, they also lost game four 95\u201392. They showed grit and determination as they staved off elimination with a 102\u201379 game five win. They were behind most of game 6, but battled back to take the lead late in the game. However, Indiana closed out the series with a 93\u201380 win. Trevor Ariza would leave in the off-season.\n2014\u201315.\nAfter the departure of Trevor Ariza, the Wizards signed veteran small forward Paul Pierce to a two-year contract. Pierce's veteran leadership proved to be a major factor on and off the court in the team's improvement. On November 12, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 107\u2013103, extending their record to 6\u20132 for the first time since the 1975\u201376 season. The following game three days later, the Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic 98\u201393 as they won their third straight and moved to 7\u20132, their best start since opening 7\u20131 during the 1974\u201375 season. With a 104\u201396 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 12, the Wizards moved to an 11\u20132 record at home to start the season for the first time in franchise history. They would struggle throughout the later months of the season but the Washington Wizards would finish the season with a 46\u201336 record, their best record since the 1978\u20131979 season. They played the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and won in four games, marking their first sweep in franchise history. Following the victory over Toronto, the Wizards next had to play the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks. The Wizards managed to take the first game in the series, but suffered the loss of Wall due to a fractured wrist. Although small forward Paul Pierce made several big shots throughout the series, the loss of Wall proved too much, and Atlanta took the series in six games.\n2015\u201316.\nHowever, the 2015\u201316 season was much less successful. The Wizards finished 10th in the Eastern Conference with a 41\u201341 record, and missed the playoffs. On April 13, 2016, the Wizards fired head coach Randy Wittman.\nOn April 21, 2016, Scott Brooks, the former head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, agreed to a five-year, $35 million deal to be the head coach of the Wizards. On September 8, 2016, the team unveiled new alternative jerseys. From 2015 on, their logo was the \"monument ball\" with \"Navy Blue, Red, Silver, White\" colors. In October 2016, they were ranked 93rd of 122 worst franchises in major sports by Ultimate Standings.\n2016\u201317.\nThe 2016\u201317 season would prove to be the most successful in recent Wizards history, following a 49\u201333 record and winning the Southeast Division for the first time since 1979. This came off the breakout of Bradley Beal who averaged a then career-high 23.1 points. Beal's rise matched the continued All-Star play of John Wall who averaged career highs in points and assists with 23.1 and 10.7, respectively, earning him an All-NBA team spot.\nDespite starting the season 1\u20135, the Wizards would defeat the Boston Celtics 118\u201393 on November 9. After mediocre play through much of the early part of the season, after December the Wizards would turn their season around, holding a record of 34\u201321 at the All-Star break. The Wizards finished the season 49\u201333, their highest win total since 1979.\nIn the first round of the playoffs the 4-seed Wizards were matched against the 5-seed Atlanta Hawks. After winning the first two games at home, the Wizards struggled on the road as the Hawks tied the series 2\u20132. The Wizards went on to win the next two games to close out the series at home behind stellar play from their backcourt of Wall and Beal who dropped a combined 73 points in the closeout Game 6 win.\nIn the second round, the Wizards faced the first-seeded Boston Celtics. They would go on to lose the series in 7 games.\n2017\u201318.\nFor the 2017\u201318 season, the Wizards would play their next season in the newly named Capital One Arena. The Wizards finished with a 43\u201339 record, which was good for the 8th seed, but lost the first round in six games to the top-seeded Toronto Raptors. Bradley Beal made his first All-Star team this season along with John Wall, who made his fifth in a row and last.\n2018\u201319.\nIn the off-season, the Wizards picked up Thomas Bryant off waivers and Troy Brown in the draft with the 15th pick in the 2018 NBA draft. Despite Bryant becoming a valuable asset and Bradley Beal having a career season, the season would end up being an underwhelming one full of turmoil and on-court troubles. The Wizards also went through injuries, including Dwight Howard playing 9 games before missing the rest of the season due to back problems and losing John Wall who underwent a season-ending surgery on his left Achilles which he injured while recovering from a previous injury, while trading Kelly Oubre Jr., Otto Porter Jr., and Markieff Morris at the same time. As a result, the Wizards would miss the playoffs for the first time since the 2015\u201316 season. Bradley Beal made his second All-Star Team.\n2019\u201320.\nIn April 2019, the Wizards fired general manager Ernie Grunfeld, who had been with the team since 2003, with Tommy Sheppard taking over as interim general manager until being officially hired fulltime in July 2019. Alongside other front office moves, the Wizards selected Japanese player Rui Hachimura with their 9th pick in the 2019 NBA draft, as well as acquiring the Philadelphia 76ers' draft rights to 42nd pick Admiral Schofield in a trade.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Wizards were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season, where the Wizards went 1\u20137 and missed the playoffs.\n2019\u20132023: The Bradley Beal era.\nIn December 2020, the Wizards traded John Wall and a first-round draft pick to the Houston Rockets for Russell Westbrook.\nIn the 2020 NBA draft, the Wizards drafted Deni Avdija and V\u00edt Krej\u010d\u00ed; Krej\u010d\u00ed's draft rights were later traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for the rights to Cassius Winston. Avdija fractured his ankle in April 2021, effectively ending his season. Bradley Beal had a career season, making All-NBA Third Team for the first time of his career. Russell Westbrook averaged a triple double for the fourth time in his career, despite not making the All-Star team.\nThe Wizards returned to the playoffs this season, but were defeated by the Philadelphia 76ers in five games.\nOn June 16, 2021, Brooks and the Wizards agreed to part ways after not being able to agree to a new contract.\nOn August 6, 2021, Washington Wizards traded Russell Westbrook, 2024 second-round pick and 2028 second-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell.\nAfter a hot start to the season, the Wizards record slowly slipped. Notable losses include a 35-point lead blown to the Clippers and a loss to the 76ers which started a fight between Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell. The Wizard's woes continued as a wrist injury that required surgery kept the team's scoring leader, Beal, out for the remainder of the season.\nThe trade deadline of the 2021\u201322 season saw a major roster change. The Wizards acquired All-Star Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is in a trade for Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans, a sharpshooter whose 5-year, $80 million contract yielded lackluster results during his time in Washington.\nOn April 19, 2023, after a consecutive season of 35-47 and missing the playoffs, the Wizards fired GM Tommy Sheppard.\n2023\u2013present: Rebuild.\nDuring the off-season of the 2023\u201324 season, the Wizards started a rebuild, trading their franchise player Bradley Beal to the Phoenix Suns for a 12-time All Star Chris Paul and traded Porzi\u0146\u0123is to the Celtics in a three-team trade for Tyus Jones, Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala and draft picks. Chris Paul was then traded to the Warriors for Patrick Baldwin Jr., Jordan Poole, draft picks and cash considerations.\nOn January 26, 2024, head coach Wes Unseld Jr. was fired and replaced by assistant coach Brian Keefe for the rest of the season. During February, the Wizards became just the 15th team in NBA history to go winless for a month. The Wizards finished with a record of 15\u201367, led in scoring by Kyle Kuzma with 22.2 points per game, his career high, in 70 games.\n2024\u201325: Arrival of Alex Sarr.\nOn June 26, 2024, the Wizards drafted Alex Sarr from France in the NBA draft with the second overall pick. They also acquired the fourteenth pick in the draft, Carlton Carrington as well as 2023 Sixth Man of The Year Malcolm Brogdon and future first round picks for Deni Avdija. Brian Keefe was also promoted from Interim Coach to full-time Head Coach.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Wizards. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Washington Wizards seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nTeam name, logos and uniforms.\nAfter moving from Chicago in 1963, the Baltimore Bullets originally went with a blue and orange scheme, which matched the city's Orioles baseball team (orange) and Colts football team (blue). The Bullets initially wore blue and white uniforms with orange trim, but in the early 1970s, orange supplanted blue as the primary color. During this era, the Bullets also wore unconventional uniforms, featuring three thick stripes which ran from the right leg up to the left side of the jersey. Beginning with the 1973\u201374 season, coinciding with the team's move to Landover, Maryland, to become the Capital Bullets, they changed their colors to red, white and blue to match the American flag. Those uniforms also featured large horizontal stripes on the chest of the jerseys, and three stars on the side panels of the shorts. The uniforms were kept when they changed their location identifier a year later to the Washington Bullets.\nThe Bullets kept the \"Stars and Stripes\" uniform until 1987, although they made a minor adjustment prior to the 1985\u201386 season with additional thin stripes, the \"Bullets\" logo on the right leg, and thin shorts stripes replacing the three stars. In 1987, the Bullets changed their logo and uniforms, going with red uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. With the exception of a switch to block lettering and numbers before the 1990\u201391 season (switching over from the Serpentine font used for both elements, with the player name on back rendered in lower case as well), the Bullets kept these uniforms until 1997.\nIn 1997, the team owner, Abe Pollin, decided to change the club's nickname from \"Bullets\" to \"Wizards\". The reasoning behind the name change was because Pollin did not want the team's name to continue to be associated with any violent connotations. The name change also included new logos, colors and uniforms, coinciding with the team's move to the new MCI Center (now Capital One Arena); though they would not play in the new arena until December 2, during which they played their first few home dates at the USAir Arena. The new team's colors were blue, bronze and black, the same colors used by the Capitals which they first unveiled two years earlier. The primary logo depicted a wizard conjuring a basketball with a quarter moon. In 2007, the Wizards made minor modifications on their team jerseys and logos. To accommodate the gold\u2013black alternate jerseys they introduced the previous season along with the design change on the Verizon Center floor, they changed their secondary team colors from bronze to metallic gold, and the player's name on the back of the jersey was changed from white and blue with bronze trim to gold (blue on home uniforms) with a change in lettering; the road uniform name lettering changed back to white with gold trim before the 2010\u201311 season.\nOn May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms, and logo. David Safren, Pat Sullivan, and Michael Glazer were the product designers for the new jerseys which include the Washington Monument as an alternate logo. The team of product designers was led by Jessie Caples, who made most of the design decisions. James Pinder was also an essential part of the team, as he helped to engineer the jerseys to meet the players' standards. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors, which are the colors of the U.S. flag. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1973 to 1987, during the team's glory years. Leonsis said the throwback to the old Bullets' uniforms was intentional; the only difference between those uniforms and the current ones is the team name on the jerseys. The colors were also used by Leonsis' other franchises, the Capitals and the Mystics, who adopted those colors in 2007 and 2011, respectively. Another Washington-based team, baseball's Washington Nationals, also use this scheme; the Washington Commanders (burgundy and gold) and D.C. United (red and black) are currently the city's only professional sports teams not to adopt the red, white and blue scheme.\nOn July 23, 2014, the Wizards unveiled a new alternate uniform. The uniform was similar to the club's road set, with the navy and red colors switched, so that navy was the predominant color instead of red.\nOn April 15, 2015, the Wizards unveiled a new primary logo. The new logo features the Washington Monument ball logo set in a roundel, with the striping pattern from the team's uniforms, three stars (each representing Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, similar to that of the NHL's Capitals), and the team's wordmarks. The team also said it would immediately discontinue the use of the wizard-partial moon logo, which had been used since 1997.\nOn September 30, 2015, the Wizards unveiled a new alternate uniform. Called the \"Baltimore Pride\" uniform, the uniform was intended to be worn for six select games during the Wizards' 2015\u201316 season.\nOn September 8, 2016, the Wizards released a second white uniform to honor the United States Armed Forces. The side stripes pay homage to the American flag.\nThe Wizards kept their existing uniforms (minus the two alternate uniforms) when Nike took over as uniform supplier in 2017. Along with the white \"Association\", red \"Icon\" and navy \"Statement\" uniforms, a \"City\" uniform was also released as part of the collection. The 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform featured a white base, \"The District of Columbia\" wordmark in navy and numbers in white. The uniform paid tribute to the Washington Monument. The \"City\" uniform for 2018\u201319 was similar to the previous set, but with a black base, white letters and orange trim. The uniform paid homage to the National Mall at night. A red version of the 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform served as the team's \"Earned\" uniform, which was a reward for making the 2018 playoffs.\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the navy \"Statement\" uniform received a minor adjustment as the city name was replaced with \"The District of Columbia\" wordmark previously used on the team's \"City\" uniforms.\nFor the Wizards' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, they brought back the white alternate uniform design worn in the 2016\u201317 season, but with the \"dc\" alternate logo in front and red numbers. The same design was carried over to the 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, but with a grey base.\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Wizards were one of 27 teams to wear mashup \"City\" uniforms in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary. This uniform featured a lighter blue base and red stripes (a nod to the 1973\u20131985 Bullets uniforms), gold trim and stylized uniform numbers (acknowledging the 1997\u20132011 Wizards uniforms), the stylized \"Washington\" typeface (like the present-day uniforms), and a tribute to the recently deceased Wes Unseld along the jock tag. Three mashup logos were also added. The alternate, \"Monument\", logo on the waist was altered to feature the throwback ball from the 1973\u20131987 Bullets logo, while the logos on the shorts feature the alternate \"dc\" logo in the shape of the Bullets logo, and the \"DMV\" logo modeled after the alternate 1997\u20132011 Wizards' \"dc\" logo.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform was unveiled alongside the Washington Nationals' \"City Connect\" uniform; both the NBA and Major League Baseball currently have uniform deals with Nike. This uniform, which is predominantly pink with blue accents, pays homage to the cherry blossoms which permeate Washington, D.C. in the spring.\nThe \"City\" uniform used for the 2023\u201324 season featured a black and anthracite base with red, bronze and patina accents. The uniform was a nod to the history of Washington, D.C. with blackletter lettering based on the original prints used in the 1700s, three red stars representing the capital flag, red diagonal stripes representing the original map of the district, and boundary stones represented by the bronze and patina gradients.\nAhead of the 2024\u201325 season, the Wizards changed their \"Statement\" uniform, taking cues from the Washington, D.C. flag with three red stars and two thick red stripes. \"The District of Columbia\" wordmark remained on the uniforms, with the only white elements being on the numbers and letters. Their \"City\" uniform for the season kept last year's blackletter lettering but with a hydrogen blue base, red letters and blue trim. The uniform was nicknamed the \"Beyond Boundaries\" uniform.\nThe 2025\u201326 \"City\" uniform brought back the template of the 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform, but with gold and black elements inspired by the team's 2006\u20132009 alternate uniform.\nHome arenas.\nIn December 2023, Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment founder and team owner Ted Leonsis engaged in a non-binding partnership with Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin to move the Wizards and Washington Capitals to a planned arena in Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia, by 2028. The structure would be part of an arts and entertainment district at the site, which would include a practice facility, restaurants, an esports venue, concert hall, and a new headquarters for Monumental. In March 2024, after officials in Alexandria announced that the $2 billion entertainment and sports complex plans were scrapped, Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser announced she has signed a deal with both teams' majority owner, Ted Leonsis, to keep the Wizards and Capitals in the District \"at least until 2050.\"\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Wizards hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.

{"id": "72861", "revid": "47127436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72861", "title": "Atlanta Hawks", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Atlanta, Georgia\nThe Atlanta Hawks are an American professional basketball team based in Atlanta. The Hawks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at State Farm Arena.\nThe team's origins can be traced to the establishment of the Buffalo Bisons in 1946 in Buffalo, New York, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL) owned by Ben Kerner and Leo Ferris. After 38 days in Buffalo, the team moved to Moline, Illinois, where they were renamed the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. In 1949, they joined the NBA as part of the merger between the NBL and the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and briefly had Red Auerbach as coach. In 1951, Kerner moved the team to Milwaukee, where they changed their name to the Milwaukee Hawks. Kerner and the team moved again in 1955 to St. Louis, where they won their first (and thus far only) NBA Championship in 1958 and qualified to play in the NBA Finals in 1957, 1960 and 1961. The Hawks played the Boston Celtics in all four of their trips to the NBA Finals. The St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta on May 3, 1968, when Kerner sold the franchise to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders. The ownership of the team includes billionaire James Cox Chambers.\nThe Hawks currently own the second-longest drought (behind the Sacramento Kings) of not winning an NBA championship at 67 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the playoffs in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. However, the Hawks are one of only four NBA teams that have qualified to play in the NBA playoffs in 10 consecutive seasons in the 21st century. They achieved this feat between 2008 and 2017.\nIn the 2024 NBA draft, the Atlanta Hawks selected Zaccharie Risacher with the first overall pick, their first since 1975.\nHistory.\n1946\u20131953: Buffalo, Tri-Cities, and Milwaukee.\nThe origins of the Atlanta Hawks can be traced back to the Buffalo Bisons franchise, which was founded in 1946. The Bisons were a member of the National Basketball League, and played their games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The club was organized by Leo Ferris and the Erie County American Legion and was coached by Nat Hickey. Their first game \u2013 a 50\u201339 victory over the Syracuse Nationals \u2013 was played on November 8, 1946. On the team was William \"Pop\" Gates, who, along with William \"Dolly\" King, was one of the first two African-American players in the NBL. The team, which needed to draw 3,600 fans per game to break even, struggled to draw even 1,000 fans per game to the Auditorium. The franchise lasted only 38 days (13 games) in Buffalo when, on December 25, 1946, Leo Ferris, the team's general manager and co-owner, announced that the team would be moving to Moline, Illinois, which at that time was part of an area then known as the \"Tri-Cities\": Moline, Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois, and Davenport, Iowa. In addition to the city of Moline for the Tri-Cities representation, the Bisons franchise also considered the bigger cities of Minneapolis and Milwaukee as potential options for them to move to instead, with the game deciding their new location being a December 6, 1946 game in Moline that drew in 4,000 people for a neutral match between the Chicago American Gears and Syracuse Nationals (now Philadelphia 76ers).\nUpon moving to Moline, the team was renamed the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and played their home games at Wharton Field House, a 6,000-seat arena in Moline. During the team's existence as the Blackhawks, the team had also been referred to as both the \"Tri-City Blackhawks\" and \"Quad-City Blackhawks\" alongside the more official Tri-Cities Blackhawks. The team featured guard/forward and coach Nat Hickey, and was owned by Leo Ferris and Ben Kerner. Pop Gates remained on the Blackhawks roster, and finished second on the team in scoring behind future 1949 NBL MVP Don Otten. A Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member, Gates helped to integrate the league and later became the first African-American coach in a major sports league, coaching Dayton in 1948.\nIn 1949, the Blackhawks became one of the National Basketball Association's 17 original teams after a merger of the 12-year-old NBL and the three-year-old Basketball Association of America (BAA). They reached the playoffs in the NBA's inaugural year under the leadership of coach Red Auerbach. The following season, they drafted three-time All-American Bob Cousy, but they were unable to reach a deal and traded him to the Chicago Stags (who would later surrender him in a dispersal draft to the Boston Celtics when the Stags folded). The Blackhawks finished last in the Western Division and missed the playoffs. By then, it was obvious that the Tri-Cities area was too small to support an NBA team. After the season, the franchise moved to Milwaukee, and became the Milwaukee Hawks.\n1954\u20131965: St. Louis and The Bob Pettit era.\nIn 1954, the Hawks drafted Bob Pettit, a future NBA MVP. Despite this, the Hawks were one of the league's worst teams, and in 1955 the Hawks moved, this time to St. Louis, Missouri, Milwaukee's rival in the beer industry, and became the St. Louis Hawks. Milwaukee would remain without an NBA team until 1968 when the Milwaukee Bucks made their debut.\nIn 1956, Bob Pettit captured the league's first official Most Valuable Player award, and the St. Louis Hawks drafted legendary Bill Russell in the first round (second overall pick). They immediately traded Russell to the Boston Celtics for Cliff Hagan and Ed Macauley, both Hall of Fame members.\nIn 1957, the Hawks finished four games under .500. However, the Western Division was extremely weak that year; no team in the division had a winning record. They won the division title and a bye to the division finals after defeating the Minneapolis Lakers and Fort Wayne Pistons in one-game tiebreakers. They then defeated the Lakers in the division finals to advance to the Finals, losing to the Boston Celtics in a double-overtime thriller in game seven.\nIn 1958, after tallying their first winning record, they again advanced to the Finals, where they avenged their defeat against the Celtics from the previous year, winning the series 4\u20132 and giving the Hawks their first and only NBA championship. Bob Pettit scored 50 points in the final game of the series. The following season Bob Pettit led the Hawks to a Western Division-best 49\u201323 record, helping him capture his second MVP award.\nThe Hawks remained one of the NBA's premier teams for the next decade. In 1960, under coach Ed Macauley, the team advanced to the Finals, but lost to the Celtics in another game seven thriller. The following year, with the acquisition of rookie Lenny Wilkens, the Hawks repeated their success, but met the Celtics in the 1961 NBA Finals again and lost in five games. They would remain contenders for most of the 1960s, advancing deep into the playoffs and also capturing several division titles.\n1965\u20131976: Move to Atlanta.\nDespite the success, Kerner became weary of the Hawks' longtime home, Kiel Auditorium. The 33-year-old arena seated only 10,000 and was starting to show its age. The Hawks occasionally played at the larger St. Louis Arena, mostly against popular opponents, but Kerner was not willing to move the team there full-time because it had not been well-maintained since the 1940s. Even though it was being heavily renovated to accommodate the arrival of the National Hockey League's (NHL) St. Louis Blues in 1967, Kerner was still not willing to move to the St. Louis Arena, because he wanted a new arena to increase revenue. However, Kerner was rebuffed by the city on several occasions. In early 1967, Kerner briefly put the Hawks up for sale. One of the bidders was a New Orleans group led by future talk show host Morton Downey Jr., but the deal collapsed and Kerner temporarily took his team off the market.\nUnable to resolve the arena situation, on May 3, 1968, Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate developer Tom Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders, which would be subject to league approval. When the deal was approved, the new owners moved the team to Atlanta to begin play for the 1968\u201369 season. While a new arena was being constructed, the team spent its first four seasons playing at Alexander Memorial Coliseum on the campus of Georgia Tech, winning their first Division title in the 1969\u201370 season with a 48\u201334 () record in the Western Division. Cousins' firm soon developed the Omni Coliseum, a 16,500-seat, state-of-the-art downtown Atlanta arena, for the Hawks and the expansion Atlanta Flames ice hockey franchise, which opened in 1972 as the first phase of a massive sports, office, hotel, and retail complex, most of which is now the CNN Center. Also in 1972, the Hawks debuted a new logo and new colors, trading the green and blue color scheme that the team had used for two years, in favor of white, gold, and red, the same colors the Flames used. The hawk head silhouette inside a circle remained as the team's logo, albeit simplified.\nThe years after the move showcased a talented Hawks team, including Pete Maravich and Lou Hudson. However, after this period of success, the team experienced some years of rebuilding. Despite appearing to be moving in the right direction when they ended up with the first and third picks overall in the 1975 NBA draft, the players selected with those two picks, David Thompson of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster of Morgan State, both signed with the Denver Nuggets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and never played for the Hawks.\n1977\u20131982: Ted Turner purchases team.\nCable network entrepreneur and Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner bought the team in 1977 and hired Hubie Brown to become head coach. The Hawks were the only NBA team in the Deep South, just as the Atlanta Braves were the only Major League Baseball team in the region for many years to come. Turner's ownership was instrumental in keeping both teams in the region. Brown won coach of the year in 1978. In the 1979\u201380 season, the Hawks finished with a 50\u201332 record and won the Central Division, their first as a member of the Central Division and second in the city of Atlanta. The next season, the Hawks got off to a 4\u20130 start, then lost 13 of the next 14 games and with 3 games left in the season, the Hawks fired head coach Hubie Brown en route to the team's 31\u201351 record.\n1982\u20131994: Dominique Wilkins era.\nIn 1982, the franchise acquired superstar Dominique Wilkins (a University of Georgia alumnus) and promoted Mike Fratello to head coach a year later. Due to sagging attendance, 12 home games during the 1984\u201385 season were played at the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. The New Orleans games were paid for by Barry Mendelson for $1.2\u00a0million with the Hawks going 6\u20136 in Louisiana. Wilkins won the Slam Dunk Contest in 1985 and 1990, engaging in an iconic rivalry with Michael Jordan. Spud Webb won the Slam Dunk Contest and Fratello won the Coach of the Year Award in 1986.\nFrom 1985 to 1989, the Hawks were among the league's elite, winning 50 games or more each season. They won a division title in 1986\u201387 going 57\u201325 which was a franchise record that would last until the 2014\u201315 season. However, the team could not advance past the semifinals of the Eastern Conference playoffs, losing to the eventual Eastern Conference (and in some years, NBA) champions Boston and Detroit. The Hawks drafted Stacey Augmon with their ninth overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft, who would make the All-Rookie First Team. However, Wilkins had a season-ending injury in the middle of the season, and without him, the Hawks were unable to make it to the playoffs. In 1992, the Hawks acquired guard Mookie Blaylock from the New Jersey Nets; he would spend seven years of his career as a Hawk, leading them in career steals and three-point field goals while earning an All-Star appearance in 1994. After seasons of mediocrity, Lenny Wilkens was hired as head coach in 1993. In 1993\u201394, the Hawks won 57 games, tying a team record. They also won a fourth division title in Atlanta, and third in the Central Division. Coach Wilkens was named Coach of the Year for his work with the team. However, the team fell short again in the playoffs, losing to the fifth-seeded Indiana Pacers in the Eastern semis in six games. The season was also marred by the trading of Dominique Wilkins, who remains the franchise's all-time leading scorer, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danny Manning, who quickly left via free agency to the Phoenix Suns after the season ended. On March 6, 2015, Dominique Wilkins received a statue in front of Philips Arena.\n1994\u20131996: Post Wilkins.\nAt the beginning of the 1994\u201395 season, the Hawks traded forward Kevin Willis to the Miami Heat for Steve Smith and Grant Long. During the season, coach Wilkens broke the record (previously held by Red Auerbach) for most victories by an NBA head coach with victory number 939. They ended up fifth in the Central Division with a 42\u201340 record and would be swept by the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs.\n1996\u20132001: Dikembe Mutombo era.\nDuring the off-season, shot-blocking All-Star center Dikembe Mutombo signed a 5-year, $55 million deal with the Hawks.\nThe Hawks finished the 1995\u201396 season with a 46\u201336 record, fourth in the Central Division. Midway through the season, they acquired Christian Laettner from the Minnesota Timberwolves; Laettner would get an All-Star appearance in 1997. They upset the third-seeded Pacers in the first round in five games; however, lost in five games to the Orlando Magic in the semifinals.\nAround this time, it was decided that the Omni should be replaced by a new arena. The Omni was designed with weathering steel that was intended to rust into a seal around the arena so it could last for decades. However, the designers and architects did not reckon on Atlanta's humid subtropical climate. As a result, it never stopped rusting, and looked somewhat dated despite being 25 years old. When Turner won an NHL franchise, the Atlanta Thrashers, one condition was that a new arena had to be in place before the new team took the ice for the first time, as The Omni was unusable even for temporary use. Eventually, it was decided that The Omni would be demolished and a new arena for the Hawks and the expansion NHL Thrashers would be built on the same area. After the 1997 playoffs, the Hawks moved back to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, with the Georgia Dome used for larger-capacity games, until Philips Arena opened before the 1999\u20132000 season.\nThe Hawks had two 50-plus win seasons in 1996\u201397 (56\u201326) and 1997\u201398 (50\u201332); center Dikembe Mutombo won defensive player of the year back to back. In the first round of the 1997 NBA playoffs, the Hawks defeated the Detroit Pistons in five games, but lost in five games in the second round to the defending champs Chicago Bulls. Game 4, an 89\u201380 loss, was the last game at The Omni. In 1997\u201398, forward Alan Henderson won Most Improved Player award. The Hawks lost in four games in the first round of the 1998 playoffs to the Charlotte Hornets. The Hawks ended with 31 wins in the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season. In the first round they defeated the Pistons in five games, but were swept in the second round by the eighth-seeded New York Knicks.\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, their first season at Philips Arena, the Hawks traded Steve Smith to Portland for Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, and sent Mookie Blaylock and a first-round draft pick to the Golden State Warriors for Bimbo Coles and a first-round draft pick. Smith and Blaylock had been among the Hawks' most popular players during the 1990s; Smith had recently received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his charitable endeavors and been picked for in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. By contrast, Rider had a history of behavioral problems both on and off the court; it continued in Atlanta. Rider missed the first day of training camp and was late for two other games. After reports that he smoked marijuana in an Orlando hotel room during a January road trip, the league demanded that he attend drug counseling, and fined him a total of $200,000 until he agreed to go. When he showed up late for a March game, the Hawks released him. The Smith/Rider trade sent the Hawks into a downward spiral. After only missing the playoffs four times since 1977, they fell to seventh place in the Central Division with a 28\u201354 record; they would not return to the playoffs for eight years.\n2001\u20132005: Post-Mutombo and struggles.\nPoint guard Jason Terry became the team's scoring leader during the 2000\u201301 season, with 19.7 ppg. After the All-Star break, the Hawks traded Mutombo to the Philadelphia 76ers for Theo Ratliff, Toni Kuko\u010d, and Nazr Mohammed. Ratliff was injured and did not play with the Hawks until next season. They ended the season with a 25\u201357 record. In 2001, the Hawks drafted Spanish star Pau Gasol third, but his rights were ceded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade involving Shareef Abdur-Rahim. Abdur-Rahim became the team's scoring leader, and made his only All-Star appearance in 2002. The team ended up 33\u201349 for the 2001\u201302 season. The Hawks sent Kukoc to the Milwaukee Bucks for All-Star Glenn Robinson in 2002, Robinson lead the team with 20.8 ppg. But the Hawks still failed to make the playoffs for the 2002\u201303 season, finishing with a 35\u201347 record.\nIn February 2004, the Hawks had NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace play one game for the team. Wallace was traded from Portland to the Hawks along with Wesley Person for Abdur-Rahim, Ratliff, and Dan Dickau. In his lone game for the Hawks, Wallace scored 20 points, had 6 rebounds, 5 blocks, 2 assists and a steal in a loss to the New Jersey Nets. After the game he was dealt to the Detroit Pistons in a three-way trade with the Boston Celtics. In turn, Detroit sent guard Bob Sura, center \u017deljko Rebra\u010da, and a first-round draft pick to the Hawks. The Boston Celtics also sent forward Chris Mills to Atlanta to complete the deal, but Mills played in a Hawks uniform. The Hawks ended their 2003\u201304 season with a 28\u201354 record. In 2003, Atlanta hosted the All-Star game, the last an Eastern Conference team would host for nine years.\nAtlanta Spirit LLC's ownership.\nOn March 31, 2004, the team was sold to a group of executives by the name of Atlanta Spirit LLC by Time Warner (who inherited the Hawks, Braves and Thrashers upon its merger with Turner Broadcasting in 1996). During the off-season, the Hawks sent Jason Terry, Alan Henderson, and a future first-round draft pick to the Dallas Mavericks for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. After the change in ownership, the Hawks still struggled. In the 2004\u201305 season, the Hawks were the league's worst team with a mere 13 victories (five fewer than even the expansion Charlotte Bobcats and the struggling New Orleans Hornets). It was also the year Josh Smith won the 2005 Slam Dunk Contest.\n2005\u20132012: Joe Johnson era.\nIn the summer of 2005, the Hawks completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Phoenix Suns to acquire Joe Johnson in return for Boris Diaw and two future 1st-round picks. They also signed Zaza Pachulia from the Milwaukee Bucks. These changes occurred after an apparent power struggle between the owners for nearly three weeks.\nDespite their league-worst record the previous season, the Hawks landed just the number-two pick in the 2005 NBA draft lottery (the first pick went to the Milwaukee Bucks). They selected Marvin Williams of North Carolina. In the 2006 draft, the Hawks selected Duke star Shelden Williams with the fifth overall pick.\nHope and redemption appeared to be on the horizon for the Hawks beginning in 2007. With the third pick of the NBA draft, they selected Al Horford. Horford nearly averaged a double-double during his rookie season, and was the only unanimous selection to the All-Rookie First Team as well as being runner-up for Rookie of the Year honors. The season started with a victory against the Dallas Mavericks 101\u201394, sending hope to Hawks fans. The last time they won a season opener was in 1998, also the last time they made the playoffs. For the 2007\u201308 season, the Atlanta Hawks updated the logos and uniforms that saw navy blue become the primary color, with red relegated to trim color status. This marked the first time in team history that they had used navy blue as one of their colors.\nA mid-season trade for point guard Mike Bibby boosted the Hawks' playoff hopes. At the time of the trade the Hawks were 22\u201328; afterwards, they won 15 of their last 32 games to finish 37\u201345. Although they finished with a losing record, they managed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1999. In the playoffs the Hawks started to show improvement, pushing the eventual NBA Champions, Boston Celtics, to a Game 7 before losing in Boston. The Hawks won all three games at Philips Arena, which hosted its first playoff games and earned its first sellout.\nThe 2008\u201309 season saw the Hawks win 47 games, their first winning season since 1999. With almost an intact lineup from the previous year, the Hawks manage to take a step forward in their development. Again they were pushed to a Game 7 in the first round but capitalized on home-court advantage earning their first playoff series win since 1999 against the Miami Heat. The Hawks were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130 in the Conference Semifinals.\nThe 2009\u201310 season saw the Hawks improve further, winning 53 games, their first 50-win season since 1997\u201398. Al Horford earned his first All-Star selection, and along with Joe Johnson, this marked the first time since 1998 that the Hawks sent two players to the All-Star Game. The playoffs, however, were a reprise from the previous year. They won a hard-fought seven-game series against the Milwaukee Bucks, but they were swept by the Orlando Magic in the second round, with every game a one-sided contest. After the season, the Hawks dismissed head coach Mike Woodson and was replaced by Larry Drew.\nThe Hawks took a step back in the 2010\u201311 season, finishing with 44 wins, even though Horford and Johnson were named to the All-Star team. In mid-season the Hawks traded Mike Bibby to the Washington Wizards for Kirk Hinrich, in hopes of bringing a defensive guard to replace the defensively liable Bibby. The Hawks finished the season losing their final six games. In the playoffs the Hawks beat the Magic in six games; however, they subsequently lost to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in six games.\nIn August 2011, it was announced that California-based businessman Alex Meruelo was buying a majority stake of the Hawks, but in November he backed out of his intentions.\nIn December 2011, the Hawks signed Tracy McGrady, Jerry Stackhouse, Jason Collins, Vladimir Radmanovic, Jannero Pargo, and Willie Green. They also picked up rookies Donald Sloan and 27-year-old Ivan Johnson. Sloan was waived a month later.\nThe Hawks finished the 2011\u201312 season with the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference with 40 wins, clinching the playoffs for the fifth straight season. However, the Hawks would be eliminated in the first round by the Boston Celtics in six games, ending the Hawks' three-year streak of advancing to the second round.\n2012\u20132013: Roster turnover.\nOn June 25, 2012, the Hawks hired San Antonio Spurs Vice President of Basketball Operations Danny Ferry as President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. During the 2012 NBA draft, the Hawks chose guard John Jenkins with the 23rd pick and power forward Mike Scott with the 43rd pick. On July 2, 2012, the Hawks traded leading scorer and All-Star Joe Johnson to the Brooklyn Nets for Jordan Farmar, Anthony Morrow, DeShawn Stevenson, Jordan Williams and Johan Petro, as well as a 2013 first-round pick. That same day, the Hawks traded small forward Marvin Williams to the Utah Jazz for point guard Devin Harris.\nOn July 10, 2012, the Hawks signed guard Lou Williams.\nOn January 21, 2013, following Lou Williams' season-ending injury in a game against the Brooklyn Nets, the Hawks signed guard Jannero Pargo to a 10-day contract.\nOn February 21, 2013, the Hawks traded Morrow to the Dallas Mavericks for Dahntay Jones. That same day, the Hawks traded a future 2nd-round pick to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Jeremy Tyler, who was waived 15 days later.\nThe Hawks ended the 2012\u201313 season with a 44\u201338 record, making a playoff appearance for the sixth straight season. However, they were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers in six games in the first round. By the end of the off-season, every player involved in the Johnson and Williams trades just a year earlier were either waived or not brought back. The 2013 free agency period also marked the end of the Josh Smith era for Atlanta as he signed a contract with the Detroit Pistons. Longtime Hawk Zaza Pachulia moved on as well and signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. With half the roster gone, 2012\u201313 proved to be a roster turnover year, paving a path to success for Mike Budenholzer.\n2013\u20132018: Mike Budenholzer era.\nOn May 28, 2013, the Hawks hired San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Mike Budenholzer as the new head coach.\nThe Hawks entered the 2013 NBA draft with four draft picks. They drafted point guards Dennis Schr\u00f6der (17th pick) and Shane Larkin (18th pick). They also chose point guard Raulzinho Neto with the 47th pick and small forward James Ennis with the 50th pick. However, the Hawks traded Larkin to the Dallas Mavericks for the draft rights of Mike Muscala and Lucas Nogueira (originally drafted by the Boston Celtics), as well as guard Jared Cunningham. They also traded Ennis's draft rights to the Miami Heat and Neto's to the Utah Jazz for a future second-round pick. The Hawks brought back Kyle Korver with a four-year, $24 million deal and signed power forward Paul Millsap to a two-year, $19 million deal.\nOn December 26, 2013, Horford tore his right pectoral muscle, and on December 30, the Hawks announced that he would undergo surgery the next day and would miss the rest of the season. The Hawks finished 38\u201344, their first losing season since 2008. However, due to the weakness of the Eastern Conference, they finished as the 8th seed in the playoffs, and just like 2008, the Hawks would not go down easy, as they took the top-seeded Pacers to 7 games in before a 92\u201380 loss in game 7.\nOn May 1, 2014, the Hawks unveiled a new secondary logo, which is a modernized version of the 1972\u201395 \"Pac-Man\" logo. On July 15, 2014, they acquired defensive specialist Thabo Sefolosha from the Oklahoma City Thunder. On September 7, 2014, Bruce Levenson announced he would sell his share of the team, after self-reporting an inappropriate email he sent in 2012. Some in the African American sports community have defended Levenson, namely Jason Whitlock and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, commenting that Levenson's email had no racist intent, but was motivated by valid business concerns.\nOn January 2, 2015, \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" reported that the remaining minority owners of Atlanta Hawks, LLC would join Levenson, effectively putting the entire franchise for sale. The sale of the team as well as the operating rights to Philips Arena was handled by Goldman Sachs and Inner Circle Sports LLC. The NBA has stated that the Hawks would remain in Atlanta as a condition of their sale. Additionally, Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed stated that the city might offer incentives for a prospective owner to keep the Hawks in Atlanta for another 30 years. On April 22, 2015, Atlanta Spirit reached a tentative agreement to sell the franchise to a group led by billionaire Tony Ressler (with Grant Hill, Steven Price, Rick Schnall, Sara Blakely, Jesse Itzler and Ressler's wife Jami Gertz holding minority stakes) for $850 million; the sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on June 24, 2015.\nOn January 31, 2015, the Hawks became the first NBA team to go 17\u20130 in a calendar month by beating Portland. The 2015 All-Star Game consisted of four Hawks All-Stars including Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, and Al Horford. On March 9, 2015, Kyle Korver and DeMarre Carroll each scored 20 points to help the Hawks become the first NBA team to 50 wins in 2014\u201315, scoring a season high in routing the Sacramento Kings 130\u2013105. The Hawks also set a franchise record by going 20-of-36 for three-pointers, breaking the mark of 19 set against the Dallas Mavericks on December 17, 1996. On March 20, 2015, the Hawks clinched their first division title in over two decades and became the first team not based in Florida to win the NBA's Southeast Division; one week later, with a win over Miami as well as a Cleveland loss to Brooklyn, the Hawks clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The team finished a franchise-best 60\u201322.\nIn the Eastern Conference first round, the Hawks defeated the Brooklyn Nets in six games. The Hawks then advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face the Washington Wizards, also defeating them in six games. It was the first time they had advanced past the second round since 1967, their second-last year in St. Louis. The Hawks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history, when they lost in four games to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nOn June 22, 2016, the Hawks traded Jeff Teague to Indiana in a three-team deal, that would give Utah's 12th pick in the 2016 NBA draft to the Hawks. On July 8, 2016, Horford signed a four-year, $113 million contract with the Boston Celtics. On July 12, 2016, Dwight Howard agreed to return home to Atlanta on a three-year, $70 million contract with the Hawks. The Hawks finished the season with a 43\u201339 record, good enough for the fifth seed. They lost in the first round to the Washington Wizards in six games.\nOn June 20, 2017, Howard was traded, along with the 31st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Marco Bellinelli, Miles Plumlee, and the 41st overall pick in the same draft. Two days later, the Hawks selected Wake Forest power forward John Collins with the 19th overall pick. On July 13, 2017, Paul Millsap left the Hawks by signing a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets.\nThe loss of Howard and Millsap proved insurmountable for the rebuilding Hawks as they finished with a 24\u201358 record in the 2017\u201318 season, last in the Eastern Conference, and missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2006\u201307 season. On April 25, 2018, the Hawks and head coach Budenholzer had mutually decided to part ways. Budenholzer later signed a deal to coach the Milwaukee Bucks.\n2018\u2013present: Trae Young era.\nOn May 11, 2018, Lloyd Pierce was hired by the Atlanta Hawks as head coach. On June 21, the Hawks selected Luka Don\u010di\u0107 with the third overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft and immediately traded him to the Dallas Mavericks for a 2019 protected first-round pick and the draft rights to Trae Young. The Atlanta Hawks also selected Kevin Huerter with the 19th pick and Omari Spellman with the 30th pick of the 2018 NBA draft. It was speculated that the Hawks general manager, Travis Schlenk, was following the same plan for a rebuild that he had success with in Golden State.\nIn July 2018, the Hawks acquired Jeremy Lin, and traded Dennis Schr\u00f6der, after he demanded to be traded. Carmelo Anthony was acquired in the trade involving Schr\u00f6der, but was later waived through a buyout. During the off-season, the team signed Vince Carter and Alex Len among other players. In February 2019, Lin was bought out, and eventually signed with the Toronto Raptors.\nIn the 2019 NBA Draft, the Atlanta Hawks obtained DeAndre Hunter who was drafted with the 4th pick. They also used the 10th pick, that they acquired when they traded Luka Don\u010di\u0107 for Trae Young, to acquire Cam Reddish.\nOn January 23, 2020, Trae Young was selected to his first All Star Game. He was voted in as a starter and was the first Hawks player to start in an All Star Game since Dikembe Mutombo in 1998. On February 4, 2020, the Hawks were involved in a four team trade in which they acquired Clint Capela and Nen\u00ea. Capela was healing from a foot injury at the time and did not play for that entire season, which was cut short due the NBA's COVID-19 protocols. Nen\u00ea was waived by the Hawks on February 6, 2020. Carter retired after the season after spending a record 22 seasons in the NBA.\nTrip to the conference finals.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Atlanta Hawks made moves to upgrade their roster. They signed two veteran players\u2014wing Bogdan Bogdanovic and power forward Danilo Gallinari\u2014and Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn to help in the backcourt.\nIn March 2021, head coach Pierce was fired after the team's 14\u201320 start to the season and Nate McMillan was named interim head coach. After McMillan took over head coaching duties, the Hawks immediately posted an eight-game win streak, putting them firmly in playoff contention. They went 27\u201311 under McMillen to finish 41\u201331, fifth-best in the Eastern Conference, and become Southeast division champions.\nIn the playoffs, they defeated the fourth-seeded Knicks before upsetting the top-seeded 76ers to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, only the second time in 54 years that the franchise had advanced past the second round. They lost to Budenholzer's Bucks in six games after Trae Young was injured by stepping on an official's foot in Game 3. Two days after the Hawks were eliminated from their deep playoff run, the Hawks announced that McMillan had agreed in principle to a four-year deal as full-time head coach, a deal finalized on July 7. The 2020\u201321 Atlanta Hawks have been compared to the 1977\u201378 Seattle SuperSonics, in that both teams had poor records early on, made a coaching change, surged up the rankings to get better records, and made unexpected deep playoff runs.\nOn June 30, 2022, the Hawks traded Danilo Gallinari and three future first-round picks for San Antonio Spurs star point guard Dejounte Murray and Jock Landale for. On July 6, 2022, the team traded Kevin Huerter to the Sacramento Kings for Maurice Harkless, Justin Holiday, and a future first-round pick. With the Young-Murray backcourt, the team finished the season below expectations with a 41\u201341 record and a first-round loss to the Boston Celtics.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, shortly before the trade deadline with a losing record, the Hawks made it widely known they were willing to trade anyone on their team except Young and third-year forward Jalen Johnson. The Hawks finished the 2023\u201324 season with a 36\u201346 record, then fell to the Chicago Bulls 131\u2013116 in the play-in tournament to miss the playoffs.\nIn the next off-season, Dejounte Murray was dealt to the New Orleans Pelicans for Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr., E.J Liddell, Cody Zeller and two future first-round picks, ending the Young-Murray backcourt after just two seasons. The Hawks won the 2024 Draft Lottery and used the 1st overall pick to select Zaccharie Risacher from France.\nThe Hawks played in the 2024 NBA Cup semifinal, with a record of 14\u201312 at the time, losing to the Bucks, preventing them from reaching their first NBA Cup Final. They finished the season two games under .500 after season-ending injuries to both Johnson (torn labrum) and backup point guard Kobe Bufkin (shoulder subluxation), and some roster turnover (DeAndre Hunter, amid an exceptional season as a backup forward, was traded at the deadline for veteran forwards Caris LeVert and Georges Niang from the Cleveland Cavaliers, while Bogdanovic was also traded at the deadline for guard Terrance Mann from the Los Angeles Clippers. Zeller never suited up a game for the team, and was sent off as trade filler around the deadline to avoid his guaranteed salary).\nDyson Daniels was named the Kia 2024-25 Most Improved Player of the Year, after an outstanding defensive season in which he set a franchise record of 229 steals in a season, and easily leading the league in steals and deflections. Injuries hurt the Hawks, which in the play-in lost two straight games to Orlando and Miami to be eliminated from contention.\nIn the off-season, the Hawks had nos. 13, 22, and 32 picks in the 2025 NBA Draft. A few days before the draft, the Hawks, taking advantage of Boston's financial woes (as wrought by the new collective bargaining agreement that imposed punitive taxes on competing teams that exceed the salary cap), traded Niang and the 32nd pick for Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is as part of a three-team trade involving the Brooklyn Nets. On the day of the draft, the Pelicans, desperate to obtain the rights to rookie Derik Queen, traded the Hawks the 23rd pick, as well as an unprotected 2026 first-round pick (decided by the better pick between Milwaukee Bucks and the Pelicans' 2025-26 lottery results) in exchange for the 13th pick. With pick no. 23, the Hawks selected forward Asa Newell, who played one year at the nearby University of Georgia and was widely considered to be a lottery pick before slipping to 23.\nOn July 1, 2025, Atlanta signed forward Nickeil Alexander-Walker from the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 4-year, $62 million contract, and guard Luke Kennard from the Memphis Grizzlies to a one-year, $11 million contract. Veteran centers Clint Capela and Larry Nance Jr. left in free agency (Capela to the Rockets and Nance to the Cavaliers), and forward Caris LeVert joined the Detroit Pistons.\nOn August 11, 2025, the Hawks signed forward Nikola \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to a fully guaranteed contract, honoring an agreement made with the front office to take a G League contract the previous season.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Hawks. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Atlanta Hawks seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nLogos and uniforms.\nThroughout the club's history, the team has undergone several uniform changes. The Hawks logo has shifted between variations of a full-bodied hawk holding a basketball on its claws and a silhouette of a hawk head (more commonly known as the Pac-Man logo). Red and white have been a part of the team's palette for the most part since the 1950s, but the Hawks also used various accent colors as well. Red, blue and white served as the team's color scheme during the St. Louis and early Atlanta years (1955\u201370), and they wore red and white uniforms for much of their tenure in St. Louis. The team moved to Atlanta in 1968 and sported baby blue and white uniforms until 1970, when they went with a blue, green and white palette. Starting in 1972, the Hawks wore red and white uniforms with yellow accents, and added black as an accent color in 1992. The color switch coincided with the arrival of the NHL's Atlanta Flames, who wore the same colors and shared the same owner as the Hawks; the now-Calgary Flames even added black a few years after the Hawks made the same tweak. From 2007 to 2015, the Hawks returned to a red, blue and white scheme, adding silver as an accent color.\nOn May 1, 2014, the club adopted a stylized version of the 'Pac-Man' logo that it used from 1972 to 1995. The 'Pac-Man' logo (placed in a roundel) would become the team's primary logo after the conclusion of the team's 2014\u201315 season. On June 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new home, road and alternate uniforms, along with its updated logos and colors. The new color scheme consisted of Torch Red, Volt Green and Georgia Granite Gray. The team also unveiled its new socks and shoes, in conjunction with the NBA's new contract for official game socks with Stance. Previously, official game socks were primarily either white or black, depending on a team's preference. The team wore white for home games, Georgia Granite Gray for road games, and Torch Red as an alternate uniform color.\nAs part of the NBA's switch to Nike, the home and road designations were replaced by \"Icon\", \"Association\", and \"Statement\". The Hawks carried over their uniforms that they had worn the previous two seasons. The numbers on the white \"Icon\" uniform were changed to red with volt green trim; the other two uniforms remained the same.\nOn July 21, 2020, the Hawks unveiled new uniforms with a look similar to the set they wore in the mid-1970s. They also returned to the red, black and yellow color scheme they wore from 1992 to 2007, while adding gray as an accent color.\nCity uniform.\nThe Hawks also wore special edition \"City\" uniforms as part of its uniform deal with Nike. In the 2017\u201318 season, the Hawks wore black uniforms with volt green accents, featuring asymmetrical striping inspired from the team's early 1970s uniforms and futuristic fonts as a nod to the city's hip-hop music scene. In the 2018\u201319 season, the Hawks wore white uniforms with black and metallic gold trim as a nod to the team's 50th anniversary in Atlanta. During the 2019\u201320 season, the Hawks wore black uniforms with peach accents as a tribute to Atlanta's Peachtree Street. This uniform returned in the 2025\u201326 season as part of the NBA revisiting past \"City\" uniform designs throughout the season. For 2020\u201321, the Hawks' \"City\" uniform paid tribute to civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., featuring a black base and gold accents. The 2021\u201322 \"City\" uniform featured various elements from previous uniforms, including a yellow base from the 2004\u201307 alternates, the full-bodied hawk logo from the 1995\u201399 uniform, the \"Hawks\" script of the 1980s uniforms, the retro \"Atlanta\" script from the 1970\u201372 uniforms, and the block numbers and striping of the 1960s uniforms. The Hawks then revisited the Peachtree theme in their 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, once again wearing black uniforms but with white/peach gradients on the striping and numbers, and a script \"Atlanta\" in white.\nThe 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform featured a black base, heritage blue and light brown trim, and lowercase \"atl\" in white letters. The design, according to the team, \"grabs inspiration from the spirit, determination, and interconnectivity of the city of Atlanta\". This theme was revisited for the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, with a look heavily based on the 1982\u20131992 uniforms.\nRivalries.\nBoston Celtics.\nThe Celtics\u2013Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the NBA that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949\u201350 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals. While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star center Al Horford leaving the team and joining the Celtics with whom he'd eventually win his first championship with in the 2024 NBA Finals.\nOrlando Magic.\nThe Hawks and the Orlando Magic have an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of Dwight Howard and Josh Smith, both from the 2004 NBA draft and who were both raised in Georgia.\nThe two teams faced each other three times in the playoffs in 1996, 2010, and 2011. The Magic beat the Hawks in the second round of the 1996 playoffs in five games and swept their 2010 playoff matchup. The Hawks eliminated the Magic 4\u20132 in the first round of the 2011 playoffs.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Hawks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list also includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with team.\n\"Italic\" denotes still active but not with team.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of April 16, 2025)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAwards and accomplishments.\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNBA MVP\nNBA Defensive Player of the Year\nNBA Rookie of the Year\nNBA Most Improved Player of the Year\nNBA Sixth Man of the Year\nNBA Coach of the Year\nNBA Executive of the Year\nNBA Sportsmanship Award\nJ.

{"id": "72862", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72862", "title": "New Orleans Pelicans", "text": "National Basketball Association team in New Orleans, Louisiana\nThe New Orleans Pelicans are an American professional basketball team based in New Orleans. The Pelicans compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Smoothie King Center.\nThe Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the 2002\u201303 season when George Shinn, then owner of the Charlotte Hornets, relocated the franchise to New Orleans. Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the team temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City, where they spent two seasons as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets before returning to New Orleans for the 2007\u201308 season. In 2013, the Hornets announced that they would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans.\nIn 22 seasons of play since the original franchise relocated from Charlotte, the New Orleans franchise has achieved an overall regular season record of 831\u2013937 (.470) and qualified for the playoffs nine times. Their achievements include two playoff series victories and one division title. To date, the franchise has yet to advance to the conference finals, joining the Charlotte Hornets as the only two teams to have never played in that round of the playoffs.\nHistory.\nBasketball in New Orleans.\nNew Orleans had been a founding member of the ABA with the New Orleans Buccaneers (1967\u20131970), but the lack of a dedicated arena and a poor performance record led the team to relocate to Memphis. The city acquired an NBA expansion franchise in June 1974: the New Orleans Jazz (as a tribute to New Orleans' history of originating jazz music). The team faced a number of the same logistical and financial woes, and relocated to Salt Lake City in 1979\u201380. One of the few bright spots during the Jazz's tenure in New Orleans was the acquisition of \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich (who had played college basketball at LSU). Although he was considered one of the most entertaining players in the league and won the scoring championship for the 1976\u201377 season with 31.1 points per game, the Jazz's best record while in New Orleans was 39\u201343 in the 1977\u201378 season.\nIn 1994, the Minnesota Timberwolves were suffering financially and an ownership group almost purchased the team and moved it to New Orleans. The Timberwolves would have played at the Louisiana Superdome until a new arena was constructed. Financial problems, however, led to the NBA blocking the move. New Orleans would attempt to chase the Vancouver Grizzlies before finally landing another team in 2002.\n2002\u20132005: The relocation and early years in New Orleans.\nWhile the Charlotte Hornets put a competitive team on the court throughout the 1990s, the team's attendance began falling dramatically. Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team's owner, George Shinn, who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city. In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city. The consensus was that while Charlotte was a basketball city, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum, which had been considered state-of-the-art when it opened but had since been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis, Tennessee, which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies. Shinn then issued an ultimatum that unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk, Louisville, or St. Louis. Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis had an NBA-ready arena, the Savvis Center, already in place and was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have previously hosted an NBA franchise\u2014the St. Louis Hawks, who moved to Atlanta in 1968.\nInvestigations into the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball program uncovered information regarding a non-binding agreement made around this time period to move the Hornets to Louisville. At the time, Louisville officials were in the early stages of building a new arena. A group of businessmen and politicians from Louisville signed a non-binding agreement with the Hornets to move the team to Louisville, as long as they built a new arena downtown. Louisville officials were in the early planning process of building what would be the KFC Yum! Center. Louisville officials were eager to bring the NBA team to Louisville, whose last professional basketball team was the ABAs Kentucky Colonels. However, Louisville Basketball's newly hired head coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were publicly opposed to the idea of bringing a professional sports team to Louisville, which led to the deal falling through. David Stern recalled thinking \"If Rick Pitino doesn't want us there, why would we go?\".\nFinally, a new arena in Uptown, which would eventually become the Spectrum Center, was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team. Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage. However, just days before the referendum, Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's African American ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees were not paid enough to make a living. After the referendum failed, city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support, but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans, league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners as it could set a precedent. The city council refused to remove the statement, leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans\u2014a move which would eventually return the NBA to that city for the first time since the Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved the move. As part of a deal, the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team, which took the court two years later as the .\nIn a 2008 interview with \"The Charlotte Observer\", Shinn, who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved, admitted that the \"bad judgment I made in my life\" played a role in the Hornets' departure. He also said that if he had it to do all over again, he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial. Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying, \"I've made enough mistakes in my life. I'm not going to make one here. This city needs us here. We're going to make this (New Orleans) thing work.\"\nThe Hornets opened their inaugural season in New Orleans on October 30, 2002, against New Orleans' original NBA franchise, the Utah Jazz. In the first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years, the Hornets defeated the Jazz 100\u201375, and posthumously retired #7 of \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich during halftime. The Hornets finished the season with a 47\u201335 record but were defeated by the Philadelphia 76ers in the First Round of the 2003 playoffs. Following the season, the team unexpectedly fired head coach Paul Silas and replaced him with Tim Floyd. The Hornets began the 2003\u201304 season strong with a 17\u20137 start but sputtered at the end and finished 41\u201341. They lost to the Miami Heat in the First Round of the 2004 playoffs. After the season, Floyd was fired and the team hired Byron Scott as its new head coach.\nDuring the first two seasons in New Orleans, the Hornets competed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. The 2004\u201305 season saw the team move to the Western Conference's Southwest Division to even the number of teams in each conference after the Charlotte Bobcats started play in their inaugural season of that same year. In a season marred by injuries to the team's three all-stars, the team finished the year with a franchise-worst record of 18\u201364.\n2005\u20132011: The Chris Paul era.\nIn the subsequent draft, the Hornets used their first-round pick to select point guard Chris Paul out of Wake Forest University. Because of the catastrophic devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina upon the communities of southeastern Louisiana, the Hornets franchise temporarily relocated its base of operations to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, posting records of 38\u201344 and 39\u201343 respectively. During this time, the franchise was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. In these two seasons, most home games were played at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, while a few remained at New Orleans Arena. One year after the Hornets moved back to New Orleans permanently, the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nThe Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007\u201308 season, with all 41 home games in the New Orleans Arena. The 2008 NBA All-Star Game and its accompanying festivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was commenced in February 2007. Healthier than previous seasons, the Hornets opened the season with a 29\u201312 record at the halfway mark, completing the regular season with a record of 56\u201326, making the season their most successful ever. The Hornets also won their first division title, winning the Southwest Division. Having clinched the second overall seed for the Western Conference in the 2008 playoffs, the Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks in the first round, but then lost to the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the conference semifinals.\nIn August 2008, the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the colors of Creole blue, purple, and Mardi Gras gold. Pinstripes were also added to the uniforms. The Hornets also introduced a new gold alternate uniform in 2010 which was used mostly in games played on Saturday at home and on the road. The Hornets finished the 2008\u201309 season with a 49\u201333 record. Facing the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2009 playoffs, the Hornets were eliminated in five games. The Hornets started the 2009\u201310 season with a 3\u20136 record and fired head coach Byron Scott. General manager Jeff Bower took over the head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. The Hornets finished the season with a 37\u201345 record and last in the Southwest Division they had won two seasons prior. Jeff Bower resigned as head coach and Monty Williams was brought in as new head coach. The team finished the 2010\u201311 season with a 46\u201336 record and qualified for the 2011 NBA playoffs, where they lost to the Lakers four games to two.\nIn December 2010, the NBA purchased the Hornets from George Shinn for an estimated $300 million.\n2011: The departure of Chris Paul.\nBefore the 2011\u201312 season, the Hornets were considering trade offers for Chris Paul and he requested a trade to the New York Knicks. The Hornets looked at many teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul had made it clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles. A three-team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon, but commissioner David Stern, acting as the President of Basketball Operations for the Hornets (which were owned by the league office at that time) rejected the trade. On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to Los Angeles in exchange for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004.\n2012\u20132019: The Anthony Davis era.\n2012\u20132013: Beginning of the Anthony Davis era.\nOn April 13, 2012, it was announced that Tom Benson, owner of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints, had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338 million. In addition, Benson announced that he would change the team name to something that would better suit the region, fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte, where the Charlotte Bobcats had been playing since 2004. In June 2012, Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets: Saints' general manager Mickey Loomis became head of basketball operations, overseeing general manager Dell Demps, and Saints' business operations head Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets.\nThe Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to the Wizards for Rashard Lewis, whom they bought out, and a draft pick.\nOn May 30, 2012, the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft and subsequently drafted Anthony Davis. Some people believed that David Stern rigged the draft lottery to give the Hornets the first overall pick, citing a picture of Davis in a Hornets hat as evidence. They also drafted Austin Rivers with the 10th pick (acquired from the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade).\nOn July 11, 2012, Ryan Anderson, 2012's Most Improved Player and three-point field goals leader, was acquired by the New Orleans Hornets in a sign-and-trade with the Orlando Magic for Gustavo Ay\u00f3n.\n2013\u20132015: Hornets to Pelicans.\nNew owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team's name to something more local, even preferring that the Utah Jazz \u2013 founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979 \u2013 give up the \"Jazz\" name, but the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it. Benson had also heavily favored the names \"Brass\" and \"Krewe\".\nHowever, on December 4, 2012, it was reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013\u201314 season. The team name is inspired by Louisiana's state bird, the brown pelican.\nThe name \"Pelicans\" previously had been used by a minor-league baseball team that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957. The Hornets organization officially confirmed the name change in a press conference held on January 24, 2013, where officials unveiled the team's new logos and navy blue\u2013gold\u2013red color scheme. On April 18, 2013, after the end of the team's 2012\u201313 season, the team's name was officially changed to the Pelicans.\nFollowing the New Orleans franchise's 2013 abandonment of the \"Hornets\" name, on May 21, 2013, the Charlotte Bobcats' owner Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014\u201315 season pending majority approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas, on July 18, 2013. Then-NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process. The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014\u201315.\nOn June 27, 2013, during the 2013 NBA draft, the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall, and traded him along with a 2014 protected first-round pick for All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick, Pierre Jackson. During a press conference on May 20, 2014, announcing the Charlotte Bobcats' official team name change to Hornets, it was also announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer the records and statistics of the original Hornets (1988\u20132002) to the current Charlotte franchise, thus unifying all of Charlotte's NBA basketball history under one franchise; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to New Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans, retroactively turning the Pelicans into a 2002 expansion team. As a result, the Hornets are considered in the league records as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, became the Bobcats from 2004 to 2014, and then the Hornets again.\n2015: Return to the playoffs.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, for the first time under the name Pelicans, the team qualified for the NBA playoffs with a 45\u201337 record as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. They owned the tie-breaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder by winning the regular season head-to-head series, 3\u20131, and they faced the Golden State Warriors in the first round; the Warriors swept the Pelicans in four games. After the season, the Pelicans fired coach Monty Williams.\nOn May 31, 2015, the Pelicans hired Alvin Gentry as the franchise's sixth head coach. The Pelicans missed the 2016 NBA playoffs, finishing with a 30\u201352 record. They acquired the 6th pick in the 2016 NBA draft from the draft lottery and selected Buddy Hield from the University of Oklahoma.\n2017\u20132019: End of the Anthony Davis era.\nOn February 20, 2017, the Pelicans acquired DeMarcus Cousins in a trade with the Sacramento Kings when they traded Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2017 second-round pick in exchange for Cousins and Omri Casspi.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Pelicans acquired Nikola Miroti\u0107 in a trade with the Chicago Bulls. Though the trade went through, a previous trade for Miroti\u0107 to the Pelicans was called off when New Orleans did not want to pay for Miroti\u0107's 2019 team option that Miroti\u0107 had signed with the Bulls during the off-season in 2017. The Pelicans received Miroti\u0107 and a 2018 second-round pick for veterans \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k, Jameer Nelson, and Tony Allen. Miroti\u0107 demanded a trade when former teammate Bobby Portis punched Miroti\u0107 in the face during an off-season practice. At the time of the trade, Miroti\u0107 was the Bulls' leading scorer, and DeMarcus Cousins was injured. Miroti\u0107 played well for the Pelicans after the trade.\nOn March 15, 2018, Tom Benson died from complications of the flu. Ownership of the Pelicans and the Saints were transferred to Benson's widow, Gayle Benson.\nThe Pelicans clinched a playoff spot on April 9, 2018, and finished with a 48\u201334 record. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the Portland Trail Blazers in four games before losing to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors four games to one.\nIn January 2019, Davis demanded a trade from the franchise, and was fined for publicly announcing the request. On May 14, 2019, the Pelicans received the first overall pick at the NBA draft lottery of the 2019 NBA draft, despite having a six percent chance to win it. On June 15, 2019, the Pelicans agreed to trade Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers. In return, the Lakers agreed to send Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks, including the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, to the Pelicans. The Pelicans later agreed to trade draft rights of the fourth overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft to the Atlanta Hawks, receiving the draft rights to the eighth, 17th and 35th picks in the 2019 NBA draft. The three-way trade was completed on July 6, 2019, marking the end of an era for the Pelicans.\n2019\u2013present: The Zion Williamson era.\nOn April 17, 2019, the Pelicans named David Griffin as the new executive vice president of basketball operations. On May 19, 2019, the Pelicans named former Brooklyn Nets assistant general manager Trajan Langdon their new general manager, replacing interim general manager Danny Ferry.\nOn June 20, 2019, the Pelicans selected Zion Williamson with the first overall pick. The team also drafted Alen Smailagi\u0107 and Jordan Bone, both of whom were immediately traded to the Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks, respectively. The Pelicans then received Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Marcos Louzada Silva from the Hawks. On July 1, the Pelicans announced that they signed Williamson to his rookie-scale contract. However, the Pelicans began the 2019\u201320 season without Williamson as he had a knee surgery following an injury in the preseason. He made his debut on January 22, 2020, scoring 22 points in 18 minutes of play. On March 3, 2020, Williamson was named the NBA Rookie of the Month for the month of February. During the month, Williamson averaged 25.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 1.0 steal per game.\nBrandon Ingram had a breakout season. On December 30, 2019, Ingram was named the Western Conference Player of the Week for games played from December 23 to 29. During the week, Ingram averaged 25.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 2.0 steals per game while shooting 49.3 percent from the field and 54.2 percent from three-point range. Ingram helped the Pelicans to a 4\u20130 week as a result. On January 16, 2020, Ingram scored a career-high 49 points in a 138\u2013132 overtime win against the Utah Jazz. Ingram gave the Pelicans a one-point lead with a fadeaway jumper with 0.2 seconds remaining in regulation. This was before Rudy Gobert was fouled and subsequently sent the game into overtime with a free throw. Because of his breakout season, Ingram became an NBA All-Star for the first time in his career. Ingram also won the 2020 Most Improved Player award.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Pelicans were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. On August 9, 2020, the Pelicans were eliminated from postseason contention when the Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers.\nIn a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers, the Pelicans landed 2015-16 Most Improved Player CJ McCollum as well as Larry Nance Jr. and Tony Snell in exchange for Josh Hart, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd, Didi Louzada, a protected 2022 first-round draft pick, the better of New Orleans' and Portland's 2026 second-round draft picks and New Orleans' 2027 second-round draft pick. Despite Williamson missing the entire season with a right foot fracture, the Pelicans finished the 2021\u201322 NBA season with a 36\u201346 record, which earned them the ninth-place position in the Western Conference and a chance to make the playoffs through the play-in tournament. On April 13, 2022, the Pelicans defeated the 10th-place San Antonio Spurs 113\u2013103 at home in the first round of the play-in and two days later defeated the eighth-place Los Angeles Clippers 105\u2013101 on the road in the second round of the play-in to clinch the eighth seed and New Orleans' first playoff berth since 2018.\nThe Pelicans selected Dyson Daniels with the 8th overall pick in the 2022 draft. Zion was selected for his second All-Star game despite only playing 29 games. Other Pelicans players would also dealt with injuries, but the team still made the play-in for the second time in a row but failed to advance to the playoffs.\nFor the first time since his second season, Zion Williamson stayed healthy for a majority of the regular season, playing 70 games. 2021 draft second-round pickup Herb Jones made the All-Defensive First Team as the fourth Pelican to do so. The Pelicans finished 49\u201333, just shy of 50 wins and advanced to the play-in for the third year in a row. Zion Williamson dropped 40 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in a loss to the Lakers. In that game, Zion got injured, ending his season. Despite not having Williamson, the Pelicans beat the Kings and advanced to the playoffs where they were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n2024\u2013present: Acquisition of Dejounte Murray and departure of Brandon Ingram.\nIn the 2024 off-season, a blockbuster trade sent 2022 All-Star Dejounte Murray to the Pelicans in exchange for 2022 lottery pick Dyson Daniels to the Atlanta Hawks along with Larry Nance Jr., E.J. Liddell, Cody Zeller and some future draft picks.\nOn February 6, 2025, Brandon Ingram was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for guard-forward Bruce Brown, center Kelly Olynyk, a 2026 first-round draft pick (via Indiana) and a 2031 second-round draft pick. On March 10, the NBA and Australia's National Basketball League (NBL) announced that in October 2025, the Pelicans would play two preseason games at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne as part of the .\nLogos and uniforms.\nOriginally, the New Orleans Hornets wore teal and white uniforms, with purple and gold added as trim colors. In 2004, they added a gold uniform to the rotation, and in 2006, it became the team's primary road uniform, while the teal uniform remained in use as an alternate. The 'fleur-de-bee' logo was added on the right chest in 2007. All three uniforms only featured the city name in front.\nDuring their two-year residency in Oklahoma City (2005\u20132007), the Hornets wore modified white uniforms with the team name in front. A teal hexagon patch with the acronym \"OKC\" inside adorned the right chest of their uniforms to represent their temporary home. They also wore a special white uniform with \"Oklahoma City\" surrounding the number, and a corresponding red uniform worn during Valentine's Day 2007. The red uniforms were auctioned for charity. Both uniforms replaced the \"OKC\" patch with the \"NOLA\" patch.\nIn 2008, the Hornets received new logos and uniforms, featuring lettering and numbers inspired by the wrought iron designs of the city. Teal was replaced with \"creole blue\", and pinstripes were added to the uniform. The following season, the Hornets began wearing a special uniform during Mardi Gras week; the design featured a purple front and a green back along with the \"NOLA\" wordmark in gold. Before the 2010\u201311 season, the Hornets brought back a gold alternate uniform, this time with pinstripes and the \"NOLA\" wordmark in front.\nThe New Orleans Hornets were sold to Tom Benson on April 13, 2012. After purchasing the team, Benson indicated that he wanted to change the club's nickname to something more regionally appropriate. On December 14, 2012, it was reported that the Hornets would change their nickname to the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 24, 2013, the team held a press conference, where it unveiled its new nickname, logos and colors. The name Pelicans is a reference to the brown pelican, the state bird of Louisiana. The team said in a press release that its colors would be navy, gold and red; each color is represented in the city flag of New Orleans. The team formally adopted its new brand identity at the end of the 2012\u201313 season.\nOn August 1, 2013, the Pelicans released their new uniforms. The 'New Orleans' wordmark logo across the front of the jerseys is inspired by French Quarter street signs; the Pelicans are one of three NBA teams to wear the city name across the front of both home and road jerseys. The partial logo is featured on the sides of the shorts, and the \"Bird-de-Lis\" logo (a combination mark of the pelican, fleur-de-lis and crescent basketball shape) is featured on the back neck. NBA teams were not allowed to have alternate uniforms during their first season of operation.\nOn September 23, 2014, the Pelicans unveiled a red alternate uniform for the 2014\u201315 season that would be worn four times in the year. Prior to the red alternate uniform unveiling, the NBA announced that its league logo would be moved to the back neck of game jerseys for all 30 clubs; as a result, the NBA league logo replaced the \"Bird-de-Lis\" logo on the back neck.\nOn September 17, 2015, the Pelicans unveiled a new alternate uniform, introduced as part of the NBA's \"Pride\" uniforms for the 2015\u201316 season. The short-sleeved uniforms feature Mardi Gras' signature colors \u2013 purple, green and gold. The tops are purple with green accents on the sleeves and sport 'NOLA' (a local acronym for New Orleans, Louisiana) across the chest in the Pelicans' signature font in gold letters trimmed in green. The Pelicans 'NO' logo is featured at the bottom of the v-neck and the Crescent City basketball logo is on the left sleeve in Mardi Gras colors. Additionally, the trim around the neckline is purple, green and gold-striped. Additionally, on the back of the jersey, the players' numbers will be gold with green trim, last name in white traditional lettering and the NBA logo will be featured at the base of the neck. The purple shorts will have green and gold stripes down the side with a small secondary logo \u2013 the \"Bird-de-Lis\" in gold centered on the waistband. The Pelicans' partial logo is on both sides of the shorts in Mardi Gras colors.\nIn 2017, the Pelicans received minor tweaks upon switching to Nike as the uniform supplier. The white \"Association\" and navy \"Icon\" uniforms now featured an enlarged and condensed treatment of the \"New Orleans\" wordmark, in a manner similar to the red \"Statement\" uniforms with the \"Pelicans\" wordmark. They also continued to wear their Mardi Gras-themed uniforms as part of the \"City\" edition series, which were updated annually. And during the 2018\u201319 season, the Pelicans wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform as a reward for qualifying in the 2018 playoffs. The uniforms switched the Mardi Gras colors for the Pelicans' existing palette.\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Pelicans' \"City\" uniform deviated from the Mardi Gras theme of previous years and was modeled after the New Orleans city flag.\nThe 2021\u201322 season saw a number of teams wear \"City\" uniforms featuring elements from past uniform designs; this was to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary. However, the Pelicans' \"City\" uniform for that season did not follow the aforementioned template, due to the fact that the team already sold the Hornets trademark to the Charlotte franchise back in 2014. Instead the team wore white \"City\" uniforms bearing the current color scheme and \"NOLA\" lettering shaped to resemble a bird in flight.\nThe Pelicans' 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform brought back the Mardi Gras-inspired design they last wore in the 2018\u201319 season, but with a dark purple base.\nPrior to the 2023\u201324 season, the Pelicans updated their red \"Statement\" uniform, now featuring the words \"Crescent City\" in white letters with navy blue trim surrounding navy blue numbers with white trim. The striping was also adjusted. Their \"City\" uniform for the season featured a black base with neon green letters, which were inspired by the vibrant night life of New Orleans. This uniform was reinstated during the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe \"City\" uniform used in the 2024\u201325 season mixed last season's uniform with the Mardi Gras-inspired look of the 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform. The dark purple-based uniform featured \"NOLA\" in gold letters with neon green trim.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Pelicans hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Pelicans. For the full season-by-season history, see List of New Orleans Pelicans seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nMascot.\nPierre the Pelican is the official mascot for the Pelicans. He was introduced on October 30, 2013, the opening night of regular season for the team at home against the Indiana Pacers. The name for the mascot was selected by the fans through an online poll on the team's website. However, Pierre's unconventional design frightened some fans. The mascot's redesigned head was released on February 11, 2014. The Pelicans' prior mascot was Hugo the Hornet, who was part of the organization from 2002 to 2013. Hugo returned as the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets starting with the 2014\u201315 season.\nSponsorship and Partnerships.\nSince 2014, the Pelicans have played in the Smoothie King Center, following a 10-year naming rights agreement with the smoothie and supplement chain headquartered in nearby Metairie, Louisiana. In 2023, the team added NewAge Products as their official jersey patch sponsor. Over the years, the franchise has also partnered with brands such as Zatarain\u2019s, Entergy, Chevron, and Hancock Whitney Bank across media, community initiatives, and in-arena sponsorship activations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72866", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72866", "title": "Chicago Bulls", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Chicago, Illinois\nThe Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team was founded on January 16, 1966, and played its first game during the 1966\u201367 NBA season. The Bulls play their home games at the United Center, which they share with the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks; both teams previously played at the now-demolished Chicago Stadium.\nThe Bulls saw their greatest success during the 1990s when they played a major part in popularizing the NBA worldwide. They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six of their championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an NBA Finals series in their history. The Bulls won 72 games during the 1995\u201396 season, setting an NBA record that stood until the Golden State Warriors won 73 games during the 2015\u201316 season. The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 2015\u201316 Warriors.\nSince 1998, the Bulls have failed to regain their former success. The franchise struggled throughout the 2000s but showed promise in the early 2010s led by Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, culminating in back-to-back seasons above .732 in 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312. An ACL tear suffered by Rose and subsequent trades of key players triggered a rebuild, culminating in different lineups throughout the late 2010s and early 2020s. Jordan and Rose won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award while playing for the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards. The Bulls share rivalries with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat, and the New York Knicks. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nHistory.\n1966\u20131975: Team creation and early success.\nThe Chicago Bulls were granted an NBA franchise on January 16, 1966, making them the third NBA team in Chicago's history, following the Chicago Stags (1946\u20131950) and the Chicago Packers/Zephyrs (1961\u20131963). The franchise was founded by Dick Klein, the only owner in Bulls history to have played professional basketball, having previously played for the Chicago American Gears. Klein served as the team\u2019s general manager and president during its formative years.\nAfter the 1966 NBA expansion draft, the Bulls (coached by Chicagoan and former NBA All-Star Johnny \"Red\" Kerr) were allowed to acquire players from established teams. In their inaugural 1966\u201367 season, the Bulls played their first game on October 15, securing an upset victory over the St. Louis Hawks. They finished the season with a 33\u201348 record, the best by any expansion team in NBA history at the time, and became the first (and only) expansion team to qualify for the playoffs. Guard Guy Rodgers, who led the league in assists, and forward Jerry Sloan were named All-Stars, and Kerr earned Coach of the Year honors.\nThe Bulls initially played their home games at the International Amphitheatre before moving to Chicago Stadium. Despite their early success, fan interest waned over the next few seasons, with attendance dropping significantly. One Bulls game in the 1967\u201368 season had an official attendance of 891 while some Bulls games were being played in Kansas City. In 1969, Klein resigned as general manager and hired Pat Williams, who had gained prominence with the Philadelphia 76ers for his promotional efforts. Williams revitalized the franchise, making key roster changes and introducing the team's first mascot, Benny the Bull, which helped increase attendance and visibility.\nUnder Williams and head coach Dick Motta, the Bulls made the playoffs for four consecutive seasons, including setting a franchise record of 57 wins in 1972. During this period, the team relied on key players like Sloan, Bob Love, Chet Walker, and Norm Van Lier. The Bulls made their first appearance in the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the eventual NBA champions, the Golden State Warriors, in a 4-3 series. Despite continued success through the early 1970s, the team faced challenges in the late decade. After four seasons of 50 or more wins, Williams left for Philadelphia, and Motta took on both the coaching and general manager roles. The Bulls' performance declined significantly, culminating in a 24\u201358 season in 1975\u201376. As a result, Motta was fired and replaced by Ed Badger.\n1976\u20131984: Gilmore and Theus duo.\nKlein sold the Bulls to the Wirtz family, longtime owners of the Chicago Blackhawks. Indifferent to NBA basketball, the new ownership group infamously implemented a shoestring budget, putting little time and investment into improving the team.\nArtis Gilmore, acquired in the ABA dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard Reggie Theus, forward David Greenwood and forward Orlando Woolridge.\nIn 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft (Rod Thorn, the Bulls' general manager, called \"heads\"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected Magic Johnson; instead, they selected David Greenwood with the second pick. The Los Angeles Lakers selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the New Orleans Jazz, who traded the selection for Gail Goodrich.\nAfter Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center Dave Corzine, the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered on Theus, and which soon included guards Quintin Dailey and Ennis Whatley. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the Kansas City Kings during the 1983\u201384 season. Local businessman Jerry Reinsdorf purchased a controlling stake in the team in 1985, two years after the death of Arthur Wirtz, patriarch of the Wirtz family.\n1984\u20131990: Michael Jordan era begins.\nIn the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the 1984 NBA draft, after Houston and Portland. The Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon, the Blazers picked Sam Bowie and the Bulls chose shooting guard Michael Jordan. The team, with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause, decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to the playoffs, where they lost in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\nIn the following off-season, the team acquired point guard John Paxson and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward Charles Oakley. Along with Jordan and center Dave Corzine, they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the 1985\u201386 season, Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for the playoffs, and led the eighth-place Bulls against the 67\u201315 Boston Celtics, led by Larry Bird. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history. Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.'\nIn the 1986\u201387 season, Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40\u201342, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs.\nIn the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward Scottie Pippen. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987\u201388 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.\nThe 1988\u201389 season marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward Charles Oakley, who had led the league in total rebounds in both 1987 and 1988, was traded on the eve of the 1988 NBA draft to the New York Knicks along with a first-round draft pick used by the Knicks to select Rod Strickland for center Bill Cartwright and a first-round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center Will Perdue. In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter Craig Hodges from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons.\nIn 1989\u201390, Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach Doug Collins was replaced by assistant coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls also picked up rookie center Stacey King and rookie point guard B. J. Armstrong in the 1989 draft. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.\n1990\u20131993: First championship three-peat.\nIn the 1990\u201391 season, the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through the playoffs, where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals, and then swept the defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals, then winning the NBA Finals in five games over the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Bulls won their second straight title in 1992 after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They swept the Miami Heat in the first round, defeated the Knicks in seven games in the second round, then the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the third round, advancing to the Finals for the second year in a row where they defeated the Clyde Drexler-led Portland Trail Blazers in six games.\nIn 1993, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks in the first three rounds of the playoffs and then defeating regular season MVP Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns in the Finals, with Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99\u201398 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix.\n1993\u20131995: Jordan's first retirement and the Scottie Pippen era.\nOn October 6, 1993, Michael Jordan shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his father's murder. The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen, who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the 1994 All-Star MVP. He received help from Horace Grant and B. J. Armstrong, who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by Cartwright, Perdue, shooting guard Pete Myers, and Croatian rookie forward Toni Kuko\u010d. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the 1993\u201394 season, they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of the playoffs, after a controversial foul call by referee Hue Hollins in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the NBA Finals that year, but lost to the Houston Rockets. The Bulls opened the 1994\u201395 season by leaving their home of 27 years, Chicago Stadium, and moving into their current home, the United Center.\nIn 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and Scott Williams to free agency, and John Paxson to retirement, but picked up shooting guard Ron Harper, the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach Tex Winter's triple-post offense, and small-forward Jud Buechler. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kuko\u010d at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter Steve Kerr, whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993\u201394 season, Myers, and centers Luc Longley (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and Bill Wennington. However, the Bulls struggled during the season, and on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs, where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic, which included Horace Grant, Penny Hardaway, and Shaquille O'Neal.\nIn the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman, who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the Detroit Pistons' \"Bad Boys\" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s.\n1995\u20131998: Return of Michael Jordan and second championship three-peat.\nWith a lineup of Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, Harper and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in Steve Kerr, Kuko\u010d, Wennington, Buechler, and guard Randy Brown, the Bulls were seen as the team to win again for the NBA Finals.\nThe Bulls started their 1995\u201396 campaign with a 105\u201391 win over the visiting Hornets. In that game, Michael Jordan recorded 42 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists for the Bulls. The next game, they were up against the Boston Celtics. The Bulls scored 35 points in the third quarter as they pulled away against the Celtics, 107\u201385. Six Bulls players scored in double figures in this win. The 1995\u201396 Bulls posted one of the best single-season improvements in league history and the best single-season record at that time, moving from 47\u201335 to 72\u201310, becoming the first NBA team to win 70 or more games. Jordan won his eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title, while Kerr finished second in the league in three-point shooting percentage. Jordan garnered the elusive triple crown with the NBA MVP, NBA All-Star Game MVP, and NBA Finals MVP. Krause was named NBA Executive of the Year, Jackson Coach of the Year, and Kuko\u010d the Sixth Man of the Year. Both Pippen and Jordan made the All-NBA First Team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman made the All-Defensive First Team, making the Bulls one of several teams in NBA history with three players on the All-Defensive First Team.\nIn addition, the 1995\u201396 team holds several other records, including the best road record in a standard 41 road-game season (33\u20138), the all-time best start by a team (41\u20133), and the best start at home (37\u20130). The Bulls also posted the second-best home record in history (39\u20132), behind only the 1985\u201386 Celtics 40\u20131 home mark. The team triumphed over the Miami Heat in the first round, the New York Knicks in the second round, the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals and finally Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp and the Seattle SuperSonics for their fourth title. The 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls are widely regarded as one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball.\nIn the 1996\u201397 season, the Bulls missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69\u201313. They repeated their home dominance, going 39\u20132 at the United Center. The Bulls capped the season by defeating the Bullets, Hawks and Heat in the first three rounds of the playoffs en route to winning their fifth NBA championship over John Stockton, Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz. Jordan earned his second straight and ninth career scoring title, while Rodman earned his sixth straight rebounding title. Jordan and Pippen, along with Robert Parish, who was a member of the Bulls at the time, were also honored as members of the 50 greatest players of all time with the NBA celebrating its 50th season. Parish, whose single season with the Bulls would be his last year in the league, was nominated for his stellar career with the Boston Celtics.\nThe 1997\u201398 season was one of turmoil for the NBA champion Bulls. Many speculated this would be Michael Jordan's final season with the team. Phil Jackson's future with the team was also questionable, as his relationship with team general manager Jerry Krause was one of growing tension. Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular season record of 62\u201320. Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.\nThe first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets, a team led by Keith Van Horn, Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1\u20131. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls. The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88\u201383, winning their sixth Eastern Conference title.\nIn a much-anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the Utah Jazz. Led by Karl Malone and John Stockton, the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3\u20131 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83\u201381. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams. Scottie Pippen left early in the first quarter due to an ongoing back injury. He came back at the start of the second half, and after a trip or two to the locker room to get physical therapy, came back out to finish the game. Late in the game and down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit the game winning shot with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87\u201386, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.\n1998\u20132008: Post-Jordan era and a decade of struggle.\n1998\u20132004: The Baby Bulls.\nThe summer of 1998 marked the end of the Bulls' championship era. GM Jerry Krause, citing the team's aging roster, opted to rebuild rather than face decline. He traded Scottie Pippen for minimal returns, let Dennis Rodman walk, and dealt other key players for draft picks. Krause also hired coach Tim Floyd to replace Phil Jackson. Michael Jordan announced his second retirement, leaving the Bulls with a new starting lineup featuring Toni Kuko\u010d, who led the team but couldn't prevent a 13-37 record in the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, which included a record-low 49 points in a game against Miami.\nWinning the draft lottery provided a highlight, allowing the Bulls to draft Elton Brand. Despite his stellar rookie season and co-Rookie of the Year honors, injuries and trades left the team floundering at 17-65 in 1999\u20132000. Attempts to attract top free agents failed, and new additions like Brad Miller and Ron Mercer didn't improve results, leading to a league-worst 15-67 record the following season. Krause shocked fans by trading Brand for Tyson Chandler and drafting Eddy Curry, both seen as long-term prospects. Without veteran leadership, the team struggled, despite mid-season trades and a coaching change from Floyd to Bill Cartwright, finishing with only 21 wins.\nOptimism returned in 2002\u201303 with the addition of Jay Williams and a young, talented core, but inconsistency limited progress to 30-52. Krause retired in 2003, and John Paxson became GM. Williams' career was derailed by a motorcycle accident, and Pippen's return was marred by injuries. The 2003\u201304 season saw setbacks from Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler, leading to Cartwright's firing and Scott Skiles' hiring. A major trade shifted the team's strategy to defense, but the Bulls still finished 23-59. Kirk Hinrich emerged as a fan favorite, earning All-Rookie honors amid another disappointing season.\n2004\u20132008: Continued rebuilding.\nBetween 2004 and 2008, the Chicago Bulls underwent notable roster transformations and fluctuating on-court results in their efforts to rebuild as a competitive team. In the 2004 NBA Draft, General Manager John Paxson acquired Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, and Chris Duhon while also signing Andr\u00e9s Nocioni, a gold medalist with Argentina. Despite beginning the season with nine consecutive losses, the team recovered to finish 47\u201335, making their first playoff appearance since 1998. However, injuries to Deng and Eddy Curry contributed to a first-round exit against the Washington Wizards. Ben Gordon received the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award.\nDuring the 2005 offseason, Curry\u2019s heart condition raised concerns, leading to his trade to the New York Knicks in exchange for Michael Sweetney, Tim Thomas and future draft picks. The Bulls struggled without a significant post presence but managed a 12\u20132 late-season run, finishing 41\u201341. They qualified for the playoffs but were defeated by the Miami Heat, who went on to win the championship. Despite the loss, key players gained valuable postseason experience.\nIn the 2006 NBA Draft, the Bulls traded for Tyrus Thomas and Thabo Sefolosha and signed veteran defensive player Ben Wallace to a four-year deal. Tyson Chandler, the last player from the Krause era, was traded to the Hornets. Chicago recovered from a poor start to finish the season with a 49\u201333 record. In the playoffs, they swept the defending champion Miami Heat, marking their first series victory since 1998. Their postseason ended in the next round with a 4\u20132 loss to the Detroit Pistons.\nThe 2007 offseason brought speculation of major trades involving players like Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, and Kobe Bryant, but none materialized. The Bulls began the 2007\u201308 season poorly, leading to the dismissal of head coach Scott Skiles in December. Interim coach Jim Boylan was appointed but could not reverse the team\u2019s fortunes, and they ended the season with a 33\u201349 record. In a midseason trade, the team acquired Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, and others in exchange for Ben Wallace and Joe Smith. Following the season, Boylan was not retained, and the search for a new head coach culminated in the hiring of Vinny Del Negro, a rookie coach supported by experienced assistants Del Harris, Bernie Bickerstaff, and Bob Ociepka.\n2008\u20132016: Derrick Rose era.\n2008\u20132010: Appearance of Derrick Rose.\nWith only a slim 1.7% chance of winning the rights to draft first overall, the Bulls won the 2008 NBA draft lottery and selected first overall. With this, the Bulls became the team with the lowest chance of winning to ever win the lottery since it was modified for the 1994 NBA draft, and second-lowest ever. On June 26, 2008, the Bulls drafted Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis as the number 1 draft pick, and Sonny Weems at number 39. The Bulls later traded Weems to the Denver Nuggets for Denver's 2009 regular second-round draft pick. The Bulls also made several trades, including one that brought \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k to the team. The team re-signed Luol Deng to a six-year deal, although he was sidelined for much of the season due to injury.\nIn February 2009, the Bulls made multiple trades to strengthen the roster, including a deal with the Sacramento Kings for Brad Miller and John Salmons, and another with the Oklahoma City Thunder for a first-round pick. These moves helped the team secure a playoff spot, finishing the season at .500 with a 41\u201341 record. In the playoffs, they faced the Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series. In Game 1, Derrick Rose scored 36 points, along with 11 assists, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for most points scored by a rookie in a playoff debut. After breaking the record for most overtimes played in an NBA Playoffs Series, the Boston Celtics managed to overcome the Bulls after 7 games and 7 overtime periods played.\nIn the 2009 NBA Draft, the Bulls selected James Johnson and Taj Gibson. They also lost Ben Gordon to the Detroit Pistons in free agency. The following season, the team made further trades, including sending John Salmons to the Milwaukee Bucks and Tyrus Thomas to the Charlotte Bobcats. The Bulls finished with the eighth seed in the 2010 playoffs but were eliminated in five games by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In May 2010, the team fired head coach Vinny Del Negro.\n2010\u20132011: Arrival of Tom Thibodeau and Rose's MVP year.\nIn early June 2010, Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau accepted a three-year contract to fill the Bulls' head coaching vacancy. He was officially introduced on June 23. On July 7, it was revealed that Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz had verbally agreed to an $80\u00a0million, five-year contract. Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard Kirk Hinrich to the Washington Wizards to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed former 76er and Jazz sharpshooter Kyle Korver to a three-year, $15\u00a0million contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish All-Star \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k. After being matched by the Orlando Magic for J. J. Redick, they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard Ronnie Brewer, traded for former Warrior point guard C.J. Watson, and signed former Bucks power forward Kurt Thomas as well as former Spurs player Keith Bogans and former Celtic Brian Scalabrine.\nRose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since Michael Jordan to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season with a league-best 62\u201320 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks in five and six games, respectively, thereby reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and faced the Miami Heat. After winning the first game of the series, they lost the next four games, ending their season.\n2011\u20132014: Injury-plagued seasons for Derrick Rose.\nThe Chicago Bulls underwent significant roster changes and faced challenges between the 2011\u20132014 seasons, navigating injuries to star players while attempting to remain competitive. In the 2011 NBA draft, the Bulls selected Jimmy Butler with the 30th overall pick. During the offseason, they signed veteran guard Rip Hamilton to a three-year deal and extended Derrick Rose\u2019s contract for five years at $94.8 million. Rose and Luol Deng earned All-Star selections during the 2011\u201312 season, marking the first Bulls duo in the All-Star game since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Despite Rose missing much of the season due to injuries, the Bulls finished with the NBA's best record (50\u201316) and secured the Eastern Conference's top seed.\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Rose tore his ACL during Game 1 against the Philadelphia 76ers, sidelining him for the remainder of the series. Joakim Noah also sustained a foot injury during Game 3. The Bulls, weakened by these absences, lost the series in six games, becoming one of the few first-seeded teams eliminated by an eighth-seed. Subsequent roster changes saw the departures of key players, including Kyle Korver, C.J. Watson, and \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k, while the team added Marco Belinelli, Nate Robinson, and Nazr Mohammed.\nRose missed the entire 2012\u201313 season, yet the Bulls finished 45\u201337 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs after a seven-game victory over the Brooklyn Nets. They were eliminated by the Miami Heat in five games. During the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season.\nIn 2013\u201314, Rose sustained another significant injury, tearing his medial meniscus just 10 games into the season, sidelining him once again. The Bulls traded Luol Deng to the Cleveland Cavaliers midseason, receiving Andrew Bynum and draft picks in return, though Bynum was immediately waived. Despite finishing 48\u201334 and earning home-court advantage in the playoffs, the Bulls were eliminated in the first round by the Washington Wizards. Joakim Noah was a standout performer, earning Defensive Player of the Year honors, an All-NBA First Team selection, and placing fourth in MVP voting.\nDuring the 2014 offseason, the Bulls made notable moves in the draft and free agency. They traded two first-round picks to acquire Doug McDermott, added Cameron Bairstow in the second round, and signed veteran star Pau Gasol. The team also brought over Nikola Miroti\u0107, a EuroLeague talent acquired via a 2011 draft-day trade, and re-signed Kirk Hinrich to bolster the roster.\n2014\u20132015: Return of Derrick Rose to health and rise of Jimmy Butler.\nThe 2014\u201315 season brought renewed optimism to the Chicago Bulls with the return of Derrick Rose, alongside the addition of two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol. The team, bolstered by a deep roster featuring Taj Gibson, Nikola Miroti\u0107, Tony Snell, Aaron Brooks, Doug McDermott and Kirk Hinrich was considered one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference, alongside the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls started the season strong, winning seven of their first nine games, although they took notable losses to the Cavaliers and Celtics.\nJimmy Butler's rise as a primary scorer, going from 13 to 20 points per game, was a standout story, positioning him as a candidate for the \"Most Improved Player of the Year\" award. Gasol's consistent double-double performances added significant value, and both Butler and Gasol were selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. Despite this, the Bulls struggled with consistency in the second half of the season, with Rose publicly expressing frustration over the team's lack of cohesion. Tensions between head coach Tom Thibodeau and the front office, led by Gar Forman and John Paxson, also created internal instability.\nThe Bulls finished the regular season with a 50\u201332 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks, quickly establishing a 3\u20130 lead in the series before allowing the Bucks to win two games in a row. However, the Bulls dominated in Game 6, winning by a playoff-record 54 points to advance 4\u20132. The next round saw a matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James. The Bulls initially shocked the Cavs in Game 1, but Cleveland responded strongly, winning in Game 2. Despite a dramatic Game 3 win by Derrick Rose on a last-second three-pointer, the Bulls were ultimately defeated 4\u20132, ending their playoff run. Following the series, speculation about Thibodeau's future with the team intensified due to the ongoing tensions with the front office.\n2015\u20132017: Departures of Tom Thibodeau and Derrick Rose.\nOn May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a \"change in approach\". The following month, Fred Hoiberg was named as the new head coach. The Bulls had only one draft pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, selecting center Bobby Portis from the University of Arkansas.\nWith forward Mike Dunleavy Jr. sidelined for the first four months of the season due to back surgery, the Bulls promoted Doug McDermott to the starting small forward position. Hoiberg told the media that the move was suggested by Noah himself, but Noah denied having made any suggestions to Hoiberg, which sparked a distrust between the two before the season even began. The Bulls started the 2015\u201316 season strong with a season-opening victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and posted an 8\u20133 record early on; however, they struggled through the middle of the season, eventually losing 12 of their next 17 games. Jimmy Butler was sidelined for four weeks due to a knee injury, and despite finishing with a 42\u201340 record, the Bulls were eliminated from playoff contention, marking the first time in eight years the team had missed the postseason.\nIn the 2016 offseason, the Bulls underwent significant roster changes. On June 22, 2016, they traded Derrick Rose, Justin Holiday, and a 2017 second-round pick to the New York Knicks in exchange for center Robin Lopez, and point guards Jerian Grant and Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n, the latter of whom was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. In July, the Bulls signed veteran guard Rajon Rondo and Chicago native Dwyane Wade, bolstering their lineup. Additionally, they acquired 2014 Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams in a trade with the Milwaukee Bucks.\nThe team made further moves in February 2017, trading Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott, and a second-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder for point guard Cameron Payne, shooting guard Anthony Morrow, and power forward/center Joffrey Lauvergne. Despite these changes, Jimmy Butler had a standout season, setting several career highs, earning All-Star honors, and being named to the All-NBA third team. The Bulls finished the regular season with a 41\u201341 record and clinched the eighth seed in the 2017 NBA playoffs. They took a surprising 2\u20130 series lead over the top-seeded Boston Celtics but ultimately lost the series 4\u20132.\n2017\u20132025: Lavine era.\n2017\u20132020: Final years of GarPax and rebuilding.\nIn June 2017, the Chicago Bulls traded Jimmy Butler and their 2017 first-round pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, and a pick used to select Lauri Markkanen. They also waived Rajon Rondo and Isaiah Canaan, and allowed Michael Carter-Williams to enter free agency. Justin Holiday rejoined the Bulls on a two-year, $9 million contract, while Dwyane Wade reached a buyout agreement, returning $8 million of his $23.2 million contract.\nOn October 17, 2017, a fight broke out between Bobby Portis and Nikola Miroti\u0107 during practice. Portis punched Miroti\u0107 in the face, causing a concussion and facial fractures. Portis was suspended eight games, and Miroti\u0107 missed 23 games. The incident led to Miroti\u0107 being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in February 2018 for a first-round draft pick and \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k, Tony Allen, and Jameer Nelson. The Bulls finished the 2017-18 season with a 27\u201355 record.\nIn 2018, the Bulls drafted Wendell Carter Jr. and Chandler Hutchison, and re-signed Zach LaVine to a four-year, $78 million deal. They also signed Jabari Parker to a two-year, $40 million contract. After a poor start to the 2018-19 season, Fred Hoiberg was fired and replaced by Jim Boylen. In February 2019, Bobby Portis, Jabari Parker, and a second-round pick were traded for Otto Porter. The Bulls ended the season with a 22-60 record, missing the playoffs.\nIn 2019, the Bulls selected Coby White and signed veterans Tom\u00e1\u0161 Satoransk\u00fd and Thaddeus Young. After the COVID-19 disruption, Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas became the Bulls' executive vice president, and Marc Eversley was hired as general manager. Jim Boylen was fired, and Billy Donovan became head coach in 2020. The Bulls drafted Patrick Williams with the fourth overall pick.\nIn March 2021, the Bulls traded for Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107 and Al-Farouq Aminu, sending Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter and draft picks to Orlando. Despite these moves, the Bulls finished the 2020-21 season with a 31-41 record, missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year.\n2021\u20132024: DeRozan-Lavine duo.\nIn the 2021 offseason, the Chicago Bulls made several notable moves aimed at improving their roster. They selected Ayo Dosunmu with the 38th pick in the second round of the NBA Draft, traded for Lonzo Ball from the New Orleans Pelicans, and signed free agent Alex Caruso. The Bulls also received DeMar DeRozan from the San Antonio Spurs, giving up Thaddeus Young, Al-Farouq Aminu, and draft picks.\nThe Bulls's new look lineup initially performed quite well, making it to the top seed in the Eastern Conference in January 2022. DeRozan\u2019s performance in this period, including back-to-back buzzer-beater three-pointers against the Indiana Pacers and Washington Wizards, briefly captured the spotlight. After Lonzo Ball was sidelined with a knee injury requiring a meniscus replacement, the team struggled to maintain consistency. DeRozan earned an All-Star selection and LaVine joined him as a reserve, but the team quickly fell in the rankings. They finished the season in sixth place in the Eastern Conference and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.\nIn the 2022 offseason, the Bulls re-signed LaVine to a five-year, $215.2 million contract (the largest in franchise history) and selected Dalen Terry in the draft. They also signed Patrick Beverley mid-season in an attempt to reignite their playoff hopes. However, despite some individual success, the team\u2019s lack of consistency persisted. The Bulls finished 40\u201342 in the 2022\u201323 season and earned a spot in the play-in tournament, beating the Toronto Raptors in a bittersweet win for Derozan, before they were again eliminated by the Miami Heat.\nThe 2023 offseason saw the Bulls trade for the 35th pick in the draft and select Julian Philips, while also re-signing Vucevic and Coby White. The Bulls finished with a 39\u201343 record, once again securing a play-in spot. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks, they were eliminated by the Miami Heat in the second game, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.\n2024\u2013present.\nDeMar DeRozan signed with the Sacramento Kings as part of a three-team sign-and-trade deal. The team also traded Alex Caruso to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Josh Giddey. Andre Drummond signed with the Sixers. In the draft, Matas Buzelis was taken by the Bulls 11th overall. After two missed seasons, Lonzo Ball made his return to the court. On February 2, 2025, the team traded Zach LaVine to the Sacramento Kings for Zach Collins, Tre Jones, Kevin Huerter and their own 2025 first round pick from San Antonio Spurs.\nThe Bulls finished the season with 39-43 recorded, placing them 9th in the Eastern Conference. This earned them spot in the play-in tournament where they would go on to lose to the Miami Heat for the third consecutive year, missing the playoffs once again.\nRivalries.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nThe Bulls\u2013Cavaliers rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Chicago Bulls. The teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, but the rivalry didn't begin in earnest until the Bulls drafted Michael Jordan with the third overall pick in 1984. After Jordan went on to the Washington Wizards and eventually retired, the rivalry died down, but when Cleveland picked LeBron James with the first selection in 2003, the rivalry heated up again. However, the Cavaliers had an edge over the Bulls, who would pick Derrick Rose with the first selection in 2008 to turn Chicago from a lottery team to a future contender.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe Bulls' main division rivals have been the Detroit Pistons ever since the Jordan-led Bulls met the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals. The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991. The Eastern Conference Finals in 1991 ended with a four-game sweep of the Pistons, who walked off the floor with time still on the game clock. The rivalry was renewed in the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which former Detroit cornerstone Ben Wallace met his former team (the Pistons won in 6 games). The geographic proximity and membership in the Central Division further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans' rivalry with Detroit extends past the NBA, as the two cities shared divisions in all four major North American sports until 2013 when the Detroit Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.\nMiami Heat.\nThe Bulls and the Miami Heat rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry was revived due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs after the departure of Jordan from the Bulls and the emergence of Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. The revived rivalry was physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player James Posey. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4\u20131. In 2023, the two would meet in the Eastern Conference play-in, with the Heat winning to advance to the playoffs. Notably the game featured former Bull, Jimmy Butler on the Heat and former teammates DeMar DeRozan (Chicago) versus Kyle Lowry (Miami). The Bulls and the Heat would go on to meet in the Eastern Conference play-ins in both of the next two years, with the Heat eliminating the Bulls from playoff contention in both of those games.\nNew York Knicks.\nAnother franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the New York Knicks. The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991\u20131994) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called \"teams on the rise\" under Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, respectively (rivalry that started their freshman year in the 1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago with six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls won in the first three years (1991\u20131993) before losing in 1994 but got revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans.\nTraditions.\nStarting lineup introductions.\nDuring the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer Tommy Edwards was the first to use \"Sirius\", \"On The Run\" and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by Ray Clay in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, The Alan Parsons Project's \"Sirius\", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by \"The Imperial March\" from \"Star Wars\" composed by John Williams or \"On the Run\" by Pink Floyd, or \"Tick of the Clock\" by Chromatics. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the 3D-animated 'Running of the Bulls' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, Alan Parsons wrote \"Sirius\" for his own band and was the sound engineer for \"On the Run\" from Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\".\nTraditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. During the championship era, Scottie Pippen was usually the first (or second after Horace Grant) Bulls player introduced, and Michael Jordan the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with Derrick Rose's arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of Tommy Edwards as the announcer.\nAs part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by Lily and Lana Wachowski, Ethan Stoller and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme. Edwards was replaced in 2020 by Tim Sinclair.\nBlack shoes and socks.\nThe Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to 1989 when they debuted the tradition. Then-Bulls backup center Brad Sellers suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the team. For the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the University of Michigan and the Fab Five which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since then, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs. It was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004\u201305 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.\nEven though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the 1995 playoffs against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his Air Jordan XI shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the 2009 playoffs, the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics. More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.\nCircus trip.\nThe Bulls and their arena mates, the Chicago Blackhawks, shared an odd tradition dating to the opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, Feld Entertainment's now-defunct Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted about two weeks. Initially local newspapers and television and radio sportscasters, and later national programs like \"SportsCenter\", referred to this fortnight-long local hiatus as \"the circus trip\". Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, who co-owned the United Center with Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, let the contract lapse after the circus' 2016 run, and condensed the formerly two-week local run of Feld's Disney on Ice to a week-long period effective February 2018. The circus itself would be discontinued in 2017.\nName, logo, and uniforms.\nName.\nDick Klein wanted a name that evoked Chicago's traditional meat packing industry (similarly to the forerunner Packers franchise) and the Chicago Stadium's proximity to the Union Stock Yards. Klein considered names like Matadors or Toreadors, but dismissed them, saying, \"If you think about it, no team with as many as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the Montreal Canadiens.\" After discussing possible names with his family, Klein settled on \"Bulls\" when his son Mark said, \"Dad, that's a bunch of bull!\"\nLogo.\nThe Bulls are unique in the fact they have used the same logo with very little change since the team's inception. The iconic logo is a red, charging bull's face. The logo was designed by noted American graphic designer Dean P. Wessel and was adopted in 1966. At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 1970s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says \"Windy City\" below the bull's nose.\nUniforms.\n1966\u20131973 uniforms.\nThe Bulls wear three different uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, and a black alternate uniform. The original uniforms were esthetically close to the current design, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows, red or white side stripes with black borders, and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969\u201370 season, the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name.\n1973\u20131985 uniforms.\nFor the 1973\u201374 season, the Bulls drastically changed their look, removing the side stripes and drop shadows while moving the front numbers to the left chest. While the white uniforms saw the \"Bulls\" wordmark go from a vertically arched to radially arched arrangement, the red uniforms saw a more significant makeover, featuring black lettering and a script \"Chicago\" wordmark. With a few tweaks in the lettering, these uniforms were used until 1985.\nThis uniform set was later revived as a throwback uniform during the 2003\u201304 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\n1985\u2013present uniforms.\nStarting with the 1985\u201386 season, the Bulls updated their uniform. Among the more notable changes in the look were centered uniform numbers and a vertically arched \"Bulls\" wordmark in both the red and white uniforms. Like the previous set, this uniform saw a few tweaks particularly in the treatment of the player's name.\nWhen Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, the Bulls kept much of the same look save for the truncated shoulder striping and the addition of the Chicago four stars on the waistline. With Nike and the NBA eliminating designations on home and away uniforms, the Bulls also announced that their red \"Icon\" uniforms would become their home uniforms, and the white \"Association\" uniforms would become their away uniforms. The Bulls would continue to wear red \"Icon\" uniforms in home games until the 2020\u201321 season, after which they returned to wearing the white \"Association\" uniforms in home games starting in the 2021\u201322 season.\nAlternate black uniforms.\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls added a black uniform to their set. The initial look featured red pinstripes and lacked the classic diamond on the shorts. This set was revived as throwback uniforms in the 2012\u201313 seasons.\nFrom the 1997\u201398 to the 2005\u201306 seasons, the Bulls wore slightly modified black uniforms without pinstripes. This set, with a few slight changes in the template, also marked the return of the city name in front of the uniform during the 1999\u20132000 season.\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw another change in the Bulls' black alternate uniform, now resembling the red and white uniform with the addition of a red diamond in the shorts. For the 2014\u201315 season, the uniforms were tweaked a bit to include sleeves and a modernized diamond treatment in black with red and white borders.\nSince the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls' black uniforms remained mostly untouched for the aforementioned switch to the new Nike logo that affected the treatment towards the shoulder piping. Nike also dubbed this uniform as the \"Statement\" uniform in reference to its third jerseys. The Bulls began wearing the Statement uniforms after Thanksgiving and they are currently used in away games against teams that wear their white, gray/silver or cream uniforms.\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the return of pinstripes to the Bulls' \"Statement\" uniform, albeit in dark gray. In addition, the diamond treatment returned to red, piping was tweaked, and four six-point stars were featured on the beltline. The Bulls wore this \"Statement\" uniform in select home games and away games against teams wearing white, cream, yellow, red or silver uniforms.\nAhead of the 2025\u201326 season, the Bulls' black \"Statement\" uniform was tweaked to feature red pinstripes and modified striping.\nOther uniforms.\nThe Chicago Bulls have worn various special edition uniforms throughout the years to celebrate different events and milestones.\nNike City uniforms.\nThe Bulls' \"City\" uniforms, introduced by Nike in 2017, pay homage to Chicago\u2019s flag, architecture, and cultural symbols. These uniforms have evolved each season:\nMascots.\nBenny the Bull is the main mascot of the Chicago Bulls. He was first introduced in 1969. Benny is a red bull who wears number 1. Benny is one of the oldest and best-known mascots in all of professional sports. The Bulls also had another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the team website as being the high-flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession and selling marijuana from his car. Da Bull was retired soon after the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had a meaner facial expression and wore number 95.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Bulls. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Chicago Bulls seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nTraining facilities.\nAlumni Hall on DePaul University's Lincoln Park campus was the practice facility for the Bulls in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIn 1992, the team began training at the Berto Center, located in Deerfield, Illinois.\nOn June 13, 2012, the team announced that it would move its practice facility to a downtown location closer to the United Center to reduce game day commutes. On September 12, 2014, the Bulls officially opened their new training facility, the Advocate Center (named after the Advocate Medical Group, one of the medicine-practicing firms that serves Chicago), a block east of the United Center.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Bulls hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with the team. \"Italics\" denotes still active, but not with the team.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHall of Famers, retired, and honored numbers.\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nChicago Bulls Ring of Honor.\nOn January 12, 2024, the Bulls introduced the Ring of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel. On September 12, 2025, the Bulls announced 6 more members to the Ring of Honor - Johnny Bach, Cartwright, Neil Funk, Grant, Paxson and Van Lier.\nThe inaugural class of Ring of Honor inductees included all personnel (players, coaches, executives, etc.) who have had their number retired or were honored with similar banners in the rafters, as well as a number of other contributors to the team over the years, such as original owner Dick Klein and assistant coach Tex Winter. Plans were made to induct a class every two years for people with at least three seasons with the Bulls and being retired from basketball for at least three years.\nMedia.\nRadio.\nThe team's games are broadcast on Entercom's WSCR (670) as of February 3, 2018. From October 2015-January 2018, games were carried on Cumulus Media's WLS (890) in a deal that was expected to last until the 2020\u201321 season, but was nullified in the middle of the 2017\u201318 season after Cumulus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and nullified several large play-by-play and talent contracts.\nChuck Swirsky does play-by-play, with Bill Wennington providing color commentary. Univision Radio's WRTO (1200) has carried Spanish language game coverage since 2009\u201310, with Omar Ramos as play-by-play announcer and Matt Moreno as color analyst.\nTelevision.\nThe Bulls' television broadcasts are televised by Chicago Sports Network, which broadcasts all of the games that are not televised nationally as of the 2024\u20132025 season. For many years, broadcasts were split between NBC Sports Chicago (and prior to that, FSN Chicago), WGN-TV, and WCIU-TV. The announcers are Adam Amin and Stacey King. Jason Benetti fills in for Amin whenever the latter is assigned to work for Fox Sports.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Bulls (along with the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Blackhawks) agreed to an exclusive multi-year deal with NBC Sports Chicago, ending the team's broadcasts on WGN-TV following the 2018\u201319 season. The Bulls left NBC Sports Chicago at the end of the 2023\u20132024 season, moving to the new Chicago Sports Network in 2024.\nIn 2020, the Chicago Bulls received significant media coverage following the release of The Last Dance, a critically acclaimed ESPN and Netflix documentary miniseries that chronicled Michael Jordan's career with the Bulls, with a particular focus on the team's 1997\u201398 championship season. The series reignited widespread interest in the Bulls' dominant run during the 1990s, leading to increased discussions across sports media and a surge in viewership for Bulls-related broadcasts.\nSome games are televised nationally on ABC, NBC, and ESPN, or streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock. All non nationally televised games are on NBA League Pass\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72868", "revid": "50310840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72868", "title": "Cleveland Cavaliers", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers, often referred to as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Arena in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66\u2013180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 seasons.\nGeorge and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender \u2013 led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty \u2013 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997\u201398 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010\u201311 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the third-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times \u2013 first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014.\nAfter four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing 3\u20131. The Cavaliers have 25 playoff appearances and have won eight Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title.\nHistory.\nThe Cavaliers began play in the 1970\u201371 season as an expansion team. They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976. The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch. It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4\u20133, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. They won Game 7, 87\u201385, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go. The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time, but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener. As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4\u20132, to the Boston Celtics. They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.\nThe early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players. His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980. As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons. The Cavaliers went 66\u2013180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner. The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981\u201382 season. The team finished 15\u201367, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak. George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.\nThe Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998. The 1988\u201389 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57\u201325 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens. They had their second 57-win season in 1991\u201392 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year. However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance. The Cavaliers finished the 2002\u201303 season 17\u201365, tied for the worst record in the NBA.\nThe Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron. On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million, and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005. That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry. The Cavaliers built a team around James and \u017dydr\u016bnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao. Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time. The 2006\u201307 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. The 2008\u201309 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39\u20132 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic. Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal, the 2009\u201310 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.\nWith the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled \"The Decision\" that he would be signing with the Miami Heat. The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. After a 19\u2013win season in 2010\u201311, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.\nIn 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224\u201388 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97\u2013215 and missed the playoffs each season. The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving. The LeBron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 \u2013 all against the Golden State Warriors \u2013 winning in 2016. The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the Finals. It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.\nThe Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017\u201318 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets. Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others. The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers. In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.\nIn the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and by this time, J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted to head coach for the 2020\u201321 season after he had been an assistant on Belien's staff the previous season.\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, the Cavs finished 44\u201338 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017\u201318 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997\u201398. The team, however, did not make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the game to the Brooklyn Nets and then to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108\u201391 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James. They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.\nOn October 25, 2023, it was announced that defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett would serve as an ambassador for the team.\nThe Cavaliers qualified the 2024 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, defeating the Orlando Magic 4\u20133 in the first round, but losing to the Boston Celtics 4\u20131 in the Conference semifinals.\nOn November 6th, 2024 the Cavaliers beat their all-time franchise \"season start\" win-streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 for a season record of 9-0. \nAfter a 128-114 win against the Charlotte Hornets on November 17, 2024, the Cavaliers achieved a 15-0 start, which is tied for the second-best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are the fourth team to achieve this milestone, after the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors team, the 1993-1994 Houston Rockets team, and the 1948-1949 Washington Capitols team. The 15-0 start is also the Cavaliers\u2019 longest winning streak in franchise history. \nOn November 19, 2024, the Boston Celtics ended the Cavaliers 15\u20130 start and 15 game winning streak when they won 120\u2013117, giving the Cavaliers their first loss of the season.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Cavaliers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Cleveland Cavaliers seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nLogos and uniforms.\nOriginal wine and mustard/metallic gold.\nWhen the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jersey colors were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys.\nThe original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004\u201305 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008\u201309 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015\u201316 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration.\nBlue and orange.\nIn the 1983\u201384 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987\u201388 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989\u201390 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006\u201307 and 2016\u201317 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986\u201387 team. The blue versions were worn in the 2009\u201310 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988\u201389 team.\nBlue, black and orange.\nCoinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994\u201395 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping.\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002\u201303 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below.\nThe 1994\u20131996 black uniforms were revived for the 2019\u201320 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Arena).\nWine, metallic gold and navy.\nThe Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003\u201304 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The navy alternates were first worn in the 2005\u201306 season and for a majority of its existence, the Cavaliers primarily wore them during road playoff games. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it.\nThe navy blue alternate from 2005\u20132010 was brought back as its \"Classic\" uniform in the 2025\u201326 season, paying tribute to the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance in the 2006\u201307 season.\nWine, mustard gold and navy.\nThe Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010\u201311 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983. The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey \u2013 gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms \u2013 was added for the 2012\u201313 season. All uniforms have the team motto \u2013 \"All for one. One for all.\" \u2013 stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme.\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, a second alternate jersey \u2013 and fourth uniform overall \u2013 was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987\u20131994 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.\nWine, mustard gold, navy and black.\nTwo alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015\u201316 season. The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. Their logos for the 2017\u201318 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.\nBeginning in the 2017\u201318 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.\nNike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017\u201318 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.\nWine, metallic gold and black.\nFor the 2022\u201323 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983\u20131994 and 1994\u20132003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.\nWith the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms.\nThe white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts.\nThe wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts.\nThe black Statement uniform \u2013 a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run \u2013 displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.\nCavFanatic uniforms.\nFrom the 2008\u201309 to the 2011\u201312 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms \u2013 combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another \u2013 on select \"CavFanatic Nights\".\n\"City Edition\" uniforms.\nNike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio:\nCleveland Clinic Courts.\nCleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Arena. In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player \u2013 either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him \u2013 is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nCavs Legends.\nThe following is a list of past Cavaliers players and other personnel who have been honored as \"Cavs Legends\" \u2013 either by retiring their number or having commemorative banners placed in the rafters at Rocket Arena.\nWall of Honor.\nIn 2019, the Cavaliers introduced the Wall of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel, and is located in the newly added North Atrium of the renovated Rocket Arena.\nNote - All personnel who have had their numbers retired or have a similar banner in the rafters are also inducted into the Wall of Honor\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nThe following is a list of players and other personnel who have spent at least part of their careers with the Cavaliers that have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nIndividual records and accomplishments.\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with team. \"Italic\" denotes still active but not with team.\nPoints scored (regular season \u2013 as of the 2024\u201325 NBA season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of the 2024\u201325 NBA season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNBA All-Star Weekend.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedia.\nRadio\nWTAM (1100 AM/106.9 FM) and WMMS (100.7 FM) currently serve as the flagship stations for the Cavaliers AudioVerse.

It is situated on the Rhine-Marne canal at the foot of a pass over the Vosges Mountains, and 45\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi) northwest of Strasbourg.\nIn 2018, the commune of Saverne had a population of 11,289, and its urban area, of 18,740.\nGeography.\nSaverne lies on the river Zorn, at the foot of the Vosges Mountains. It is crossed by the Marne\u2013Rhine Canal and the Paris\u2013Strasbourg railway. The A4 autoroute (Paris\u2013Strasbourg) passes a few kilometers north of the town. Saverne station has rail connections to Paris, Strasbourg, Metz, Nancy and several regional destinations.\nHistory.\nSaverne (: Caesar's three taverns, so called because in the older days there were three inns on the way to the Lorraine plateau where they would change oxen due to the steep incline) was an important place in the time of the Roman Empire, and, after being destroyed by the Alemanni, was rebuilt by the emperor Julian.\nWith the settlement of the Alemanni, the town became part of the Germanosphere. After 870 AD the town belonged to East Francia, which turned into the Holy Roman Empire. During the German Peasants' War the town was occupied, in 1525, by the insurgents, who were driven out in their turn by Duke Anton of Lorraine. It suffered much from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War, but the episcopal palace, then destroyed, was subsequently rebuilt.\nAfter 1680 the town was annexed by the French. The episcopal palace was in 1852 converted by Louis Napoleon into a place of residence for widows of knights of the Legion of Honour.\nSaverne was conquered by Imperial Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. It was returned to French control after World War I.\nIn 1913, the city was the theater of the infamous \"Saverne Affair\". This event gave rise to the term \"Zabernism\" (from the German name of the town), meaning abuse of military authority, or unwarranted aggression.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSights.\nThe emblem of the town is a unicorn. Legend has it that a unicorn's horn was found in one of the nearby castles in ruins. It is more likely that a narwhal's tooth was discovered and mistaken for a unicorn's horn.\nHowever, it gave its name to the local beer (fr: \"Bi\u00e8re de la Licorne\") and to the Karlsbr\u00e4u brewery (f: \"Brasserie la Licorne\") making it.\nIts principal building, the Rohan Castle (\"Ch\u00e2teau des Rohan\"), is the former residence of the bishops of Strasbourg, rebuilt by Cardinal de Rohan in 1779, it was used by the Germans as barracks. It now houses the city museum with its large archeological collection of Roman and Celtic artifacts, a hostel, a small arts and crafts museum as well as the collection of 20th century and ethnological art donated by feminist journalist and politician Louise Weiss.\nOther sights include the 15th century former castle (\"Ch\u00e2teau vieux\") and the adjacent 15th century Roman Catholic parish church of Notre-Dame-de-la-Nativit\u00e9 with fine stained glass and sculptures; a Gothic former Franciscan, then R\u00e9collets, monastery with a church and a cloister ornated by 17th-century frescoes; as well as several old houses, among which the heavily decorated \"Maison Katz\" stands out.\nIn the vicinity are the ruined castles of Haut-Barr, Grand Geroldseck, Ochsenstein and Greifenstein. Hence a road, immortalized by Goethe in \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\", leads across the Vosges to Pfalzburg. The mountain pass (Col de Saverne) contains a vast botanical garden, the Jardin botanique du col de Saverne.\nSaverne is also known for its Rose Garden, locally known as \"La roseraie\". It is also the host of the International Contest of New Roses every year. The Garden itself blesses visitors with over 550 varieties of roses.http://\nAn old semaphore tower, from the former Landau (and later Strasbourg) to Paris semaphore line, can be seen in the vicinity. It was one of the 50 stations built by the first French Empire on this line which was the second of this kind in France.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72871", "revid": "37576545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72871", "title": "Detroit Pistons", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Detroit, Michigan\nThe Detroit Pistons are an American professional basketball team based in Detroit. The Pistons compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Little Caesars Arena, located in Midtown Detroit.\nThe team was founded as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a semi-professional company basketball team based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1937. The club would turn professional in 1941 as a member of the National Basketball League (NBL), where they won two NBL championships (1944 and 1945). The Pistons later joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1948. The NBL and BAA merged to become the NBA in 1949, and the Pistons became part of the merged league. In 1957, the franchise moved to Detroit. The Pistons have won three NBA championships: in 1989, 1990 and 2004.\nHistory.\n1937\u20131957: Fort Wayne (Zollner) Pistons.\nFred Zollner owned the Zollner Corporation, a foundry that manufactured pistons, primarily for car, truck, and locomotive engines in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In 1937, Zollner sponsored a semi-professional company basketball team called the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons after he received a request from his workers. In addition to the basketball works team, Zollner also hosted a championship 12 inch, fast-pitch softball team, with players from both the softball and basketball teams being employed in the Zollner Corporation. In 1941, the Zollner Pistons shed their works team roots and joined the National Basketball League (NBL). The Zollner Pistons were NBL champions in 1944 and 1945. They also won the World Professional Basketball Tournament in 1944, 1945 and 1946.\nIn 1948, the team became the Fort Wayne Pistons and jumped to the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1949, Fred Zollner brokered the formation of the National Basketball Association from the BAA and the NBL at his kitchen table.\nThere are suggestions that Pistons players conspired with gamblers to shave points and throw various games during the 1953\u201354 and 1954\u201355 seasons. In particular, there are accusations that the team may have intentionally lost the 1955 NBA Finals to the Syracuse Nationals. In the decisive Game 7, the Pistons led 41\u201324 early in the second quarter before the Nationals rallied to win the game. The Nationals won on a free throw by George King with 12 seconds left in the game. The closing moments included a palming turnover by the Pistons' George Yardley with 18 seconds left, a foul by Frank Brian with 12 seconds left that enabled King's winning free throw, and a turnover by the Pistons' Andy Phillip in the final seconds which cost them a chance to attempt the game winning shot. In the following season, the Pistons made it back to the NBA Finals. However, they were defeated by the Philadelphia Warriors in five games.\n1957\u20131981: Move to Detroit; decades of struggles.\nThough the Pistons enjoyed a solid local following, Fort Wayne's small size made it difficult for them to be profitable, especially as other early NBA teams based in smaller cities started folding or relocating to larger markets. After the 1956\u201357 season, Fred Zollner decided that Fort Wayne was too small to support an NBA team and announced the team would be playing elsewhere in the coming season. He ultimately settled on Detroit. Although it was the fifth largest city in the United States at the time, Detroit had not seen professional basketball in a decade. They lost the Detroit Eagles due to World War II, both the Detroit Gems of the NBL (who became the Minneapolis Lakers) and the Detroit Falcons of the BAA in 1947, and the Detroit Vagabond Kings in 1949. Zollner decided to keep the Pistons name, believing it made sense given Detroit's status as the center of the automobile industry. George Yardley set the NBA single-season scoring record in the Pistons' first season in Detroit, becoming the first player to score 2,000 points in a season.\nThe Pistons played in Olympia Stadium (home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the time) for their first four seasons, then moved to Cobo Arena beginning in the 1961\u201362 season.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the Pistons were characterized by talented players including George Yardley, Bailey Howell, Dave Debusschere, Dave Bing, and Bob Lanier, questionable trades, and frequent coaching changes. At one point, DeBusschere was the youngest player-coach in the history of the NBA. Then a trade during the 1968\u201369 season sent DeBusschere to the New York Knicks for Howard Komives and Walt Bellamy, both of whom had their best seasons behind them. DeBusschere became a key player in leading the Knicks to two NBA titles. Howell had previously been dealt to the Baltimore Bullets in 1964 and former Pistons guard Gene Shue, who was the head coach of the Bullets at the time, assessed the Pistons thusly: \"Detroit has the worst management in the league.\" Howell would go to win two championships as a member of the Boston Celtics. Yardley, Lanier, and Bing all ended their Pistons tenure being traded away, frustrated with the direction and opportunities with Detroit.\nIn 1974, Zollner sold the team to glass magnate Bill Davidson, who remained the team's principal owner until his death in 2009.\nThe team had a winning season in 1971, having spent the 1960s below .500, and then had a brief period of sustained success in the mid-1970s, qualifying for the playoffs in four straight seasons (1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977). Hope was then placed in Dick Vitale in 1978, the former head coach at the University of Detroit, but he was fired the following season, and the team limped into the 1980s with a 16\u201366 record in 1979\u201380. The 1979\u201380 team lost its last 14 games of the season which, when coupled with the seven losses at the start of the 1980\u201381 season, constituted a then-NBA record losing streak of 21 games.\nOver time, Davidson became displeased with Cobo Arena, but opted not to follow the Red Wings to the under-construction Joe Louis Arena next door. Instead, in 1978, he moved the team to the suburb of Pontiac, where they played in the 82,000 capacity Silverdome, a structure built for professional football (and the home of the Detroit Lions at the time).\n1981\u20131994: The Isiah Thomas era.\nThe franchise's fortunes finally began to turn in 1981, when they drafted point guard Isiah Thomas from Indiana University. In November 1981, the Pistons acquired Vinnie Johnson in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics. They later acquired center Bill Laimbeer in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers in February 1982. Another key move by the Pistons was the hiring of head coach Chuck Daly in 1983.\nInitially, the Pistons had difficulty moving up the NBA ladder. In 1984, the Pistons lost a tough five-game series to the underdog New York Knicks, 3\u20132. In the 1985 playoffs, Detroit won its first-round series and faced the defending champion Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals. Though Boston prevailed in six games, Detroit's surprise performance promised that a rivalry had begun. In the 1985 NBA draft, the team selected Joe Dumars 18th overall, a selection that proved to be very wise. They also acquired Rick Mahorn in a trade with the Washington Bullets. However, the team took a step backwards, losing in the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the more athletic Atlanta Hawks. After the series, changes were made in order to make the team more defensive-minded.\n1986\u20131992: The Bad Boys.\nPrior to the 1986\u201387 season, the Pistons acquired more key players: John Salley (drafted 11th overall), Dennis Rodman (drafted 27th) and Adrian Dantley (acquired in a trade with the Utah Jazz). The team adopted a physical, defense-oriented style of play, which eventually earned them the nickname \"Bad Boys\".\nIn 1987, the team reached the Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics. After pushing the defending champions to a 2\u20132 tie, the Pistons were on the verge of winning Game 5 at the Boston Garden with seconds remaining. After a Celtics turnover, Isiah Thomas attempted to quickly inbound the ball and missed Chuck Daly's timeout signal from the bench. Larry Bird stole the inbound pass and passed it to Dennis Johnson for the game-winning layup. While the Pistons did win Game 6 in Detroit, they lost the series in a tough Game 7 back in Boston.\nMotivated by their loss to the Celtics, the Pistons, aided by midseason acquisition James Edwards, improved to a then-franchise-record 54 victories and the franchise's first division title in 32 years. In the postseason, the Pistons avenged their two previous playoff losses to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating them in six games and advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since the franchise moved to Detroit.\nThe Pistons' first trip to the Finals in 32 years saw them face the Los Angeles Lakers, who were led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. After taking a 3\u20132 series lead back to Los Angeles, Detroit appeared poised to win their first NBA title in Game 6. In that game, Isiah Thomas scored an NBA Finals record 25 points in the third quarter while playing on a severely sprained ankle. However, the Lakers won the game, 103\u2013102, on a pair of last-second free throws by Abdul-Jabbar following a controversial foul called on Bill Laimbeer, referred to by many as a \"phantom foul\". With Thomas unable to compete at full strength, the Pistons narrowly fell in Game 7, 108\u2013105, as the Lakers became the first back-to-back NBA Champions since the 1969 Boston Celtics.\nPrior to the 1988\u201389 season, the Pistons moved to Auburn Hills to play at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the first NBA arena financed entirely with private funds. The 1989 Pistons completed the building of their roster by trading Adrian Dantley for Mark Aguirre, a trade that Pistons fans criticized heavily initially, but later praised. The team won 63 games, shattering their one-year-old franchise record, and steamrolled through the playoffs and into an NBA Finals rematch with the Lakers. This time, the Pistons came out victorious in a four-game sweep to win their first NBA championship. Joe Dumars was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe Pistons successfully defended their title in 1990, despite losing Rick Mahorn to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the expansion draft. After winning 59 games and a third straight division title, the Pistons cruised through the first two rounds of the playoffs before playing a tough Eastern Conference Finals series against Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and the Chicago Bulls. Facing each other for the third straight season, the Pistons and Bulls split the first six games before the Pistons finished the series with a decisive 93\u201374 victory in Game 7. Advancing to their third consecutive NBA Finals, the Pistons faced the Portland Trail Blazers. After splitting the first two games at The Palace, the Pistons went to Portland, where they had not won a game since 1974, to play Games 3, 4 and 5. The Pistons won all three games in Portland, becoming the first NBA team to sweep the middle three games on the road. The decisive game came down to the final second. Trailing 90\u201383 with two minutes remaining, the Pistons rallied to tie the game, then took a 92\u201390 lead when Vinnie Johnson sank a 15-foot jumper with 00.7 seconds left in the game; this shot earned Johnson a new nickname in Detroit, \"007\", to go with his original, \"The Microwave\". Isiah Thomas was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe Pistons' championship run came to an end in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, as they were swept by the eventual NBA champion Chicago Bulls in four games. The most critical injury during this time belonged to Isiah Thomas, who had suffered a wrist injury a few months prior to the NBA playoffs. The Conference Finals is best remembered for the Pistons walking off the court in the last game just before it ended, willingly letting the final seconds tick away, unwilling to shake hands with the Bulls. After the series, Michael Jordan said, \"You see two different styles with us and them. The dirty play and the flagrant fouls and unsportsmanlike conduct. Hopefully, that will be eliminated from the game. I think we play clean basketball. We don't go out and try to hurt people and dirty up the game. You never lose respect for the champions. But I haven't agreed with the methods they used. I think people are happy the game will get back to a clean game [with a Bulls triumph] and away from the 'Bad Boy' image.\" It was later revealed that the real reason the Pistons walked off the court without shaking hands with the Bulls was due to comments said by Jordan in a pre-game interview before Game 4, where he said, \"The Pistons are undeserving champions. The Bad Boys are bad for basketball.\"\nAfter getting swept by the Bulls, the Pistons traded James Edwards and waived Vinnie Johnson during the off-season. In the 1991\u201392 season, the Pistons finished with a 48\u201334 record. In the first round of the 1992 NBA playoffs, the Pistons were defeated by the New York Knicks in five games. Chuck Daly resigned as head coach after the season. Following Daly's departure, the Pistons went through a transitional period, as key players were either traded (Salley and Rodman) or retired (Laimbeer in 1993 and Thomas in 1994). They bottomed out in the 1993\u201394 season, finishing with a 20\u201362 record.\n1994\u20132000: The Grant Hill era.\nFollowing the 1993\u201394 season, they were able to draft Grant Hill, a promising small forward, with the third overall pick. However, this period also saw the team make numerous questionable personnel decisions, such as the loss of free agent Allan Houston to the New York Knicks, the signing of free agent washouts Loy Vaught and Bison Dele; and head coaching changes from Ron Rothstein to Don Chaney to Doug Collins to Alvin Gentry to George Irvine in an eight-year span. Of these coaches, only Collins had any sort of success with the Pistons, winning 54 games in the 1996\u201397 season. The franchise even changed its team colors in 1996 from its traditional red and blue to teal, burgundy, gold and black in what proved to be a highly unpopular move with fans. The only color that did not change was white. This period has become known, often derisively, as the \"teal era\".\n2000\u20132008: \"Goin' to Work\" era.\n2000\u20132002: Building a contender.\nAfter being swept by the Miami Heat in the 2000 playoffs, Joe Dumars, who had retired following the 1998\u201399 season, was hired as the team's president of basketball operations. He quickly faced what appeared to be a setback for the franchise, as Grant Hill elected to leave for the Orlando Magic. However, Dumars worked a sign and trade with Orlando that brought the Pistons Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins in exchange for Hill. Both quickly entered the Pistons' starting lineup. Wallace in particular developed into a defensive stalwart in the coming years. However, Hill played only 47 games in the following three seasons due to a recurring ankle injury.\nThe Pistons suffered through another tough season in 2000\u201301, going 32\u201350 despite Jerry Stackhouse averaging 29.8 points a game. After the season, the Pistons fired George Irvine as head coach and hired Rick Carlisle, a widely respected assistant coach who had been a contributor for the Celtics during the mid-1980s. The franchise also returned to its traditional red, white, and blue colors.\nCarlisle helped lead the Pistons to their first 50-win season since 1997, and their first playoff series victory since 1991 by defeating the Toronto Raptors in five games. They lost, however, to the Boston Celtics in five games.\n2003\u20132008: Six consecutive Eastern Conference Finals.\nIn the 2002 off-season, Joe Dumars revamped the roster by signing free agent Chauncey Billups, acquiring Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton from the Washington Wizards, and drafting Tayshaun Prince from Kentucky. The Pistons posted consecutive 50-win seasons and advanced to the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1991. There, however, they were swept in four games by the New Jersey Nets.\nDespite the team's improvement, Rick Carlisle was fired in the 2003 off-season. There were believed to be five reasons for the firing: first, that Carlisle had appeared reluctant to play some of the team's younger players, such as Prince and Mehmet Okur, during the regular season; second, that some of the players had not gotten along with Carlisle; third, that Carlisle's offense was thought to be conservative; fourth, that Hall of Famer Larry Brown had become available; and fifth, that Carlisle was rumored to have alienated owner Bill Davidson with his personality. Brown accepted the job that summer.\nThe Pistons' transformation into a championship team was completed with the February 2004 acquisition of Rasheed Wallace. The Pistons now had another big man to pose a threat from all parts of the court. The Pistons finished the season 54\u201328, recording their best record since 1997. In the 2004 playoffs, after defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games, they defeated the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets in seven games after coming back from a 3\u20132 deficit. The Pistons then defeated the Pacers, coached by Rick Carlisle, in six tough games to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1990. Many analysts gave the Pistons little chance to win against their opponent, the Los Angeles Lakers, who had won three out of the previous four NBA championships and who fielded a star-studded lineup that included Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone. However, the Pistons won the series in dominating fashion, defeating Los Angeles in five games for the team's third NBA championship. The Pistons posted double-digit wins in three of their four victories and held the Lakers to a franchise-low 68 points in Game 3. Chauncey Billups was named NBA Finals MVP. With the win, Bill Davidson became the first owner to win both an NBA and NHL championship in the same calendar year, as he had also won the Stanley Cup as owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nDespite losing key members of their bench during the off-season (including Okur, Mike James and Corliss Williamson), the Pistons were considered a strong contender to win a second consecutive title in 2005. They won 54 games during the regular season, their fourth consecutive season of 50 or more wins. During the 2005 playoffs, they easily defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4\u20131 and then rallied from a 2\u20131 deficit to finish off the Indiana Pacers, 4\u20132. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons faced the Miami Heat. Once again, the Pistons fell behind. However, they ultimately won the series in seven games. In the NBA Finals, the Pistons faced the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first four games of the series, the turning point came at the end of Game 5 in Detroit, which went into overtime. The Pistons were ahead 95\u201393 when Robert Horry sank the game-winning three-point basket for the Spurs with 5.8 seconds left in the extra session. The Pistons fought back to win Game 6 in San Antonio, setting up the first NBA Finals Game 7 since 1994. The Pistons then lost a hard-fought, low-scoring game to the Spurs, who won their third NBA championship since 1999.\nThe Pistons' 2004\u201305 season was marked by a major controversy, as well as distracting issues involving Larry Brown. In the first month of the season, the infamous Malice at the Palace erupted between the Pacers and the Pistons, one of the largest fan-player incidents in the history of American sports. It resulted in heavy fines and suspensions for several players and a great deal of NBA and media scrutiny. Meanwhile, Brown was forced to leave the team on two occasions due to health concerns. During this time, he was the subject of a series of rumors linking him to other job openings. Concerned about Brown's health and angered over his alleged pursuit of other jobs during the season, the Pistons bought out his contract soon after the 2005 NBA Finals. Brown was promptly named head coach of the New York Knicks, while the Pistons hired Flip Saunders, formerly of the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, the Pistons recorded the NBA's best overall record. Their 37\u20135 start exceeded the best start for any Detroit sports franchise in history and tied for the fourth-best start through 42 games in NBA history. Four of the five Pistons starters (Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace, and Ben Wallace) were named to the All-Star team, and Flip Saunders served as the Eastern Conference All-Star team coach. The Pistons finished the regular season with a record of 64\u201318, setting new franchise records for both overall and road victories (27). In addition, the team set an NBA record by starting the same lineup in 73 consecutive games from the start of the season.\nThe top-seeded Pistons defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 4\u20131 in the first round of the 2006 NBA playoffs, but struggled in the second round against the Cleveland Cavaliers, falling behind 3\u20132 before winning in seven games. Things did not improve against the second-seeded Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. Miami defeated the Pistons in six games en route to the 2006 NBA championship.\nDuring the off-season, the Pistons offered Ben Wallace a four-year, $48 million contract, which would have made him the highest-paid player in franchise history at the time. However, Wallace agreed to a 4-year, $60 million contract with the Chicago Bulls.\nTo replace Ben Wallace, the Pistons signed Nazr Mohammed. He struggled to fill the team's void at center, however, and the team began looking for additional help. On January 16, 2007, the Pistons signed free agent Chris Webber. The Pistons quickly began playing better basketball. They were only 21\u201315 before Webber was acquired; with him, the team went 32\u201314. On April 11, the Pistons clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference, which guaranteed them home-court advantage for first three rounds of the playoffs.\nThe Pistons opened the 2007 NBA playoffs with a 4\u20130 victory over the Orlando Magic, their first playoff series sweep since 1990. The team advanced to face the Chicago Bulls, marking the first time that the Central Division rivals had met in the postseason since 1991. After winning the first two games by 26 and 21 points, the Pistons overcame a 19-point deficit to win Game 3, 81\u201374. The Bulls avoided elimination by winning Games 4 and 5, but the Pistons closed out the series, 95\u201385, in Game 6 to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the fifth consecutive season. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. After both teams split the first four games of the series, the turning point happened in Game 5. The game is best remembered for LeBron James' performance where he scored the Cavaliers' final 29 of 30 points, including the team's final 25 points, to help defeat the Pistons 109\u2013107 in double overtime. The Pistons never recovered as they were eliminated in Game 6, 98\u201382.\nIn the 2007 NBA draft, the Pistons selected Rodney Stuckey with the 15th overall pick and Arron Afflalo with the 27th overall pick. They also re-signed Chauncey Billups to a long-term contract, as well as top prospect Amir Johnson and key reserve Antonio McDyess. This season marked the 50th anniversary of the franchise in Detroit.\nAt the start of the 2007\u201308 season, Rasheed Wallace became the Pistons' new center. Upon entering his third season, Saunders became the longest-tenured Pistons coach since Chuck Daly. Detroit finished the season with the second-best record in the league at 59\u201323. The Boston Celtics held the first seed, and many speculated that Boston was their main competition in the Eastern Conference. In the 2008 NBA playoffs, Detroit started out poorly with a Game 1 loss to the seventh-seeded Philadelphia 76ers and found themselves in a 2\u20131 deficit. However, the Pistons rallied to defeat the Sixers in six games.\nIn the semifinals, the Pistons faced the Orlando Magic. The Pistons rolled out to a Game 1 romp, and won a tight Game 2 amid mild controversy. At the very end of the third quarter, Chauncey Billups hit a three-point field goal that gave the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped shortly into the play. League rules currently prohibit officials from using both instant replay and a timing device to measure how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay from the time of the malfunction onward allowed. The officials estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and since there were 5.1 seconds remaining when it began, the field goal was counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket should not have counted.\nIn addition to losing Game 3 badly, 111\u201386, the Pistons also lost all-star point guard and team leader Chauncey Billups to a hamstring injury. Despite his absence, the Pistons rallied from 15 down in the third quarter to win Game 4 90\u201389 on a field goal by Tayshaun Prince with just 8.9 seconds to play, taking a 3\u20131 series lead. Again with Billups sitting on the sideline, they then proceeded to win Game 5 in Detroit, winning the series 4\u20131.\nDetroit advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth straight season, squaring off against the Celtics. This put the Pistons second on the all-time list of most consecutive conference finals appearances, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers, who appeared in eight straight conference finals from the 1981\u201382 to 1988\u201389 seasons. They lost Game 1 88\u201379, but won in Game 2 on the road, 103\u201397, marking the Celtics' first home court loss in the postseason. Immediately following that, the Celtics won their first road game of the postseason, 94\u201380, in Game 3. Game 4 saw the Pistons win 94\u201375. In the pivotal Game 5 they lost 106\u2013102, despite rallying from 17 points down late in the game. In Game 6, the Pistons entered the fourth quarter leading 70\u201360, but a lack of focus, a poor game from Rasheed Wallace, and a rally-killing turnover by Tayshaun Prince ultimately led to their demise; the Pistons ended their season with an 89\u201381 loss.\nIn what would ultimately be a bellwether moment in the franchise's history, Wallace refused to take any post-game questions, simply walking back to the locker room afterwards, aware that Joe Dumars would likely start dismantling the team, saying only, \"It's over, man.\" The Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals. On June 3, 2008, the Pistons announced that Saunders would not return as head coach.\n2008\u20132011: Failed rebuilding.\nOn June 10, 2008, the Pistons hired Michael Curry to be their new head coach. On November 3, 2008, the Pistons traded key members Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess to the Denver Nuggets for Allen Iverson. McDyess was later waived on November 10 and rejoined the Pistons on December 9. The trade was marked as the start of a new rebuilding process due to Iverson's free agent status at the end of the season. Indeed, Joe Dumars previously made it clear that no player on the team was guaranteed a position, bluntly saying they lost their sacred cow status.\nThe season was marked with many controversies and injuries. As a result of this and poor play, the Pistons dropped down the standings, only clinching a playoff berth on April 10, 2009. The Pistons finished the season at 39\u201343, their first losing season in eight years. The Pistons were then swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games in the first round of the 2009 NBA playoffs. On June 30, 2009, Curry was fired as head coach. Iverson signed with the Memphis Grizzlies during the off-season.\nIn the off-season, the Pistons reached an agreement with former Chicago Bulls guard Ben Gordon on a five-year/$55 million contract, as well as an agreement with former Milwaukee Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva on a five-year contract worth $35 million. That same month, the Pistons lost their two key members during the last few years, veterans Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess. On July 8, 2009, the Pistons hired former Cavaliers assistant coach John Kuester to be the new head coach. The Pistons later re-signed Ben Wallace on August 12, 2009.\nDespite these changes, the team regressed even further, as they were hampered by setbacks and injuries. On March 23, 2010, the Pistons were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Indiana Pacers. The Pistons finished with a 27\u201355 record, their worst since 1994. Another 50-loss season, this time finishing at 30\u201352, led to the firing of Kuester at the end of the 2010\u201311 season; he had gotten into several disputes with the players, culminating with a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on February 25, 2011, where it was reported several players staged a protest that morning during shootaround; Kuester responded by benching all those involved, and the animosity was so high that some of the benched players could be seen laughing in response to his ejection from the game late in the first half.\n2011\u20132015: New ownership; more struggling.\nOn April 7, 2011, Karen Davidson, the widow of the late Bill Davidson, reached a long-awaited agreement to sell the franchise to billionaire Tom Gores, which was approved by the NBA Board of Governors in May. The deal also included The Palace of Auburn Hills and DTE Energy Music Theatre. According to \"Crain's Detroit Business\", the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected. In the 2011 NBA draft, the Pistons selected Brandon Knight, Kyle Singler and Vernon Macklin.\nPrior to the start of the 2011\u201312 season, the Pistons made several leadership changes, including appointing Dennis Mannion as president of the franchise and Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment. The team decided to hire Lawrence Frank as the head coach. The 2011\u201312 season was an improvement from previous years for the Pistons, although they still posted a losing record. While they started the season 4\u201320, they won half their remaining games to finish a lockout-shortened season with a record of 25\u201341. The team continued to build its young core with the drafting of the talented center Andre Drummond.\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 season, Frank was fired as head coach on April 18, 2013, after two losing seasons, and on June 10, 2013, the Pistons hired former player and coach Maurice Cheeks. His tenure lasted for just a bit more than half a season, as he was replaced by interim coach John Loyer. In April, the Pistons announced that Joe Dumars would step down as president of basketball operations but remain as an advisor to the organization and its ownership team. On May 14, 2014, Stan Van Gundy was hired. Van Gundy signed a 5-year, $35 million contract to become the head coach and president of basketball operations for the team.\nAfter starting the 2014\u201315 season with a 5\u201323 record, the Pistons waived Josh Smith, who was acquired in the summer of 2013. The team went on a lengthy winning streak, but finished the season with a record of only 32\u201350 after Brandon Jennings' Achilles injury.\n2015\u20132017: Return to the playoffs.\nIn the 2015 off-season, Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy began to change the roster by making such acquisitions as Ersan \u0130lyasova, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, and Steve Blake. They also drafted rookie Stanley Johnson with the eighth pick in the 2015 NBA draft and re-signed point guard Reggie Jackson. The Pistons entered the 2015\u201316 season with a stronger roster than the previous season, although they lost starter Greg Monroe to the Milwaukee Bucks in free agency. Andre Drummond started the season strong, earning consecutive Eastern Conference Player of the Week awards for the weeks of November 1 and 8.\nThe Pistons entered the All-Star break at 27\u201327. The Pistons surpassed their win totals from the 2009\u201310 season to the 2014\u201315 season on March 9, 2016, when they defeated the Dallas Mavericks 102\u201396. On April 6, 2016, following a 108\u2013104 win over the Orlando Magic, the Pistons reached 42 wins and were assured their first winning season since the 2007\u201308 season. On April 8, 2016, the Pistons defeated the Washington Wizards 112\u201399 and clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2009. The eighth-seeded Pistons faced the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs. They were swept in four games in a highly competitive series.\n2017\u20132020: Returning to downtown Detroit.\nBeginning with the 1978\u201379 season, the Pistons played their home games in suburban Oakland County, directly north of Detroit/Wayne County, first playing ten seasons at the Pontiac Silverdome and then playing at The Palace of Auburn Hills starting in the 1988\u201389 season. Pistons owner Tom Gores, Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment vice chairman Arn Tellum, and Olympia Entertainment, the Ilitch family's holding company that controls the Red Wings and Tigers, had been in negotiations over a partnership since the summer of 2015, with the Pistons possibly relocating to the new Little Caesars Arena as soon as the 2017\u201318 season. Talks intensified just as the Pistons were set to open their 2016\u201317 season, and as part of the terms of the agreement, there was discussion of a possible merger between Olympia and PS&amp;E. Also contingent on a finalized agreement, the Pistons were looking for a parcel of land in the arena's vicinity to build a new practice facility and team headquarters. The leasing agreement/partnership needed both city and league approval to be finalized.\nOn November 22, 2016, the Pistons officially announced their intention to move to Little Caesars Arena, and the site of The Palace of Auburn Hills was to be redeveloped and sold, with the arena likely to be demolished as part of the redevelopment. The last remaining NBA franchise to play in a suburban location, the Pistons ended their 39-year stay in Oakland County.\nOn June 20, 2017, Detroit City Council approved the Pistons' move to Little Caesars Arena. On August 3, 2017, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the move, which made it official. The move made Detroit the only U.S. city to have its Major League Baseball (MLB), National Football League (NFL), NBA, and NHL teams playing in its downtown district, and one of only two U.S. cities to have all their teams playing in one place, the other being Philadelphia.\nOn January 29, 2018, the Pistons announced they had acquired all-star forward Blake Griffin along with Willie Reed and Brice Johnson from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Avery Bradley, Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic, a 2018 first-round draft pick, and a 2019 second-round draft pick.\nThe Pistons finished the 2017\u201318 season with a 39\u201343 record. They missed the playoffs for the eighth time in ten years. On May 7, 2018, the Pistons announced that Stan Van Gundy would not return as head coach and president of basketball operations. On June 11, 2018, Dwane Casey was hired by the Pistons to be their new head coach, agreeing to a five-year deal. The Pistons finished the 2018\u201319 season with a 41\u201341 record, clinching a playoff spot as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the 2019 NBA playoffs, the Pistons were swept in four games by the Milwaukee Bucks, setting an NBA record for the most consecutive playoff losses with 14.\nOn March 11, 2020, the 2019\u201320 season was suspended by the NBA after it was reported that Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. On June 4, 2020, the season came to an end for the Pistons when the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan that would restart the season with 22 teams returning to play in the NBA bubble on July 31, 2020, which was approved by the National Basketball Players Association the next day. The Pistons finished the season with a 20\u201346 record.\n2020\u20132024: Continued struggles; historic losing streak.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Pistons hired Troy Weaver as the new general manager. The Pistons finished the 2020\u201321 season with the second-worst record in the league at 20\u201352, missing the playoffs for a second consecutive season. The 20 wins were also tied for the second-fewest in franchise history at the time. In the 2021 NBA draft, the Pistons selected Cade Cunningham with the first overall pick. The Pistons finished the 2021\u201322 season at 23\u201359, missing the playoffs for the third consecutive season.\nWith the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft, the Pistons selected Jaden Ivey. Later in the first round, the Pistons acquired Jalen Duren via a trade with the New York Knicks. The Pistons finished the 2022\u201323 season with the worst overall record in NBA and third-worst in franchise history at 17\u201365. It was their first 60-loss season since 1993\u201394. After the last game of the season on April 9, 2023, Dwane Casey stepped down as head coach to join the front office. On June 2, 2023, Monty Williams was hired by the Pistons to be their new head coach.\nAfter the Pistons started the 2023\u201324 season with a 2\u20131 record, they lost a franchise-record 28 games in a row from October 30 to December 30, the longest single-season losing streak and tied for the longest losing streak overall in NBA history. They became the thirteenth team in NBA history to have a winless month, going 0\u201315 in November. On March 9, 2024, the Pistons were officially eliminated from playoff contention for the fifth consecutive season. The Pistons finished with the worst overall record in the NBA for the second consecutive season and worst in franchise history at 14\u201368.\n2024\u2013present: Historic turnaround.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Pistons hired Trajan Langdon as President of Basketball Operations. The following day, the Pistons announced that Troy Weaver had stepped down as general manager. On June 19, 2024, Monty Williams was fired as head coach. On July 3, 2024, the Pistons hired J. B. Bickerstaff as head coach.\nOn January 1, 2025, following a win over the Orlando Magic, the Pistons surpassed the previous season's win total. On March 28, the Pistons secured their first winning season since 2016. They also became the second team in NBA history to triple their win total from the previous season, joining the 2012\u201313 Charlotte Bobcats, and the first to do so from the previous full season. On April 4, the Pistons clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 2019 with a 117\u2013105 win over the Toronto Raptors. The Pistons finished the 2024\u201325 season at 44\u201338, their best record since 2016. On April 21, the Pistons snapped their NBA-record, 15-game postseason losing streak by beating the New York Knicks 100\u201394 in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series. The Pistons were ultimately defeated by the Knicks in six games.\nMedia coverage.\nRadio.\nThe Pistons flagship radio station is WXYT-FM. There are several affiliate stations throughout Michigan. The regular radio announcers are Mark Champion with play-by-play and Rick Mahorn with color commentary.\nTV.\nThe Pistons' current local television rights holder is FanDuel Sports Network Detroit. Since the 2023\u201324 NBA season, five games per season have also been simulcast over-the-air on WMYD. The regular TV announcers are George Blaha with play-by-play, Greg Kelser with color commentary, Johnny Kane and Natalie Kerwin as the sideline reporter and pregame and postgame show host, Grant Long with studio analysis, and Dwane Casey as a contributor for select games.\nTeam identity.\nLogos and uniforms.\nAfter moving from Fort Wayne, to Detroit in 1957, the Pistons' uniforms remained largely unchanged for two decades, featuring the word \"Pistons\" in blue block lettering. In the 1978\u201379 season, the team featured a uniform with lightning bolts on the sides and in the wordmark on the front of the jerseys. The team discontinued the lightning bolt theme and returned to its classic block lettering and simple side panel pattern in 1981, staying with this look until 1996. That year, the Pistons changed their colors to teal, black, yellow and, red and unveiled a new logo with a horse's head and flaming mane. This color scheme lasted until 2001, when the team returned to the traditional red, white, and blue colors and a uniform pattern taking cues from the 1981\u20131996 threads. The horse's head and flaming mane logo lasted until 2005, when the team switched to a more classic logo design.\nOn May 16, 2017, the Pistons unveiled a new logo, which is a modernized version of the previous \"Bad Boys\" era logo used from 1979 to 1996.\nMascot.\nHooper is the mascot of the Pistons. He is depicted as a horse wearing a Pistons jersey. The symbolism is, that like the pistons they are named after, the team produces horsepower. Hooper became a part of the team on November 1, 1996, replacing Sir Slam A Lot.\nThough Hooper was introduced during the teal era to coincide with the Pistons' original equestrian logo, his popularity allowed him to remain a part of the team, despite the horsepower theme being phased out in 2005.\nOrigins of the Bad Boys nickname.\nAt the start of the 1987\u201388 season, Al Davis, owner of the then Los Angeles Raiders, sent Raiders merchandise to the Pistons to acknowledge the shared view of the teams and their physical style of play. Dan Hauser, Pistons vice-president of Marketing said, \"Al sent us Raiders sweaters, and when we played Golden State in Oakland, Al had Raiders warm-ups for us with our names and numbers on them. The rough bad-boy fighting style of the Raiders fits our image. That's why, at our home games at the Palace, you see a sea of black: black caps, black T-shirts, black sweatshirts\".\nThe end of season video yearbook produced by the NBA was titled \"Bad Boys\". Due to these factors, the name and image was embraced by the players and fans. Pistons guard Joe Dumars said, \"You can't be great in this league and have zero identity.\" Hudson Soft would later develop and publish \"Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball\", a futuristic basketball game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System without rules, without fouls, and weapons are permitted. \nThe positive view of the team was not universal with Michael Jordan declaring \"the Bad Boys are bad for basketball\", later adding \"I hated them. And that hate carries even to this day.\" David Stern, Commissioner of the NBA at the time, said, \"If I had it to do over again, we would be more aggressive in regulating, shall we say, that style of play, because it led to our game becoming much more physical.\"\nJalen Rose, who later starred as a member of the Fab Five at Michigan, embraced the Bad Boys brand as a teenager growing up in Detroit, stating \"I loved everything about the Bad Boys. I loved how they played and how they didn't back down. They just went out and kicked the other teams' butts.\" Pistons announcer George Blaha said, \"I think the people of Detroit and all across Michigan loved the Pistons' don't-back-down-ever mentality. Detroit's a working person's town and that's the same type of fan that you have all across the state of Michigan from the big cities to the small towns. Never does a day go by that somebody that I talk to doesn't bring up the Bad Boys; they loved 'em.\"\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Pistons.

It lies in the western part of the Metropolis GZM, a metropolis with a population of around 2 million. It is in the Silesian Highlands, on the Bytomka River, a tributary of the Oder.\nZabrze is located in the Silesian Voivodeship. It is one of the cities composing the 2.7\u00a0million inhabitant conurbation referred to as the Katowice urban area, itself a major centre in the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area which is populated by just over five million people. The population of Zabrze as of December 2021 was 168,946, down from June 2009 when the population was 188,122. Zabrze is bordered by three other cities of the metropolitan area: Gliwice, Bytom and Ruda \u015al\u0105ska. The city is particularly known as the home of G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, one of the most accomplished Polish football clubs. The local historic coal mine complex is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland as one of the most valuable of its kind in Poland.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBiskupice, which is now a subdivision of Zabrze, was first mentioned in 1243 as \"Biscupici dicitur cirka Bitom\". Zabrze (or \"Old\" Zabrze) was mentioned in 1295\u20131305 as \"Sadbre sive Cunczindorf\" (German for \" Konrad/Kunze's village\"; \"sive\" = \"or\"). According to historical sources, mining in Zabrze dates back to the 13th century. The present-day districts of Mikulczyce and Rokitnica were locations of motte-and-bailey castles from the 13th-15th century, which are now archaeological sites. In the 1970s, archaeologists discovered an Epipalaeolithic flintwork and flint tools from the Mesolithic at the Mikulczyce archaeological site. In the Late Middle Ages, the local Silesian Piast dukes invited German settlers into the territory, resulting in increasing German settlement. The settlement was part of the Silesian duchies of fragmented Poland. Zabrze became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. In 1645, along with the Duchy of Opole, Zabrze returned to Polish rule under the House of Vasa, in 1666 it fell back to the Habsburgs, and was later annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Silesian Wars. In 1774, the Dorotheendorf settlement was founded. In 1791, a coking coal seam was discovered in Zabrze, and then its first coking coal mine was opened. In the 19th century, new coal mines, steelworks, factories and a power plant were created. A road connecting Gliwice and Chorz\u00f3w and a railway connecting Opole and \u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owice were led through Zabrze.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn 1905, the Zabrze commune was created from the former communes of Alt-Zabrze, Klein-Zabrze, and Dorotheendorf. In 1915, it was renamed \"Hindenburg\" in honour of Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg, with the change approved by Emperor Wilhelm II on 21 February 1915. Until that time, it was among the few cities in Upper Silesia whose Polish name had been retained under German rule.\nIn 1904, the \"Sok\u00f3\u0142\" Polish Gymnastic Society was established in Zabrze as both a sporting and patriotic organization promoting Polish national identity. It was dissolved by Prussian authorities in 1911 but reactivated twice, in 1913 and 1918. Members of the organization later took an active role in the Upper Silesia plebiscite campaign and in the Silesian uprisings.\nInterwar period.\nDuring the plebiscite held after World War I, 21,333 inhabitants (59%) of the Hindenburg commune voted to remain in Germany, while 14,873 (41%) voted for incorporation to Poland, which had just regained its independence. In May 1921 the Third Silesian Uprising broke out and Hindenburg was captured by Polish insurgents, who held it until the end of the uprising. When Upper Silesia was divided between Poland and Germany in 1921, the Hindenburg commune remained in Germany, while the present-day districts of Ko\u0144czyce, Makoszowy and Paw\u0142\u00f3w were reintegrated with Poland. It received its city charter in 1922. Just five years after receiving city rights Hindenburg became the biggest city in German-ruled western Upper Silesia and the second biggest city in German-ruled Silesia after Wroc\u0142aw (then \"Breslau\"). Nevertheless, various Polish organizations still operated in the city in the interbellum, including a local branch of the Union of Poles in Germany, Polish libraries, sports clubs, credit unions, choirs, scout troops and an amateur theater. Polish newspaper \"G\u0142os Ludu\" was published in the city. In a secret \"Sicherheitsdienst\" report from 1934, Zabrze was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia. In terms of religion, most of the city's population adhered to the Catholic Church.\nIn the 1920s, the communists, Christian democrats and nationalists enjoyed the greatest support among the German population, while Poles supported Polish parties. In 1924 the Communist Party of Germany won the local elections and proposed changing the name of the city to \"Leninburg\". In 1928, among the largest cities in western Upper Silesia, Polish parties received the most votes in Zabrze. In the March 1933 elections, most of the citizens voted for the Nazi Party, followed by Zentrum and the Communist Party. Nazi politician Max Fillusch became the city's mayor and remained in the position until 1945.\nThe anti-Polish organization Bund Deutscher Osten was very active in the city, it dealt with propaganda, indoctrination and espionage of the Polish community, as well as denouncing Poles to local authorities. When, the Barb\u00f3rka (traditional holiday of miners) church services were organized separately for Poles and Germans in 1936, the Polish service enjoyed a greater attendance, however, due to Nazi oppression and propaganda, the attendance at Polish services in the 1930s gradually decreased, according to Bund Deutscher Osten. Polish activists were increasingly persecuted since 1937. People were urged to Germanise their names, Polish inscriptions were removed from tombstones. Some Polish priests were expelled from the city, both before and during World War II. As a result of German persecution the Jewish community dropped from 1,154 people in 1933 to 551 in 1939, and its remainder was deported to concentration camps in 1942. The town's synagogue, that had stood since 1872, was destroyed in the \"Kristallnacht\" pogroms of November 1938.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, in 1941 the German authorities requisitioned church property and removed Polish symbols and memorabilia. Church bells were confiscated for war purposes in 1942. The Germans also established three forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the city, two of which operated in the local coal mines, and one subcamp of Auschwitz III was also located there. Another subcamp of Stalag VIII-B/344 (E51) operated at a coal mine in the present-day Mikulczyce district.\nOn 24 January 1945, the city was captured by the Red Army. According to historian Andrzej Hanich, around 100 inhabitants were killed during and after the takeover. Some inhabitants were later deported to the Soviet Union, and others were resettled west in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nContemporary history.\nFollowing World War II, according to the Potsdam Agreement the city was handed over to Poland in 1945 and the town's name was changed to the historic \"Zabrze\" on 19 May 1945. The first post-war mayor of Zabrze was Pawe\u0142 Dubiel, pre-war Polish activist and journalist in Upper Silesia, prisoner of the Dachau and Mauthausen concentration camps during the war. The pre-war Polish inhabitants of the region, who formed the majority of the city's population in 1948, were joined by Poles expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. Moreover, Polish settlers from the central part of Poland also settled in Zabrze.\nThe city limits were largely expanded in 1951, by including Mikulczyce, Rokitnica, Grzybowice, Makoszowy, Ko\u0144czyce and Paw\u0142\u00f3w as new districts. New neighbourhoods were built from the 1950s to 1990s. In 1948, G\u00f3rnik Zabrze football club was founded, which won its first Polish championship in 1957, and soon became the pride of the city as one of the most successful clubs in Poland. Zabrze was administratively part of the Katowice Voivodeship until 1998.\nAdministrative division.\nOn 17 September 2012, the Zabrze city council decided on a new administrative division of the city. Zabrze was subsequently divided into 15 districts and 3 housing estates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInfrastructure.\nThe Polish north\u2013south A1 and east\u2013west A4 motorways, which are parts of the European routes E75 and E40, respectively, run through Zabrze, and their junction is located just outside the city limits. In addition the Polish National roads 78, 88 and 94 also run through the city.\nThe Drogowa Trasa Srednicowa leads through the town.\nCulture and sights.\nAmong the cultural institutions of the town are the Zabrze Philharmonic and \"Teatr Nowy\" (\"New Theatre\"). \"Dom Muzyki i Ta\u0144ca\" (\"House of Music and Dance\") indoor arena is located in Zabrze. The local museums are the Coal Mining Museum, the Municipal Museum and the Military Technology Museum. The Maciej mine shaft and the Main Key Hereditary Adit (\"G\u0142\u00f3wna Kluczowa Sztolnia Dziedziczna\"), one of the longest such structures in Europe, are open for tourists. The historic coal mines of Zabrze are listed as a Historic Monument of Poland.\nAmong the historical architecture there are many industrial facilities, as well as various churches, houses, public buildings, etc. Important monuments of architecture were built the Expressionist and modernist styles, eg. the Admiralspalast Hotel (1924-1927), housing estate on S\u0142owia\u0144ski Square (1927-1928) and St Joseph's Church (1930-1931, designed by Dominikus B\u00f6hm). There are also numerous monuments referring to the history of the city, especially the Silesian uprisings fought here and World War II.\nThere is also a botanical garden and several parks in Zabrze.\nPolitics.\nMembers of Parliament (Sejm) elected from Bytom/Gliwice/Zabrze constituency\nSports.\nThe city's most renown sports team is G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, one of the most accomplished Polish football clubs, 14 times Polish champions, 6 times Polish Cup winners, and 1969\u201370 European Cup Winners' Cup runners-up, as the only Polish team to reach the final stage of a major European football competition. Other popular team is NMC G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, two times Polish men's handball champions and three times Polish Cup winners. Both teams compete in the national top leagues, the Ekstraklasa and Superliga respectively.\nMany sportspeople were born in Zabrze, including footballers Jerzy Gorgo\u0144, \u0141ukasz Skorupski and Adam Bodzek, and pro ice hockey player of the National Hockey League, Wojtek Wolski.\nEconomy.\nLike other towns in this populous region, it is an important manufacturing centre, having coal-mines, iron, wire, glass, chemical and oil works, and local Upper Silesia Brewery, etc.\nInternational relations.\nConsulates.\nThere is an Honorary Consulate of Armenia in Zabrze. There is a khachkar in Zabrze commemorating the Armenian\u2013Polish friendship.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nZabrze is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was dominated by the Kenya Rift Valley which passes through it and gave the province its name. According to the 2009 Census, the former province covered an area of and would have had a population of 10,006,805, making it the largest and most populous province in the country. The bulk of the provincial population inhabited a strip between former Nairobi and Nyanza Province. The capital was the town of Nakuru.\nCounties.\nAs of March 2013 after the Kenyan general election, 2013, the Province was partitioned into counties and Rift Valley Province was dissolved.\nGeography.\nThe Great Rift Valley runs south through Kenya from Lake Turkana in the north and has several unique geographical features, including the Elgeyo escarpment which is a popular tourist attraction.\nApart from the Rift Valley itself, the area has other important geographic features such as: the extinct volcanoes Mount Longonot and Mount Suswa and Lake Baringo, Lake Bogoria, Lake Magadi, Lake Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, the Suguta Valley, and Lake Turkana.\nGeology.\nA large part of Kenya is underlain by Precambrian basement, while the Kenya rift basin (a typical extensional basin) hosts Tertiary volcanics that cover Mesozoic sediments (Recently these sediments have been considered for oil exploration). The sedimentary basins evolved along the Anza trough during the Late Paleozoic to Early Tertiary times through extension tectonics during the major Gondwanaland breakup. In the Miocene Period, the region underwent intermittent uplift and subsidence along major boundary faults accompanied by a large outpouring of lava flows. The Anza trough intersects the modern rift valley in the area of Lake Turkana. Rifting still continues today; primarily in the north, where active volcanoes are more plentiful.\nEconomy.\nThe highlands provide adequate rainfall for farming and agriculture which is the economic base of the residents of the Rift Valley. Tea from the highlands in the Kericho district enjoys a worldwide reputation, but horticulture is an important part of the district's economy and cattle raising is also practised to a large extent.\nThe full economic potential of the Rift Valley region is, however, far from fully exploited, though the current growth in population and improved education may change this in a near future. People in the province are still mostly rural, but urbanisation is gradually increasing; new cities and towns contain the rural-urban migration and, provided the right policies are instituted, the Rift Valley province will be able to emerge as a national economic and cultural hub.\nEthnicity.\nThe Rift Valley is home to various communities. The people of the Rift Valley are a mesh work of different ethnic identities, and the Kalenjin and the Maasai are two of the best known ethnic groups. Most of Kenya's top runners come from the Kalenjin community. The Maasai people have the most recognizable cultural identity, both nationally and internationally, and serve as Kenya's international cultural symbol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72875", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72875", "title": "Indiana Pacers", "text": "American professional basketball team\nThe Indiana Pacers are an American professional basketball team based in Indianapolis. The Pacers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team was founded in 1967 as an original member of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and became a member of the NBA in 1976 as a result of the ABA\u2013NBA merger. They play their home games at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The team is named after the state of Indiana's history with the Indianapolis 500's pace cars and with the harness racing industry.\nThe Pacers have won three championships, in 1970, 1972, and 1973, all in the ABA. They also reached the ABA Finals in 1969 and 1975, and have also appeared in the NBA Finals in 2000 and 2025. The team has also won nine division titles.\nSix Hall of Fame players \u2013 Reggie Miller, Chris Mullin, Alex English, Mel Daniels, Roger Brown, and George McGinnis \u2013 played with the Pacers for multiple seasons. The franchise has multiple Hall of Fame coaches in Bobby \"Slick\" Leonard, Jack Ramsay, and Larry Brown. Furthermore, former Pacers inducted into international Halls of Fame include Miller and Detlef Schrempf in the FIBA Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\n1967\u20131976: ABA dynasty.\nIn early 1967, a group of six investors (attorney Richard Tinkham, John DeVoe, Chuck DeVoe, entrepreneur Lyn Treece, sports agent Chuck Barnes, and \"Indianapolis Star\" sports writer Bob Collins) pooled their resources to purchase a franchise in the proposed American Basketball Association.\nFor their first seven years, they played in the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum, although they did play select playoff games in various places, such as Anderson High School Wigwam for four playoff games (1969, 1971, 1972). and even Assembly Hall for two playoff games (1972). In 1974, they moved to the new Market Square Arena in downtown Indianapolis, where they played for 25 years.\nEarly in the Pacers' second season, former Indiana Hoosiers standout Bob \"Slick\" Leonard became the team's head coach, replacing Larry Staverman. Leonard quickly turned the Pacers into a juggernaut. His teams were buoyed by the great play of superstars such as Mel Daniels, George McGinnis, Bob Netolicky, Rick Mount, Freddie Lewis and Roger Brown. The Pacers were the most successful team in ABA history, winning three ABA Championships in four years. In all, they appeared in the ABA Finals five times in the league's nine-year history, which was an ABA record.\n1976\u20131987: Early NBA struggles.\nThe Pacers were one of four ABA teams that joined the NBA in the ABA\u2013NBA merger in the 1976\u201377 season, along with the Denver Nuggets, New York Nets, and San Antonio Spurs.\nThe league charged a $3.2 million entry fee for each former ABA team. Since the NBA would only agree to accept four ABA teams in the merger, the surviving ABA teams also had to compensate the two remaining ABA franchises which were not a part of the merger, the Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels (a third ABA team, the Virginia Squires, would fold operations before the merger talks began). As a result of the merger, the four teams dealt with financial troubles. Additionally, the Pacers had some financial troubles, which dated back to their waning days in the ABA; they had begun selling off some of their star players in the last ABA season. The new NBA teams also were barred from sharing in national TV revenues for four years.\nThe Pacers finished their inaugural NBA season with a record of 36\u201346. Billy Knight and Don Buse represented Indiana in the NBA All-Star Game. However, this was one of the few bright spots of the Pacers' first 13 years in the NBA. During this time, they had only two non-losing seasons and only two playoff appearances.\nA lack of continuity became the norm for most of the next decade, as they traded away Knight and Buse before the 1977\u201378 season even started. They acquired Adrian Dantley in exchange for Knight, but Dantley (who was averaging nearly 27 points per game at the time) was traded in December, while the Pacers' second-leading scorer, John Williamson, was dealt in January.\nThe early Pacers came out on the short end of two of the most one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was long past his prime and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on to become one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens, who had played for the Pacers during their last ABA season. Owens played one year for the Pacers with little impact and was out of the league altogether a year later. In 1983\u201384, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft \u2013 the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie, while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history \u2013 including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sam Perkins, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton.\nClark Kellogg was drafted by the Pacers in the 1982 and finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting, but the Pacers finished the 1982\u201383 season with their all-time worst record of 20\u201362 and won only 26 games the following season. After winning 22 games in 1984\u201385 and 26 games in 1985\u201386, Jack Ramsay replaced George Irvine as coach and led the Pacers to a 41\u201341 record in 1986\u201387 and their second playoff appearance as an NBA team. Chuck Person, nicknamed \"The Rifleman\" for his renowned long-range shooting, led the team in scoring as a rookie and won NBA Rookie of the Year honors. Their first playoff win in NBA franchise history was earned in game 3 of their first-round, best-of-five series against the Atlanta Hawks, but it was their only victory in that series, as the Hawks defeated them in four games.\n1987\u20132005: The Reggie Miller era.\nReggie Miller from UCLA was drafted by the Pacers in 1987, beginning his career as a backup to John Long. Many fans at the time disagreed with Miller's selection over Indiana Hoosiers' standout Steve Alford. The Pacers missed the playoffs in 1987\u201388, drafted Rik Smits in the 1988 NBA draft, and suffered through a disastrous 1988\u201389 season in which coach Jack Ramsay stepped down following an 0\u20137 start. Mel Daniels and George Irvine filled in on an interim basis before Dick Versace took over the 6\u201323 team on the way to a 28\u201354 finish. In February 1989, the team traded veteran center Herb Williams to the Dallas Mavericks for future NBA Sixth Man-of-the Year Detlef Schrempf.\nFrom 1989 to 1993, the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs; in 1989\u201390, the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the team's third playoff appearance under coach Bob Hill. But the Pacers were swept by the Detroit Pistons, who would go on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the All-Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points-per-game average. Despite four straight first-round exits, this period was highlighted by a first-round series with the Boston Celtics in the 1991 playoffs that went to game 5. The next season, the Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 and met the Boston Celtics for the second year in a row. This time, the Celtics swept the Pacers in three games. Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the off-season, and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell in return. For the 1992\u201393 season, Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All-Star game. Meanwhile, Miller became the Pacers' all-time NBA era leading scorer during this season (fourth overall). The Pacers returned to the playoffs with a 41\u201341 record, but lost to the New York Knicks in the first round, three games to one.\n1994\u20131997: Larry Brown era.\nLarry Brown was brought aboard as Pacers' coach for the 1993\u201394 season, and Pacers' general manager Donnie Walsh completed a then highly criticized trade as he sent Schrempf to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Derrick McKey and little known Gerald Paddio. But the Pacers won their last eight games of the season to finish with an NBA-era franchise-high 47 wins. They stormed past Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic in a first-round sweep to earn their first NBA playoff series win, and pulled off an upset by defeating the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the conference semifinals.\nBack-to-back Eastern Conference finals appearances.\nWith the 1994 Eastern Conference finals tied going into game 5 in New York, and the Pacers trailing the Knicks by 15 points early in the fourth quarter, Reggie Miller scored 25 points, which included five 3-point field goals. Miller also flashed the choke sign to the Knicks' celebrity fan, Spike Lee, while leading the Pacers to the come from behind victory. The Knicks ultimately came back to win the next two games and the series. Miller was a tri-captain and leading scorer of the USA Basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1994 FIBA World Championship.\nMark Jackson joined the team in an off-season trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, giving the team a steady hand at the point guard position that had been lacking in recent years. The Pacers enjoyed a 52\u201330 campaign in 1994\u201395, giving them their first Central Division title and first 50+ win season since the ABA days. The team swept the Hawks in the first round of the 1995 NBA playoffs, before another meeting with the rival Knicks in the conference semifinals. This time, with the Pacers down six points with 16.4 seconds remaining in game 1, Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to help secure a two-point victory. The Pacers beat the Knicks in seven games. They pushed the Orlando Magic to seven games before falling in the Eastern Conference finals.\nInjury-plagued seasons.\nThe Pacers duplicated their 52\u201330 record in 1995\u201396, but were hurt severely by an injury to Reggie Miller's eye socket in April, from which he was not able to return until game 5 of their first-round series against the Hawks. Miller scored 29 points in that game, but the Hawks came away with a two-point victory to put an early end to Indiana's season. This 1995\u201396 Pacers did manage to go down in history as the only team to defeat the Chicago Bulls twice that year, a Bulls team which made history with a then all-time best 72\u201310 record. The Pacers could not withstand several key injuries in 1996\u201397, nor could they handle the absence of Mark Jackson, who had been traded to the Denver Nuggets before the season (though they did re-acquire Jackson at the trading deadline). The Pacers finished 39\u201343 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1989, after which coach Larry Brown stepped down.\n1997\u20132000: Larry Bird era.\nIn the 1997\u201398 NBA season, Indiana native and former Boston Celtics great Larry Bird was hired as head coach. He led the Pacers to a 19-game improvement over the previous season, finishing 58\u201324 at the time, the most the franchise had ever won as an NBA team, and tying the 1970\u201371 ABA Pacers for the franchise record.\nBack-to-back Eastern Conference finals appearances.\nChris Mullin joined the team in the off-season and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineup as the starting small forward. Assistant coaches Rick Carlisle, in charge of the offense, and Dick Harter, who coached the defense, were key in getting the most out of the Pacers' role players such as Dale Davis, Derrick McKey, and a young Antonio Davis. Miller and Rik Smits both made the All-Star team that year, and in the playoffs, the Pacers breezed past the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks before falling to the Chicago Bulls in a seven-game Eastern Conference finals.\nIn the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, the Pacers won the Central Division with a 33\u201317 record and swept the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers before falling to the Knicks in a six-game Eastern Conference finals.\n2000 NBA Finals appearance.\nPrior to the 1999\u20132000 NBA season, the Pacers traded forward Antonio Davis to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for first-round draft choice Jonathan Bender. In the 2000 NBA playoffs, after a 56\u201326 regular season, the Pacers survived the upset-minded Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, handled the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round and finally broke through to the NBA Finals by virtue of a six-game conference finals victory over the New York Knicks. Their first NBA Finals appearance was against the Los Angeles Lakers, who ended Indiana's championship hopes in six games. However, the Pacers dealt Los Angeles their worst playoff defeat up to that time by a margin of 33 points in game five.\n2000\u20132003: Isiah Thomas era.\nThe off-season brought sweeping changes to the Pacers' lineup, as Rik Smits and coach Larry Bird retired, Chris Mullin returned to the Golden State Warriors, Mark Jackson signed a long-term contract with Toronto, and Dale Davis was traded to Portland for Jermaine O'Neal, who went on to average 12.9 points per game in his first year as a starter. It was a rebuilding year for the Pacers under the new head coach Isiah Thomas. However, the team still managed to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in four games.\nJermaine O'Neal's rise to stardom.\nIn the midseason of 2001\u201302, the Pacers made a blockbuster trade with the Chicago Bulls that sent Jalen Rose and Travis Best to Chicago in exchange for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Kevin Ollie and Ron Mercer. In the next few years, Miller and Artest would go on to be All-Stars for the Pacers. The trade bolstered a team that had been floundering, and the Pacers managed to return to the playoffs, where they pushed the top-seeded New Jersey Nets to five games before losing game 5 in double overtime. Jermaine O'Neal made his first of what would be several All-Star appearances in his Pacers career.\nThe Pacers got off to a 13\u20132 start in 2002\u201303 but hit the wall after the All-Star break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's multiple suspensions and family tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin Croshere. O'Neal and Brad Miller both made the All-Star team, and the Pacers made a substantial improvement as they finished 48\u201334, but they suffered a loss to the underdog Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs.\n2003\u20132007: Rick Carlisle era.\nIn the 2003 off-season, the Pacers managed to re-sign O'Neal for the NBA maximum and inked Reggie Miller to a modest two-year deal, but they could not afford to keep their talented center, Brad Miller. He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard, who spent much of the following year watching from the bench and backing up Jeff Foster. The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president, and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach Isiah Thomas and replacing him with Rick Carlisle.\nRon Artest's rise to stardom.\nThe Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well and had a breakthrough 2003\u201304 season in which they finished 61\u201321, earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record. O'Neal and Artest made the All-Star team, and Artest was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year; the Pacers swept the Boston Celtics in the first round and squeezed by the Miami Heat in the conference semifinals. But the Detroit Pistons proved an impediment to Indiana's championship aspirations, as they defeated the Pacers in six games on their way to the NBA Championship.\nMiller's final season and Malice at the Palace.\nAl Harrington, a small forward who had established himself as one of the best sixth-men in the NBA, was dealt in the off-season to the Atlanta Hawks in return for Stephen Jackson after Harrington allegedly demanded that the Pacers start him or trade him. Nevertheless, the Pacers started the 2004\u201305 season strongly until a November 19, 2004 game. Toward the end of a Pacers victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pacers' Ron Artest committed a hard foul against Ben Wallace. Wallace retaliated with a hard push, threw a towel at Artest, and the situation escalated to a full-scale brawl, with fans and several Pacers taking part. While Artest lay atop the scorer's table trying to calm down and do an interview, Pistons fan John Green (who was sitting next to Wallace's brother) threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, causing him to charge into the stands. Stephen Jackson followed him into the stands while Jermaine O'Neal struck a fan who came onto the court. The game was called off with 45.9 seconds left on the clock, and the Pacers left the floor amid a shower of beer and other beverages that rained down from the stands.\nSeveral of the involved players were suspended by NBA Commissioner David Stern. Artest was suspended for the rest of the regular season and playoffs, a total of 73 games \u2013 the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Other suspensions included Jackson (suspended for 30 games), O'Neal (25 games), Wallace (6 games), and the Pacers' Anthony Johnson (5 games) (O'Neal's suspension was later reduced to 15 games by arbitrator Roger Kaplan, a decision that was upheld by U. S. District Judge George B. Daniels). O'Neal was charged with two counts of assault and battery, while Artest, Jackson, Johnson, and David Harrison were charged with one count each.\nAfter the brawl and suspensions that followed, the Pacers fell into the Central Division. They went from a legitimate title contender to a team that hovered around .500 in winning percentage. The Pistons eventually became the Central Division champions. Despite the difficulties with the suspensions and injuries, the Pacers earned a sixth seed in the playoffs with a record of 44\u201338. An important reason for their strong finish was the re-acquisition of Dale Davis, who had been released by the New Orleans Hornets after being traded there by the Golden State Warriors. He played the final 25 games of the regular season and every playoff game, contributing a strong presence at center. And Davis' signing coincided with an injury to Jermaine O'Neal that would knock him out for virtually the remainder of the regular season.\nDespite the adversity they had gone through, the Pacers made the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years. In the first round, Indiana defeated the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics, winning game 7 in Boston with a score of 97\u201370, just the third time the Celtics had dropped a game 7 at home. The Pacers then advanced to the second round against the Detroit Pistons, in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference finals. The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the scene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the Pacers' season. After losing game 1, the Pacers won the next two games to take a 2\u20131 lead. However, the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the Pistons and lost the next three games, losing the series 4\u20132. The final game (game 6) was on May 19, 2005; Reggie Miller, in his final NBA game, scored 27 points and received a standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Miller's effort, the Pacers lost, sending Miller into retirement without an NBA Championship in his 18-year career, all with the Pacers. Miller had his No. 31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30, 2006, when the Pacers played the Phoenix Suns.\n2005\u20132012: The Danny Granger era.\nThe team went on to draft Danny Granger 17th overall in the 2005 NBA draft. During the 2005\u201306 season, the Pacers traded Ron Artest to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Peja Stojakovi\u0107. Despite the loss of Reggie Miller, the Artest saga, and many key injuries, the Pacers made the playoffs in 2006 for the 14th time in 15 years. They also were the only road team to win game 1 of a first-round playoff series. However, New Jersey won game 2 to tie the series at 1\u20131, heading back to Indiana. In game 3, Jermaine O'Neal scored 37 points, as the Pacers regained a 2\u20131 series lead. The Nets, however, won games four and five to take a 3\u20132 series lead. In game 6, Anthony Johnson scored 40 points, but the Pacers' season came to an end as the Nets won 96\u201390.\nThe Pacers finished the 2006\u201307 season as one of the worst seasons in team history. The turning point of the season would be an 11-game losing streak that started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and Marquis Daniels, a lack of a solid backup point guard, the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive efforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs for the first time since the 1996\u201397 season.\n2007\u20132010: O'Neal's final season and rebuilding years.\nOn April 10, 2007, the Pacers announced that coach Rick Carlisle had been fired, with the Pacers' first losing record in ten seasons being the main reason for the coach's dismissal. Pacers President Larry Bird noted that Carlisle had the opportunity to return to the Pacers franchise in another role. Later, Carlisle opted to leave and took a broadcasting job with ESPN before returning to coach the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 (where he would win a championship in 2011). On May 31, 2007, Jim O'Brien was named Carlisle's successor. O'Brien made it clear that he intended to take the Pacers back to the playoffs in the 2007\u201308 season, but he did not in his tenure. He also made it known that he favored a more up-tempo, fast-paced style as opposed to Carlisle's slower, more meticulous style of coaching. Many people have taken note that this style, while exciting at times, failed to produce a winning record, and O'Brien's inability to change his style to better suit his talent available has hurt the team.\nDespite missing the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since the 1980s, the 2007\u201308 season displayed many signs of growth in the team, especially towards the end of the season. Off-court legal distraction from Jamaal Tinsley, Marquis Daniels, and Shawne Williams in the middle of the season did not help the Pacers struggles, and injuries to Tinsley and Jermaine O'Neal damaged the Pacers' already weak defense and left almost all point guard duties to recently acquired Travis Diener, who saw minimal minutes on his previous NBA teams. Despite this, and a 36\u201346 record, the Pacers had a very strong finish to the season, which included a desperate attempt to steal the eighth seed from the Atlanta Hawks, and dramatic improvement in forwards Danny Granger and Mike Dunleavy. Both Granger and Dunleavy were involved in the voting for Most Improved Player, with Dunleavy finishing in the top 10. The two were also the first Pacers players to score 1500 points each in a single season since Reggie Miller and Detlef Schrempf did it in the early 1990s.\nIn April of the 2007\u201308 season, Donnie Walsh, Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment CEO &amp; President, left the Indiana Pacers to join the New York Knicks. All of Walsh's basketball-related duties were given to Pacers' President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird. Walsh's business-related roles were given to co-owner Herb Simon and Jim Morris, who was promoted to President of Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment.\nDuring the 2009 off-season, the Pacers traded declining Jermaine O'Neal along with Nathan Jawai to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Roy Hibbert, T. J. Ford, Rasho Nesterovi\u0107 and Maceo Baston. Hibbert would go on to be a two-time all\u2013star for the Pacers and was known as a defensive force with his shot-blocking abilities.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Pacers forward Tyler Hansbrough (drafted in 2009) suffered a season-ending ear injury, and without center Jeff Foster, the Pacers again fell into another season under .500 and missed the playoffs for four years in a row. Despite another disappointing season, the Pacers managed to sweep the waning Detroit Pistons for the first time in five years, and the abysmal New Jersey Nets. The team showed signs of life near the end of the season, winning nearly all of their last 14 games.\nIn May 2010, after completing his rookie season, guard A. J. Price suffered a knee injury during a charity pick-up game that would require surgery. His expected rehabilitation was to last between four and six months, to be back just in time for training camp.\n2010\u20132012: The arrival of Paul George and Danny Granger's final years.\nIn the 2010 NBA draft, the Pacers selected forward/guard Paul George with the 10th overall pick. In the second round, they drafted guard Lance Stephenson, as well as forward Ryan Reid. The draft rights to Reid were traded on draft night to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for the rights to forward/center Magnum Rolle. The Pacers signed George to his rookie contract on July 1, 2010. Stephenson signed a multi-year contract with the team on July 22. Just before training camp, Rolle was signed, along with big man Lance Allred. Both were cut before the regular season began.\nOn August 11, 2010, the Pacers acquired guard Darren Collison and swingman James Posey from the New Orleans Hornets in a four-team, five-player deal. Troy Murphy was dealt to the New Jersey Nets in that trade.\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, the team went 2\u20133 in the first five games. On November 9, in a home game against Denver, the team scored 54 points in the third quarter alone, shooting 20\u201321 in the process, on the way to a 144\u2013113 rout of the Nuggets. Led by Mike Dunleavy's 24 points in the period, the team set a franchise record for most points in a quarter and was only four points short of the all-time NBA record for points in a quarter (58) set in the 1970s.\nOn January 30, 2011, the Pacers relieved Jim O'Brien of his coaching duties and named assistant coach Frank Vogel interim head coach.\nWith a victory over the Washington Wizards on April 6, 2011, the Pacers clinched their first playoff berth since 2006. In the first round, they were defeated by the first seed Chicago Bulls in five games. Despite a lopsided comparison in terms of the two teams' win-loss records, three of the four Pacers' losses were close, losing games 1\u20133 by an average of five points.\nThe Pacers named Vogel their permanent head coach on July 7, 2011. They acquired George Hill from the San Antonio Spurs on draft night. After the lockout, and losing Mike Dunleavy Jr. to free agency, the Pacers signed former two-time All-Star power forward David West to a two-year deal. These new players contributed to the Pacers' record of 21\u201312 at the All-Star break. The Pacers acquired another key piece in Leandro Barbosa from the Toronto Raptors at the trade deadline, mid-season.\nAt the end of the 2011\u201312 season, the team, led in scoring by Danny Granger, clinched the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. They finished with a 42\u201324 record, their best record since their 2003\u201304 season. On May 8, 2012, the Pacers defeated the Orlando Magic 105\u201387 to win their first playoff series since 2005 and would go on to play the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals. On May 15, 2012, they defeated Miami to tie the second-round series at 1\u20131. On May 17, they again beat Miami 94\u201375 to take the series lead 2\u20131. However, despite a hard-fought series between the two, the Heat won game 6 to close the series at 4\u20132.\nThe following season, Granger was sidelined by a knee injury and managed only to play five games. Granger made his return during the 2013\u201314 season; however, he failed to regain his form of the previous seasons. Granger was then traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for wing Evan Turner and forward Lavoy Allen in a swap that took place approximately 30 minutes before the trade deadline.\n2012\u20132017: The Paul George era.\n2012\u20132014: Championship aspirations.\nOn June 26, 2012, general manager David Morway officially resigned. The following day, president of basketball operations, Larry Bird stepped down. Bird and Morway were officially replaced by Donnie Walsh and Kevin Pritchard, respectively. Walsh returned to the organization after spending the previous three seasons in the Knicks' front office. Pritchard was promoted by the Pacers after serving as the team's director of player personnel. In the 2012 NBA draft, the Pacers selected Miles Plumlee with the 26th pick and acquired Orlando Johnson, the 36th pick from the Sacramento Kings. The team also acquired key bench players Ian Mahinmi, Gerald Green, and D. J. Augustin.\nOn April 7, 2013, the Pacers clinched their first Central Division championship since the 2003\u201304 season. They finished the 2012\u201313 season with a 49\u201332 record, the third seed in the Eastern Conference, and beat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. The Pacers then beat the New York Knicks in six games to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2004 to face the defending champs, the Miami Heat. The Pacers lost game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on May 22, 2013, in overtime 103\u2013102. On May 24, 2013, in game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Pacers were victorious by a score of 97\u201393. The game was clinched for Indiana after David West deflected a pass from LeBron James. The team headed home to Indianapolis, where they had been a perfect 6\u20130 in the playoffs. The Heat won game 3 in Indianapolis on May 26, 2013, with contributions from role players Udonis Haslem and Chris Andersen, and won 114\u201396. The Pacers bounced back in game 4 with a strong contribution from Lance Stephenson and won 99\u201392. The Pacers lost game 5 in Miami on May 30 but won game 6 at home on June 1, extending the series to game 7. The Pacers were defeated by Miami 99\u201376.\nOne year after stepping down, Larry Bird returned as president of basketball operations. Donnie Walsh, who was brought back to hold the position for Bird, was named a consultant for the Pacers. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Pacers selected Solomon Hill with the 23rd overall pick. During the 2013 off-season, the Pacers made strengthening their bench a priority, resulting in the acquisitions of point guard C. J. Watson, and forwards Chris Copeland and Luis Scola, the latter being acquired via trade with the Phoenix Suns.\nThe 2013\u201314 season saw the Pacers jump to an explosive first half of a season, as they started the season 33\u20137 thanks to the rise of Paul George and Lance Stephenson. On January 14, 2014, Vogel was named the Eastern Conference head coach for 2014 NBA All-Star Game. Paul George and Roy Hibbert were selected for the All-Star Game. The Pacers signed two-time NBA champion and 2012 All-Star Andrew Bynum for the remainder of the season. However, after the All-Star Break, the Pacers collapsed. After starting the season 40\u201311, the Pacers crashed and stumbled to a 16\u201315 finish, with rumors of fighting in the locker room being a potential cause for the meltdown. Regardless, they managed to hold onto their first seed in the East, finished the season with a 56\u201326 record.\nThe Pacers started off the playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks, defeating them in seven games. The Pacers then defeated Washington in six games in the semifinals, then a rematch with the second-seeded and defending champion Miami in the Eastern Conference finals. The Pacers surprised many critics, taking game 1 in the Eastern Conference finals with a score of 107\u201395. Unfortunately for the Pacers, they ended up losing the next three to the Heat before managing to avoid elimination in game 5 with a close win over the Heat. The game was notable for the infamous incident where Lance Stephenson blew into LeBron James' ear. Despite the win, the Pacers were eliminated in game 6 by the Miami Heat for the third straight year.\n2014\u20132017: George's injury and final seasons.\nOn August 1, 2014, Paul George, who was playing in a Team USA scrimmage in preparation for the FIBA World Cup, suffered a catastrophic open fracture to his right leg (tibia and fibula) while trying to defend James Harden on a fast break. As he tried to defend Harden from advancing to the rim, George's leg caught on the stanchion of the hoop and fractured. He was stretchered off of the court. A day later, George successfully underwent surgery. He was expected to miss the entire 2014\u201315 season. On April 5, 2015, Paul George returned from his injury to play in a game against the Miami Heat. George shot 5-of-12 from the field and tallied two steals, two rebounds, and two assists in a winning effort. He played for fifteen minutes. After failing to reach the 2015 NBA Playoffs, the team departed with core players Roy Hibbert, David West, and Luis Scola. In the 2015 NBA draft, the Pacers selected Myles Turner 11th overall.\nDuring the off-season, the Pacers signed star Monta Ellis as well as role player Jordan Hill, while acquiring Ty Lawson during the season. Paul George fully recovered from his injury and made the 2016 NBA All-Star Game as a starter. The Pacers would go on to lose game 7 in the first round against the Toronto Raptors ending their 2015\u201316 season. Despite the Pacers going 45\u201337 and making the playoffs, on May 5, 2016, Pacers' president Larry Bird announced that head coach Frank Vogel's contract would not be renewed, citing a need for \"a new voice\" to lead the players. Later that month former Seattle SuperSonics and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Nate McMillan was promoted to replace Vogel.\nThe team made several off-season moves, acquiring new starters Jeff Teague and Thaddeus Young, as well as key bench players Al Jefferson and Aaron Brooks. During the season, the Pacers waived Rodney Stuckey in order to sign former fan-favorite Lance Stephenson. The Pacers qualified to play in the 2017 NBA Playoffs with a 42\u201340 record, which earned them the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. However, they were given a quick exit by the defending champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers, who swept them in four games.\n2017\u20132021: The Oladipo and Sabonis era.\nOn June 30, 2017, Paul George was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. The Pacers received heavy criticism for this trade, but it would eventually prove to be the best season of Oladipo's career, with him showing an increase in points, steals, assists, rebounds, free throw percentage, field goal percentage, and three-point percentage, which resulted to winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award. Sabonis also showed an increase in points, rebounds, and assists while leading the Pacers in rebounding during the 2017\u201318 season. Oladipo would be selected as a 2018 NBA All-Star reserve, while Sabonis was selected to represent Team World in the Rising Stars Challenge. Oladipo ended the season leading the NBA in steals per game. The team welcomed back former Pacer Darren Collison as well as newcomers Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 and Cory Joseph. The Pacers ended the season with a 48\u201334 record, which earned them the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. Their record was a six\u2013game improvement from last season with Paul George. The Pacers faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs for the second year in a row. After taking a 2\u20131 series lead, the Pacers fell to the Cavaliers in seven games.\nThe 2018\u201319 season welcomed new players Tyreke Evans, Wesley Matthews, and Doug McDermott. Oladipo would be selected as an All-Star reserve again for the 2019 game. However, while playing against the Toronto Raptors on January 23, 2019, he left the game with a ruptured quad tendon, and he was ruled out for the rest of the season. Regardless, the Pacers again finished the season going 48\u201334 and secured a playoff spot for the fourth consecutive time on March 22, but were swept in the first round of the 2019 playoffs by the Boston Celtics.\nAfter an active 2019 off-season, the Pacers fielded four new starters on opening night. Holdover Myles Turner was joined by reserve\u2013turned\u2013starter Domantas Sabonis, as well as new acquisitions Malcolm Brogdon, T. J. Warren, and Jeremy Lamb, who was slated to become a top reserve once all-star guard Victor Oladipo returned from injury. The Pacers also signed reserves T. J. McConnell and Justin Holiday, with Holiday joining his younger brother Aaron Holiday on the team. The Pacers also saw three players with the name \"T. J.\" take the court in McConnell, Warren, and Leaf. in Following an 0\u20133 start to the season, the Pacers held a 26\u201315 record halfway through the season, ranking them fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Domantas Sabonis averaged a careerbest 18.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 5 assists a game. Subsequently, Sabonis was named an NBA All-Star for the first time in his career. Unfortunately, his season was cut short due to a foot injury and would miss the postseason.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Pacers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. The Pacers would finish the 2019\u201320 regular season with a record of 45\u201328 and headed into the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. On August 12, 2020, the team announced that they had extended Nate McMillan's contract. They then matched up with the fifth seeded Miami Heat where they would go on to lose the first-round series 4\u20130 which subsequently ended their 2019\u201320 season.\nFollowing the loss to the Heat, the Pacers parted ways with head coach Nate McMillan, despite the recent extension. On October 20, 2020, it was announced that former Toronto Raptors assistant coach, Nate Bjorkgren, had signed a multi-year deal to become the next head coach. On January 16, 2021, Victor Oladipo was traded to the Houston Rockets as a part of a four-team deal that sent James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets and Caris LeVert to Indiana. Sabonis would go on to earn his second NBA All-Star appearance during the 2020\u201321 season. The team also signed Oshae Brissett this year. The season would end in the 2021 NBA play-in tournament in a loss to the Washington Wizards. After missing the 2021 NBA Playoffs, and amid reported locker room tension, the Pacers fired Bjorkgren on June 9, 2021.\n2021\u2013present: Return of Rick Carlisle.\nOn June 24, 2021, the Pacers announced that they had reached an agreement with former Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle to become the next head coach following Bjorkgren's departure. Carlisle previously was an assistant coach for the Pacers from 1997 to 2000, and was also the head coach of the Pacers previously from 2003 to 2007. The team also hired former Charlotte Hornets assistant and Indiana-native Ronald Nored as well as former Atlanta Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce to serve as lead assistant to Carlisle. The arrival of Carlisle also brought over Jenny Boucek and Mike Weinar, both formerly serving with the Dallas Mavericks. Boucek served as the first female assistant coach for the Pacers franchise. In the 2021 NBA draft, the Pacers selected Chris Duarte with the 13th pick and traded up for the 22nd pick, Isaiah Jackson. Duarte was selected to the 2022 NBA All-Rookie Second Team.\n2022\u2013present: The Tyrese Haliburton era.\nThe Pacers failed to qualify for the 2022 NBA Playoffs with a record of 25\u201357 in the 2021\u201322 NBA season, which marks the first time the team failed to reach the playoffs for consecutive seasons since 2007\u201310. The 2021\u201322 season also saw fan-favorite Lance Stephenson serve his third stint with the Pacers franchise. During the season, the Pacers traded away core players including Domantas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, and Malcolm Brogdon between seasons. In return, the Pacers notably received multiple first-round draft picks, sharpshooter Buddy Hield, veterans Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson, as well as young stars Tyrese Haliburton, Jalen Smith and Aaron Nesmith, all lottery picks in the 2020 NBA draft.\nThe team would go on to draft Bennedict Mathurin sixth overall in the 2022 NBA draft along with standout second-round pick Andrew Nembhard. Mathurin was the Pacers' highest pick the franchise has owned since selecting Rik Smits second overall in the 1988 NBA draft. On January 31, 2023, both Mathurin and Nembhard were named 2023 NBA Rising Stars. Tyrese Haliburton was also selected to his first ever NBA All-Star Game in 2023 as a reserve guard for the Eastern Conference. Both Tyrese Haliburton and Buddy Hield were selected to participate in the 2023 NBA Three-Point Contest. At the 2023 trade deadline, the team acquired three future second round picks, Jordan Nwora, Serge Ibaka, as well as Indiana-native and former Pacer, George Hill in exchange for the draft rights to Juan Pablo Vaulet. On March 25, against the Atlanta Hawks, Jordan Nwora posted his Pacers season-high 33 points and added six rebounds, scoring 25 of his 33 points in the second quarter, setting the Pacers regular season franchise record for most points in a quarter since tracking began in the 1996\u201397 NBA season. At the conclusion of the season, Bennedict Mathurin passed Chris Duarte for most three-pointers made as a rookie in Pacers franchise history. Additionally, Buddy Hield broke Reggie Miller's record of most three-pointers made in a season in Pacers history. Furthermore, Bennedict Mathurin finished fourth in the 2023 NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting and earned NBA All-Rookie Team honors.\nFollowing a 35\u201347 record in the 2022\u201323 season, the 2023 NBA draft saw the Pacers select Bilal Coulibaly seventh overall. The Washington Wizards selected Jarace Walker with the eighth overall pick and immediately traded him to the Pacers along with two future second-round picks for the draft rights to Bilal Coulibaly. Following several draft-day trades, the Pacers walked away with the eighth pick Jarace Walker, the 26th pick Ben Sheppard, the 47th pick Mojave King, and the 55th pick Isaiah Wong. On July 1, 2023, Jarace Walker signed his rookie contract with the Pacers alongside Ben Sheppard.\nOn July 6, 2023, during NBA free agency, Haliburton officially signed a max contract extension with the Pacers worth up to $260 million over five years. It was also announced that Haliburton would represent the United States men's national team at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The same day, the team announced they had signed Bruce Brown to a two-year, $45 million contract.\nDuring the 2023 off-season, the Pacers made several acquisitions including trading away Chris Duarte to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for two future second-round picks. Oshae Brissett left the Pacers to sign a contract with the Boston Celtics while the team decided against bringing back veteran George Hill but later re-signed James Johnson. In addition, the Pacers acquired Obi Toppin, the eighth overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft, from the New York Knicks in exchange for two future second-round picks. On the Pacers, Toppin joined Jalen Smith, Tyrese Haliburton, Aaron Nesmith, and Jordan Nwora, all selected in the 2020 NBA draft. The same off-season, the team announced they had lost Ronald Nored to an assistant coaching position with the Atlanta Hawks, while simultaneously rehiring former Pacers assistant and Chicago Bulls head coach Jim Boylen to replace Nored, who had been previously serving as a Pacers consultant. The team also hired former Pacer player Shayne Whittington as an assistant to Carlisle. In a surprising move, the Pacers brought back Larry Bird to serve as a consultant, returning to the franchise for the first time since July 2022.\nThe Pacers were particularly successful in the 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament, beating the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks en route to reaching the In-Season Tournament finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, where they lost 123\u2013109.\nOn January 17, 2024, it was reported that the Pacers acquired All-Star forward Pascal Siakam in a three-team deal with the Toronto Raptors and New Orleans Pelicans, where the Pacers gave up Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora, and three future first-round picks for Siakam. On January 25, 2024, Siakam earned his first win as a Pacer in a 134\u2013122 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers, also recording his first triple double of the season. That same day, Haliburton was named an Eastern Conference starting guard for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, which was played in Indianapolis. This marked his second consecutive All-Star selection and his first selection as a starter.\nThe Pacers finished the regular season with a record of 47\u201335, securing the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round they faced the third seed Milwaukee Bucks, who were without star player Giannis Antetokounmpo due to injury. The Pacers won the series 4\u20132, with second star Damian Lillard also missing time for the Bucks. In the conference semifinals, the Pacers faced the second seed New York Knicks. The Knicks had their own injury issues, with starting forward Julius Randle and role-player Bojan Bogdanovic set to miss the series. The Knicks won game 1 after a series of controversial officiating decisions in the final minute, before also winning game 2, in which they lost OG Anunoby to injury. The Pacers responded by winning games 3 and 4 at home, before the teams traded home wins in games 5 and 6. The Pacers won the series with a historic offensive performance in game 7, winning the series 4\u20133. They were then beaten by Boston.\nOn March 27, 2025, the Pacers defeated the Washington Wizards 162\u2013109, breaking their NBA scoring record.\nThe Pacers ended the 2024\u20132025 season as the 4th seed winning 50 games and qualifying for the playoffs. They faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and beat them in 5 games. They entered the second round playing against the 1st seed Cleveland Cavaliers. They beat the Cavaliers in 5 games, advancing to the Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks. They won in 6 games with Tyrese Halliburton hitting a game-tying 2-point shot in Game 1. After hitting the 2-pointer, Haliburton imitated Reggie Miller's iconic choke sign done in the 1994 Eastern conference finals, also against the Knicks. The Pacers got to their 2nd NBA finals in franchise history, where they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. They lost in 7 games, forcing the first Game 7 in the finals since the 2016 NBA Finals.\nHome arenas.\nIndiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum (1967\u20131974).\nThe Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum was home to the Pacers from 1967 to 1974. The Pacers were very successful in their tenure at the Coliseum, winning three ABA Championships. They captured the ABA titles in 1969\u201370, defeating the Los Angeles Stars in six games, in 1971\u201372, defeating the New York Nets in six games, and in the 1972\u201373 season, defeating the Kentucky Colonels in seven games. The team moved to Market Square Arena in 1974. In 1976, the Pacers became a franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA) when the ABA merged with the NBA.\nMarket Square Arena (1974\u20131999).\nMarket Square Arena was home of the Indiana Pacers from 1974 to 1999. The first Pacers basketball game ever held in the arena was a preseason game against the Milwaukee Bucks; attendance was 16,929. The first regular-season ABA game in the arena was held on October 18, 1974, against the San Antonio Spurs; the Pacers lost in double overtime, 129\u2013121 in front of 7,473 fans. The 1974\u201375 season ended for the Pacers with the ABA Finals played in Market Square Arena and Freedom Hall against their archrivals, the Kentucky Colonels. The Colonels defeated the Pacers in that championship series, winning the ABA title in five games. The 1975\u201376 Pacers won their final home ABA game in Market Square Arena with a 109\u201395 victory against the Colonels. (Kentucky won the next game by one point to win the series and advance, ending the Pacers' ABA tenure.) The Pacers continued to play in Market Square Arena after they joined the NBA, with their first game at the arena as an NBA team being a 129\u2013122 overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on October 21, 1976. Michael Jordan's return to the Chicago Bulls after his first retirement took place at Market Square Arena in a loss to the Pacers on March 19, 1995. The final Pacers game to be played in Market Square Arena was a pre-season exhibition game against the Utah Jazz on October 23, 1999.\nConseco, Bankers Life, and Gainbridge Fieldhouse (1999\u2013present).\nThe Indiana Pacers play their home games at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, which opened in 1999. Gainbridge Fieldhouse is located in downtown Indianapolis and is owned and operated by the Capital Improvement Board, City of Indianapolis and its groundbreaking was on July 22, 1997, by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers. Originally known as Conseco Fieldhouse, the arena officially opened on November 6, 1999. The Fieldhouse is considered one of the best arenas in the NBA, being rated the best venue in the NBA according to the Sports Business Journal/Sports Business Daily Reader Survey. The arena was renamed to Bankers Life Fieldhouse on December 22, 2011, after a subsidiary company of Conseco. The arena adopted its current name on September 27, 2021, being sponsored by Indianapolis-based financial platform Gainbridge. It presently seats 18,165 for basketball games, down from the original 18,345 due to removal of bleacher seats at the south end in favor of adding a premium club area known as Legends. Gainbridge Fieldhouse is also the home of the Indiana Fever of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), who are also owned by Herb Simon via Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment (PS&amp;E).\nIt hosted the Big Ten men's basketball tournament in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008\u20132012, 2014, 2016, 2022, and 2025. Gainbridge has been the home to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2017, 2021, 2022, and 2024. Previously, the men's tournament was held at Market Square Arena in 1978 and 1982. Furthermore, the stadium hosted the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament in 2011, 2016, and 2028. The Fieldhouse also hosted the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend. It hosts concerts and philanthropic events as well.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Indiana Pacers colors are (navy) blue, yellow (gold), cool gray and white. The original team colors of blue and yellow, using a more medium shade of blue, came from the flag of Indiana.\nABA years.\nThe Pacers wear blue and white uniforms with yellow trim. Their initial uniforms featured either the state or team name in block letters, with some changes in striping. The shorts initially featured contrasting side stripes with the team name written inside, before simplifying altogether. The \"P\" logo would debut on the white uniform in the 1970\u201371 season.\nAhead of the 1971\u201372 season, the Pacers debuted their \"double stripes\" uniform, featuring said stripes running through the right side. The \"P\" logo then occupied the left leg. This uniform would be worn during two of their three ABA championship seasons. In 1974, the stripes were modified, and both the team and state name was changed to a script lettering design.\n1976\u20131990.\nThe Pacers reverted to a simpler look reminiscent of their early ABA years upon moving to the NBA in 1976, this time extending the side stripes through the uniform. After one season, the white uniform was tweaked, incorporating the \"P\" logo to the \"PACERS\" wordmark. Slight changes were made in the early 1980s, with both the white and blue uniform incorporating the team logo on the left leg and changing the typeface on the state and team name. The white uniform was then replaced with a gold uniform in 1983, featuring the state name.\nIn 1985, the Pacers radically changed their uniform, featuring a contrasting stripe on the chest and incorporating a \"streaking bullet\" stripe across the \"PACERS\" wordmark. Initially, the numbers were located on the left chest and right leg, but was changed the following year, with the numbers now centered and the team logo replacing the shorts number. This would be the first uniform that Reggie Miller wore upon joining the Pacers.\n1990\u20131997: FloJos.\nMidway through the 1989\u201390 season, the Pacers introduced a new uniform that would debut the following season. Designed by track and field star Florence Griffith Joyner, the uniform featured a darker navy blue and deeper yellow palette, and incorporated a Helvetica-like typeface with drop shadows. The contrasting side stripes on the right taper towards the top of the uniform. The logo itself removed the outstretched hand and added some lines towards the yellow basketball to signify motion. This look became synonymous with the Pacers' mid-1990s success, which included two Conference Finals appearances and a budding rivalry with the New York Knicks.\n1997\u20132005: Pinstripes.\nThe arrival of Larry Bird in 1997 brought a new look to the Pacers. Block letters returned as were the contrasting side stripes. For the first time, the uniform incorporated pinstripes, a design feature that was used by a few NBA teams during the 1990s. In the 1998\u201399 season, a yellow alternate uniform was added. All three uniforms used the state name on the chest. This design would be worn by the Pacers during their first NBA Finals appearance in 2000.\n2005\u20132017: Post-Miller era.\nOn September 29, 2005, the Indiana Pacers unveiled then-new uniforms, coinciding with a new era following the retirement of Reggie Miller. This design eliminated the pinstripes and incorporated thinner stripes across the uniform. The team name returned on the white uniform, which also added bolder yellow accents on each side. Silver was also added to both the logo and uniforms. Updated typefaces were introduced, and an alternate roundel logo featuring the full team name in a yellow circle with navy blue and silver borders surrounding the \"P\" logo also debuted. The roundel logo would make its way to the uniforms. A gold alternate uniform was added ahead of the 2008\u201309 season. The uniform would become synonymous with Paul George, as he wore this set throughout his Pacers career, including two Conference Finals appearances.\nHoosiers uniform.\nOn July 21, 2015, the Indiana Pacers, in collaboration with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios, unveiled a new uniform based on the 1986 motion picture \"Hoosiers\". The Pacers wore these maroon and gold \"Hickory\" (the name and colors of the fictional High School from the film) uniforms for several home games and a few select road contests during the 2015\u201316 season. It is the first time a major North American pro sports team wore a uniform based on a film.\n2017\u2013present: Nike era.\nThe Indiana Pacers unveiled new uniforms and logos to coincide with the NBA's uniform contract with Nike on July 28, 2017. The roundel logo, which had been the alternate since 2005, was promoted to a \"Global\" logo. Initially, the white \"Association\", navy blue \"Icon\" and yellow \"Statement\" uniforms mirrored each other, with the full team name encircling the uniform number and subtle pinstripes added on each side. However, ahead of the 2019\u201320 season, the Pacers released an updated \"Statement\" uniform, which was a nod to the FloJo design from 1990 to 1997. The right side incorporated subtle silver pinstripes as a nod to Indiana's farmlands, while the state name was emblazoned on the chest. This \"Statement\" uniform was worn during their second NBA Finals appearance in 2025.\n\"City\" and \"Earned\" uniforms.\nA fourth uniform set, the \"City\" uniform, was also part of Nike's contract with the NBA. The Pacers' first \"City\" uniform is in navy blue with subtle yellow racing flag stripes on the left side. A vertical orientation of the state name was emblazoned within the yellow stripe and yellow numbers were encircled in a nod to IndyCar racing history. A white and navy blue version of the uniform served as its \"City\" uniform in the 2019\u201320 season.\nThe 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform was loosely based on the 1990s FloJos design and was also inspired by Indiana's racing history. It featured a gray base with an italicized \"PACERS\" wordmark in yellow trimmed in navy blue. A tapered navy blue stripe with yellow pinstripes was hugely inspired by a similar motif that defined the FloJo uniforms. A white version served as its \"Earned\" uniform that season as a reward for making the NBA playoffs the previous year.\nFor the Pacers' 2020\u201321 \"City\" uniform, they revived the original royal blue and yellow shade worn in their ABA years while incorporating pinstripes as a nod to the early 2000s teams. This design with a yellow base and navy blue pinstripes was used as its \"Earned\" uniform that season.\nThe following season, the Pacers wore a \"mix-tape\" version of the \"City\" uniform in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary. The design featured subtle nods to the franchise's history, from the \"streaking bullet\" stripe of the late 1980s to the 1990s FloJos striping, as well as a reimagined version of the classic Pacers logo which merged the current gold ball with the outstretched arm of the original logo. This design was reused in the 2025\u201326 season, but recolored to a white base and the original shades of royal blue and yellow.\nThe \"City\" uniform in the 2022\u201323 season honored the team's current home of Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Black was featured heavily on the uniform, with the only blue elements seen on the top. Subtle yellow stripes separate the blue and black bases.\nThe Pacers' \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season featured a black base with light blue and yellow accents, incorporating a graffiti-style \"INDY\" wordmark across the chest. This uniform was a nod to Indiana's art scene. A white version was worn as their \"City\" uniform the following season.\nRivalries.\nDetroit Pistons.\nThe Pacers and Pistons met for the first time in the 1990 Playoffs; the Pistons swept the Pacers in three straight games on their way to their second straight NBA championship. But the rivalry truly began in the 2000s, specifically during the 2003\u201304 season. The Pacers finished with a league-best 61 wins and were led by Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Reggie Miller, and coached by Rick Carlisle. Carlisle had been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, and Richard Hamilton, and coached by former Pacers head coach Larry Brown. Indiana won the first three matchups in the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit.\nThey met in the 2004 Eastern Conference finals. Indiana narrowly won game 1, thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed, unimpressed, stated \"they will not win game 2\" during an interview before the second game (locally known as the \"Guaran-Sheed\" victory). Late in game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4\u20132, and went on to win the NBA title.\nOn November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, what has become known as the Malice at the Palace took place. Nine players were suspended for varying lengths after a violent altercation in the stands. Artest received the longest penalty: the remainder of the season.\nThat year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the Eastern Conference semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers blew an 18-point lead, but still won game 3 in Indianapolis. However, just as he did a year earlier, Rasheed promised a win in game 4 saying, \"When we return, we will be tied at two\". The Pistons won games 4 and 5. The Pacers, knowing a loss would lead to Miller's retirement, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons 88\u201379.\nNew York Knicks.\nThe Knicks\u2013Pacers Rivalry has been heavily documented since 1977. During the 1990s, the Knicks and Pacers were perennial playoff teams. They met in the playoffs six times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. The rivalry was likened by Miller to the Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud, and described by \"The New York Times\", in 1998 as being \"as combustible as any in the league\". During those years, the Pacers were led by a core of Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Mark Jackson, Jalen Rose, Chris Mullin, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis, Derrick McKey, Detlef Schrempf, and others. On the other hand, the Knicks consistently built teams around Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Charles Oakley, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson, Latrell Sprewell, as well as former Pacer legend Herb Williams.\nThe Knicks and Pacers next met in the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals with the Pacers upsetting the New York Knicks 4\u20132. This series included Pacers All\u2013Star Paul George, David West, Roy Hibbert, George Hill, Lance Stephenson, Tyler Hansbrough, Gerald Green, Ian Mahinmi, and D. J. Augustin. The Knicks consisted of All-Star Carmelo Anthony, J. R. Smith, Raymond Felton, Tyson Chandler, Jason Kidd, Iman Shumpert, Rasheed Wallace, Kenyon Martin, and Marcus Camby. The Pacers battled without All-Star forward Danny Granger as he sustained a season-ending injury, while Knicks All-Star big-man Amar'e Stoudemire also experienced limited playing-time due to injury. Following the season, Chris Copeland left the Knicks to sign with the Pacers.\nThe Knicks and Pacers would again meet in the 2024 Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pacers were now led by All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, joined by Myles Turner, Pascal Siakam, Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard in the starting lineup. The \"Nova Knicks\" in turn were led by their own All-Star point guard, Jalen Brunson, while other key players included Julius Randle, OG Anunoby, Mitchell Robinson, Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart. Despite Randle missing the series due to injury, the Knicks jumped out to a series lead after winning game 1 at home, via a series of controversial officiating decisions in the final minute, before also winning game 2, in which they lost Anunoby to injury. The Pacers responded by winning games 3 and 4 at home, before the teams traded home wins in games 5 and 6. The Pacers won the series with a historic offensive performance in game 7, winning the series 4\u20133.\nMiami Heat.\nThe two franchises first met in the 2004 NBA playoffs, when Indiana won 4\u20132 in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Indiana was seen as title contenders, having the first seed in the Eastern Conference, and the best record in the league, led by Reggie Miller, Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest, and Al Harrington. The Heat were led by rookie Dwyane Wade, Lamar Odom, Eddie Jones, and Caron Butler, with this being Wade's first ever playoff experience. The Pacers would go on to lose in six games in the Eastern Conference finals to the eventual 2004 NBA champion Detroit Pistons. Following the 2003\u201304 NBA season, and before meeting again in 2012, Indiana remained competitive in the Eastern Conference, while Miami would win their first ever championship in 2006 after acquiring Shaquille O'Neal.\nA true rivalry with the Miami Heat was triggered in the Eastern Conference semifinals of the 2012 NBA playoffs. During the series, both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: Frank Vogel accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while Erik Spoelstra took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate \"head-hunting\" of his players on the part of the Pacers. In 2012, Indiana took a 2\u20131 lead after Miami's Chris Bosh was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4\u20132 and later become 2012 NBA Champions. The series was marked by several suspensions, flagrant fouls, and confrontations between the players: Tyler Hansbrough's flagrant foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem's retaliatory flagrant foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem's game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with Darren Collison in transition, Juwan Howard confronting Lance Stephenson over the latter's flashing of the choke sign to James, and Dexter Pittman elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana's Danny Granger received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in game 2, while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James' jersey in game 3, while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in game 4 after the latter was fouled by Roy Hibbert.\nThe following season saw improvements for both teams, from Miami's acquisitions of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen, to the emergence of Paul George and Lance Stephenson in the absence of Danny Granger due to a season-ending injury. Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of game 6 in the conference semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks, the Pacers' fans were chanting \"Beat The Heat\" as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the conference finals of the 2013 NBA playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West. Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1\u20131 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It was the first time the Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4\u20133, with a 99\u201376 win in game 7, eventually becoming 2013 NBA champions.\nIn the 2014 NBA playoffs, the Pacers and Heat renewed their rivalry in a second consecutive Eastern Conference finals match up. Indiana entered the series with home court advantage, having earned the first seed in the Eastern Conference, with a 56\u201326 record during the 2013\u201314 season. Indiana's core players from this series included Paul George, David West, Lance Stephenson, George Hill, Roy Hibbert, and new acquisitions, Evan Turner, Luis Scola, and Andrew Bynum. Likewise, Miami's key players again consisted of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Mario Chalmers, as well as newcomers Greg Oden and Michael Beasley. Even though the Pacers were viewed as legitimate title contenders, Miami eliminated Indiana again, this time in six games.\nIn 2023, the last players active on either team was Udonis Haslem on the Heat and George Hill on the Pacers, who both competed in all three 2012, 2013, and 2014 playoff series.\nIndiana and Miami would meet again for the first time since 2014 in the 2020 NBA playoffs with the Heat sweeping the Pacers in the first round. Indiana was led by Victor Oladipo, Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. Warren and Myles Turner. The Heat were led by Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Goran Dragi\u0107, and Tyler Herro, who ended up reaching the 2020 NBA Finals. Indiana sustained significant injuries preventing All-Star Domantas Sabonis and Jeremy Lamb from playing in the 2020 NBA Bubble.\nMilwaukee Bucks.\nWhile the franchises have been divisional rivals since 1976 (originally as part of the Midwest Division, though both have since moved to the Central Division), it is only in recent years that the matchup has been described as a true rivalry. On December 7, 2023, the two teams met in Las Vegas, Nevada during the semifinals of that season's inaugural In-Season Tournament. While the Bucks led for most of the game, the Pacers staged a comeback in the fourth quarter, culminating in Tyrese Haliburton hitting a game-winning stepback 3-pointer over Bucks center Brook Lopez. Haliburton then tapped his wrist, mimicking Bucks guard Damian Lillard's iconic \"Dame Time\" celebration. The loss resulted in Bobby Portis later calling out former Bucks coach Adrian Griffin in the locker room, as well as his other teammates.\nAlmost a week later, on December 13, the teams met at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, wherein Bucks franchise superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a career-high 64 points. In the same game, Pacers rookie Oscar Tshiebwe scored his first career points, resulting in both teams wanting the official game ball to give to their players. At the end of the game, both teams had a basketball, but confusion arose towards who had the game ball; believing that the Pacers had it, multiple Bucks players entered the Pacers' tunnel to retrieve it, leading to a verbal altercation between Antetokounmpo and Haliburton. Footage later showed a member of Bucks' security receiving a ball from the officials towards the end of the game, however it is not known if it was the game ball or an alternate, with Antetokounmpo later stating he did not believe it to be the game ball. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle also alleged a member of the Bucks of elbowing general manager Chad Buchanan in the ribs, though this was not confirmed and multiple Bucks players chose not to comment on it.\nThe matchup intensified during the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs, where the 3rd-seed Bucks had home-court advantage over the 6th-seed Pacers. The Pacers' core players included Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, Myles Turner, Benedict Mathurin, and Andrew Nembhard. The Bucks' core included Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, and Bobby Portis. The Bucks dealt with injury trouble throughout the series, with Antetokounmpo not playing the entire series and Lillard missing games 4 and 5. Despite missing key contributors, the Bucks were able to remain competitive, though in the end the Pacers won the series 4\u20132.\nThe two teams met again in the first round of the 2025 NBA Playoffs, featuring an almost identical core from the Pacers, whereas the Bucks had traded Middleton for Kyle Kuzma at the trade deadline and added Gary Trent Jr. in free agency. The Pacers had earned the 4th-seed and home-court advantage after going 50\u201332 in the regular season, whereas the Bucks owned the 5th-seed with a 48\u201334 record. While Antetokoumpo was healthy and played every game of the series, Lillard missed game 1, playing in games 2, 3, and 4 before tearing his achilles tendon in the latter game, ending his season. The Pacers would win the series 4\u20131 in game 5, following a comeback win from the Pacers and a game-winning basket from Tyrese Haliburton. When the game concluded, Antetokounmpo was involved in a scuffle with Benedict Mathurin, and later a verbal altercation with Haliburton's father, John. John Haliburton would later be barred from attending Pacers games for most of their playoff run. The Pacers would go on to make it to that year's NBA Finals, but lost the Oklahoma City Thunder in 7 games, wherein Tyrese Haliburton would tear his achilles tendon in the final game of the series. That offseason began with a shocking move where Pacers center Myles Turner, who was the team's longest tenured player (having been with the team since 2015) signed with the Bucks, who had lost veteran center Brook Lopez to the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency. Pacers executives later stated they had been willing to enter the luxury tax to keep Turner, but had not had the chance to match Milwaukee's offer.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Pacers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Indiana Pacers seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Pacers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nHead coaches.\nThere have been 13 head coaches for the Pacers franchise. Larry Staverman was the first coach of the team in 1967, when the team was in the ABA. Coach Bobby Leonard has the most wins in franchise history, with 529 in his 12 seasons with the team. After Leonard, Jack McKinney, George Irvine, and Jack Ramsay. When Ramsay abruptly resigned in 1988 after the team got off to a weak start, Pacers legend Mel Daniels took over on an interim basis for two games, before Irvine returned for 20 more. Dick Versace then led the Pacers through another sub-par stretch before Bob Hill got the Pacers back to the playoffs and into contention. Then in 1993, Larry Brown joined the Pacers franchise and led the team to many playoff appearances as Reggie Miller blossomed into a superstar and eventual Hall of Famer. Larry Bird took over the team in 1997 and coached until 2000. Bird took the Pacers to their first NBA Finals appearance in the 1999\u20132000 season. Isiah Thomas, Rick Carlisle, and Jim O'Brien were next up as the Pacers top coach. The most recent head coach of the Pacers was Frank Vogel, until May 5, 2016, when his contract was not renewed after the seventh-seeded Pacers lost game 7 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs to the number two seeded Toronto Raptors. Subsequently, associate head coach Nate McMillan was promoted to the top spot. After four seasons in which he compiled a 183\u2013136 record, McMillan and the team parted ways on August 26, 2020, just two weeks after it had been announced that the team had re-signed him. On October 20, 2020, the team hired former Toronto Raptors assistant coach Nate Bjorkgren as their new head coach. Bjorkgren would lead the Pacers to a 34\u201338 record in his lone season and the team missed the playoffs. On June 24, 2021, the Pacers re-hired Rick Carlisle for a second stint as the team's head coach.\nFranchise records and individual awards.\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with team.\n\"Italic\" denotes still active but not with team.\nPoints scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNBA individual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNBA Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player\nNBA Defensive Player of the Year\nNBA Rookie of the Year\nNBA Sixth Man of the Year\nNBA Most Improved Player of the Year\nNBA Coach of the Year\nNBA Executive of the Year\nAll-NBA Second Team\nAll-NBA Third Team\nNBA All-Defensive First Team\nNBA All-Defensive Second Team\nMagic Johnson Award\nJ.

{"id": "72877", "revid": "1934512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72877", "title": "Odometer", "text": "Instrument used for measuring the distance traveled by a vehicle\nAn odometer or odograph is an instrument used for measuring the distance traveled by a vehicle, such as a bicycle or car. The device may be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two (electromechanical). The noun derives from ancient Greek , \"hod\u00f3metron\", from , \"hod\u00f3s\" ('path' or 'gateway') and , \"m\u00e9tron\" ('measure'). Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient Greco-Roman world as well as in ancient China. In countries using Imperial units or US customary units it is sometimes called a mileometer or milometer, the former name especially being prevalent in the United Kingdom and among members of the Commonwealth.\nHistory.\nClassical Era.\nPossibly the first evidence for the use of an odometer can be found in the works of the ancient Roman Pliny (NH 6. 61-62) and the ancient Greek Strabo (11.8.9). Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by Alexander the Great (r. 336-323 BC) as by his bematists Diognetus and Baeton. However, the high accuracy of the bematists's measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device. For example, the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion, which later became a part of the Silk Road, was given by Alexander's bematists as 575 Roman miles (529 English miles) long, that is with a deviation of 0.2% from the actual distance (531 English miles). From the nine surviving bematists' measurements in Pliny's \"Naturalis Historia\" eight show a deviation of less than 5% from the actual distance, three of them being within 1%. Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last 2300 years, the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances, although there is no direct mention of such a device.\nAn odometer for measuring distance was first described by Vitruvius during the 1st century BC. According to Andr\u00e9 Wegener Sleeswyk, the actual inventor may have been Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC \u2013 c.\u2009212\u00a0BC). However, this mention is unjustified and nothing concerns the odometer in the preserved treatises of Archimedes. Hero of Alexandria (10 AD \u2013 70 AD) describes a similar device in chapter 34 of his \"Dioptra\". The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor Commodus (c.\u2009192\u00a0AD), although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the 15th century in Western Europe. Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek Antikythera mechanism.\nThe odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of 4 Roman feet (1.18 m) diameter turning 400 times in one Roman mile (about 1,480\u00a0m). For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400-tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (\"calculus\") were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles. Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. Leonardo da Vinci later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed. However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of Leonardo with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the \"Antikythera mechanism\". With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.\nImperial China.\nHan dynasty and Three Kingdoms period.\nThe odometer was also independently invented in ancient China, possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist Zhang Heng (78 AD \u2013 139 AD) of the Han dynasty. By the 3rd century (during the Three Kingdoms Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'j\u00ec l\u012d g\u016d ch\u0113' (\u8a18\u91cc\u9f13\u8eca), or 'li-recording drum carriage' (Note: the modern measurement of li = ). Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm.\nDespite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later Ma Jun (c. 200\u2013265), there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han dynasty China that centered around the \"huang men\" court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) that would follow the musical procession of the royal 'drum-chariot'. The historian Joseph Needham asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device, since there is already other evidence of their craftsmanship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court. There is speculation that some time in the 1st century BC (during the Western Han dynasty), the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically-driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road-wheels. This might have actually been the design of one Luoxia Hong (c.\u2009110\u00a0BC), yet by 125 AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known (depicted in a mural of the Xiaotangshan Tomb).\nThe odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history. In the historical text of the \"Jin Shu\" (635 AD), the oldest part of the compiled text, the book known as the \"Cui Bao\" (c.\u2009300\u00a0AD), recorded the use of the odometer, providing description (attributing it to the Western Han era, from 202 BC\u20139 AD). The passage in the \"Jin Shu\" expanded upon this, explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the south-pointing chariot invented by Ma Jun (200\u2013265, see also differential gear). As recorded in the \"Song Shi\" of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), the odometer and south-pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the 9th century, 11th century, and 12th century. The \"Sunzi Suanjing\" (Master Sun's Mathematical Manual), dated from the 3rd century to 5th century, presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer. It involved a given distance between two cities, the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage's wheel, and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B.\nSong dynasty.\nThe historical text of the \"Song Shi\" (1345 AD), recording the people and events of the Chinese Song dynasty (960\u20131279), also mentioned the odometer used in that period. However, unlike written sources of earlier periods, it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form (Wade-Giles spelling):\nThe odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung-Hsi reign-period (987 AD) the emperor Thai Tsung increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (1027 AD) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows:\nWhat follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:\nThe vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels. On the body are two storeys, each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick. The road-wheels are each 6 ft in diameter, and 18 ft in circumference, one evolution covering 3 paces. According to ancient standards the pace was equal to 6 ft and 300 paces to a li; but now the li is reckoned as 360 paces of 5 ft each.\n[Note: the measurement of the Chinese-mile unit, the li, was changed over time, as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times.]\nThe vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) 2.3 inches apart. There is also a lower horizontal wheel (hsia phing lun), of diameter 4.14 ft and circumference 12.42 ft, with 54 cogs, the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel (2.3 inches). (This engages with the former.)\nUpon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel, there is fixed a bronze \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (hsuan feng lun) which has (only) 3 cogs, the distance between these being 1.2 inches. (This turns the following one.) In the middle is a horizontal wheel, 4 ft in diameter, and 12 ft circumference, with 100 cogs, the distance between these cogs being the same as on the \"turning-like-the-wind wheel\" (1.2 inches).\nNext, there is fixed (on the same shaft) a small horizontal wheel (hsiao phing lun) 3.3 inches in diameter and 1 ft in circumference, having 10 cogs 1.5 inches apart. (Engaging with this) there is an upper horizontal wheel (shang phing lun) having a diameter of 3.3 ft and a circumference of 10 ft, with 100 cogs, the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel (1.5 inches).\nWhen the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the \"dog-teeth\" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point (ti hsiang kou so, chhuan ya hsiang chih, chou erh fu shih).\nSubsequent developments.\nOdometers were first developed in the 1600s for wagons and other horse-drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled.\nAbramo Colorni (d. 1599) illustrated a carriage with odometer in his \"Euthimetria\", a treatise on engineering.\nLevinus Hulsius published the odometer in 1604 in his work \"Gr\u00fcndtliche Beschreibung de\u00df Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn Instruments Viatorii oder Wegz\u00e4hlers, So zu Fu\u00df, zu Pferdt unnd zu Fu\u00dfen gebraucht werden kann, damit mit geringer m\u00fche zu wissen, wie weit man gegangen, geritten, oder gefahren sey: als auch zu erfahren, ohne messen oder zehlen, wie weit von einem Orth zum andern. Daneben wird auch der grosse verborgene Wegweiser angezeiget und vermeldet\".\nIn 1645, the French mathematician Blaise Pascal invented the \"pascaline\". Though not an odometer, the \"pascaline\" utilized gears to compute measurements. Each gear contained 10 teeth. The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution, the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers.\nOdometers were developed for ships in 1698 with the odometer invented by the Englishman Thomas Savery. Benjamin Franklin, U.S. statesman and the first Postmaster General, built a prototype odometer in 1775 that he attached to his carriage to help measure the mileage of postal routes. In 1847, William Clayton and Orson Pratt, pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, first implemented the \"Roadometer\" they had invented earlier (a version of the modern odometer), which they attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west. It recorded the distance traveled each day by the wagon trains. The \"Roadometer\" used two gears and was an early example of an odometer with pascaline-style gears in actual use.\nIn 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the \"Cyclometer\". The \"Cyclometer\" was a mechanical device that counted the number of rotations of a bicycle wheel. A flexible cable transmitted the number of rotations of the wheel to an analog odometer visible to the rider, which converted the wheel rotations into the number of miles traveled according to a predetermined formula.\nIn 1903 Arthur P. and Charles H. Warner, two brothers from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented \"Auto-meter\". The \"Auto-Meter\" used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk. Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument. The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart &amp; Clark Company of Chicago. The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.\nBy the early 2000s, mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers. The Pontiac Grand Prix was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in 2003; the Canadian-built Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis were the last Fords sold with one in 2005. \nTrip meters.\nMost modern cars include a trip meter (trip odometer). Unlike the odometer, a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey, making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Many modern vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most mechanical trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.\nClocking/busting miles and legality.\nA form of fraud is to tamper with the reading on an odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles/kilometres traveled to a prospective buyer; this is often referred to as \"clocking\" in the UK and \"busting miles\" in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most new cars sold today use digital odometers that store the mileage in the vehicle's engine control unit, making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical odometers, the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a concept which provides the premise for a classic scene in the comedy film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.\nThe resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer, yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners. Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit odometer fraud. In the US (and many other countries), vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced or inspected. Companies such as Carfax then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred.\nPrevalence.\nResearch by Irish vehicle check specialist Cartell found that 20% of vehicles imported to Ireland from Great Britain and Northern Ireland had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage.\nAccuracy.\nMost odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times pi (3.141592). If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer. The formula is formula_1. It is common for odometers to be off by several percent. Odometer errors are typically proportional to speedometer errors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72878", "revid": "6702527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72878", "title": "Milwaukee Bucks", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are an American professional basketball team based in Milwaukee. The Bucks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team was founded in 1968 as an expansion team, and play home games at Fiserv Forum. Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, but on April 16, 2014, a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wes Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors one month later on May 16. The team is managed by Jon Horst, the team's former director of basketball operations, who took over for John Hammond.\nThe Bucks have won two league championships (1971, 2021), three conference titles (Western: 1971, 1974, Eastern: 2021), 19 division titles (1971\u20131974, 1976, 1980\u20131986, 2001, 2019\u20132024), and the 2024 NBA Cup. They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Sidney Moncrief, Bob Lanier, Terry Cummings, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Michael Redd, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Damian Lillard among others. Abdul-Jabbar and Antetokounmpo have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Bucks, for a total of five MVP awards. They both are also the only players to win Finals MVP for the franchise. The Bucks are the only NBA team to have won a championship in both the Eastern and Western Conference.\nHistory.\n1968\u20131969: Team creation.\nOn January 22, 1968, the NBA awarded a franchise to Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc. (Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman. A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating. While the most-voted fan entry was the \"Robins\", named for Wisconsin's state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the \"Bucks\", which was a reference to Wisconsin's official wild animal, the white-tailed deer. One fan, R. D. Trebilcox, was awarded a new car for his part in reasoning why the Bucks was a good nickname, saying that bucks were \"spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile.\" The Bucks marked a return of the NBA to Milwaukee after 13 years; their previous team, the Hawks, played for four seasons in the early 1950s before moving to St. Louis in 1955 (they are now based in Atlanta). In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls before a Milwaukee Arena crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season (1968\u201369) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 134\u2013118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. That year, the Bucks' record earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the Phoenix Suns, to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be Lew Alcindor of UCLA. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the New York Nets of the upstart American Basketball Association (ABA) to secure him.\n1969\u20131975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era.\nWith the addition of Alcindor, the Bucks finished with a 56\u201326 record in 1969\u201370, second-best in the league behind the New York Knicks. Not only was this a near-reversal of their inaugural season, but the 29-game improvement was the best in league history \u2013 a record which would stand for ten years until the Boston Celtics jumped from 29 wins in 1978\u201379 to 61 in 1979\u201380. The Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for NBA Rookie of the Year.\nThe following season, the Bucks traded for Cincinnati Royals guard Oscar Robertson to complement Alcindor. Subsequently, the Bucks, now in the Western Conference, finished 66\u201316, the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still a franchise record. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record 20-game win streak. Posting a 12\u20132 record in the playoffs, they won their first NBA championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games. By winning the championship in only their third season, the Bucks became one of the fastest true expansion teams in North American professional sports history to win a league championship.\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, Alcindor, who had already privately converted to Islam and changed his name, publicly announced his name change to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Bucks reached the division/conference finals for the third year in a row, but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. In 1973, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so, but injuries resulted in an early playoff exit. The Bucks were back in the 1974 NBA Finals against the Celtics. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \"sky hook\" shot in a classic double-overtime victory. However, the Bucks then lost in game seven, and did not return to the NBA Finals until 2021.\nAs the 1974\u20131975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the Bucks got off to a 3\u201313 start. After his return, other injuries befell the team, sending them to the bottom of their division with a 38\u201344 record. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks and wanted to play in a larger market, either Los Angeles or New York. After the front office was unable to convince him to stay, the Bucks obliged Abdul-Jabbar's request by trading him to the Lakers on June 16, 1975, for Elmore Smith, Junior Bridgeman, Brian Winters, and David Meyers. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Minority owner and cable television executive Jim Fitzgerald opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock.\n1976\u20131979: Post-Abdul-Jabbar era; \"Green 'n Growing\".\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with Don Nelson who became head coach in November 1976 after Larry Costello abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted Kent Benson, Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process. Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a martial arts blackbelt, snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the Detroit Pistons in 1980 for veteran center Bob Lanier to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the Midwest Division title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the Eastern Conference's Central Division.\n1979\u20131990: The Sidney Moncrief era.\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Marques Johnson, Paul Pressey, Junior Bridgeman and the arrival of Craig Hodges, Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time.\nFor much of the 1970s, the Bucks' colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in 1983 they became the first, and until 2003, only team in NBA history to sweep the Boston Celtics in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat Michael Jordan in a playoff series (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting Julius Erving's final NBA game in the 1987 NBA playoffs, which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\nOwnership and arena changes.\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of Sportsvue, a pioneering regional sports network\u2013a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable. By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S. Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit, announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to Michael Jordan and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\nOn May 21, 2012, the naming rights of the Bradley Center were sold to BMO Harris Bank, a division of Bank of Montreal. BMO Harris had merged with Milwaukee-based M&amp;I Bank a year earlier. After the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed the \"BMO Harris Bradley Center\".\n1990\u20131998: The period of struggles.\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen, Mike Dunleavy, and Chris Ford. They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft-day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s. At the 1998 NBA draft, the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years. At the draft, the Bucks selected Dirk Nowitzki with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Robert Traylor. Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in 2011 while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007. Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward Vin Baker in a three-team trade to the Seattle SuperSonics, and they would acquire Cleveland Cavaliers guard Terrell Brandon and forward Tyrone Hill. They also traded their 10th overall pick Danny Fortson, guard Johnny Newman, and center Joe Wolf to the Denver Nuggets for center Ervin Johnson. The 1997\u201398 Bucks finished their season with a 36\u201346 record, failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\n1998\u20132003: The Big Three era; \"Light It Up\".\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl, who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld, and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell, the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \"big three\"\u2014consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinson\u2014along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000\u20132001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers. This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \"Light It Up\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\nAfter coming within one game of an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward Anthony Mason at the beginning of the 2001\u201302 season. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role. The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, went into a swoon in February and March. The collapse culminated with a loss to the Detroit Pistons on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between Karl and the players, resulting in a trade of Glenn Robinson to Atlanta (for Toni Kuko\u010d and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select T. J. Ford).\nDuring the 2002\u201303 season, the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \"Flip\" Murray to the Seattle SuperSonics for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason. The trade allowed emerging star Michael Redd to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42\u201340 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the New Jersey Nets in six games. That offseason, team leaders Sam Cassell and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for Joe Smith). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\n2003\u20132009: The Michael Redd era.\nUnder the direction of new general manager Larry Harris, the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006. In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games. During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise\". The Bucks received the first pick in the 2005 NBA draft, and used it to select center Andrew Bogut. Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\nIn 2006, the team finished 40\u201342, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64\u201318 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4\u20131 series loss.\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager Larry Harris's contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager, giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that Larry Krystkowiak, the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. Scott Skiles, formerly of the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns, became head coach.\nOn June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired Richard Jefferson from the New Jersey Nets in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons. Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's Joe Alexander with the eighth pick of the NBA draft. Alexander was the first Taiwanese-born player in the NBA.\n2009\u20132013: The Brandon Jennings era.\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings, who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager John Hammond traded Hakim Warrick to the Chicago Bulls, and acquired John Salmons. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved Ersan \u0130lyasova, and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years. In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the Chicago Bulls.\nIt was during that time that the phrase \"Fear the Deer\" was coined, most likely by ESPN commentator John Anderson. It was quickly adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6. The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since 2001. The Bucks' short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and Stephen Jackson and head coach Scott Skiles not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh, and Kwame Brown.\nBefore the 2012 NBA draft, the Bucks sent a first-round pick, Shaun Livingston, Jon Brockman, and Jon Leuer to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and Samuel Dalembert. In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected Doron Lamb and John Henson.\nAfter 32 games of the 2012\u201313 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22\u201328 record to finish the season at 38\u201344. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4\u20130 by the reigning, and eventual champions, the Miami Heat.\n2013\u2013present: The Giannis Antetokounmpo Era.\n2013\u20132014: under Larry Drew.\nJim Boylan was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick of the 2013 NBA draft. They also brought in O. J. Mayo, Carlos Delfino, Zaza Pachulia, and Gary Neal as well as seeing Monta Ellis opt-out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, and Viacheslav Kravtsov. The Bucks later extended their contract with Larry Sanders with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded Ish Smith and Kravtsov to the Phoenix Suns for Caron Butler. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15\u201367, the worst record in team history.\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires Wes Edens, and Marc Lasry for $550 million, but Kohl retained a significant minority interest in the team. The new owners were expected to keep the team in Milwaukee. They were also expected to contribute $100 million toward building a new arena for the franchise. Approval from the NBA Board of Governors came on May 15, a month later. By this time, Bradley Center was seen as obsolete. The donation from the Bradley heirs did not provide for the arena's operating expenses or long-term capital needs. This led the NBA to give an ultimatum to Edens and Lasry\u2013unless the Bucks were either close to getting a new arena or actually opening a new arena by the 2017\u201318 season, Edens and Lasry would be required to return the franchise to the league, which would sell it to prospective ownership groups in Las Vegas and Seattle.\n2014\u20132018: under Jason Kidd.\nOn July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured the coaching rights for Jason Kidd from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in the 2015 NBA draft, and the 2019 NBA draft. With the acquisition of Kidd, the team fired coach Larry Drew.\nWith the many changes to the Bucks in ownership, coaches, and acquiring new young players to rebuild the team, the Bucks' new slogan for the 2014\u201315 season became \"\"Own The Future\".\"\nThe Bucks' overall play vastly improved, and on December 13, the Bucks beat the Boston Celtics 107\u2013106 for their 15th win, matching their win total of the previous season just 30 games in. The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 8 to February 30, where they went 20\u20132. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 1 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first-ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break.\nOff the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams, Miles Plumlee, and Tyler Ennis. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the 'Jay-Z Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%. Both Lasry and Edens had sold chunks of Bucks ownership to family, friends, and prominent members of the Milwaukee community.\nThe Bucks finished the 2014\u201315 season with a 41\u201341 record. Their 26-game improvement from the previous season was the second-highest in franchise history. The Bucks made the 2015 NBA playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference, where they faced the Chicago Bulls in the first round, losing in six games.\nOn July 6, 2015, Bucks president Peter Feigin stated if public funding for a new arena fell through, the NBA could have bought the team and moved it to Las Vegas or Seattle. Current Bucks owners Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan combined with Herb Kohl to pledge $250 million for a new arena and sought a match from the public. Of those funds, $93 million would come from the Wisconsin Center District in the form of new debt on Milwaukee citizens. The district would not commence repaying the bonds until 13 years thereafter.\nOn July 9, 2015, the Bucks confirmed their signing of center Greg Monroe to a three-year, $50 million contract. The Bucks also announced the club's re-signing of Khris Middleton to a five-year, $70 million contract.\nOn July 15, 2015, the future for the Bucks in Milwaukee was solidified after the Wisconsin State Senate voted 21\u201310 in favor of a proposal to use public money to help finance a replacement for the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which at the time was the third-oldest arena being used by an NBA team, behind Oracle Arena, and Madison Square Garden.\nOn the court, the young roster of the Bucks went through a step backward, to a 33\u201349 record in the 2015\u201316 season, though Giannis Antetokounmpo had an encouraging stretch in the final half of the season, accumulating 5 triple-doubles.\nOn June 18, 2016, ground was broken for the Bucks' new arena.\nOn September 19, 2016, the Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo agreed to a 4-year, $100 million contract extension. In addition, the team would add new young improvements to the roster in drafting Thon Maker and Malcolm Brogdon, and made trades to bring in Tony Snell and Michael Beasley. When the 2016\u201317 season began, the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who suffered a torn hamstring during a practice. Even so, the Bucks remained competitive, staying around .500 for the first half of the season, with both Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker leading the offense. While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004.\nIn January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March. During the month, the Bucks went 14\u20134, putting the team back in the thick of the playoff race. On April 8, 2017, the Bucks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 90\u201382, clinching the Bucks a playoff spot. On April 10, the Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 89\u201379 to clinch only the third winning season for the Bucks since 2001. The team finished the 2016\u201317 regular season with a 42\u201340 record. Giannis Antetokounmpo made history, becoming only the 5th player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories, and was the first in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each category. The Bucks were the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, and lost in the opening round to the Toronto Raptors, 4\u20132.\nOn May 23, 2017, Bucks general manager John Hammond stepped down to become general manager with the Orlando Magic.\nOn January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Jason Kidd, who had a 23\u201322 record in the 2017\u201318 season. In Kidd's three and a half seasons as head coach, the Bucks had a regular-season record of 139\u2013152 and reached the first round of the NBA playoffs in the 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 seasons. Bucks' assistant coach Joe Prunty was announced as Kidd's replacement on an interim basis for the rest of the season. Prunty finished the season with a 21\u201316 record, leading the Bucks to an overall 44\u201338 record, their best since the 2009\u201310 season. Seeded seventh in the 2017\u201318 Eastern Conference playoffs, the Bucks lost the series to the second-seeded Boston Celtics, 4\u20133.\n2018\u20132023: under Mike Budenholzer.\nOn May 17, 2018, the Bucks announced former San Antonio Spurs' assistant coach and former Atlanta Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer as their new head coach. On August 26, 2018, the Bucks' new arena, Fiserv Forum, opened to the public.\nSince 2018, the Bucks host Pride Night at Fiserv Forum, an event to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. On January 22, 2022, the annual event was hosted for the 5th time.\nThe Bucks stormed through their 2018\u201319 regular season, racing out to a 25\u201310 start en route to finishing 60\u201322, the fifth 60-win season in franchise history and the first time they had won that many in a regular season since the 1980\u201381 season. They also finished with the league-best record for the second time in franchise history, equalling their 1970\u201371 championship season. This earned them home-court advantage in any playoff series for the first time since 2001, and only the second time in the new millennium. On April 22, 2019, the Bucks swept the Detroit Pistons for their first playoff series win since 2001. On May 8, they eliminated the Boston Celtics in five games to reach their first Conference Finals since 2001, where they lost to the eventual league champion Toronto Raptors in six games. After the season, Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the league's Most Valuable Player. General Manager Jon Horst won the NBA Executive of the Year award.\nIn their 2019\u201320 season, the Bucks clinched a playoff berth after the team's 56th regular-season game, becoming the fastest team to clinch a playoff spot measured by the number of games played and by the calendar date (February 23) since the NBA changed its playoff format in 1984. Following the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Bucks were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. On August 26, the Bucks\u2019 players refused to play in their playoff matchup against the Orlando Magic following the shooting of Jacob Blake by police. Antetokounmpo received his second consecutive Most Valuable Player award after returning home from the NBA Bubble upon the Bucks losing in the semi-finals of the 2020 NBA playoffs to the Miami Heat. During the first possession of a 2020\u201321 regular season game against the Detroit Pistons on January 6, both teams took a knee in protest to the announcement that criminal charges would not be filed against police officers in the Blake shooting. The Bucks held the ball for seven seconds in reference to Blake's seven gunshots.\nDuring the offseason, the Bucks signed Antetokounmpo to a 5-year, $228 million contract extension, the largest contract in NBA history. Along with resigning their superstar, the Bucks also made a trade which resulted in Eric Bledsoe and George Hill being sent to the New Orleans Pelicans and receiving a former All-Defense player in Jrue Holiday. The Bucks also strengthened their bench with free agent signings of Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes. In their 2020\u201321 season, the Bucks clinched the third seed in the Eastern Conference with a record of 46\u201326, as well as their third consecutive Central Division title. It was the third consecutive season the Bucks had a winning percentage of at least .600, the first time it had happened in franchise history since 1984\u201386. During the season, the Bucks acquired P. J. Tucker to further strengthen their defense for the playoffs.\nIn the 2021 NBA playoffs, the Bucks began by defeating the Heat in a four-game sweep in the first round in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Semifinals. They then defeated the Brooklyn Nets (led by Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden) in seven games in the Conference Semifinals, culminating with a Game 7 victory on the road at Barclays Center. They then defeated the Atlanta Hawks in six games in the Conference Finals to secure their 3rd NBA Finals appearance in franchise history and their first since 1974. In the NBA Finals, the Bucks faced the Phoenix Suns, who were favored after defeating the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference first round. The Bucks came back from down 2\u20130 to win the series. Antetokounmpo was named Finals MVP after averaging 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.8 blocks in the series including a 50-point performance in a 105\u201398 Game 6 victory at Fiserv Forum.\nThe Bucks finished 2021\u201322 with a 51\u201331 record, their 4th consecutive season with a winning percentage of .600 or better, as well as their 4th consecutive Central Division title, their longest streak of division championships since 1979\u20131986. Once again with the 3-seed in the Eastern Conference, the Bucks beat the rival Chicago Bulls 4 games to 1 in the first round, but lost Middleton to a sprained knee in game 2. Without Middleton, the Bucks struggled to find offensive support for Antetokounmpo in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Boston Celtics. Though the Bucks had a 3\u20132 lead in the series, they would lose game 6 at home and game 7 on the road, ending their season.\nDuring the 2022 off-season, the Bucks selected MarJon Beauchamp and Hugo Besson with the 24th and 58th overall picks in the 2022 NBA draft respectively. The Bucks also re-signed Portis to a 4-year, $48 million contract as well as Wesley Matthews and Serge Ibaka to 1-year deals and Jevon Carter to a 2-year, $4.3 million deal. The Bucks also signed Joe Ingles to a 1-year deal out of free agency. Despite Middleton playing just 33 games over the course of the 2022\u201323 season, the Bucks finished with a 58\u201324 record, the best in the league. They went into the 2023 NBA playoffs as the 1st seed in the Eastern Conference and faced the Miami Heat in the first round. Antetokounmpo suffered a back injury just a few minutes into the first game of the series following a blocking foul from Kevin Love as Antetokounmpo was driving to the basket. Antetokounmpo would go on to miss games 2 and 3 and, despite his return for games 4 and 5, the Bucks lost the series 4\u20131. On May 4, 2023, a week after their series loss, the Bucks announced the firing of Budenholzer.\n2023\u2013present: Coaching changes, arrival of Damian Lillard.\nOn June 5, 2023, the Bucks announced that former Toronto Raptors assistant coach Adrian Griffin would be their new head coach. On September 27, 2023, the Bucks acquired seven-time all-star point guard Damian Lillard in a 3-team trade. On January 23, 2024, the Bucks fired Griffin after only 43 games. On January 26, 2024, the Bucks named Doc Rivers as the new head coach.\nOn December 17, 2024, the Bucks won their first NBA Cup, after defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in the championship game in Las Vegas. Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the tournament's MVP.\nLater in the season, the Bucks would be eliminated in the first round for the third straight season.\nOn October 13, 2025, the Bucks signed Alex Antetokounmpo to a two-way contract, making him teammates with his brothers Giannis and Thanasis for the first time. The signing marked the first time in NBA history that three brothers played on the same active roster.\nOwnership.\nAs of September 26, 2024, the following individuals and groups are among the owners of the Bucks:\nMascot.\nThe Bucks' official mascot is Bango. The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by Eddie Doucette, the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest.\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the 1977\u201378 season. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his Los Angeles Lakers at the Milwaukee Arena. Bango's original outfit only consisted of a green wool sweater with a \"B\" on the front, similar to the buck featured on the team logo. Since the 1990s, Bango now wears a Bucks uniform with the number 68, referring to the franchise's inaugural season of 1968. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the Fiserv Forum. Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the NBA All-Star Game.\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto YouTube shortly after the incident occurred.\nDuring game four of the 2009\u201310 first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks, Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the Seattle SuperSonics' mascot Squatch's feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the SuperSonics and the Phoenix Suns.\nBango has also dunked the ball while in a human hamster wheel in 2012 and made a behind-the-back half-court shot in New Orleans at the NBA All-Star game. In 2010 Bango was named Mascot of the Year, and later in 2011 was awarded, Most Awesome Mascot\", by Cartoon Network. Bango has also made many television appearances. He appeared in an ESPN commercial with Brandon Jennings in 2011, and then appeared in another ESPN commercial with Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2018. In 2013, Bango was featured on a Hulu original documentary series called, \"Behind the Mask\". This documentary featured the trials and tribulations of sports mascots. The 20-episode series focuses on the unsung heroes of sports mascots. The series follows the lives of seven mascots at different levels, both inside and outside the suit.\nLogos and uniforms.\n1968\u20131977.\nThe Bucks entered the NBA wearing hunter green and white uniforms with red trim. The white uniform featured \"Bucks\" in green serifed letters with red trim and block numbers, while the green uniform has \"Milwaukee\" in white serifed letters with red trim. Both sets have the deer head logo on the left leg. The Bucks would bring back the green uniform in the 2002\u201303 season, and the white uniform in the 2017\u201318 season as part of the league's \"Classic\" uniform series.\nPrior to the 1971\u201372 season, the letters on the white uniform changed to red with green trim, with \"Bucks\" now taking a block letter style. They kept the original green uniform until 1973, when it was modified to feature a script \"Milwaukee\" in red with white trim and numbers below the left chest. Both sets removed the deer head logo on the shorts.\nIn the 1975\u201376 season, the Bucks' white uniform changed to feature a script \"Bucks\" lettering and numbers on the left chest. The green uniform brought back the block \"Milwaukee\" lettering and centered numbers but kept the red base and white trim. The striping on the shorts was also modified.\n1977\u20131993.\nCoinciding with the debut of Robert Indiana's iconic MECCA court in the 1977\u201378 season, the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \"Irish Rainbows\"). Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \"Bucks\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the 1985\u201386 season, while lime green was promoted to accent color.\n1993\u20132006.\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the 1993\u201394 season. Green was relegated to trim color in favor of purple, while silver was added as an accent color. The original white uniform featured the letters in green with silver and purple trim, while the purple uniform featured letters in white with green and silver trim. In the 2001\u201302 season, the uniforms were tweaked to include the alternate antler logo on the waist along with extended side stripes. Letters on the purple uniform were now silver with green and white trim. The purple uniform from this era would be reused in the 2022\u201323 season as part of the \"Classic\" edition series.\nIn the 1995\u201396 season the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \"Bucks\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic deer logo on the right side. They were retired after the 1998\u201399 season. It would be resurrected for the 2012\u201313 season during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\nAccording to former NBA creative director Tom O'Grady, the Bucks' purple and green color scheme was inspired by a mysterious FedEx package that O'Grady received in 1992, containing a dark green cap and purple shirt with the logo of the Wimbledon Championships, and a handwritten letter by then-Bucks general manager Mike Dunleavy Sr.\n2006\u20132015.\nThe uniforms were changed again for the 2006\u201307 season. The new home uniform was white with hunter green stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \"BUCKS\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the 2008\u201309 season. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968\u201373 uniforms. It says \"Milwaukee\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the 2014\u201315 season, with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with hunter orange replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.\n2015\u2013present.\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015\u201316 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land green (a reference to \"Milwaukee\" being supposedly based on an Algonquian word meaning \"The Good Land\"), Cream City cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \"the Cream City\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes blue, black, and white.\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the 2015\u201316 season. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1976. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \"Cream City Rainbow\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \"Irish Rainbow\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \"blue collar\" citizens, while the inscription \"Fear the Deer\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' 1971 and 2021 NBA championships.\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform. The uniforms still feature the trim and the \"Cream City Rainbow\" on the sides, with the new Bucks logo in the center and the uniform number placed between the antlers of the logo. In conjunction with the unveiling of the uniform, dubbed the \"Fear the Deer uniform\", the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team planned to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for at least four home games during the 2015\u201316 season.\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's new protocol for uniforms, with each team allotted 5 different uniform sets, the Bucks added to their regular home (now \"Association\" white) and road (now \"Icon\" green) uniforms, as well as their alternate black (\"Statement\") uniforms. For their retro uniform, the Bucks went with a replica version of their inaugural home uniforms from 1968 to 1970, as part of the Bucks celebrating their 50th season in the NBA. In addition, the Bucks were also given new \"City\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. The \"City\" uniforms, dubbed \"Cream City\" uniforms, featured cream-colored jerseys and shorts, with the \"Cream City Rainbow\" running horizontally along the front of the uniform, with the Bucks logo in the middle. The \"Cream City Rainbow\" was also on the shorts, shaped in an \"M\" on both sides that are part of the regular Bucks' uniform design.\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, Milwaukee's \"City\" uniform will pay homage to Robert Indiana's famous MECCA court, featuring yellow, beige and red as base colors and light blue and forest green on the hem of the shorts. \"Bucks\" is written vertically on the right while the number is on the left; both are in forest green with lime green trim. The Bucks would also wear an \"Earned\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs; this uniform is essentially the \"City\" uniform but with the visual elements of red with green stripes, inspired from the 1977\u20131985 \"Irish Rainbow\" home uniform.\nThe Bucks made slight updates to the black \"Statement\" uniform prior to the 2019\u201320 season. It was essentially a black version of the team's 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform, with the exception of the \"Fear the Deer\" insignia on the beltline and near the jock tag.\nThe Bucks' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform again used a cream base, this time with a stylized \"Cream City\" wordmark in front. Blue, cream and green stripes run through the piping while a giant \"M\" insignia is featured on the shorts. These uniforms are a nod to the team's fondness of the cream-colored brick buildings which surround the city of Milwaukee. This uniform was brought back for the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe 2020\u201321 Bucks \"City\" uniform used three shades of Great Lakes Blue as its base color. The uniform was a nod to Milwaukee's meaning as \"the gathering place by the water\" due to the city's location at the confluence of the Milwaukee, Menomonee and Kinnickinnic rivers flowing into Lake Michigan.\nAs in 2019, the Bucks were given an \"Earned\" uniform after making the 2020 playoffs. This design, with a predominantly green base, featured \"Bucks,\" the uniform number and piping in white with black trim, and stylized antlers on each side.\nThe 2021\u201322 Bucks \"City\" uniform combined different elements of each of the Bucks' different uniform designs during their history, as part of the NBA's 75th season celebration. The jersey is white, with arched block letters, similar to their first uniforms. The sides featured the different shades of green from the team's \"Irish Rainbow\" uniform, as well as one line of blue from their current \"Cream City Rainbow\". Down the rest of the side of the jersey is purple, from the team's uniforms of the late 1990s, early 2000s.\nStarting with the 2022\u201323 season, the green \"Earned\" uniform worn in 2021 became the basis of the team's new black \"Statement\" uniform. Also during the season, the Bucks' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Bronzeville neighborhood, featuring a blue base, cream trim and rainbow side stripes of black, blue, cream and green. The team chose replicas of their 2000\u201301 purple road uniforms for their \"Classic\" uniform.\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Bucks wore a blue-based uniform with cream and green accents; the cream curving stripes surrounding the blue \"Milwaukee\" wordmark were meant to represent the Fiserv Forum architecture. The design was inspired by the fans that flood the neighborhood in Deer District, and were represented by light blue speckles.\nBlue again served as the base color of the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, featuring jagged cream and black stripes as reference to Wisconsin's borders. The design was inspired by the team's unifying impact and bond with the state's fanbase.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Milwaukee Bucks seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nRoster.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Bucks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nRadio and television.\nSince the 2007\u201308 season, all Bucks games not nationally broadcast have aired exclusively on regional cable television over FanDuel Sports Network Wisconsin. In 2018 the Bucks agreed to a seven-year extension with the network. Since the 2023\u201324 NBA season, due to the bankruptcy of the parent company of FanDuel Sports Network, select games have aired instead on WMLW-TV in English and WYTU-TV in Spanish using FanDuel's production. Bucks games produced by FanDuel Sports Network are also carried on the FanDuel Sports Network app within the Bucks broadcast territory.\nPrior to the Bally Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between Fox Sports Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and WCGV (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, WVTV (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, who also own Bally Sports. During each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks, the telecasts consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to televise home games regularly. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-ABC affiliate WITI (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-CBS affiliate WISN-TV (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time: ABC (1965\u20131973) and CBS (1973\u20131990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to Fox in December 1994.\nUntil his 2021 retirement, Jim Paschke was the team's television play-by-play announcer since 1986, with former Buck Jon McGlocklin providing color commentary for the team from 1976 to 2018. From 2015 to 2018, veteran announcer Gus Johnson called selected games alongside Paschke on a rotating basis. During that time, former Buck Marques Johnson also was in the booth for selected games, but became the new permanent color commentator for the 2018\u201319 season when the team moved to the Fiserv Forum. Veteran sportscaster Eddie Doucette served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research. In 2021, the team named Lisa Byington as their new television play-by-play announcer, making her the first woman to be the lead TV play-by-play announcer for a team in any of the four men's professional leagues.\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by WTMJ (620/103.3) and throughout the state on the Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network (which is sponsored by BMO Harris) for most of the team's history. Dave Koehn announces, with former Wisconsin Badgers Basketball Player Ben Brust providing color.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "72879", "revid": "46227441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72879", "title": "Toronto Raptors", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Toronto, Ontario\nThe Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto. The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Scotiabank Arena, which it shares with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies. Since the 2001\u201302 season, the Raptors have been the only Canadian team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.\nAfter Carter's departure, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. For the 2006\u201307 season, Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani, and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the 2007\u201308 season, they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the 2009\u201310 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the break-out of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\nAfter the Raptors won their first championship, Leonard left in free agency. After Lowry's departure via trade in 2021, Siakam became the face of the franchise until 2024 when Siakam was traded to the Indiana Pacers, leaving Scottie Barnes as the new face of the franchise.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nOn November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the Basketball Association of America). However, the Huskies folded after the initial 1946\u201347 season. Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the Buffalo Braves (predecessor to the Los Angeles Clippers) played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.\nInterest to move or expand an NBA franchise to Toronto grew during the late-1980s; with former NBA commissioner David Stern later describing the expansion to Toronto as a \"safe step,\" given the market size and the likelihood of success in the city. The NBA organized two exhibition games in 1989 and 1992 with an attendance of over 25,000 people each, both in the newly built SkyDome.\nThe NBA began to seriously consider expansion into Toronto after they received an unsolicited application fee from the Palestra Group, headed by Larry Tanenbaum. The Palestra Group was one of several seeking an NBA franchise, with Professional Basketball Franchise (Canada) Inc. (PBF) formally submitting an application for a Toronto-based team on April 23, 1993. Later that year, in July, the NBA Expansion Committee visited various existing and proposed stadium sites along with the bid contenders. On September 30, 1993, the committee recommended conditionally awarding PBF the franchise.\nCreation.\nThe team was formalized on November 4, 1993, when the NBA Board of Governors endorsed the decision of Expansion Committee and awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of US$125 million. Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44 per cent, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), David Peterson (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners. Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), which is the provincial lottery corporation that regulates gambling in Ontario, agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate OLG for its loss of revenue. The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game on November 3, 1995.\nNaming the team.\nInitial sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves to avoid confusion with that team. As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to ten prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, and Terriers. The final selection\u2014\"Toronto Raptors\"\u2014was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994: the choice was influenced by the popularity of the 1993 film adaption of the 1990 science fiction novel \"Jurassic Park\" by Michael Crichton; The name \"Raptor\" is a common informal name for the \"Velociraptor\", a species of dinosaur featured in the film. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first general manager, Isiah Thomas, were revealed at a press conference. As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value. He would purchase 4.5 per cent in May 1995 and a further 4.5 per cent in December 1995, half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5 per cent. The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; \"Naismith\" silver was chosen to honour Canadian James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. The team originally competed in the Central Division, and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.\n1995\u20131999: Struggles of a new franchise.\nAs general manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach. The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report to the club, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander. Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.\nSubsequent to the expansion draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. However, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at the SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.\nIn the team's first official NBA game, Alvin Robertson scored the first NBA points in Raptors history, while Stoudamire recorded 10 points and 10 assists in a 94\u201379 victory over the New Jersey Nets. The Raptors concluded their inaugural season with a 21\u201361 win\u2013loss record, although they were one of the few teams to defeat the Chicago Bulls, who set a then all-time NBA best 72\u201310 win\u2013loss regular season record. With averages of 19.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, Stoudamire also won the 1995\u201396 Rookie of the Year Award.\nIn November of the 1996\u201397 season, Bitove sold his ownership interest in the team to Slaight for $65 million after Slaight had activated a shotgun clause in their partnership agreement, giving Slaight 79 per cent control of the team, and remaining minority partner of the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), Thomas (9 per cent) Peterson (1 per cent) and Granovsky (1 per cent). Slaight subsequently acquired the 1 per cent, which had been owned by both Peterson and Granovsky, who had died a year earlier. In their second season the team put up a 30\u201352 record and selected centre Marcus Camby with the second overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. By the end of the season, Camby earned a berth on the NBA's All-Rookie Team, while Stoudamire continued to play well, averaging 20.2 points and 8.8 assists per game. As in the previous season, the Raptors were one of only 11 teams to topple the eventual 1997 champions, the Chicago Bulls. The Raptors also defeated the Houston Rockets, Utah Jazz and Miami Heat, all of which were eventual Conference finalists. However, the Raptors struggled against teams who were not of championship calibre, including three losses to the 15\u201367 Boston Celtics.\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, the team suffered numerous injuries and slid into a 17-game losing streak. After Thomas' attempts to execute a letter of intent with Slaight to purchase the team failed, he resigned his position with the team in November and sold his 9 per cent stake in the team to Slaight. This left Slaight with 90 per cent and the Bank of Nova Scotia with 10 per cent. Thomas was replaced by Glen Grunwald as general manager. With Thomas gone, Stoudamire immediately sought a trade. On February 13, 1998, he was shipped to the Portland Trail Blazers along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers for Kenny Anderson, Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, two first-round draft choices, a second-round draft choice and cash. Anderson refused to report to Toronto and was traded to the Celtics with \u017dan Tabak and Popeye Jones for Chauncey Billups, Dee Brown, Roy Rogers and John Thomas. When the trading deadline was over, the Raptors became the youngest team in the league with an average age of 24.6 years. They had five rookies on their roster, including the 18-year-old Tracy McGrady, who at the time was the youngest player in the NBA. The inexperienced Raptors struggled throughout the season and their regular season record regressed to 16\u201366.\nOn February 12, 1998, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, purchased 100 per cent of the Raptors and the arena the team was building, Air Canada Centre, from Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia; Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. later renamed itself Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE). MLSE paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena. During the 1998 NBA draft, in what became a defining move for the franchise, Grunwald traded the team's fourth overall pick Antawn Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter, who was selected fifth overall, and cash. To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald traded Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for Charles Oakley, a veteran with playoff experience. Kevin Willis, another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. Both Christie and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed into one of the elite defenders in the NBA, while Williams improved his play on the offensive end. New coach Butch Carter was also credited with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season. Although the team did not make the playoffs, many were optimistic with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter and a much improved McGrady.\n1999\u20132002: Success during the Vince Carter era.\nDuring the 1999 NBA draft, believing that the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for a power forward, Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors starting line-up and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would be out of the league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie, and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley, and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first-ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant postseason experience, Toronto was defeated 3\u20130 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter\u2014who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest\u2014attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45\u201337 record.\nStill, playoff failures and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior to the 2000\u201301 season with Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Fame coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience. The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark Jackson on a four-year contract. When Alvin Williams later emerged as a clutch performer, Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time. In the 2000 off-season, free-agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando Magic for a first-round draft pick.\nAs predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise-high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first-ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3\u20132, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.\nThe relocation of the Vancouver Grizzlies to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, as the Memphis Grizzlies, left Toronto as the NBA's only Canadian team. In the summer of 2001, long-term contracts were given to Alvin Williams, Jerome Williams and Davis, while former NBA MVP centre Hakeem Olajuwon was signed to provide Carter with good support. The Raptors appeared to be on their way to another competitive season with a 29\u201321 record going into the All-Star break and with Carter the top vote-getter for the All-Star game for the third consecutive year. Carter then suffered a bout of patellar tendinitis (also known as \"jumper's knee\"), forcing him to miss the All-Star game and the rest of the season, and without their franchise player, Toronto lost 13 consecutive games. However, they were able to win 12 of their last 14 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the regular season. The comeback featured some of the Raptors' best defence of the season, along with inspired performances by Davis and Keon Clark.\nDespite Toronto's improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83\u201365, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85\u201382 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.\n2002\u20132006: Another period of struggle.\nThe 2002\u201303 season began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game, suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto and Wilkens' \"laissez-faire\" attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury. Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season. Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach, with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24\u201358 record and Wilkens was fired. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the fourth overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.\nCanadian country singer Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors alternate road uniform at the start of the 2003\u201304 season, and the jerseys made their debut in a 90\u201387 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003, against the defending Eastern Conference champions, the New Jersey Nets. Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 games, Toronto was 25\u201325 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8\u201324 in their remaining games. The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a forward-centre, averaging 11.5\u00a0ppg and 7.4\u00a0rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending.\nFor the 2004\u201305 season, the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors' President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the previous season. Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: \"While the blame for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change.\" Rob Babcock was named general manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development. Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as new head coach of the Raptors.\nBabcock's first move as general manager was drafting centre Rafael Ara\u00fajo\u2014selected eighth overall\u2014in the 2004 NBA draft, in a move that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The \"Toronto Sun\" reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the general manager search and had concluded that as long as the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team. Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first-round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract at a reported $10\u00a0million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal, and the trade eventually cost him his job.\nCarter's departure heralded a new era for Toronto. Bosh stepped up to the role of franchise player and performed well in his sophomore campaign, ranking tenth in the league in defensive rebounds. In contrast to Bosh's emergence, Ara\u00fajo struggled to keep a spot in the line-up, and became unpopular with fans and local media. Although the ACC was often well-attended due to the Raptors' 22\u201319 home record, their inability to win on the road (11\u201330) and a poor defensive record made Mitchell's first year as head coach unimpressive. Additionally, Mitchell had problems dealing with Alston, who openly expressed his unhappiness with Mitchell in a post-game interview. Later in the season, Alston was suspended two games for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" for reportedly walking out of a scrimmage during practice. Notwithstanding the unrest, in their first season competing in the Atlantic Division, Toronto maintained the same regular season record of 33\u201349 as the previous season.\nThe Raptors continued to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Uki\u0107 and Uro\u0161 Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike. The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James and signing free agent Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n as a backup for James. Despite the infusion of new players, Toronto's overall 2005\u201306 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games and 15 out of their first 16 games. With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team and establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129\u2013103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game. But less than a week later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second-highest single-game total in NBA history. With media scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors entrenched at the bottom of the league in defensive field goal percentage, CEO Richard Peddie fired Babcock.\nThe 2005\u201306 season was not a total disaster. Villanueva's play impressed both fans and former critics as he came in second in NBA Rookie of the Year and recorded 48 points in an overtime loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997. Bosh was also named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game, becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo, the 2004\u201305 NBA Executive of the Year, the president and general manager of the Raptors. Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending thumb injury. The Raptors lost ten consecutive games after Bosh's injury and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27\u201355) in the NBA.\n2006\u20132010: Chris Bosh era.\nThe 2006\u201307 season represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number one pick Andrea Bargnani, the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard Anthony Parker and small forward Jorge Garbajosa. Bosh was given a three-year contract extension, while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.\nThe first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark. After the All-Star break, Bargnani continued to work on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second straight time on March 1, 2007. Bargnani became the third Raptor ever to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire. Toronto ended the regular season with a 47\u201335 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA playoffs along with the Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time in franchise history. Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing and tremendous team chemistry. Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were credited with Toronto's turnaround this season, which was one of the best in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking. Mitchell was subsequently named the 2006\u201307 NBA Coach of the Year, the first coach in Raptors history to receive the honour, while Colangelo was named 2006\u201307 Executive of the Year.\nOn April 24, 2007, the Raptors won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89\u201383 victory over the New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4\u20132. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey chipped away and had a chance to win the game, but Bo\u0161tjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.\nSeveral changes to the roster were made before the 2007\u201308 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second-round draft picks, and signed Jamario Moon and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents. On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles. However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign.\nThe Raptors finished 41\u201341, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the sixth seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game. Howard would put up a 29\u201320 in Game 2, as Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2\u20130 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and Jos\u00e9 Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three-point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3\u20131 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks. Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007\u201308 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game\u2014rebounding, defence, and a lack of a swingman\u2014were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.\nAs it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 2008\u201309 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calder\u00f3n), Rasho Nesterovi\u0107, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt. Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as \"Canada's team\". Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8\u20139 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano. Triano tweaked the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21\u201334 prior to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks, but with the losses mounting, the Raptors soon fell out of the playoffs picture and were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining. The Raptors eventually finished with a 33\u201349 record and headed into the next season with a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh could become one after 2009\u201310; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year term for the position of head coach.\nThe inevitable roster shakeup for the 2009\u201310 season began when Kapono was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for the aggressive veteran forward Reggie Evans. Toronto then drafted DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick, enabling them to fill a spot on the wings. This was followed by the signing of free agent Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, which in turn led to a sign-and-trade agreement involving four teams, with Toronto landing wing players Devean George (later traded for Marco Belinelli) and Antoine Wright, while releasing Marion, Kris Humphries and Nathan Jawai. Around the same time, Parker headed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, while Indiana point guard Jarrett Jack was added and Nesterovi\u010d brought back to provide cover for the big men. Finally, Delfino and Uki\u0107 were moved to the Milwaukee Bucks for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems. It became increasingly clear that Colangelo, in securing a credible nucleus for the future, was doing this to persuade Bosh to stay beyond 2010. While the Raptors were off to a sluggish start, they picked up the pace around the All-Star break, reaching a season-high seven games above .500 and standing fifth in the Eastern Conference. Bosh was recording career-highs in points and rebounds per game. However, a season-ending injury to Bosh after the break coincided with Toronto's descent down the standings from the fifth seed to the eighth, and they ultimately relinquished their spot to Chicago a few games before the regular season ended.\n2010\u20132013: Rebuilding.\nBefore the 2010\u201311 season began, there was much anticipation around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. \nBosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami. Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calder\u00f3n, Evans and the disenchanted T\u00fcrko\u011flu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw, but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks instead. Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright, and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojakovi\u0107 and Jerryd Bayless. Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns. Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.\nDwane Casey, an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the 2011\u201312 season. The Raptors used their number five pick to select Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, a centre from Lithuania in the 2011 NBA draft. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the 2011 NBA lockout, and the Raptors finished the season with a 23\u201343 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash, who had become a free agent after playing for the Phoenix Suns, to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets for a future first-round pick. Lowry, combined with Valan\u010di\u016bnas and the eighth pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross, represented the next phase of the re-building process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calder\u00f3n to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a second-round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second-round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. The 2012\u201313 season was the first season since 2009\u201310 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21\u201320), despite their overall losing record (34\u201348).\n2013\u2013present: The Masai Ujiri era.\n2013\u20132018: The DeRozan and Lowry era.\nDuring the 2013 off-season, new general manager Masai Ujiri traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first-round draft pick, and two future second-round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after the trade. The Raptors also added Tyler Hansbrough, D. J. Augustin, Dwight Buycks, and Austin Daye via free agency. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors traded Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy, and Aaron Gray to the Sacramento Kings for John Salmons, Greivis V\u00e1squez, Patrick Patterson, and Chuck Hayes, and waived Augustin.\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, the Raptors were 6\u201312 before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade they went on a 10\u20133 run, as they maintained their lead in the division and rose above the .500 mark for the first time in almost three years. The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28\u201324 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105\u2013103. On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108\u2013100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007. They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42\u201322 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when the Nets were located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, the Raptors were off to their best start in franchise history: a then-Eastern Conference-leading 24\u20138 record by the end of 2014. On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94\u201383 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title. On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records. Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014\u201315 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.\nOn June 25, 2015, the Raptors selected Delon Wright with their first-round pick in the 2015 NBA draft, along with Norman Powell in the second round. On June 29, the Raptors announced their new NBA G League (then known as the NBA D-League) team, the Mississauga-based Raptors 905, which began play in the 2015\u201316 season; the team is named after the area code the team represents. The Raptors added DeMarre Carroll, Cory Joseph, Bismack Biyombo, and Luis Scola via free agency.\nThe Raptors opened a new practice facility, the OVO Athletic Centre, originally known as the BioSteel Centre, in Exhibition Place, on February 10, 2016. The Raptors hosted the 2016 NBA All-Star Game on February 14, 2016, and its associated weekend for the first time in its history. With a 105\u201397 win at home against the Atlanta Hawks on March 30, 2016, the Raptors attained their first-ever 50-win season. The following day the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title for the third consecutive season as a result of a Boston Celtics loss against the Portland Trail Blazers. The 56\u201326 record became the best Raptors regular season ever, fourth overall in the league and second only to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference. Entering the 2016 playoffs as the East's second seed, the Raptors were pushed to seven games by the Indiana Pacers, but won their first playoff series in 15 years. Another seven-game series against the Miami Heat ensued, which Toronto also won. The Raptors, who were one of the four teams that never reached the NBA Conference Finals in their histories, appeared in the third round for the first time in their twenty-first season, facing the Cleveland Cavaliers, in which they ultimately lost the series 4\u20132. The Cavaliers advanced to the NBA Finals and became champions.\nIn preparation for their title push, the Raptors conducted a series of trades, including on February 14, 2017, when Terrence Ross and a first-round pick were traded for Serge Ibaka from the Orlando Magic, and on February 23, 2017, when Jared Sullinger and two second-round picks were traded for PJ Tucker. During the 2017 NBA playoffs, the third-seeded Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks during the first round 4\u20132, but lost to the defending champions Cavaliers in the second round 4\u20130.\nOn January 1, 2018, DeMar DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points to help the Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 131\u2013127 in overtime, matching the team record with their 12th consecutive home victory. DeRozan became the third player in Raptors history to score 50 or more in a single game\u2014the others being Vince Carter and Terrence Ross, who each had 51. On March 7, 2018, Toronto became the first team in the league to clinch a playoff spot in the 2017\u201318 season, with a 121\u2013119 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons in Detroit, and set a new franchise record in earliest playoff qualification, doing so in only their 64th game of the season. On April 6, 2018, the Raptors became Eastern Conference regular season champions, securing the number one seed for the first time in franchise history with a 92\u201373 win over the Indiana Pacers, in the process also setting new records for single-season wins at 57 and home wins with 33, with three games remaining on the schedule. The Raptors finished the regular season with a franchise-record 59 wins, which was the second-best overall in the league behind only the Houston Rockets.\nThe Raptors faced off the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs, a rematch of the 2015 playoffs. The Raptors defeated the Wizards 4\u20132. The Raptors were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round, becoming the first number one seed to get swept before the Conference Finals since 1969. Despite winning Coach of the Year, Casey was subsequently fired as coach on May 11. Nick Nurse was promoted to replace Casey as head coach on June 14.\n2018\u20132019: First championship season.\nToronto's roster underwent two major changes during the 2018\u201319 season. First, on July 18, DeRozan was traded, along with Jakob P\u00f6ltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Leonard was a two-time All-Star and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, but owing to the short length of his contract, there was uncertainty over his longer-term future with the franchise. Secondly, during the trade deadline, the Raptors traded Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, Delon Wright, C. J. Miles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol\u2014another multiple All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year\u2014and signed Jeremy Lin shortly thereafter. The Raptors got off to a 6\u20130 start, a franchise record. Winning their 16th game on November 23, the Raptors broke their franchise record for the best start through 20 games with a 16\u20134 record. They reached the 20-win mark quicker than any time in their history when they won the 24th game of their season on December 1 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland. On January 13, 2019, the Toronto Raptors broke the record for most points scored in franchise history after beating the Washington Wizards in Washington 140\u2013138 points after double overtime.\nDespite resting Leonard for more than 20 games due to his injury from the previous season, the Raptors finished the regular season with the second seed in the East, and the second-best record in the league behind the Milwaukee Bucks. The Raptors faced the Orlando Magic in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, defeating them in five games. In the following round, the Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in a tightly contested seven-game series. In the closing seconds of Game 7 with the game tied, Leonard hit the game-winning 15-foot buzzer-beater to lift the Raptors to a 92\u201390 victory\u2014the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA playoff history. They went on to face the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. After losing the first two games in Milwaukee, Toronto won the next four, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and their opponents were the two-time defending champions Golden State Warriors. The Warriors, which were making their fifth consecutive finals appearance and featured multiple All-Stars, including Splash Brothers Stephen Curry (son of former Raptor Dell Curry) and Klay Thompson, were favourites to win. However, the Raptors earned their first championship by defeating the Warriors 4\u20132, with Leonard being named Finals MVP. In doing so, the Raptors became the first team based outside the United States to win the NBA title (and the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy) and the first team based outside the United States to win a championship in any of the four major North American sports leagues since the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series in 1993, ending a 25-year-long drought from Canada-based major professional sports teams.\n2019\u20132021: Pandemic-shortened seasons.\nThe fear that Leonard would depart after only one season materialized when he signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. Nonetheless, the Raptors managed to win 53 games in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic to secure the second seed and the second best record in the league. Their winning percentage (73.6 per cent) was the best in franchise history, with the season also seeing Nurse being named as Coach of the Year; additionally, Pascal Siakam made his first All-NBA Second Team, as well as being a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as well as Kyle Lowry making his sixth consecutive all-star selection. In the playoffs\u2014which began later than usual in August, at the \"Bubble\" in Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando\u2014the Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4\u20130 in the first round. They went down 0\u20132 against the Boston Celtics in the next round, before OG Anunoby scored a buzzer-beater to win Toronto the third game. The series eventually went to seven games, with Boston prevailing.\nDue to travel restrictions imposed by the Canadian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors were unable to host games in Toronto and played their home games for the 2020\u201321 season at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. On February 28, 2021, due to NBA's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, the Raptors suffered their first postponement, in a scheduled game versus the Chicago Bulls, At the time, the Raptors were fourth in the East. They did not play again until March 3, but with five players missing due to the safety protocols, including Siakam, Anunoby, Lowry and Fred VanVleet, as well as head coach Nurse, resulting the Raptors to tank, Toronto lost 129\u2013105 to the Detroit Pistons. The Raptors ultimately missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. For the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors jumped up to the fourth pick after having the seventh-best odds in the 2021 NBA draft lottery. With the fourth pick in the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors selected guard/forward Scottie Barnes from Florida State.\n2021\u20132024: The Pascal Siakam era.\nBefore the 2021\u201322 season, the Raptors signed and traded Lowry to the Miami Heat for Goran Dragi\u0107 and Precious Achiuwa. On September 10, 2021, the Canadian government allowed the Raptors to return to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since March 2020, requiring spectators to show a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend. Despite a multitude of injuries to key players, the Raptors won 48 games to return to the postseason, entering the 2022 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the Raptors would lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round in six games, after going down 0\u20133 to start the series. Siakam was named to his second All-NBA Team, tying Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan for the most All-NBA selections in Raptors history. Scottie Barnes, whom the Raptors had selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year.\nOn April 21, 2023, after the Raptors were eliminated from the Play-in tournament by the Chicago Bulls, the Raptors fired head coach Nurse. The rest of Nurse\u2019s coaching staff were also fired. On June 13, 2023, Darko Rajakovi\u0107, a former Memphis Grizzlies assistant coach, was hired as the Raptors head coach, replacing Nurse. \nOn December 30, 2023, the Raptors traded OG Anunoby, along with Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn to the New York Knicks in exchange for RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and a 2024 2nd-round pick.\n2024\u2013present: The Scottie Barnes era.\nOn January 17, 2024, the Raptors traded Pascal Siakam to the Indiana Pacers for Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora, Kira Lewis Jr. and 3 first-round picks. Injuries to Scottie Barnes and other key players saw the Raptors tank for the remainder of the year, ultimately finishing at the bottom of the Atlantic Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference. Despite the injuries, Scottie Barnes represented Toronto in the All-Star Game.\nOn February 6, 2025, the Raptors acquired forward Brandon Ingram from the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Kelly Olynyk, Bruce Brown, a 2026 first round pick, and a 2031 second round pick. \nShortly after the 2025 NBA Finals, the Raptors did not re-sign Ujiri. His basketball duties were subsequently transferred to Raptors GM Bobby Webster, who also got promoted to head of basketball operations.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Raptors. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Toronto Raptors seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nLogos and uniforms.\nLogos.\nFueled by the success of the \"Jurassic Park\" film and the popularity of non-avian dinosaurs with younger audiences, who would grow up to be fans of the franchise, the team's first logo originally featured an aggressive-looking, featherless red \"Velociraptor\" wearing white sneakers with exposed toe-claws dribbling a silver-coloured basketball. The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, James Naismith). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales. For the 2008\u221209 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".\nCourt art.\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Toronto Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams and the Huskies are the Raptors' unofficial geographical predecessor. Beginning in early 2018, in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper Drake, as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary Tangerine Bank's name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly ING Direct Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\nUniforms.\nUniform evolution.\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995\u201396 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the \u2018T\u2019 of the \u2018TR\u2019 franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive \"Velociraptor\" dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999\u22122000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003\u221204, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006\u221207 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From the 2008\u221209 season through the 2014\u221215 season, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\nHome\nRoad\nHome\nRoad\n2003\u201305 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHome\nRoad\n2008 Road Alt.\n2015 redesign.\nOn August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with 2K Sports' \"NBA 2K16\" video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move from Vancouver to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jerseys. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's \"T-Dot\" nickname. The Raptors also have an alternate road uniform based on Drake's October's Very Own (OVO) Sound record label.\nHome\nRoad\nRoad Alt.\nRoad (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;)\n2017 onward.\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was allotted four primary uniforms, classified as \"editions\". The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms. In addition, each franchise was also given new \"City edition\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. For the 2018\u201319 season, the Raptors were one of the franchises awarded \"Earned edition\" uniforms, by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs. The 2021\u221222 version of the \"City edition\" brought back the original Velociraptor, albeit in black and gold and facing the opposite direction.\nPrimary uniforms \nAssociation\nIcon\nStatement\nAssociation\nIcon\nStatement\n2017\u221218\n2018\u221219\n2019\u221220\n2020\u221221\n2021\u221222\n2018\u221219\n2020\u221221\nJersey sponsors.\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Raptors announced that Toronto-based Sun Life Financial is the team's jersey sponsor starting in the 2017\u201318 season.\nThrowback and other jerseys.\nOn December 8, 2009, the Raptors introduced a blue-and-white throwback jersey to commemorate the Toronto Huskies of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), regarded by many as the unofficial, geographical predecessor of the Raptors. The uniforms were the same as those worn by the Huskies during the 1946\u201347 season, with the exception of the nickname and length of the shorts. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009\u201310 season and have since been used as \"retro\" jerseys, worn during special \"Huskies Nights\".\nIn the 2016\u201317 NBA season, the Raptors not only unveiled the season's \"retro\" uniforms in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies, but also revealed a Huskies-themed throwback court. The franchise also launched a special red Chinese New Year jersey in celebration of the event. The Chinese New Year jersey features a stylized rendering of \"Toronto\" in white traditional Chinese characters (\u591a\u502b\u591a, Pinyin: \"Du\u014dl\u00fandu\u014d\", Wade\u2013Giles: \"To1-lun2-to1\") with the head of a leftward-facing (viewer's perspective) Chinese dragon replacing the upper half of the first \u591a character and the Raptors slashed basketball logo replacing much of the bottom half of the \u502b character.\nOther jerseys worn by the Raptors include a green uniform worn from the 2007\u221208 season through to the 2011\u221212 season on St. Patrick's Day.\nThe Raptors also wear a camouflage uniform based on the temperate variant of CADPAT (Canadian Disruptive Pattern) during special events involving the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), as well as jerseys themed by Drake, such as Welcome Toronto jerseys, which are black with gold text.\n Huskies Night (2016\u201317)\n Chinese New Year (2016\u201317)\n Saint Patrick's Day (2007\u201312)\n CAF &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt; (2012)\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Raptors hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nAll retired numbers hang from the rafters at Scotiabank Arena.\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nManagement.\nGeneral managers\nPresidents of basketball operations\nOwners\nAwards and records.\nSince their inception in 1995, the Raptors have made the playoffs thirteen times (2000\u20132002, 2007, 2008, 2014\u20132020 and 2022), advancing past the first round six times (2001 and 2016\u20132020). The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division seven times (2007, 2014\u20132016, and 2018\u20132020), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season is 59 (2018). The Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals twice (2016 and 2019). Only once did the Raptors reach and win the NBA Finals (2019). Nine Raptors have been selected to play in the All-Star game: Vince Carter, Antonio Davis, Chris Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and Scottie Barnes. With the exception of Davis, VanVleet and Barnes, these players also made All-NBA teams, while Leonard has also made the All-NBA Defensive team. Two Raptors coaches have also made the All-Star game: Dwane Casey in 2018 and Nick Nurse in 2020. In 2020, the Raptors went on a 15-game winning streak and set a new record for the longest winning streak by a Canadian-based professional sports franchise.\nBroadcasters.\nRaptors games are primarily broadcast on television by Canadian sports channels TSN and Sportsnet, owned by Bell Media and Rogers Communications, respectively. Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA. During the 2019 NBA Finals, for simultaneous substitution purposes, Citytv (for games aired by Sportsnet) and CTV 2 (for games aired by TSN) aired the ABC feed.\nFanbase and marketing.\nThe Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. They set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006\u201307 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre. Following the success of the 2006\u201307 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007\u201308 season.\nAnother successful run starting in 2013\u201314 led to a spike in the Raptors' support. For the 2014\u201315 season, the team sold out the 12,500 season tickets, the first time it occurred since 2011. Public watchings of the Raptors games, particularly during the playoffs, started being held in 2014 at Maple Leaf Square, which the fans nicknamed \"Jurassic Park\". MLSE decided to endorse this practice by setting up concession stands and branded sponsorships at the square with naming rights sold to Ford Motor Company's Canadian operations, along with increased security. At times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room. The victorious Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers on the 2016 playoffs was the most-watched Raptors broadcast ever and the biggest television audience in Canada that day, averaging 1.53 million viewers with a peak of 2.63 million. This record has since been broken during the Raptors' victorious 2019 playoff run, averaging 7.7 million viewers with a peak of 10 million.\nThe value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125\u00a0million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148\u00a0million in 2000 to $297\u00a0million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315\u00a0million in 2006 to $373\u00a0million in 2007, and $400\u00a0million in 2008. By 2018, \"Forbes\" estimated the Raptors were worth $1.4\u00a0billion, 12th in the NBA.\nThe Raptor mascot, the North Side Crew, and DJ 4 Korners provide in-arena entertainment at Scotiabank Arena during game day. During the 2013\u201314 season, a new \"Drake Zone\" was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to fans sitting in the Drake Zone. Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a cheese or pepperoni pizza slice at standalone Pizza Pizza locations throughout Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor. However, beginning in the 2018\u201319 season, the promotion added an extra requirement of purchasing a first slice before receiving the free second slice, though it requires using the Pizza Pizza mobile app instead of using a Raptors ticket, allowing Raptors fans who did not attend the game to receive a free second slice after purchasing a first slice. Beginning in the same NBA season, McDonald's Canadian operations also offer fans in Ontario using the McDonald's Canada mobile app, regardless of game attendance, a free medium-sized serving of French fries with a minimum C$1 purchase of another item the next day after when the Raptors make at least a dozen successful three-pointers in home or away games regardless of outcome. The promotion was then expanded to include McDonald's locations throughout the rest of Canada the following season, but excluded McDonald's restaurants located in Quebec because the chain was already running a similar promotion with the Montreal Canadiens NHL team in that province.\nPartnership with Drake.\n\"We The North\" re-branding.\nIn the lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015 and its hosting of the 2016 All-Star Game, the Raptors began the process of re-branding itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team. In April 2014, the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency Sid Lee, \"We The North\", built around a manifesto that was meant to embrace the team's trait of being an \"outsider\" from the \"north side\", and the accompanying feelings of players and fans.\nThe \"We The North\" campaign was originally to be launched during the 2015\u201316 season; however, the launch was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, \"We The North\"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to Molson's former \"I Am Canadian\" alcohol advertising campaign in how it resonated with the country.\nOn December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during the 2015\u201316 season. The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of coloured versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015. There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design\u2014in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake distanced himself from the \"execution\" of the new logo.\nWelcome Toronto.\nIn 2018, Drake unveiled the Welcome Toronto program with the Raptors. As a part of the program, the Raptors wore \"city edition\" uniforms for six home games throughout the 2017\u201318 season. As a salute to the earlier We the North campaign, the uniforms feature a gold chevron with \"NORTH\" written across it. The six Welcome Toronto home games also featured an OVO-themed black-and-gold home court, with chevrons pointing north. In addition to the Welcome Toronto home games, it was also announced that the Raptors and OVO would donate $1 million in order to refurbish local community basketball courts, as well as another $2 million to Canada Basketball.\n2025 commentating ban.\nIn January 2025, Drake was banned from commentating on Toronto Raptors game broadcasts for one year for disparaging former Raptors player DeMar DeRozan.\nCommunity service.\nThe Raptors Foundation was the charitable arm of the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered charities that support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players and volunteers, the Foundation had successfully raised more than $14\u00a0million between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities. In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the MLSE Team Up Foundation.\nIn 2018, the Raptors, in partnership with Drake, announced the Welcome Toronto program. The program will see the Raptors and OVO contribute $2 million to Canada Basketball over the next four years. In addition, the Raptors and OVO also announced a donation of $1 million over the next three years in order to refurbish four community basketball courts within Toronto city limits. The four courts are located at Flemingdon Community Centre in the North York district in the north end of the city, Malvern Community Recreation Centre in the Scarborough district in the east end of the city, Matty Eckler Community Centre in the Riverdale neighbourhood of the Old Toronto district just to the east of downtown, and Thistletown Community Centre in the Etobicoke district in the west end of the city.\nRivalries.\nThe Toronto Raptors have a rivalry with both the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.\nNew Jersey/Brooklyn Nets.\nThe New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter during the 2004\u201305 season. The rivalry began to heat up as the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, with the Nets winning the series, 4\u20132, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring a 98\u201397 defeat for the Raptors. The rivalry was rekindled during the 2013\u201314 season when the Nets and Raptors battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but then faced the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors' general manager Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. During the rally, Ujiri yelled \"Fuck Brooklyn!\" which found its way onto various social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language. The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104\u2013103 victory. The two teams met again in the first round of 2020 NBA Playoffs, this time with the Raptors sweeping the Nets in four games, which was the first playoff series that the Raptors swept.\nNew York Knicks.\nThe New York Knicks and the Raptors are divisional rivals. The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 1999\u20132000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round, 3\u20130. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3\u20132; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Mavericks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at American Airlines Center, which it shares with the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars.\nThroughout the 1980s, the Mavericks were a perennial playoff team, led by All-Stars Rolando Blackman and Mark Aguirre. The team struggled during the 1990s, entering into a period of rebuilding. In 1998, the franchise's fortunes would change drastically with the acquisition of Dirk Nowitzki, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history, leading the team to its first NBA Finals appearance in 2006 and its only NBA championship in 2011.\nThe Mavericks later entered a rebuilding phase in the tail end of Nowitzki's storied career; although they missed the playoffs in three consecutive years from 2017 to 2019 (after which Nowitzki retired following his record-breaking 21st season with Dallas), the franchise's fortunes immediately rebounded once again with the acquisition of Luka Don\u010di\u0107; the Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 2020, reached the Western Conference finals in 2022 for the first time since their 2011 championship, and reached their third NBA Finals in 2024. In February 2025, the Mavericks traded Don\u010di\u0107 to the Los Angeles Lakers mainly for Anthony Davis.\nSince the Mavericks' inaugural 1980\u201381 season, the Mavericks have won five division titles (1987, 2007, 2010, 2021, 2024), three conference championships (2006, 2011, 2024) and one NBA championship (2011).\nHistory.\n1978\u20131981: The creation and early years of the Mavericks.\nIn 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met Dallas lawyer Doug Adkins and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to Dallas. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, Home Interiors and Gifts owner Don Carter. Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at Duncanville High School. Simultaneously, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju developed an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the , Sonju eventually returned to Texas. He was introduced to Carter by Mayor Robert Folsom, one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, which moved to San Antonio in 1973 becoming the San Antonio Spurs. Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Kansas City Kings, but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an expansion team.\nThe league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and Houston Rockets. The 1978\u201379 season was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the 1979 NBA All-Star Game weekend, NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien announced the league would add two new teams in the 1980\u201381 season, with teams in Dallas and Minneapolis. Once the potential Minnesota owners backed out, only Dallas remained. (The Minnesota Timberwolves would not join until 1989.) Through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner David Stern, the expansion fee was settled on $12.5\u00a0million. Carter would provide half the amount.\nAt the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957\u20131962 TV western \"Maverick\"; the fans chose the title with 4,600 postcards received, beating \"Wranglers\" and \"Express\". James Garner, who played the title character, was a member of the ownership group. The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name but did not attempt any legal action. They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004\u201305 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977\u201378, was hired as the team's first head coach.\nThe Mavs drafted Kiki VanDeWeghe of UCLA with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft. Still, VanDeWeghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into its inaugural season. VanDeWeghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets, along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981, and Sam Vincent in 1985.\nIn the Mavericks debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103\u201392. But the Mavs started the season with a 6\u201340 record on their way to finishing 15\u201367. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a significant role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6\u00a0ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavericks in December after a scout watched a game with Davis. He had to be convinced to play for the team rather than attend to his studies at the University of Maryland (which he was funding by playing for Anchorage). He would play for the remainder of the season after joining in December. Davis would spend the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually, his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a good debut season, with 7,789 spectators per game.\nThe 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected forward Mark Aguirre with the first pick, guard Rolando Blackman ninth, and forward Jay Vincent at 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavericks career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the most significant difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28\u201354, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz.\n1982\u20131990: Playoff contention.\nIn 1982\u201383, the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the All-Star break, they were 25\u201324 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain that momentum and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38\u201344 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season.\nMark Aguirre led the 1982\u201383 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game and shot .845 from the free-throw line, sixth in the league. The Mavs drafted Derek Harper with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA draft. The 6\u00a0ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in 1983\u201384 posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43\u201339 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game\u2014second in the league to Utah's Adrian Dantley.\nDallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum, as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks was hosting a tennis tournament. The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers, were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984 because they owned Cleveland's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center Sam Perkins, a former North Carolina Tar Heel, with a surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas.\nAbout this time, the Dallas Cowboys, once one of the NFL's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1\u201315 in 1989. The Mavs were hitting their stride simultaneously and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex's most popular team. The 1984\u201385 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44\u201338. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game. The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985 but were not as successful as they had been. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season.\nDallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft\u2014again due to a trade with the Cavaliers\u2014and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991\u201392 season. This trade allowed the Mavericks to have a steady hand at the center position lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson became the first Dallas Mavericks center in club history to be selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game.\nRolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985\u201386 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or fewer, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would become a very talented\u2014but troubled\u2014member of the roster.\nThe 1986\u201387 Mavericks team had their most successful regular season to date, going 55\u201327 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing to Game 4 in Seattle. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. John MacLeod, who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons, including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement.\nThe 1987\u201388 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season\u2014finishing 53\u201329 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets\u2014but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle. Still, in the end, the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.\nDespite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989, and missed the rest of the season. The Mavericks were left understaffed, demoralized, and disheartened as they finished with a 38\u201344 record. It was their first losing season since 1982\u201383\u2014which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.\nThe Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989\u201390 with a 47\u201335 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5\u20136, and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and playoff appearance until 2001.\n1990\u20131998: Rebuilding.\n1990\u20131994: Free falling.\nThe team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990\u201391 starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire\u2014Rodney McCray, Fat Lever, and Alex English\u2014were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9, it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own, which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28\u201354, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA.\nIt got even worse in 1991\u201392. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season\u2014hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22\u201360 record.\nIn 1992\u201393, the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman\u2014who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer\u2014to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992\u201393 season. Derek Harper was the team's only bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.\nThe Mavericks selected Ohio State guard Jim Jackson with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft, but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in 1992\u201393, a season also ruined by trades, a coaching change, and injuries. The Mavericks started 2\u201327 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9\u201373 by the 1972\u201373 Philadelphia 76ers). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7\u201314 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finishing 11\u201371, the second-worst record in NBA history.\nDallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as head coach. Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight, who told Buckner that the only way he would succeed with the Mavs would be to run the team with an iron hand. The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style and started 1\u201323. By the end of January, they were 3\u201340, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5\u20139 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13\u201369. It was still the worst record in the league by far, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. However, they did tie the NBA's \"single-season\" record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken).\nBuckner was fired at the end of the season despite having a five-year contract. However, Carter decided that Buckner had \"burned too many bridges\" due to his autocratic coaching style. He compiled the worst record for a rookie NBA head coach, a record that only lasted four years until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number two pick in the 1994 NBA draft and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd, giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn, and Kidd, known as \"The Three Js.\"\n1994\u20131996: Arrival of Jason Kidd.\nThe addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994\u201395. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.7 assists in his rookie season and led the league in triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February, which caused him to miss the regular season's remainder. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.\nThe Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. The team jumped to 36\u201346, 10th in the Western Conference, and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the most significant one-year improvement in the team's history and the highest in the NBA. Many expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4\u20130 start, the 1995\u201396 season was a disappointment about every conceivable way. For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy\u2014he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee, only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule.\nThe team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had trouble establishing his stardom. Jackson led the team scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers, and was the only Mav to start 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history.\nOverall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26\u201356, fifth in the Midwest Division, and 33 games out of first place. Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities at season's end and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by H. Ross Perot, Jr.\n1996\u20131998: Arrival of Michael Finley.\n The 1996\u201397 season was a year of transition for the Mavericks as they re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over only rookie forward, Samaki Walker, had remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer, and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A.C. Green. Cassell would play just one season while Green played three, but Finley, who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near twenty points per game for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game and played in each of the Mavericks games until the 2004\u201305 season.\nDon Nelson was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavericks had released Fred Roberts and Oliver Miller. They then traded Jamal Mashburn to the Miami Heat for forwards Kurt Thomas and Martin M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp and guard Sasha Danilovi\u0107. Thomas did not play in 1996\u201397 and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the New York Knicks. Danilovi\u0107 played in 13 games for the Mavericks before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna. M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA.\nChris Gatling was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the most massive two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud, and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets for 7\u00a0ft 6 in center Shawn Bradley, forward Ed O'Bannon, and guards Khalid Reeves and Robert Pack. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell became a consistent floor leader, and Jackson, Gatling and, McCloud all continued to be substantial contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any time in Dallas. He would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for Dallas and giving them substantial numbers in blocked shots.\nUndrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland averaged 10.6 ppg. Along with Finley and Bradley, he was expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any team chemistry in 1996\u201397, and the Mavericks finished 24\u201358. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997\u201398, despite a poor record of 20\u201362, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time to beat the Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers, and Chicago Bulls. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17\u20132 run to force overtime, where they won 104\u201397. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach.\n1998\u20132019: The Dirk Nowitzki era.\n1998\u20132001: New beginnings with Nowitzki &amp; Nash.\nIn the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19\u201331 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up substantial numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15\u201310) since 1989\u201390. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash, two seemingly unspectacular moves that would significantly impact the future. In the following season, the team finally \"clicked\" and started to win consistently. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989\u201390. He was much helped by Nowitzki, who finally \"arrived\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat.\nOn January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder Mark Cuban for $285\u00a0million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed Dennis Rodman to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas. They garnered the team much press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.\nIn 2000\u201301, the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53\u201329 record fueled by Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash's offensive triangle. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis, Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth, and Obinna Ekezie. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with Eduardo N\u00e1jera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. Nowitzki was named to the All NBA Third Team, becoming the first Maverick receive an All NBA honor. In the playoffs, the Mavericks won in the first round against the Utah Jazz. They advanced to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though the San Antonio Spurs eliminated them in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in earnestly contending for an NBA title. This season was also the last in the old Reunion Arena before moving to the modern American Airlines Center.\n2001\u20132005: Run-and-gun Nellie ball.\nThe 2001\u201302 season was an excellent season for the Mavericks, with a 57\u201325 record and many sellout crowds. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo and blue, almost on the same colors of fellow Dallas-based team, the Cowboys. Also, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway, and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel, Tariq Abdul-Wahad, and Avery Johnson. The Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz's star Karl Malone. The Mavericks swept the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2002 playoffs but lost again in the second round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings.\nBut it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. The team started the 2002\u201303 season with a 14\u20130 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the 1993\u201394 Houston Rockets (15\u20130). The Mavericks finished with a 60\u201322 record in the regular season, impressing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the \"Big Three\" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting. Finally, they led the team to the conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs. However, with the series tied 1\u20131, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out. This injury further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series), and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.\nIn 2003\u201304, two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired Antawn Jamison, Danny Fortson, Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch, and Chris Mills from Golden State in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Evan Eschmeyer, Popeye Jones, Avery Johnson, and Antoine Rigaudeau. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, and Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch to Boston for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks comfortably qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the NBA's best offensive team. Notable were two rookies, Josh Howard and Marquis Daniels, who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the 2004 playoffs, losing in the first round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings, a better defensive team. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy.\nThe 2004\u201305 season saw trades which (among others) brought in robust center Erick Dampier, combo guard Jason Terry, speedy rookie point guard Devin Harris, scoring machine Jerry Stackhouse, and defensive stalwart Alan Henderson. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired Keith Van Horn for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson stepped down, and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Mavericks' defense became more vigorous, and they quickly qualified for the 2005 playoffs with an impressive 58\u201324 record. The Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the Phoenix Suns 4\u20132, led by former Maverick star Steve Nash.\n2005\u20132006: First finals appearance.\nBefore the 2005 NBA draft, the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \"Allan Houston Rule.\" Under that rule, the Orlando Magic waived Doug Christie, who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed Darrell Armstrong and introduced Christie, DeSagana Diop, Rawle Marshall, and Josh Powell as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was minimal amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and Mr. Europa, a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural FIBA Europe Player of the Year.\nUp until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division and the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60\u201322 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. They swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2006 playoffs, leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the conference finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference finals on June 3, 2006, in the US Airways Center in Phoenix, and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.\nIn the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the Miami Heat, held the home-court advantage, and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the final possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard, who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double-digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for \"several acts of misconduct\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. Jerry Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 after fouling Shaquille O'Neal on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs.\nThe Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the finals after taking a 2\u20130 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22\u20137 in the momentum-changing 98\u201396 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's most remarkable postseason comeback in team history.\n2006\u20132007: Nowitzki wins MVP.\nAfter an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a 0\u20134 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52\u20135 record over their next 57 games. They finished the regular season with a record of 67\u201315, good enough to be tied for sixth place all-time, first in the league, and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team.\nHowever, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors. This outcome is regarded as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history. The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. The Mavericks went 67\u201312 against the rest of the league and 0\u20133 against Golden State on the year. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson, the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks. He had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006\u201307 mid-season.\nNowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, MVP awards are given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs. It is believed that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted.\n2007\u20132008: The return of Jason Kidd.\nThe Mavericks dealt Devin Harris, two first-round picks, and others to the New Jersey Nets for veteran all-star Jason Kidd and other role players; Cuban also tried to acquire Kevin Garnett without success. The Mavericks were 3\u201311 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the Golden State Warriors in a 111\u201386 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the Phoenix Suns in a 105\u201398 win on April 6. Dallas' win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, beating the Utah Jazz 97\u201394 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their eighth consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated by the New Orleans Hornets 4\u20131 on the road, 99\u201394.\nJust one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, Rick Carlisle was hired as the head coach.\n2008\u20132010: Falls in the playoffs.\nAfter getting off to 2\u20137 start, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50\u201332 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season). About three to four weeks earlier, they were not even sure if they would make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5\u20131 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.\nThe Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 106\u201397 in San Antonio. The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they could not do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106\u201393. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semi-finals for the first time since 2006.\nThey faced the two-seeded Denver Nuggets in the semi-finals, who were fresh off a 4\u20131 series win against the New Orleans Hornets, including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three-quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106\u2013105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009, the Mavericks suffered a Game 3 loss. The league later announced that the referees made the wrong call, but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3\u20130 deficit in the series.\nNowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3\u20131. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as a score of 124\u2013110 would oust them. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.\nAfter a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the team's future construction. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a transaction to compound their age problem by trading for All-Star small forward Shawn Marion. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swingman Antoine Wright and defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired athletic center Nathan Jawai and power forward Kris Humphries. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, given that it countered their age issues while also providing them with more depth on the bench. The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas, Drew Gooden, and Quinton Ross.\nThese moves proved successful because after dropping the season opener to the Wizards, the Mavericks beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns.\nA day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts thought that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast. Many believed that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade worked because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128\u201378. This win was the third-largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83\u201377. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for the Western Conference's second seed. The Mavericks then entered the postseason with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could earnestly contend for a title.\nDuring the playoffs, though, this optimism proved to be short-lived. After winning game one 100\u201394, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97\u201387, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.\n2010\u20132011: Championship season.\nAfter yet another first-round exit, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki, and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80 million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, or Amar'e Stoudemire, acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajin\u00e7a from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo N\u00e1jera, and guard Matt Carroll. \"USA Today\" called this trade one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, saying Chandler \"was the perfect fit during his first season with the Mavericks, anchoring their defense on the way to the franchise's first championship.\"\nThe 2010\u201311 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks' momentum. The team's second-leading scorer Caron Butler suffered a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later. The Mavericks then went on to drop seven of their next nine games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. However, this injury would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense. Consequently, they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010\u201311 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team). The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the third seed, with a 57\u201325 record. The Mavericks had a lousy reputation of struggling during the playoffs; many predicted them to be eliminated in the first round against the six-seeded Portland Trail Blazers. Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers.\nThe Mavs won Games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival at the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks would let another impressive regular season go down the drain. The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-finals. This series would be the first and only time that Kobe Bryant met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; however, it did not prove the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98\u201392 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect \"exclamation point\" crushing the Lakers in Game 4 by a final score of 122\u201386. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking Game 1 by a score of 121\u2013112. The Thunder then responded with 106\u2013100 victory in Game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in Game 4, to take the five-game series. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat.\nThe Mavericks entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's Big Three coming together at the start of the season. After dropping Game 1 in Miami by a score of 92\u201384, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, with the Mavericks trailing 88\u201373, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0\u20132 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22\u20135 run to end the game, stunned the Heat with a game two victory, and evened the series at one game apiece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in Game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a final score of 88\u201386. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal Game 4 with Nowitzki hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch, and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112\u2013103, putting them one game from their first-ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first-ever NBA title with a 105\u201395 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \"soft\" and putting an end to the Mavericks' postseason futility.\n2011\u20132013: Post-championship struggles and later absence from playoffs.\nThe 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to a lockout, which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea, and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the New York Knicks, Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets, Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West.\nThe Mavericks raised their championship banner before their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day. Still, in what would soon become a mirror image of the 2006\u201307 Heat's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105\u201394 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things did not get better for Dallas after starting the season 0\u20133, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 14 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22\u201322 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing seventh with a 36\u201330 record, their lowest finish since the 2007\u201308 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds, and 45.7% shooting, his most insufficient numbers since the 2000\u201301 season. Meanwhile, Odom, who proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, was deactivated for the final two months of the season.\nIn a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. Games 1 and 2 went down to the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant made a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks suffered a 95\u201379 defeat to fall behind 0\u20133. In Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but James Harden's 15-point fourth-quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103\u201397 win to eliminate the defending champions. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series. They became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006\u201307 Heat and the 1956\u201357 Philadelphia Warriors.\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the Boston Celtics. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the Charlotte Bobcats. The Mavericks acquired Darren Collison from the Indiana Pacers and signed O. J. Mayo from the Memphis Grizzlies. Also joining the team were former All-Stars Chris Kaman and Elton Brand.\nThe 2012\u201313 season was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. Also, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games, before settling on Mike James. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Injuries also hounded Kaman and Brand. The Mavericks were 23\u201329 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.\n2013\u20132016: Return to the playoffs.\nDuring the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option and later signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Mavericks signed Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n from the Detroit Pistons and Monta Ellis from the Bucks. They also signed veteran Samuel Dalembert.\nOn April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980\u201381 season with a 107\u201395 win.\nThe Mavericks finished 49\u201333, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62\u201320 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Gin\u00f3bili hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 despite a late Dallas comeback, after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119\u201396, putting an end to the Mavericks' season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calder\u00f3n, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two-second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25\u00a0million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent Chandler Parsons from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46\u00a0million. Devin Harris was re-signed for four years and $16\u00a0million. Dallas brought in Richard Jefferson, Al-Farouq Aminu, Jameer Nelson, Greg Smith to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies.\nOn November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest victory ever with a 123\u201370 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010. Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nOn December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent Jae Crowder, Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell.\nOn April 28, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in-state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4\u20131 series loss. After going down 3\u20130 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103\u201394. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50\u201332.\nOn April 25, 2016, the Mavericks were once again knocked out of the first round, this time, by the Oklahoma City Thunder in a 4\u20131 series loss. After managing to win a game at OKC and tying the series 1\u20131, the Mavericks lost three straight to lose the series. This series was marked by both teams' physicality, including a Kevin Durant Flagrant 2 foul and several Mavericks playing very aggressive defense on Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.\n2016\u20132019: Lottery return, the arrival of Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Dirk's final years.\nThe Mavericks did not make the playoffs during the 2016\u201317 season, despite efforts from their newest additions, Seth Curry, Harrison Barnes, Nerlens Noel, and Yogi Ferrell. They began the season going 3\u201315 through their first 18 games, and could not bounce back, finishing at a 33\u201349 record despite fighting towards a winning record, even reaching a 28\u201336 record partway through the season. This season was the second time in 17 years they missed the playoffs, with the other being the 2012\u20132013 season. The season marked the first time the team finished with a losing record since the 1999\u20132000 season.\nThe Dallas Mavericks received the ninth pick in the 2017 NBA draft and used it to select point guard Dennis Smith Jr. out of North Carolina State. They began the 2017\u201318 season 3\u201315 through their first eighteen games as in the year prior and concluded it on a 2\u201312 slump to finish with a 24\u201358 record despite a solid rookie season from Smith Jr., who averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists over 69 games, landing a spot on the All-Rookie Second Team. This season was the team's worst season since the 1997\u201398 season, in which they finished 20\u201362 and drafted Dirk Nowitzki afterward.\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, Dallas traded for Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who was drafted third by the Atlanta Hawks. Dallas traded their 2018 first-round pick, the fifth overall pick, and a top 5 protected 2019 first-round pick, which turned out to be the 10th overall pick. The two selections resulted in Trae Young and Cam Reddish, respectively. Head coach Rick Carlisle described Don\u010di\u0107 as \"a guy that we think is a franchise foundation piece.\" On July 6, 2018, long-time Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan (who had been with the Clippers since 2008), signed a one-year deal. The Mavericks finished the season with a record of 33\u201349 and missed the playoffs despite Don\u010di\u0107 winning Rookie of the Year. Nowitzki announced his retirement at season's end; his 21st season with the Mavericks marked the longest that any NBA player in history spent with a single franchise.\n2019\u20132025: The Luka Don\u010di\u0107 era.\n2019\u20132021: Return to playoff contention and Don\u010di\u0107's rise.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Mavericks sent Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, and two future first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks in exchange for Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Trey Burke. At the quarter-mark of the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks began with a 15\u20136 record through their first 21 games. With Luka Don\u010di\u0107 averaging a near 30-point triple-double, leading the Mavericks in points, rebounds, and assists and entering MVP contention, he led the Mavericks to the top-rated offense in the league. On December 12, 2019, the Mavericks won against the Detroit Pistons in Mexico City, due to the NBA's efforts to expand internationally. During that game, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists, becoming the first player in NBA history to record multiple 40-point triple-doubles before turning 21-years-old. Don\u010di\u0107 was later selected to his first NBA All-Star Game as a Western Conference starter.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Mavericks were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the regular season's final eight games. They resumed play on July 31, with a 153\u2013149 loss against the Houston Rockets. On August 2, after the Memphis Grizzlies lost against the San Antonio Spurs, the Mavericks clinched a spot in the 2020 NBA playoffs no worse than the seventh seed, marking their first trip since 2016. Don\u010di\u0107 was announced as one of the three finalists for the NBA Most Improved Player Award. In the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers, which was the first time the two teams ever faced off in the playoffs, the Mavericks lost 4\u20132, despite historically great performances by Don\u010di\u0107. Don\u010di\u0107 later was selected to the All-NBA First Team.\nThe 2020\u201321 season saw Dallas have players miss 41 games to COVID-19 protocols, with Maxi Kleber, Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson and Dorian Finney-Smith missing most of those 41 games. Additionally the start of the season saw forward Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is missing the first 9 games as he recovered from off-season meniscus surgery. At one point Dallas dropped to 14th in the Western conference largely in part due to missing key pieces of their rotation. Despite this, Dallas improved on their previous season record and finished the season 42\u201330. The Mavericks clinched the Southwest division for the first time since the 2009\u201310 season following a 110\u201390 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 7, 2021. However the Mavericks lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers for the second consecutive season in seven games.\n2021\u20132023: The 2nd return of Jason Kidd.\nFollowing the season on June 17, 2021, longtime head coach Rick Carlisle resigned from his position as head coach after 13 seasons.\nThe 2021\u201322 season would be the first season since 2004\u201305 without long-time general manager Donnie Nelson, as he announced his departure from the team on June 17, 2021, a day prior to Rick Carlisle's mutual parting with the team. Carlisle and Nelson were part of the Mavericks' 2010\u201311 championship squad, with Nelson being part of the 2005\u201306 team that made the 2006 NBA Finals.\nOn June 28, 2021, Jason Kidd, a player on the 2010\u201311 championship team, was hired as head coach of the team. This marked the third time that Kidd was involved with the organization.\nUnder Kidd, the Mavericks finished the 2021\u201322 season with a 52\u201330 record, which netted them the fourth seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks won their first playoff series since their 2011 championship season by defeating the Utah Jazz, 4\u20132, in the first round of the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Mavericks won two of the games with Don\u010di\u0107 out due to injury. The Mavericks then faced the Phoenix Suns, who won a league-best 64 games in the regular season. After being down 3\u20132, Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 said, \"Everybody acts tough when they're up.\" The Mavericks won the next two games to advance to their first Western Conference finals since 2011. In Game 7, the Mavericks beat the Suns by 33 points, and at one point they had a 46-point lead. During the 2022 Playoffs Jalen Brunson broke out as a star alongside Spencer Dinwiddie and Don\u010di\u0107, averaging 23 points in the first two series. In their first Western Conference finals appearance since 2011 the Mavericks would ultimately fall to the eventual NBA champion-Golden State Warriors in 5 games.\nOn Draft Night in the 2022 NBA draft, the Mavericks traded for center Christian Wood sending the Houston Rockets a 2022 NBA draft pick (became Wendell Moore Jr.) as well as Boban Marjanovic, Sterling Brown, Trey Burke, and Marquese Chriss. They also drafted guard Jaden Hardy with the 37th overall pick.\nThe Mavericks entered the 2022\u2013 2023 season hoping to improve upon their WCF appearance, and traded for star guard Kyrie Irving at the 2023 trade deadline in exchange for Dorian Finney-Smith, Spencer Dinwiddie, a 2029 unprotected first-round draft pick and second-round picks in 2027 and 2029. However, The Mavericks failed to click and failed to make the playoffs, intentionally losing the last few games by sitting their star players in order to keep the #10 overall pick instead of having it convey to the New York Knicks, who received the draft pick in the Kristaps Porzingis trade.\nAfter Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, Mark Cuban and the Mavericks were named in a class-action lawsuit that alleged that Voyager Digital was a Ponzi scheme the following month due to Cuban's promotion of Voyager and Voyager's sponsorship with the team. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.\n2023\u20132024: Return to NBA Finals.\nWith the 10th overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft, the Mavericks selected Cason Wallace who they immediately traded along with Davis Bertans to the Thunder for the 12th pick, Dereck Lively II. The Mavericks also selected Olivier-Maxence Prosper with the 24th overall pick which they received through a salary dump of Richaun Holmes by the Sacramento Kings. Before the February 8, 2024, trade deadline, the Mavericks traded for P.J. Washington and two future second\u2013round picks from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Seth Curry, Grant Williams, and a 2027 first\u2013round pick that is top 2 protected. Daniel Gafford was also received from the Washington Wizards for Richaun Holmes and draft compensation.\nThe Mavericks finished the 2023\u20132024 regular season as Southwest Division champions and as the 5th seed in the West with a 50\u201332 record. The Mavericks would face the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs for the third time in five seasons, however this time the Mavs would avenge previous playoff defeats to the Clippers in 2020 and 2021 by winning the series 4\u20132. They proceeded to then eliminate the one-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in six games, winning the series-clinching Game 6 at home, 117\u2013116. The win allowed the Mavericks to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the second time in three years. In the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in five games to win their third Western Conference title in franchise history.\nThe Mavericks would go on to face the Boston Celtics in the 2024 NBA Finals, their first NBA Finals appearance since their 2011 victory. In those, the Mavericks lost in five games. Their one win came from a 122\u201384 blowout, the third-largest blowout in NBA Finals history.\n2024\u20132025: Last year of Luka.\nOn July 6, 2024, Klay Thompson was traded to Mavericks in exchange for a 2025 second-round pick via a sign-and-trade. The Mavericks also traded Hardaway Jr. to the Detroit Pistons for Quentin Grimes, while also acquiring Naji Marshall, Melvin Ajin\u00e7a, and Spencer Dinwiddie. \nOn February 1, 2025, the Mavericks sent Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Markieff Morris, and Maxi Kleber to the Los Angeles Lakers in a blockbuster trade for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round draft pick. The Utah Jazz received Jalen Hood-Schifino and two second round picks to facilitate the trade. The trade was regarded as one of the most significant and unexpected in NBA history, marking the first time two reigning All-NBA players were traded for each other midseason. The Mavericks, who initiated the deal, drew heavy criticism for trading their franchise player, while Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison defended the trade, stating, \"I believe that defense wins championships.\" Don\u010di\u0107 on the other hand was blindsided by the trade; he was not told of it until the deal was done and according to Harrison, Don\u010di\u0107 has severed the relationship between himself and the organization. Team governor Dumont later said the trade decision had the backing of Mavericks ownership, and emphasized his support for general manager Harrison in making \"tough decisions.\"\nThe Mavericks ended their 24\u201325 season in the play in against the Memphis Grizzlies. On May 12, 2025, the Mavericks won the first overall pick in the 2025 NBA draft with a less than a 2% chance of getting the pick, selecting Cooper Flagg.\nUniforms.\nDuring their expansion season of 1980\u201381, the Mavericks road uniform colors were royal blue with green and white trim, but the green and blue were reversed a year later, and green was the dominant road uniform color through 1992. However, in the 1992\u201393 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the \"Dallas\" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980 to 2001, the home white uniforms had \"Mavericks\" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the \"Mavericks\" script during the 1990s. The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004\u201305 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary. However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993\u20132001 uniforms. The green uniforms would be revived again in the 2015\u201316 season, still with the 1990s number scheme. The aforementioned uniforms were brought back for the 2020\u201321 and 2025\u201326 seasons as part of Nike's \"Classic\" set, this time with the proper number scheme.\nIn the 2001\u201302 NBA season, the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new Dallas Cowboys-inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a \"Dallas\" script on both the home and road jerseys. On the home jersey, \"Dallas\" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, \"Dallas\" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim.\nIn the 2003\u201304 NBA season, the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with \"Mavericks\" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at Lakers on October 28, 2003).\nIn the 2004\u201305 NBA season, the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs, and featured \"Mavs\" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest.\nOn September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same \"Mavs\" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark \"Los Mavs.\".\nOn August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the \"Dallas\" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim. The alternate royal blue uniform was retired as a result and this new uniform has replaced the midnight blue one as the main road uniform. However the 'Los Mavs' uniforms were still in use despite the change, but would be the last time the Mavericks participated in the 'Noche Latina' uniform events.\nOn December 13, 2011, during media day, the Mavericks unveiled an alternate uniform based on the last alternate uniform they wore in the 2009\u201310 season, except that the base color is navy blue and the number is positioned below the team nickname 'Mavs' rather than above, effectively reversing roles.\nOn September 23, 2014, the Mavericks unveiled a new navy alternate uniform, featuring a depiction of the Dallas skyline in silver with white trim. The uniform was selected among thousands of entries as part of a design-a-uniform contest the Mavericks initiated during the 2013\u201314 season, but was not worn until the 2015\u201316 season.\nWith the switch to Nike as the uniform supplier in 2017, the home and away uniform designations were eliminated. In its place are the \"Icon\" uniforms, \"Association\" uniforms, \"Statement\" uniforms and \"City\" uniforms. The Mavericks' white uniforms are part of the \"Association\" set, the royal blue uniforms are identified with the \"Icon\" set, and the navy blue uniforms are included in the \"Statement\" set.\nFor the \"City\" set, the Mavericks wore black uniforms with \"DAL\" and the numbers in royal blue with neon green trim (a nod to the original Mavericks' colors). This set was worn only during the 2017\u201318 season, after which a new \"City\" uniform would be designed. The new \"City\" uniform was unveiled in November 2018. The \"DAL\" across the chest was replaced with the team's secondary logo and the neon green trim was removed, with the numbers no longer having a trim color. The \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season featured a stylized \"MAVS\" wordmark inspired from graffiti paintings. The uniform base had a light blue/navy blue gradient and neon green trim. The \"City\" uniform for 2020\u201321 featured a white base with gold and silver trim, which was said to be inspired by Pegasus, a Dallas symbol. The Pegasus-themed \"City\" uniform returned in the 2025\u201326 season, but used the Mavericks' current color scheme.\nPrior to the 2019\u201320 season, the Mavericks drastically redesigned their navy \"Statement\" uniforms, eliminating the Dallas skyline and reverting to the full team name \"Mavericks\" in front. The uniform contains white lettering and white and royal blue side stripes. In 2022, the uniform was tweaked to again feature just \"Mavs\" in front and the numbers moving to the left chest, along with thick black side stripes.\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, in commemoration of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Mavericks wore \"City\" uniforms featuring various elements taken from past uniforms. The template used is from their current uniforms, but with green striping. The typography resembled the Mavericks' uniforms from 1980 to 2001, and featured a modified version of the cowboy hat logo (except the \"M\" was replaced with a \"D\"). A recolored version of the current horse logo appears on the shorts, and the skyline silhouette from their 2015\u20132019 navy alternates is placed on the beltline.\nThe 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform featured retro-style white letters with green trim on a blue base, which was a nod to the late 1970s\u2013early 1980s disco era that served as a boom period within the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex.\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Mavericks partnered with Grammy Award-winning recording artist Leon Bridges in designing the uniform. The black-based uniform with stylized Western letters in silver and blue trim pay homage to 150 years of American rhythm and blues history. This uniform, albeit in white with silver letters, was reused for their 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform.\nHead coaches.\nThere have been nine head coaches for the Mavericks franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Dick Motta, who served for two non-consecutive stints and coached for nine seasons with the Mavericks. Motta is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season games coached (738); Don Nelson, Donnie Nelson's father, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season game wins (339); Avery Johnson is the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (47), the most playoff-game wins (23), and the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.735). Nelson is also named one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history. Johnson was the first coach to win the Western Conference championship, losing the 2006 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat. Johnson is also the only Mavericks coach to have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award, having won it in the 2005\u201306 season. Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons have spent their entire NBA coaching careers with the Mavericks. Only one of the Mavericks coaches, Don Nelson, has been elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach. Rick Carlisle was the head coach of the Mavericks from 2008 to 2021. Carlisle led the team to their first championship in franchise history in 2011, against their 2006 Finals opponent, the Miami Heat, in a rematch. In 2015, he passed Motta as the winningest coach in franchise history. Currently, the head coach is Jason Kidd, who in 2022 led the Mavericks to the team's first playoff series win since the 2011 championship season that he won as a player.\nRivalries.\nMiami Heat.\nThe Mavericks-Heat rivalry is a testament to when the two teams faced each other in the NBA finals on two occasions. First they came head to head in the 2006 NBA Finals, in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60\u201322 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52\u201330 record and sported an aging but still strong Shaquille O'Neal as well as an up-and-coming Dwyane Wade. Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history.\nBoth teams saw success over the next few seasons and appeared in the playoffs multiple times, and would ultimately go on to have a rematch in the 2011 NBA Finals. It was also the first time that either team had reached the Finals since 2006. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after the highly publicized signings of LeBron James and Chris Bosh to their roster. Dallas came in with a 57\u201325 record while the Heat came in 58\u201324. Miami won the first game 92\u201384, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavericks made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and three conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 5. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This is known as the \"I-35 rivalry\" because both cities lie on Interstate 35.\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of Steve Nash, Michael Finley, and Dirk Nowitzki, had just defeated the Utah Jazz despite not having home-court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference finals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings, respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, Don Nelson would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur Avery Johnson, the point guard of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the New York Knicks. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' head coach Gregg Popovich, he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 off-season, Michael Finley, waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130. The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games. Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty. The season also gave longtime former Maverick Michael Finley his first championship. Many Spurs teammates claimed that the drive to win this season was partially to give Finley his first championship, especially since Finley had lost a bitter-fought series to his longtime team the year previous.\nWorth noting in a regular season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game that the Spurs won 91\u201386, Tim Duncan suffered his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford, the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Gin\u00f3bili getting into an altercation after a rebound.\nIn the 2009 NBA playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round. The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&amp;T Center in San Antonio.\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top-seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies, the first time an eight-seed defeated a one-seed since the Mavericks-Warriors series of 2007. In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\nThe Mavericks were swept in the 2012\u201313 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1997\u201398 season, Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match-up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, the Spurs once again swept the Mavericks in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014, ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA playoffs, where the Mavericks were the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas reached an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 90\u201385. However, the Mavericks managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Gin\u00f3bili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. The Mavericks won Game 6 at home by 113\u2013111. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\nPhoenix Suns.\nDuring the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard Steve Nash signed a free-agent deal with the 29\u201353 Phoenix Suns to help out their offense. The addition of Nash completely turned the team around, as Phoenix rolled to a 62\u201320 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the 2005 Western Conference Semifinals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage.\nPhoenix won game 1 127\u2013102 with a 40-point game by Amar'e Stoudemire. Steve Nash was also given his NBA MVP award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in game 2 to beat Phoenix 108\u2013106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1\u20131. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in Dallas which saw the winners of both games score 119 points. The series went back to Phoenix, where the Suns defeated the Mavericks 114\u2013108 in the America West Arena (now Footprint Center). Then, in game 6, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw Steve Nash with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. In the Western Conference finals, Phoenix lost to the San Antonio Spurs, who then went on to win the NBA title.\nThe following year, the Suns were without Stoudemire (who was injured), Joe Johnson, and Quentin Richardson, but with a core of new players led by Raja Bell (who clotheslined Lakers star Kobe Bryant in a first-round series game), Boris Diaw and Tim Thomas to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star Shawn Marion. Phoenix had to play seven-game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the Los Angeles Lakers (who had a 3\u20131 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference finals, they faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference finals, Dallas swept the Memphis Grizzlies, and beat in-state rival San Antonio Spurs in seven tense games. Phoenix won game 1 121\u2013118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in game 1, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105\u201398 and 95\u201388. Bell came back for game 4 and led Phoenix to a 106\u201386 win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117\u2013101 in game 5 which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102\u201393 in game 6. Dallas would later lose to the Miami Heat in six games, despite winning the first two games.\nOn March 14, 2007, in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129\u2013127 double-overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. Jason Terry sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle.\nOn April 10, 2013, the Mavericks' 12-season playoff streak, since 2001, ended in a loss to the Suns 102\u201391.\nOn April 12, 2014, the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101\u201398. Their other two losses were to the San Antonio Spurs and Memphis Grizzlies.\nFrom the 2016\u201317 season through the 2021\u201322 regular season, the Suns dominated the rivalry, winning 17 out of 21 head-to-head games, including separate winning streaks of nine and seven games.\nThe Mavericks and the Suns met again in the 2022 Western Conference Semifinals, in which the Suns were coming off a historic franchise-record 64 wins, while the Mavericks compiled 52 regular season wins. Despite the Suns being heavily favored to win and going up 2\u20130 in the series, the Suns' season ended in an upset 123\u201390 game 7 loss to the Mavericks on their home floor.\nHouston Rockets.\nAn NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. This is also known as the I-45 rivalry because they both lie on Interstate 45. In the Mavericks' inaugural season in 1980\u201381, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116\u201368 win. In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988 and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game-fixing, while the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s, and also during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets 156\u2013147 in double overtime, making that win one of their most memorable victories against Houston who were the reigning champions. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first-ever regular season game played in Mexico City, which was won by the Rockets 108\u2013106. In the 2010s, the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Mark Cuban and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan-favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46\u00a0million, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving, causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally, longtime Mavericks' player Jason Terry, who was a starter on the Mavericks' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2014\u201315 season, and both teams met in the first round of the 2015 NBA playoffs, with the Rockets as the second seed and Mavericks the seventh seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4\u20131.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe rivalry between the Lakers and Mavericks began in the 1980s during the Lakers' Showtime era. In the 1984 NBA playoffs, the Lakers won over the Mavericks in the Western Conference Semi-finals with the series 4\u20131. In 1986, they met again in the semi-finals and the Lakers won the series 4\u20132. In the 1988 NBA playoffs, the Lakers, who were the defending champions, defeated the Mavericks in a seven-game series in the Western Conference finals and eventually became the back-to-back champions after winning the NBA Finals. In 2011, the Mavericks met the two-time defending champions Lakers in the semi-finals and rejected their three-peat by sweeping them in four games and eventually won the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the 2011 NBA playoffs, Ron Artest was ejected for hitting J. J. Barea and suspended for Game 3. In Game 4, Lamar Odom was ejected for pushing Dirk Nowitzki and then Andrew Bynum was ejected for elbowing J. J. Barea. Both players received flagrant foul 2. After the 2011 NBA lockout, Lamar Odom was sent to the Mavericks after he requested to leave the Lakers due to the vetoed Chris Paul trade. Andrew Bynum made a formal apology for what he did to Barea before the start of the following season.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Mavericks. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Dallas Mavericks seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Mavericks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nIndividual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNBA All-Star selections.\nThe following Mavericks players were selected to the NBA All-Star Game.\nOwnership and management.\nDonald Carter purchased the Dallas Mavericks for $12 million in 1980. Developer Ross Perot Jr. and car dealer David McDavid purchased a 67% interest in the Mavericks from Carter on May 1, 1996, valuing the team at $125 million. Carter and other limited partners kept a 33% stake. After the sale, head coach Dick Motta was removed from his role but remained an advisor. Perot beat out a similar bid by businessman Tom Hicks, who had purchased the Dallas Stars in January 1996. According to the New York Daily News, Carter wanted to sell the team because he didn't want to fire his friend Dick Motta.\nMark Cuban purchased a majority stake in the Mavericks for $285\u00a0million from Ross Perot Jr. in 2000.\nOn December 27, 2023, casino magnates Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont acquired a 69% majority stake in the team at a franchise valuation of between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion. Cuban retained 27% ownership and operational oversight of the team. Dumont replaced Cuban as the team's governor on the NBA Board of Governors, and the Adelson and Dumont families would have final say over all business and basketball decisions. Adelson funded the purchase by selling $2 billion of stock in Las Vegas Sands Corporation and with additional cash on hand. As part of the purchase, four minority shareholders were bought out, except for Mary Stanton who kept her 4% stake in the franchise.\nCuban's nearly 23-year tenure as owner and governor was the longest and most successful in team history. During the Cuban era, the Mavericks' record was 1,152\u2013782, with 18 playoff berths, and the 2011 NBA championship.\nTerdema Ussery.\nTerdema Ussery served as team president and CEO from 1997 until 2015. During this time Ussery also served in other roles, including president of the Dallas Mavericks Foundation and an alternate governor for the Mavericks on the NBA Board of Governors. Ussery left the Mavericks for a position with Under Armour.\nSexual assault and domestic violence allegations.\nIn February 2018, \"Sports Illustrated\" released an investigation with sexual assault allegations against Ussery and domestic violence allegations against another employee, Earl K. Sneed. Cuban said he had not been aware of improper behavior from Ussery or Sneed. The organization hired a pair of independent investigators to look into the allegations. The Mavericks also hired former AT&amp;T executive Cynthia Marshall as their interim CEO in a direct response to the allegations. Marshall was the first black female CEO of an NBA franchise as well as the first woman ever to hold the position.\nMark Cuban responded in March 2018 to separate allegations against him of a 2011 sexual assault; in an email to the \"Associated Press,\" he stated, \"It didn't happen.\"\nOn September 19, 2018, the team's investigation report concluded that there were \"numerous instances of sexual harassment and other improper workplace conduct\" that had occurred within the organization, none of which were related to the allegation against Cuban himself. Cuban also agreed to donate $10\u00a0million in reparations to organizations related to women's causes, mainly those committed to combating domestic violence and supporting the professional development of women within the sports industry.\nOn October 5, 2018, over two weeks after the team publicly released their sexual harassment report, it was reported that team photographer Danny Bollinger made propositions to four now-former employees over the course of a decade. Bollinger was laid off by Cuban four days later.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "72883", "revid": "44092845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72883", "title": "Denver Nuggets", "text": "American basketball team\nThe Denver Nuggets are an American professional basketball team based in Denver. The Nuggets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team was originally founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 as a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA), but changed their name to the Rockets before the first season began due to a swift ownership change that came from the owners of the local Ringsby Rocket Truck Lines company. The Rockets then changed their name to the Nuggets on August 7, 1974 as a precautionary measure for their franchise to move from the ABA to the NBA. After the name change, the Nuggets played for the final ABA Championship title in 1976, losing to the New York Nets.\nThe team has had some periods of success, qualifying for the ABA playoffs in all but two seasons of the ABA's existence. The team made the 1976 ABA Finals, losing to the New York Nets. The team joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA\u2013NBA merger and qualified for the NBA playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013. In 2023, the Nuggets, led by Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray, reached their first NBA Finals and defeated the Miami Heat to capture the franchise's first NBA championship. The Nuggets were the last of the four surviving former ABA teams to reach the NBA Finals, and the second former ABA team to win an NBA title (after the San Antonio Spurs). The Nuggets play their home games at Ball Arena, which they share with the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League (NLL).\nHistory.\n1967: Franchise founding.\nThe current franchise traces its roots to 1967, when one of the American Basketball Association (ABA)'s charter franchises was awarded to a group in Kansas City, Missouri, headed by Southern California businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena within the Kansas City area. League commissioner George Mikan suggested moving the team to Denver instead. After agreeing to name Denver resident and former NBA player Vince Boryla as the general manager, Trindle moved his Kansas City team to Denver as the newly named Denver Larks franchise, named after Colorado's state bird. However, the Trindle group was found out to be severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks franchise to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise before they even played a single game. Hours before the deadline happened, Trindle sold a two-thirds controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby and his son for $350,000. Ringsby then immediately renamed the team the Rockets, after his local company's long-haul trucks called the \"Ringsby Rocket Truck Lines\".\n1967\u20131976: ABA years.\nPlaying at the Denver Auditorium Arena, the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way. However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and only once played in the ABA championship series.\nEarly on, Denver had a solid lineup led by Byron Beck and Larry Jones, then later by Beck and Ralph Simpson. Lonnie Wright of the American Football League's Denver Broncos signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver. Controversial rookie Spencer Haywood joined the team for the 1969\u201370 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn professional before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league due to his status at the time. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51\u201333, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.\nJust before the start of the 1970\u201371 season, Haywood signed with the Seattle SuperSonics, jumping to the NBA and later resulting in the Haywood v. National Basketball Association case that allowed for both NBA and ABA teams to draft collegiate underclassmen (and later, high school players) going forward. The team tumbled to a 30\u201354 record and attendance suffered.\n1974\u20131976: Becoming the Denver Nuggets.\nRingsby later sold the team to San Diego businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972 following more recent troubles with his trucking operations at the time. A year prior to the change in management, the Rockets changed their team logo from a logo reflecting the team's partnership with Ringsby's Rocket Truck Lines (whose logo was similar looking to the one the team was using at the time) to one that gave the team more of an identity beyond branding purposes with Ringsby's business. In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the NBA, and the new McNichols Arena, the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as \"Rockets\" was already in use by the Houston Rockets. The winning choice was \"Nuggets\", in honor of the original Denver Nuggets NBL team from 1948 to 1950, the last year as a charter member of the NBA following the BAA merging operations with the NBL to create the modern-day NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball. The change from Rockets to Nuggets was ultimately made official on August 7, 1974, months before the franchise began the 1974\u201375 ABA season. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group called Nuggets Management Inc. in 1974 and 1975 in relation to the upcoming move from the ABA to the NBA.\nWith the drafting and signing of future Hall of Fame player David Thompson out of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster, and the acquisitions of Dan Issel and Bobby Jones (all signed for the 1975\u201376 season), with Larry Brown coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two as the Nuggets. Playing in the Denver Auditorium Arena for the last season the 1974\u201375 team went 65\u201319, including a 40\u20132 record at home. However, they lost in the Western Conference Finals in 7 games, to the Indiana Pacers.\nIn 1975\u201376, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets, with the acquisitions of Thompson, Jones and Dan Issel who had come via a trade after he won an ABA title with the 1974\u201375 Kentucky Colonels, the team went 60\u201324, edged the reigning champion Kentucky Colonels four games to three to make the 1976 ABA finals for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the New York Nets and Julius Erving in 6 games. They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the ABA\u2013NBA merger took place after the 1975\u201376 season. The Nuggets, Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs were merged into the NBA. The Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels were disbanded, with the Virginia Squires not even making it to the merger period.\n1976\u20131982: Early NBA years.\nThe Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were saddled with stiff financial obligations upon joining the NBA, including a $2 million entry fee. Red McCombs bought the team in 1978.\nIn 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired Doug Moe as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as other NBA coaches. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981\u201382 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games. During the 1981\u201382 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.\n1982\u20131989: The Alex English era.\nAnchored by scoring machines Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting Detroit Pistons combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple overtime, 186\u2013184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In 1984\u201385, they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\nVandeweghe was traded before the 1984\u201385 season to the Portland Trail Blazers for 6\u20133 rebounding guard Fat Lever, undersized power forward Calvin Natt and center Wayne Cooper. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists Bill Hanzlik and TR Dunn, the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the 1987\u201388 season, the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to Sidney Shlenker in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to COMSAT in 1989.\n1989\u20131991: A period of decline.\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead. Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play allowing players to speed down the court to shoot rather than creating set plays. Combined with the 1980s Nuggets core slowly departing due to age and injuries, the Nuggets collapsed, going from a 46-36 record and a playoff spot in '88-'89 to a pitiful 20-62 record and last place in the conference.\n1991\u20131996: The Dikembe Mutombo era.\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24\u201358 that year.\nDenver fired Westhead prior to the 1992\u201393 season and hired former star player Dan Issel as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted University of Notre Dame forward LaPhonso Ellis and University of Virginia guard Bryant Stith. Denver improved to 36\u201346, just missing the playoffs that year.\nDenver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993\u201394 season. Led by Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42\u201340. Denver clinched the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place Seattle SuperSonics. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in Seattle, the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98\u201394. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the Utah Jazz in Game 7 of the second round.\nDenver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter Dale Ellis in the off-season and drafted University of Michigan guard Jalen Rose. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach Gene Littles assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager Bernie Bickerstaff. Denver rebounded and earned the eighth seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341. The Nuggets were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs that season.\nFollowing that season, Denver acquired Antonio McDyess in a draft-day trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995\u201396 season for the Atlanta Hawks, Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Mark Jackson, and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the Sacramento Kings prior to the 1996\u201397 season.\n1996\u20132003: Another period of struggle.\nAfter finishing the 1996\u201397 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21\u201361), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns, and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the 1997\u201398, by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23\u2014only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. While the Nuggets would slowly rebuild towards semi-competitiveness, they remained out of the playoffs, with the best record of this time still a game below .500, a 40-42 finish in 2000-2001. However, it would serve merely a brief respite before struggling further, hitting a nadir at the start of the following season when then-coach Dan Issel was forced to resign after making an inflammatory comment towards a heckling fan. It all culminated in the Nuggets tying for the worst record in the NBA in 2002\u201303 with a ghastly 17-65 record, also with the Cavaliers.\nOwnership instability.\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.\nAfter almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Walmart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.\nHowever, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect taxpayers in the event Sturm either died or sold the teams. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market. In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply could not make due to the unstable ownership situation. Under the terms of Strum's purchase agreement, all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty \"and\" Sturm.\nFinally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke in a $450 million deal. Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained a 6.5% interest. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.\n2003\u20132011: The Carmelo Anthony era.\nIn 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2008. In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 months of play in 2002\u201303. Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Nuggets player who assumed general manager duties on August 9, 2001. In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule. They were eliminated in the first round four games to one by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nOn December 28, 2004, head coach Jeff Bzdelik was fired from the organization and replaced by interim coach, former Los Angeles Lakers player and Los Angeles Sparks head coach Michael Cooper. The Nuggets later hired George Karl as a permanent replacement. Karl led the team to a record of 32\u20138 in the second half of the regular season, which vaulted the team into the playoffs for the second consecutive year.\nIn the playoffs, however, the Nuggets could not survive the San Antonio Spurs. After winning game one in San Antonio, the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4\u20131. The Nuggets picked 20th in the 2005 NBA draft; it was acquired from the Washington Wizards via the Orlando Magic. Denver selected Julius Hodge with the pick. The Nuggets also had the 22nd overall selection in the draft, in which they selected Jarrett Jack, but sent him to the Portland Trail Blazers for rights to Portland's 27th overall pick, Linas Kleiza.\nIn 2005\u201306, for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title. This placed the team in the third seed of the Western Conference playoffs. Denver played the Los Angeles Clippers who, despite their sixth seeding, had a better regular season record. As a result, the Clippers received home-court advantage. They defeated the Nuggets in 5 games. Shortly after, the Nuggets announced that general manager Kiki Vandeweghe's contract would not be renewed. He was replaced by Mark Warkentien.\nOn December 18, 2006, team co-captain Carmelo Anthony, shooting guard J. R. Smith and power forward Nen\u00ea were suspended by the NBA (15, 10 and one games respectively) for a fight that occurred in the last two minutes of a game against the New York Knicks two days earlier. The fight was sparked by Knicks rookie Mardy Collins, when he tackled J. R. Smith on a breakaway layup. According to Anthony, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas warned him to not go in the paint shortly before the hard foul.\n2006\u20132008: The Anthony and Iverson duo.\nOn December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval). The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade. On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins, Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for point guard Steve Blake. With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West. However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the sixth seed, giving them a first-round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. In the playoffs, the Nuggets took Game 1 and home-court advantage away from the Spurs. However, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.\nOn March 16, 2008, the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168\u2013116 home win over Seattle SuperSonics. It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)\nThey finished the 2007\u201308 NBA season with exactly 50 wins as well as finishing the first half of that season 25\u201316 (50\u201332 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120\u2013111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season. It was the first time since the 1987\u201388 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season. Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 NBA playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history. It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a Conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57\u201325) in the first round. The seven games separating the Nuggets and the Lakers overall records is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983\u201384. However, the Lakers swept them in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the first round. It was Denver's fifth straight first-round loss.\n2008\u20132011: The Anthony and Billups duo.\nOn July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007\u201308 NBA season, the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman).\nOn November 3, 2008, guard Allen Iverson was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess, and Cheikh Samb (part of the trade exception from the Marcus Camby trade was used to allow the deal to go through). McDyess was waived though on November 10, 2008, and he returned to Detroit shortly afterwards.\nWith Carmelo Anthony averaging 22.8 points per game and Billups averaging 6.4 assists in the 2008\u201309 NBA season the Nuggets accomplished a great number of franchise milestones. Their 54\u201328 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27\u201314 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. General manager Mark Warkentien won the NBA Executive of the Year Award for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs against the New Orleans Hornets, the first time they had home-court advantage since 1988 and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the 2009 NBA playoffs. Chauncey Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series. They went on to beat the Hornets in 5, including a 58-point victory in Game 4 which matched the most lopsided win in NBA playoff history. They then went on to beat the sixth seed Dallas Mavericks four games to one in the Conference Semifinals to make their first trip to the Western Conference Finals since 1985. That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3\u20130 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976. They lost the series 4\u20132, ending Denver's longest playoff run in team history.\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Nuggets traded a first-round draft pick acquired from the Charlotte Bobcats to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rights to rookie Ty Lawson, who was drafted 18th overall. On July 13, 2009, the Nuggets traded a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for Arron Afflalo (part of the trade exception from the Iverson trade was used to allow the deal to go through) and Walter Sharpe. Afflalo replaced starting guard Dahntay Jones, who signed with the Indiana Pacers. However, on August 10, the Nuggets lost forward Linas Kleiza, who signed with Olympiacos Piraeus of the Greek League.\nThe 2009\u201310 season saw Anthony average 28.2 points per game and Billups average a career-high 19.6 points per game. In the opening two games of the season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively. Anthony became one of two players in the Nuggets' history to open with more than 70 points through two games (Alex English also accomplished the feat). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2\u20130. They later went 3\u20130, 4\u20130, and 5\u20130 for the first time since 1985 after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, Indiana Pacers, and New Jersey Nets respectively. Despite injuries that caused all three captains \u2013 Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and Kenyon Martin \u2013 to miss a total of 46 games, and then later on in the second half of the season the absence of head coach George Karl, who underwent treatment for neck and throat cancer, the Nuggets were still able to win 53 games (third consecutive 50-win season, a Nuggets first) for the season which gave them a second consecutive Northwest division title and finished as the fourth seed in the West Conference. However, they were eliminated by the Utah Jazz 4\u20132, their sixth first-round elimination in 7 seasons. Anthony averaged a career-high 30.7 points per game in the playoffs.\nOn July 14, 2010, the Nuggets bolstered their frontcourt depth by signing Al Harrington. During the 2010 off-season, Masai Ujiri replaced Mark Warkentien as the general manager, while Josh Kroenke was named team president.\n2011\u20132015: Period of rebuilding.\nOn February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded alongside Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos. On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with nine players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets won 120\u2013107, where they led by as many as 27 points. In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of \"Who needs Melo?\" George Karl said after the game, \"Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level. We always react to tough situations in a very positive way.\" However, the trade only seemed to make them better. Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork. The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 points per game before the trade to 97.1 points per game for the remainder of the season. Despite the franchise-changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the fifth seed of the Western Conference. They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one.\nThe first full season of the post-Melo Nuggets saw the steady rise of Danilo Gallinari, who averaged 17 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists through the first 25 games of the season, which resulted to the Nuggets' best start through the first 20 games. However, Gallinari sustained injuries to his ankle, thumb, and wrist that year. On March 15, 2012, the Nuggets decided to make their team younger by trading Nen\u00ea, who had played the previous nine seasons for Denver, to the Washington Wizards for JaVale McGee. In his first game as a Nugget, McGee made a putback dunk off an Arron Afflalo miss which proved to be the game-winning basket in Denver's 116\u2013115 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In two of the Nuggets' final games of their season, McGee finally earned national attention when he had a 16-point, 15-rebound effort, and a 21-point, 14-rebound effort in Denver's playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers. These performances helped the Nuggets come back from a 2\u20130 and a 3\u20131 series deficit, but the Nuggets eventually lost in Game 7, 87\u201396.\nOn August 10, 2012, Denver was involved in a four-team trade where they received All-Star Andre Iguodala and sent Arron Afflalo and Al Harrington to the Orlando Magic. This same trade also sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the trade, Iguodala tweeted \"I'm excited to be joining the Denver Nuggets and I know my best basketball is ahead of me!\" Despite losing their first three games, the 2012\u20132013 Nuggets finished with a franchise-best 57\u201325 record, and a 38\u20133 record in Pepsi Center (the Washington Wizards, Miami Heat, and Minnesota Timberwolves were the only 3 visitors to defeat Denver on their home during the regular season). Denver also clinched the third seed in the Western Conference, with a first-round matchup with the Golden State Warriors. The Nuggets won Game 1 97\u201395 on their home court on a last-second Andre Miller game-winner, but the Warriors won the next three games, putting the Nuggets on the brink of elimination. Denver won Game 5 at home to keep their season alive, but the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in Game 6, winning 92\u201388 in Oakland. It was Denver's ninth first-round loss in the previous 10 seasons, and the eighth of Karl's tenure. Although Karl won that year's NBA Coach of the Year Award and had led Denver to the playoffs in every year of his nine-year tenure, it was not enough to keep him from being fired after the season.\nAlong with Karl being fired, Denver saw a major shake-up in the front office with Executive of the Year Masai Ujiri accepting the general manager position with the Toronto Raptors and vice-president Pete D'Alessandro, who was expected to replace Ujiri, being named general manager of the Sacramento Kings. On June 21, 2013, Tim Connelly was announced as the new general manager. To replace Karl, the Nuggets hired the Indiana Pacers' associate head coach, former NBA player, Brian Shaw. Guard-forward Andre Iguodala was sent to the Golden State Warriors in a sign-and-trade in which they acquired guard Randy Foye from the Utah Jazz. They also signed center-forward JJ Hickson, who was previously with the Portland Trail Blazers and guard Nate Robinson, who played for the Bulls during the 2012\u20132013 season. They also acquired Darrell Arthur from the Memphis Grizzlies and 55th pick Joffrey Lauvergne in return for Kosta Koufos. In a tough 2013\u201314 season which saw numerous injuries to key players missing a significant amount of the season, the Nuggets finished with 36 wins, their worst in 11 years, and missed the playoffs.\nDuring the 2014 off-season, the Nuggets brought back Arron Afflalo for whom they traded Evan Fournier. During the 2014 NBA draft, Denver traded their first lottery pick (11th overall pick) since 2003 to Chicago to acquire two later first-round draft picks, which were used to draft Jusuf Nurki\u0107 and Gary Harris; with the 41st overall pick and their first pick of the second round of the draft, the Nuggets selected 19-year old Nikola Joki\u0107 from Mega Basket in Serbia. On March 3, 2015, general manager Tim Connelly announced the Nuggets fired head coach Brian Shaw and named Melvin Hunt interim head coach. Joki\u0107 would end up being one of the biggest draft steals in NBA history.\n2015\u2013present: The Nikola Joki\u0107 era.\n2015\u20132018: Early years.\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets. Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded. On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months. The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernang\u00f3mez.\nUnder Michael Malone's leadership, the Denver Nuggets slightly started to improve while primarily relying on the youth movement consisting of Emmanuel Mudiay, Nikola Joki\u0107, Gary Harris and later also on the recovered Jusuf Nurki\u0107. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that both Mudiay and Joki\u0107 would participate in BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star 2016. On February 18, the Denver Nuggets announced that they decided to trade veteran shooting guard Randy Foye to Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for D. J. Augustin, Steve Novak and two second-round draft picks. One day later, JJ Hickson and the newly acquired Novak were waived.\nOver the course of the 2016 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets added the Kentucky guard Jamal Murray as well as Juan Hernang\u00f3mez, Malik Beasley, and Petr Cornelie. Meanwhile, their 56th pick was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On February 13, 2017, Nurki\u0107 was traded, along with the rights to the Memphis Grizzlies' 2017 first-round draft pick, to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Mason Plumlee, a 2018 second-round pick and cash considerations. Thanks to the continuing improvements of Nikola Joki\u0107, the Nuggets would make significant improvements to their team, although they would be just one game shy from reaching the 2017 NBA playoffs, finishing 9th in the Western Conference.\nOn June 15, 2017, the Nuggets officially promoted both Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas and Tim Connelly to become the team's newest general manager and president of basketball operations respectively. In the 2017 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets selected Tyler Lydon, Vlatko \u010can\u010dar, and Mont\u00e9 Morris, with the 24th, 49th, and 51st picks respectively. On December 2, 2017, the Nuggets would retire Fat Lever's number during their 115\u2013100 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite compiling their first winning season since 2013, they missed the 2018 playoffs, the fifth straight missed playoff run, after losing to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a win-or-go-home situation in the regular season finale, also ending the Timberwolves' 14-year playoff drought. The Nuggets finished 9th, one game behind the eighth seeded Timberwolves.\n2018\u20132020: Rise of Nikola Joki\u0107.\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the Nuggets drafted Michael Porter Jr. and traded with the Magic to get Jarred Vanderbilt. On January 31, 2019, Joki\u0107 received his first All-Star selection as a Western Conference reserve for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the Nuggets' first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2011. The Nuggets finished the 2018\u20132019 season with 54 wins, first in their division and second in the Western Conference, and made the playoffs for the first time since 2012\u20132013. In the first round, the Nuggets played against the San Antonio Spurs, winning the round in game seven. The Nuggets were eliminated in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games. Game three of the second round had four overtimes, tying a 1953 game for the longest NBA playoff game.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Nuggets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season. Led by Joki\u0107 and Murray, the team is the first in NBA playoff history to consecutively come from 3\u20131 deficits. In the first round, they defeated Utah in 7 games in a record-breaking scoring duel between Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell. The Nuggets repeated the same feat against Paul George and Kawhi Leonard of the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round, becoming the only team in NBA history to overcome multiple 3\u20131 deficits in a single playoff run. In the Western Conference Finals, the Nuggets' title race came to an end, after the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers trounced them in five games.\n2020\u20132022: Joki\u0107's back-to-back MVP seasons.\nIn the 2020\u201321 NBA season, Joki\u0107 was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, becoming the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 and the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the award. He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece), and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Tim Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Nowitzki of Germany, and Antetokounmpo of Greece). Joki\u0107 also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41, and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era draft, to win the MVP award. Although the Nuggets finished the season with the third seed in the Western Conference and beat their first round opponents, the Portland Trail Blazers, in six games, the loss of starting guard Jamal Murray to an ACL tear contributed to the team's sweep by the eventual Western Conference champions, the second-seeded Phoenix Suns.\nThe following season saw more poor injury luck for the Denver Nuggets. Nine games into the season, starting forward Michael Porter Jr. joined Murray on the sidelines with season-ending back surgery. In spite of the injuries, Joki\u0107 and starting power forward Aaron Gordon carried the Nuggets to the sixth seed, the former becoming the first-ever player in NBA history to accumulate 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, and 500 assists in a single season. Joki\u0107 went on to receive the Kia MVP Award for the second year in a row \u2013 joining 12 other players in NBA history to achieve the award in back to back years, and the first center to do so since Moses Malone in 1982 and 1983. In the first round of the playoffs, Joki\u0107's Nuggets fell five games to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the championship.\n2022\u20132023: First NBA title.\nIn the 2022\u201323 season, elevated by the offseason acquisitions of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Bruce Brown, the Nuggets secured the top seed in the Western Conference with 53 wins and 29 losses, two games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies. The Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 4\u20131 in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, before defeating the Phoenix Suns 4\u20132 in the Conference Semifinals. The Nuggets' playoff dominance continued in the Conference Finals; spearheaded by outstanding play from Joki\u0107, who was named the Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, the team swept the Los Angeles Lakers in four games to advance to their first ever NBA Finals. This also marked the first time that the Nuggets had beaten the Lakers in a playoff series (having previously been 0\u20137 against them), as well as the first playoff series sweep in franchise history. In the NBA Finals, on June 12, 2023, the Nuggets would beat the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4\u20131 to win their first NBA championship, with Joki\u0107 receiving the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.\n2023\u20132025: Back-to-back chase and Jokic's third MVP season.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, the first season in league history with the Nuggets as defending champions, Denver finished with the 2nd seed in the Western Conference with a 57\u201325 record, tying with the Oklahoma City Thunder and finishing 1 game ahead of the Minnesota Timberwolves. On May 8, 2024, Nikola Joki\u0107 won his third Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the ninth player to do so and tying with other greats such as Moses Malone and Larry Bird. The Nuggets faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round and defeated them in five games. In the series, Jamal Murray finished the Lakers with a game-winning buzzer-beater over Anthony Davis to complete a 20-point comeback in Game 2, and later hit another game-winner in Game 5 to eliminate the Lakers. Next, they faced the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. Along the way, Murray hit a half-court shot in Game 4 to end halftime and stared at \"NBA on TNT\" announcer Kevin Harlan. The Nuggets ultimately blew a 20-point lead in Game 7 and lost to the Timberwolves.\n2024\u20132025: Change of head coach.\nWith the 22nd overall pick, the Phoenix Suns drafted DaRon Holmes II from Dayton. He was later traded to the Nuggets for the 28th overall pick (Ryan Dunn), the 56th overall pick, a 2026 second-round pick, and a 2031 second-round pick. DaRon Holmes II tore his Achilles in the NBA Summer League. Nikola Joki\u0107 of the Denver Nuggets achieved a historic feat on March 7, 2025, becoming the first NBA player to record a game with at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, and 20 assists. Nuggets notably signed former MVP Russell Westbrook. They lost a reliable shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. \nOn April 8th, 2025, the Nuggets fired both head coach Michael Malone, and general manager Calvin Booth. In the 2024-25 season, Denver finished with the 4th seed in the Western Conference with a 50-32 record, tying with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Los Angeles Clippers, and 1 game ahead of the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the first round, they played the Los Angeles Clippers and won in seven games. On the way to winning the series, Aaron Gordon scored a buzzer-beating dunk in Game 4. Next, they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round, where Gordon stunned the Thunder crowd with a game-winning three-pointer in Game 1. The Nuggets ended up losing the series in seven games to the eventual champions. The Nuggets hired their interim head coach David Adelman as their official new head coach.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Nuggets. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Denver Nuggets seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nColors, logos and uniforms.\nThe Nuggets have displayed numerous color schemes, logos, and uniforms throughout their franchise history, including their days in the American Basketball Association (ABA) as the \"Denver Rockets.\"\n1967\u20131974: Denver Rockets (ABA).\nFrom 1967\u201368 through 1970\u201371, the Denver Rockets' logos, uniforms, and colors were black, orange, and white. From 1971\u201372 through 1973\u201374, the Rockets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms, and their logo featured a cartoonish rocket bouncing a gold and purple basketball, with a purple and white snow-capped mountain in the background.\n1974\u20131982: Maxie The Miner.\nDuring the Nuggets' final two seasons in the ABA, the team's logo featured a cartoonish miner known as \"Maxie The Miner,\" with a large red beard, a pick-axe in one hand and a red and blue basketball in the other hand. When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976\u201377 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n1982\u20131993: Rainbow City Skyline.\nFrom 1982\u201383 through 1992\u201393, the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"Tetris\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of Dikembe Mutombo, the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the 2012\u201313 season.\n1993\u20132003: Navy blue, metallic gold and maroon.\nFor the 1993\u201394 season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms. The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n2003\u20132018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold.\nFor the 2003\u201304 season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with Carmelo Anthony's debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark \"(see previous section)\", was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest\u2014it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the 2008\u201309 season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993 to 2003. These jerseys were used until the 2014\u201315 season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the 2017\u201318 season.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick-axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"mountain peaks\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the 2011\u201312 season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the 2018\u201319 season.\nWhile the \"pick axe\" logo was officially introduced in 2005, former NBA director of creative services Tom O'Grady had planned on introducing the logo as early as 1998, but then-NBA commissioner David Stern was not informed of the possible logo change. As a result, the logo was shelved until it was brought in as an alternate seven years later.\nFor the 2012\u201313 season, the Nuggets unveiled a gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. This jersey featured a return to the Denver \"rainbow skyline\" logo, but used the team's \"Aachen\" typeface and color scheme of powder blue, navy and gold.\nFor the 2015\u201316 season, the Nuggets modified the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold \"Nuggets\" script on the home white jersey and a gold \"Denver\" script on the powder blue away jersey\u2014both with the \"Coliseum\" typeface. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white. The numerals were also modified with the Coliseum typeface, but remained white, with powder blue interior trim and navy blue exterior outlining.\nThe Nuggets updated their uniforms for the 2017\u201318 season. The light uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Association\" jersey), the dark uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Icon\" jersey) and the alternate uniform (dubbed by Nike as the \"Statement\" jersey) saw the return of navy blue as a primary color for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season, while powder blue was drastically diminished and relegated to trim color status. Slight tweaks were made to the striping and lettering. The Nuggets' gold \"Statement\" jersey made some noticeable alterations as well, relegating the navy, powder blue and white rainbow to the sides and relocating the number to the bottom. Western Union became the team's jersey sponsor.\n2018\u2013present: Evolved new identity.\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, the Nuggets modified their logos and uniforms, featuring various color schemes that the team has worn in their history. The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)\u2014the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos. Powder blue, which had been part of the team's color scheme since 2003, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms. The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim. Both sets also include mountain peak striping on the shorts and the pick axe logo on the waistline. The skyline blue \"Statement\" jersey features \"Mile High City\" in white surrounding sunshine yellow numbers, plus a midnight blue mountain peak silhouette and a sunshine yellow pick axe logo on the sides of the shorts. A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline. The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993. The colors on the circular pick axe logo were also modified with the team's new color scheme.\nPrior to the 2022\u201323 season, the \"Statement\" uniform was slightly tweaked with greater usage of gold on the letters, and red on the trim and mountain silhouette. Two \"gold strikes\" were also added between the words \"Mile High City\".\nCity Edition uniforms.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, Nike released a fourth uniform option known as the \"City\" series, which is updated annually. The Nuggets' first \"City\" uniform had a navy base, highlighting the pick-axe and mountain logo in front and incorporating sublimated mountain peak patterns on the shorts.\nThe Nuggets' 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform was a callback to the team's 1982\u201393 rainbow uniforms, featuring a sublimated pattern of the rainbow logo and navy lettering. The same design was used for the 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, albeit with a black base and white letters; this uniform was reused during the 2025\u201326 season.\nFor 2020\u201321, the Nuggets kept the same \"City\" uniform design but eliminated the rainbow pattern and went with a red/yellow/orange gradient within the mountains and a flatirons red base.\nThe Nuggets were one of 27 teams to receive mashup \"City\" uniforms as part of the NBA's 75th anniversary during the 2021\u201322 season. Denver's uniform featured various design takes from past uniforms, including the throwback \"Nuggets\" wordmark and rainbow pattern from the 1980s uniforms, navy blue and stylized numbers from the 1993\u20132003 uniforms, Maxie the Miner and striping based on the ABA Nuggets uniforms, and the powder blue and \"DN\" alternate logo from the 2000s uniforms.\nFor the 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets wore white uniforms with navy letters, gold and red trim, and royal blue/white gradient stripes. The uniform was inspired by Denver's iconic architecture and its civic organizations.\nFor their 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets revisited the mountain-themed motif from their 1980s \"Rainbow\" uniforms. The black-based design featured sublimated blue lines representing the Rocky Mountains, and \"5280\" below in gold to symbolize Denver's high elevation. Other elements include a secondary team logo on the shorts, \"Denver\" wordmark on the waistband, white numbers above the left chest, and burgundy stripes. The uniform would be worn for select games, and in home games during the 2023 NBA in-season tournament, it would be paired with a specially-painted alternate blue court with a gold middle strip and the silhouette of the NBA Cup.\nAs part of the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, the Nuggets revisited the \"Rainbow\" theme last seen in the 2018\u20132020 \"City\" uniforms, as well as last season's \"5280\" uniform. The white-based uniform featured \"5280\" in white trimmed in black along with rainbow mountain accents along the text and sides.\n2020 Earned Edition uniforms.\nAs a reward for making the NBA playoffs the previous season, 16 teams were given an exclusive fifth or sixth uniform option: the \"Earned\" uniform. The Nuggets, having qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given this option in the 2020\u201321 season. The white-based design featured a modified pickaxe logo, with the top half in skyline blue and the bottom half in flatirons red. Names are written in blue and numbers are written in red with gold trim.\nMascot.\nRocky The Mountain Lion has been the official team mascot since the 1990-1991 season. He was introduced to Nuggets fans on December 15, 1990 in a losing effort to the Phoenix Suns. He is best known for being the highest paid mascot in the NBA and for his beef with former NBA player and Hall of Famer Charles Barkley.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Nuggets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72884", "revid": "36068529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72884", "title": "Zacatecas (city)", "text": "City in Zacatecas, Mexico\nZacatecas () is the principal city within the municipality in Mexico of the same name, and the capital of the state of Zacatecas. Located in north-central Mexico, the city had its start as a Spanish mining camp in the mid-16th century. Native Americans had already known about the area's rich deposits of silver and other minerals. Due to the wealth that the mines provided, Zacatecas quickly became one of the most important mining cities in New Spain. The area saw battles during the turbulent 19th century, but the next major event was the Battle of Zacatecas during the Mexican Revolution when Francisco Villa captured the town, an event still celebrated every anniversary. Today, the colonial part of the city is a World Heritage Site, due to the Baroque and other structures built during its mining days. Mining still remains an important industry. The name Zacatecas is derived from the Zacateco people and has its roots in Nahuatl. The name means \"people of the grasslands\".\nHistory.\nIndigenous peoples.\nThe first people to populate the area arrived approximately 10,000 years ago, when the climate was wetter and warmer, with different vegetation and wildlife. Eventually, the area came to be dominated by Chichimeca tribes such as the Caxcans, Guachichils, Guamares, Huichols, Zacatecos and others, with the Zacatecos being the most numerous in the area of the city today. These peoples were mining silver and other metals in the hills long before the Europeans arrived, making the area important in pre-Columbian times.\nColonial period.\nThe Spanish came to the Zacatecas area via Guadalajara. In 1540, Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n traveled from Mexico City conquering what are now the states of Michoac\u00e1n and Jalisco. One of Guzm\u00e1n's lieutenants, Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate, conquered the area around what is now Guadalajara. Another, Pedro Almindes Chirinos Peralmindes, went to explore the lands to the north, taking Zacatecas with little trouble but not knowing of the riches underneath the soil. And the area initially was simply frontier. Other expeditions followed, including one by Juan de Tolosa in 1546, who brought back rock samples from Cerro de la Bufa, which were determined to contain high concentrations of silver and lead. A mining camp was soon established at the foot of Cerro de la Bufa. The Zacatecos initially fought the permanent presence of the Spanish, but the mining potential of the area strengthened the Europeans\u2019 resolve and the natives were defeated in the 1540s. Surveys of the other surrounding hills were undertaken by Tolosa, Diego de Ibarra, Baltasar Temi\u00f1o de Ba\u00f1uelos, Andr\u00e9s de Villanueva and others.\nA military mining camp was formally established in 1548 and called Minas de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Remedios. The first major vein of silver was found in 1548 in a mine called San Bernab\u00e9. This was followed by similar finds in mines called Albarrada de San Benito, Vetagrande, P\u00e1nuco and others. This brought a large number of people to Zacatecas, including craftsmen, merchants, clerics and adventurers. In 1550, royalty found its way to Zacatecas in the person of Leonor Cort\u00e9s Moctezuma, the illegitimate daughter of conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Isabel Moctezuma, daughter of the Aztec emperor. Do\u00f1a Leonor married Juan de Tolosa. The settlement grew over the space of a few years into one of the most important cities in New Spain and the most populous after Mexico City. The camp became a parish in 1550, in 1585, then it was declared a city with the name of \"Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Zacatecas\" (Very Noble and Loyal City of Our Lady of Zacatecas), receiving its coat of arms from Philip II of Spain at the same time. The success of the mines led to the arrival of indigenous people and the importation of black slaves to work in them. The mining camp spread southwards along the course of the Arroyo de la Plata, which now lies underneath Hidalgo Avenue, the old town's main road. Tall buildings were constructed along here due to the lack of flat area on which to build. The first house was supposedly built in 1547, just before the fortress and metal foundry. Hospitals and hospices were built in the 1550s.\nZacatecas was one of the richest states in Mexico. One of the most important mines from the colonial period is the El Ed\u00e9n mine. It began operations in 1586 in the Cerro de la Bufa. It principally produced gold and silver with most of its production occurring in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, the opening of this mine is within the city limits and was closed to mining in 1960. It was reopened as a tourist attraction in 1975.\nBy the end of the 16th century, the city was the second most important, after Mexico City, and the income its mines produced for the Spanish Crown made it one of the most powerful in Europe. Its importance was not only due to mining. Most of the mendicant religious orders in New Spain eventually established monasteries, making Zacatecas an important center for evangelization. The Franciscans arrived in 1558, the Augustinians in 1576 and the Dominicans in 1604. Many of the missionary expeditions to what are now California and Texas came from this city.\nOver the rest of the colonial period, the riches from the ground financed the building of important religious and secular constructions. The peak of this construction occurred in the 18th century. One of these constructions is the Colegio de San Luis Gonzaga, which was established in 1796.\nMexican War of Independence.\nIgnacio L\u00f3pez Ray\u00f3n led a group of Mexican rebels capturing the city of Zacatecas on April 15, 1811, early in the fight for Mexican independence from Spain. V\u00edctor Rosales and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cos were leaders of Hidalgo's rebellion. Shortly after Independence, the Mexican government established the city of Zacatecas as the capital of the newly formed state of Zacatecas.\n19th century.\nIn the mid-1820s, institutions such as the first opera house, first teachers\u2019 college, the state treasury, the state supreme court and other institutions were founded in the city when the first state constitution was signed. The first newspaper in the state started circulation herein 1825. The municipality was established in 1825.\nFrom the end of the War of Independence until nearly the end of the 19th century, liberals or federalists and conservatives, who favored centralized rule from Mexico City, battled for control of Zacatecas. In 1835, then-liberal Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna defeated the troops of Francisco Garcia Salinas. During the Reform War, the city was taken by conservative general Miguel Miram\u00f3n.\nThe first railroad connecting Zacatecas with Guadalupe was completed in 1880. Connections with Mexico City and El Paso by rail were established in 1884.\nMexican Revolution.\nDuring the Mexican Revolution, Zacatecas was the scene of the Battle of Zacatecas in 1914, pitting the rebel forces of Francisco Villa against the government forces of Victoriano Huerta. Zacatecas was the last stronghold of the Huerta forces, which the Divisi\u00f3n del Norte arrived on June 19, 1914, from Torre\u00f3n.\nTaking the city would clear the way for Villa to proceed to Mexico City. Villa's forces were under the direct command of General Felipe \u00c1ngeles, and Huerta's forces were under the command of General Luis Medina Barr\u00f3n. From the 19th to the 23rd, General Medina used a light beacon brought from the port city of Veracruz to light the hills at night looking for rebel positions. The battle began at 10:00\u00a0a.m. on the 23rd with rebel cannon fire. Over 22,000 rebel troops then approached the city from four directions, from the mountains known as La Bufa, La Sierpe, Loreto and La Tierra Negra. The battle continued until about 5:00 that afternoon, when Huerta's troops began to abandon their positions, and the Divisi\u00f3n del Norte took the strategic hills of La Bufa and El Grillo, entering the city. The rebels sacked the city and destroyed a number of buildings. Battle casualties were about 5,000 for Huerta's troops and about 3,000 for the rebels.\nAfter the Mexican Revolution, the city of Zacatecas decided to revive the original seal granted to it by Philip II, and make it the seal of both the city and the state. It had been discarded after the War of Independence. The \"Marcha Ar\u00e9chiga\" or \"Marcha Zacatecas\" written by Genaro Codina in the early 20th century, became the semi official anthem of the city and state.\n20th century.\nThe old Instituto de Ciencias was refounded as the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Zacatecas in 1968, and an international airport was constructed in 1970.\nThe anniversary of the city had been celebrated on the day of the Virgin of Zapopan, who was the patron until 1975. Since then the patron has been changed to the Virgin del Patrocinio, who is celebrated on the same day.\nThe city center was named a World Heritage Site in 1993. UNESCO's websites states the following as justification. \"Founded in 1546 after the discovery of a rich silver lode, Zacatecas reached the height of its prosperity in the 16th and 17th centuries. Built on the steep slopes of a narrow valley, the town has views of the area. There are also several old buildings, both religious and civil. The cathedral, built between 1730 and 1760, dominates downtown. It is notable for its harmonious design and the Baroque profusion of its fa\u00e7ades, where European and indigenous decorative elements are found side by side.\"\nZacatecas has had a number of earthquakes since the colonial period. The last occurred in 1995 and caused minor damage.\n21st century.\nIn 2009, the city council approved the logotype of the new administration with includes the Virgin of Zacatecas image. However, since then it has been claimed that the new logo violates Article 5 of the Zacatecas constitution and Article 10 of a law called \"Bando de Polic\u00eda y Buen Gobierno\". Another objection is that the new seal contains the colors yellow and black, those of the political party of the municipal president.\nThe city has grown to the point where houses now balance on the edge of a creek and over the mounds of waste from mines. This is possible due to the lack of regulation and urban planning by authorities. Irregularities exist in 85% of the city's neighborhoods but the neighborhoods of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Minera, CNOP, Lomas de la Pimienta, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega have the largest number of them. Many of these buildings have structural and infrastructure problems such as flooding during rains and the damage this creates.\nThe city.\nThe city is called \"con rostro de cantera rosa y coraz\u00f3n de plata\" (with a face of pink stone and a heart of silver) because of the pink stone that many of its iconic buildings are made of and the silver that has spurred its development and history. Like other mining cities in Mexico, such as Guanajuato and Taxco, the city was built near the mines on very rough terrain. It is at the foot of the Cerro de la Bufa, in which was one of the greatest silver mines in the world. Instead of having an orderly plan of streets, the Spanish settlement followed the old Indian neighborhoods with narrow streets and alleys squeezed into a large ravine or \"ca\u00f1ada\". Without attempting to modify the rough terrain, development also ran up the hills. The main road through town aligns north\u2013south along the Arroyo de la Plata, with the rest of the city filled with small winding alleys and streets and tiny plazas. Many of the alleys have names that refer to local legends, such as the \"Callej\u00f3n del Indio Triste\" (Alley of the Sad Indian) and \"Callej\u00f3n del Mono Prieto\" (Alley of the Dark Monkey). The only really open space is the main plaza. Even here, it is not possible to stand back far enough to see the whole Baroque fa\u00e7ade of the main cathedral.\nAround the city are the Brittany hills or small mountains that contain silver and other minerals such as the Cerro de la Virgen, Cerro de Cl\u00e9rigos, Cerro del Grillo, Cerro del Padre and Cerro de la Bufa. These hills are starkly barren of vegetation, due to the semi-desert climate. The city is known for its clear air and clean streets, with garbage cans placed every ten meters in the city center.\nThis city, along with Guanajuato and Taxco are along a route called the \"Ruta de la Plata\" or Silver Route. These cities are distinguished not only for silver but for the conservation of their colonial fa\u00e7ades and narrow streets. Zacatecas conserves many of its original structures from the colonial period such as churches, colonial government buildings and monasteries and mansions built by rich miners in pink stone. Most of these buildings were constructed in the 18th century, when the silver flowing out of the mines was at its highest. These buildings have made the historic center of the city a World Heritage Site.\nHistoric sites and attractions.\nThe Cerro de la Bufa, with its El Ed\u00e9n mine, is one of the most important symbols of the city and was the scene of the Battle of Zacatecas (called the Toma de Zacatecas in Spanish) in which Francisco Villa emerged victorious in 1914. At the top of this mountain is a museum and statues honoring P\u00e1nfilo Natera, Francisco Villa and Felipe \u00c1ngeles, which are related to this event. The site also contains an observatory, the Mausoleo de los Hombres Ilustres and the Chapel of Virgen del Patrocinio.\nThe El Ed\u00e9n mine began operations in 1586 and principally produced gold and silver. According to legend the devil is supposed to be found in this parts due to the sound made when the wind whistles around the rocks. While operations began in the 16th century, its peak was reached in the 17th and 18th centuries. Despite the fact that there is still a significant amount of minerals left to extract, mining operations ceased in 1960, because the entrance is located in the middle of the city making this too hazardous. In 1975, the mine was converted into a tourist attraction. Today, visitors can take a small train which leads into the mountain for about a half a kilometer, then walk with a guide along some of the narrow passages. One of the things to see is an altar to the Santo Ni\u00f1o de Atocha. At night, the former rock crushing room of the mine has been converted into a nightclub.\nThe Toma de Zacatecas Museum is located on Cerro de la Bufa, which played at part in the Battle of Zacatecas during the Mexican Revolution. The museum was opened in 1984 and contains many articles from this battle as well as some from the Cristero War. Inside are clothing and uniforms, arms such as shotguns, mousers and cannons, historic maps of Zacatecas and newspaper and photographs from the era. Photographs include those of Juana Gallo, who was a heroine of the Cristero War. Some battles from this conflict also took place on Cerro de la Bufa. The museum is fronted by the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n, which contains statues of Francisco Villa and two other generals who successfully led the attack on the city. The building housing the museum was originally the Casa de la Caridad y Hospital de Pobres. Next to the museum is the Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Patrocinio, an old hermitage from the 16th century. Its fa\u00e7ade is Baroque with two levels. The Observatorio Meteorol\u00f3gico is mostly used to observe weather phenomenon.\nBetween Cerro de la Bufa and Cerro del Grillo is an aerial tramway or cable car that provides panoramic views of the city below. This cable car extends for about 650\u00a0meters, is called \"El Telef\u00e9rico\" and was constructed in 1979 by the Swiss. The ride lasts about eight minutes, but does not operate when there are high winds.\nCathedral.\nIn the city proper just south of the main plaza, is the cathedral, which is located over the ruins of pre-Hispanic temples. The current structure dates from 1752 and has a fa\u00e7ade of sculpted pink stone. The best time to appreciate the fa\u00e7ade is in the late afternoon when the sun shines directly on it. This church is considered to be one of the best examples of Mexican Churrigueresque architecture. The first parish church was built on this site between 1567 and 1585, but it was in ruins by the beginning of the 17th century. A second church was built between 1612 and 1625 and was called the Chapel of Santo Cristo. The remains of this construction can be seen in the first level of the south tower and the main fa\u00e7ade. The current cathedral was begun in 1729 with main fa\u00e7ade finished in 1745 but not opened to worship until 1752.\nThe cathedral is attributed to Domingo Xim\u00e9nez Hern\u00e1ndez and is a testament to the wealth that the city had in the 18th century. Later on, additions were made. The dome was rebuilt in 1848 and the south tower was completed in 1904, by D\u00e1maso Mu\u00f1et\u00f3n. The 19th-century dome is an imitation of the dome of the Church of Loreto in Mexico City. The church achieved cathedral status in 1862, and was declared a national monument in 1935. In 1965, the building was robbed of many of its precious metal items, which were never recovered.\nThe cathedral is eighty-five meters high and entirely constructed of pink sandstone. It has three naves with three main portals. The main fa\u00e7ade has three levels supported by three Solomonic columns with flank niches. At the crest is a cross. The first level has three columns decorated with vines and angels. In its niches are statues of the Four Evangelists. The second level has columns formed by shells, acanthus and vines. The choir window is found here framed by stonework. The third level has an image of Christ with two of the Apostles flanked by solomonic columns decorated with leaves, caryatids and cherubs. The plaza side portal has two levels with stone columns and a sculpted scene of the crucified Christ with the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. The market side portal is Baroque and is dedicated to the Virgen del Patrocinio, patron of the city. The interior has a Latin cross layout with two naves and with the roof supported by Doric order columns. The altarpieces are made of stone in Neoclassical style. The main altar is dedicated to the Eucharist with side altars dedicated to the Holy Christ and the Virgin of Zacatecas. The American author Mrs. John Wesley Butler, in her book \"Historic Churches in Mexico\" tells us that the artist who designed the fa\u00e7ade was French. This individual, condemned to death for some grave problem was able to get the execution postponed until he finished his work on the cathedral. He was able to continue the work for twenty-one years, being watched constantly by custodians and sentries while he worked. Finally bored with such a life, he declared one day that he was ready to be executed. But because of his work on the Cathedral fa\u00e7ade he was not executed but received a pardon. The neighborhood showered him with gifts and banquets in his honor. Yet he was not content and desired to return to France. Unfortunately when all was ready for his departure he suddenly died. Where Mrs. Butler got this story is not known, since longtime residents of Zacatecas disclaim all knowledge of it.\nBuildings and Plaza de Armas.\nThe main square is called the Plaza de Armas, with the most important buildings such as the State Government Palace, the State Congress, the cathedral and others surrounding it. What is now the State Government Palace was constructed at the beginning of the 18th century as the residence of the Count de la Laguna. The exterior is marked by its red roof, and the interior has a courtyard surrounded by arches and a stairwell with a mural depicting the history of the state. This mural was painted in 1970 by Antonio Pintor Rodr\u00edguez.\nOne of the mansions that line the main plaza is called the \"Palacio de la Mala Noche\", which belonged to a miner named Jos\u00e9 Manuel de R\u00e9tegui in the 18th century. The name comes from a legend that states that the owner fell into poverty and one night decided to commit suicide. When he was at the point to doing so, he was informed that a rich vein had been found in one of his mines. Its fa\u00e7ade has balconies and windows elaborated in sandstone. The main balcony is a half octagon. Today it houses the state supreme court. Another prominent mansion is the old house of Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega, which stands next to the cathedral and today is part of the governor's mansion.\nMarket.\nOn the other side of the cathedral is the Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega Market, which was constructed in 1889 and still conserves its original fa\u00e7ade. Originally, it was a traditional Mexican style market but has since been modernized into a mall with stores selling crafts, silver, leather, Zacatecas wine, antiques, charreada gear, Huichol needlework and regional sweets. There are also restaurants which offer regional dishes such as gorditas, asado de boda, pozole verde, pacholes, gorditas rellenas and enchiladas zacatecanas, filled with pork or cheese and covered in a sauce made with poblano, guajillo or ancho chili peppers. The interior of the building has two floors with wrought iron columns and the fa\u00e7ade is French style fronted by the Plazoleta Goitia. Another market for crafts is the Casa de Artesanias in front of the Temple of San Agust\u00edn, which sells wool serapes, masks, Huichol figures, wood boxes, ceramics and more.\nChurches.\nThe former Temple of San Francisco was founded in 1568 as first monastery in Zacatecas, the monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the primary function of evangelization. It was inaugurated on January 12, 1707, but some parts of the buildings (such as the south tower) were not really completed until the 19th century. Today the monastery complex houses a museum but the church is in ruins. The vault of the central nave has fallen and many of its rooms and corridors are in ruins.\nThe church of St. Agustine (ex-templo de San Agust\u00edn) was built by the religious order of San Agust\u00edn which arrived in the City of Zacatecas in 1575; was consecrated in 1617 and was refurbished and re-consecrated in 1782. The building has been attributed to Andres Manuel de la Riva, who built La Valenciana Church and monastery in Guanajuato. After the Reform Laws, the complex was sold to private buyers who turned it into a pool hall and hotel or apartments. In 1882, it was sold again, this time to the American Presbyterian Society, which demolished the main fa\u00e7ade because it did not represent the concepts of that society. The Catholic Church regained possession in 1942 and it is now the Bishop's palace. Reconstruction efforts began in 1948 and continued sporadically until 1969. Only part of the monastery complex survives and is home to the Rafael Coronel Museum. The right side fa\u00e7ade of the church remains, worked in sculpted stone, with the scene of St. Agustine being converted to Christianity. Inside, the church has distinctive arches as well as a cupola and side portal. The sacristy contains some of the sculptures from the original main fa\u00e7ade. It also contains a collection of colonial artwork and hosts exhibitions.\nThe Temple of Santo Domingo Jesuit church of Santo Domingo, built between 1746 and 1749 by Cayetano de Sig\u00fcenza. It is known locally as the Parish of the Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n. The Church of Santo Domingo is built over a solid platform, which makes it look more monumental. It was taken over by the Dominicans when the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in the 18th century. It would substitute for the cathedral when it was in construction. It has a sober Baroque portal, with altarpieces and paintings in its interior. Attached to this church is the monastery building of the Company of Jesus, which contains the current Pedro Coronel Museum. Inside the church are eight Churrigueresque altars, which are carved of wood and gilded with gold mined from the Cerro del Grillo. However, the main altar is Neoclassical. The Churringueresque altars are attributed to Felipe de Ure\u00f1a and his son-in-law, Juan Garc\u00eda de Casta\u00f1eda.\nTheater.\nThe Calder\u00f3n Theater was built to replace a theater which had burned in the late 1880s (where the Gonz\u00e1lez Ortega Market is now). The theater has been in operation since then, having hosted famous performers such as \u00c1ngela Peralta. The building is built in a Renaissance revival style and has a hall with large mirrors made in Venice.\nOther attractions.\nThere are also a number of lesser known landmarks in the city. The first city park is the Alameda Trinidad Garc\u00eda de la Cadena, which was built in the early 19th century. The Enrique Estrada General Park contains an enormous kiosk. The Meson de Jobito is a 19th-century building which is part of the garden dedicated to Benito Ju\u00e1rez. The former Bern\u00e1rdez Hacienda now contains an artisans\u2019 school which specializes in the making of silver items. Other mines that can be visited include La Esperanza, which extends 520\u00a0meters inside Cerro del Grillo. The Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de F\u00e1tima is an example of the relatively rare Gothic architecture in Mexico. The Mauricio Magdaleno Public Library is in a 19th-century building which served as the granary. The fa\u00e7ade contains an image of a winged Victory.\nThe former Plaza de Toros and El Cubo aqueduct are located on one side of the Cerro de la Bufa. The Plaza de Toros bullring was inaugurated in 1866 and conserves much of its original architecture. Events featuring bullfighters such as Lino Zamora, Epifanio del Rio, Eloy Cavazos, Manolo Mart\u00ednez and Curro Rivera were held here. However, the plaza was eventually closed in 1975, and abandoned. After eleven years, it was almost demolished but it was instead rehabilitated and converted into a hotel and place to hold events. The Hotel Quinta Real was built by Mexicans Ricardo and Roberto El\u00edas Pessah and contains 49 suites. The corridors maintain the bullring atmosphere as do the stores, restaurant and event halls. The El Cubo aqueduct was built at the end of the 18th century to carry water from the El Cubo mine area, which gave the structure its name. Only a few arches of it remain.\nMuseums.\nIn relation to its population, Zacatecas is one of the cities with the most museums in the nation.\nThe Pedro Coronel Museum is located in the old monastery of the Santo Domingo church, which also housed the former Jesuit college of San Luis Gonzaga. San Luis was famous throughout Latin America for the quality of his teaching (one pupil of this college was Father Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Miranda, the spiritual father of Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, the Mexican poet). Following the expulsion of the Jesuits and a brief interlude in the hands of the Dominicans, the college was converted successively into a barracks, a prison and a warehouse before being restored in 1981. The museum is mostly dedicated to the works of Zacatecas painter Pedro Coronel as well as works by others that he collected. The archive includes works by Pablo Picasso, Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f3, Braque, Chagall, Basarelli, Eduardo Degas and Hogart. There are also halls dedicated to works from Africa, India, Egypt, China and Greece. The museum also contains an important collection of medals and 25,000 volumes which made up the libraries of the old convents (including 15,000 from Our Lady of Guadalupe alone). Most of these are in the El\u00edas Armador Historical Library, which contains over 20,000 volumes.\nThe Rafael Coronel Museum, named after the brother of Pedro Coronel, is housed in eight halls of the monastery complex which was part of the Church of San Francisco. This museum is dedicated to historic relics with the main collection being 5,000 masks made of wood. leather and clay coming from many of Mexico's regional cultures, past and present. Many represent historic and supernatural figures. It also contains drawings and sketches by Diego Rivera. In the halls dedicated to the colonial period, there is a set of terracotta figures from the 17th and 18th centuries and in the Rosete Aranda Hall there is a collection of puppets from Burma, Indonesia and China. There is also a collection of masks and puppets which belonged to one of the most important theatrical companies in 20th-century Mexico. This museum was begun when Rafael donated 10,764 pieces from his own collection to the city of Zacatecas.\nThe Manuel Felgu\u00e9rez Museum contains a large collection of abstract art by the namesake and other artists covering three generations. One exhibition is the \"Murals of Osaka\" created in 1969 when Fernando Gamboa was commissioned to archive Mexico's pavilion at the World's Fair in Osaka in 1970. Since the event, the murals remained stored for decades until this permanent exhibition was installed. Artists represented include Lilia Carrillo, Francisco Corzas, Roger Van Gunten and Francisco Icasa. It includes permanent workshop space for etching, an auditorium and exhibition halls. Its building dates from the 18th century, which was the site of the Seminario Conciliar, and later a barracks and penitentiary. The current museum was inaugurated in 1998.\nThe Zacatecano Museum is on Doctor Hierro Street and houses a collection of Huichol art, folk retablos (ex-votos) (folk paintings giving thanks for a miracle) and wrought ironwork. This building used to be the Casa de Moneda (coin mint) between 1802 and 1905. Other museums include Museo de Pintura Colonial and Casa Museo Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Velarde. Still other museums include the Episcopal Gallery, the Museo de la Ciencia and the Francisco Goitia Museum. The Episcopal Gallery is located to the side of the cathedral and contains religious art from the 19th and 20th centuries. It contains religious paraphernalia, paintings and sculptures related to Catholic Church history including a multilingual Bible from 1772. The Museo de la Ciencia (Science Museum) is located in the old central building of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Zacatecas and contains collections documenting the advances of physics, mathematics and natural sciences. The Francisco Goitia Museum contains works by this Zacatecas artist as well as works by Julio Ruelas, Pedro and Rafael Coronel, Manuel Felgu\u00e9rez and Jose Kuri Brena.\nEducation.\nUniversities and technical education.\nThe city contains a number of universities and institutions of higher education, including the state-sponsored Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Zacatecas \nThe Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica del Estado de Zacatecas (UTEZ) is part of a technological university system across the Mexico. It was founded in 1998 by the state government of Zacatecas focusing on majors in technology and business.\nOther technical schools are the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Zacatecas, the Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Zacatecas, and a campus of the ITESM college system.\nFestivals and celebrations.\nThe city hosts a number of religious and cultural festivals throughout the year. The Festival Cultural de Zacatecas is held each year in the city during Holy Week, which unites artists of different genres from classic to rock and offers visitors more than 130 attractions. Some of the artists have included La Barranca, Real de Catorce, blues singer Betsy Pecannins and singer Vicky Carr. There are also theatrical events and events for children. About 90% of the events are free. The event is organized by the state of Zacatecas with support from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Zacatecas, ISSSTE, IMSS, CONACULTA and other government agencies.\nThe Feria Nacional de Zacatecas is held during the month of September at the foot of the Cerro de la Bufa. It includes concerts, bullfighting, events at the Foro Infantil, crafts expositions as well as exhibitions of livestock, autos and culture. The annual event began in 1940 and received more than two million visitors each year since 2002. The main concert hall for the event has a capacity of 5,000 and has hosted names such as Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n, Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal, Rio Roma, and Ha*Ash. It has exhibition and sales of crafts, livestock and food. Other events include charreadas and bullfighting. The evening has folkloric dance and fireworks.\nThe Festival Zacatecas del Folclor International takes place the first week of August.\nReligious events include the feast of the Virgin of Zacatecas and the feast of the Virgin del Patrocinio. Activities associated with these events include parades with floats, musical concerts, bullfighting, processions and other religious events. The Virgin of Zacatecas is housed in a chapel built in 1728 and regularly receives visitors from the city and other areas. The Virgin of Patrocinio, whose day is September 14, celebrates one of the most celebrated images in the Zacatecas area. This event lasts for ten days with traditional dances, processions and more. This feast coincides with the Feria Nacional de Zacatecas and Mexico's Independence Day. On Good Friday, a large procession called the \"Procession of Silence\" is held.\nThe last three days of August are dedicated to an event called Morismas de Bracho. This event involves approximately 5,000 people in costume who commemorate the decapitation of John the Baptist and the struggle of Christians against the Moors, with the principal players representing Charlemagne, Mohamed and John the Baptist. The staging occurs at El Bracho Park, behind the Cerro de la Bufa and ends with the decapitation of Mohamed.\nOn June 23, the town commemorates the Battle of Zacatecas at the Cerro de la Bufa and the Plaza de Armas with cultural events and fireworks.\nNeeding no date or special reason for celebration are the \"callejoneadas\" or alleyway parties. These are considered to be a traditional form of nightlife in which one can dance, sing and drink mezcal or beer-based punch called \"heribertas\" for free. According to tradition, these parties were begun by a college student named Heriberto, whose last name has been lost. They are most commonly held at the end of the school year, but no reason is needed to hold one. Most callejoneadas form in front of the Palacio de Gobierno, where a \"tambora\" band or other type of band, a group of revelers and a donkey carrying jugs of \"heribertas\" gather. The donkey is often painted or otherwise decorated. The party then winds its way around the narrow streets and alleys of the city, with people drinking the heribertos from little jars called jarritos. Most of the revelers are students but all are welcome to join.\nZacatecas is the seat of a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Category II Regional Office, to promote training, research and conservation of artistic, historical, natural and archaeological heritage of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. It is the fourth such office to be established after those in China, Brazil and Bahrain. The office is in charge of fourteen percent of the World Heritage Sites in the world.\nThe city's chamber music festival has been held annually since 1993. It is organized by the Instituto Zacatecano de Cultura with support from the Escuela de Musica of the Universidad de Zacatecas as well as other local and national entities.\nTransportation.\nBy highway, Zacatecas is connected to Aguascalientes via Fed 45, to San Luis Potos\u00ed via Fed 49, Fed 23 to Guadalajara and Torre\u00f3n and Fed 54 to Guadalajara and Saltillo. There is a rail line called the \"Ferrocarril Central\" that still connects the city with other parts such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Mexico City. The city is served by the General Leobardo C. Ruiz International Airport, which connects the city with Tijuana, Morelia, Leon, and Mexico City. Intercity busses connect the city with other regional cities such as Fresnillo as well as national destinations such as Guadalajara, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Mexico City. There is also transportation to locations such as Plateros, and the Sanctuary of the Ni\u00f1o de Atocha. There is also public transportation intra-city as well.\nThe municipality.\nGeography.\nAs municipal seat, the city of Zacatecas is the governmental authority for 180 other named localities, which total an area of . Ninety-three percent of the municipality's population of 132,035 lives in the city proper. There are no indigenous communities in the municipalities with almost all of the population being \"mestizo\" or mixed indigenous-European. Under 500 people speak an indigenous language such as Huichol and Zacateco but most of these are from other parts of Mexico and speak Spanish as well. The municipality borders the municipalities of Calera, Morelos, Vetagrande, Guadalupe, Genaro Codina and Jerez.\nThe municipality is wedged between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the subrange called Sierras y Valles Zacatecanos. The area is very rugged terrain filled with narrow valleys, ravines and mountains. The principal elevations include Cerro El Grillo at , Cerro Los Alamitos at , Cerro La Bufa at , Cerro La Mesa at , Mesas El Rinc\u00f3n Colorado at , Cerro La Mesa at and Cerro Grande at . The area is divided between the Lerma River and El Salado River basins, with a large number of small streams and arroyos crossing the territory.\nDemographics.\nThe 2020 Mexican Census, reported Zacatecas municipality had a population of 149,607 people, of whom 77,635 are female and 71,972 are male.\nClimate.\nZacatecas City has a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\", according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with an average annual temperature of . Freezing temperatures are not uncommon, especially in January and February. During the winter of 2017\u20132018, Zacatecas municipality reached temperatures that haven't been reached in several years as \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C with a wind chill of \u221216\u00a0\u00b0C, although the coldest temperature occurred in Fresnillo which its another city close to Zacatecas City, where the temperature dropped to \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C with a wind chill of \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. Most rain falls between June and September, and there is a defined winter. Principal wild vegetation is that adapted to dry areas such as nopals, mesquite, maguey and grasses, with pines and holm oaks in the higher elevations. Wildlife includes coyotes, grey foxes, bobcats, opossums, rabbits, raccoons, other small mammals as well as variety of small birds and reptiles.\nEconomy.\nThe most important sectors of the municipal economy are mining, which employs about 21% of the population, livestock to which 76% of the surface area is dedicated and commerce, which employs over 70% of the population. Most mining today occurs on the Panuco, Vetagrande and Morelos mountains with the most active mines being El Compas, La Gallega, San Panuncio and San Rafael. Annual production is valued at 50,043 pesos for gold, 11,320 pesos for silver and 38,122 for lead. Non-metallic minerals include kaolin, building stone and petroleum aggregates. Agriculture and livestock is mostly done communally, with ten established ejidos. Only 15% of the municipality's land is farmed. This agriculture is dependent on the annual rainy season and produces some basic staples such as beans, chili peppers and corn. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and horses. There is some industry related to food processing, textiles, wood products, paper and mining equipment as well as the making of crafts such as sarapes, stonework, leather and precious metals. Commerce is divided between providing for local needs as well as tourism. In addition to the city's status as a World Heritage site, there is camping available in the Sierra de Organos, Canon de Juchipila, the Cerro del Mixton and the Sierra de Cardos. La Quemada or Alta Vista-Chalchihuites is the best known archeological site in Zacatecas. Due to its location, the artifacts show influence of cultures such as Teotihuacan, the Pur\u00e9pechas and the Toltecs. It has several levels and built over a large hill. When it rains, water flows over the upper levels like a waterfall.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nZacatecas has these sister cities:\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72885", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72885", "title": "Houston Rockets", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Houston\nThe Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston. The Rockets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Toyota Center, located in Downtown Houston. Throughout its history, Houston has won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. It was established in 1967 as the San Diego Rockets, an expansion team originally based in San Diego. In 1971, the Rockets relocated to Houston.\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the 1968 NBA draft, the Rockets were awarded the first overall pick and selected power forward Elvin Hayes, who would lead the team to its first playoff appearance in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for All-Star center Moses Malone from the American Basketball Association (ABA). Malone led Houston to the Eastern Conference Finals in his first year with the team. During the 1980\u201381 season, the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record but still made the playoffs. Led by Malone, the Rockets reached their first NBA Finals in 1981, losing in six games to the Boston Celtics.\nIn the 1984 NBA draft, once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with Ralph Sampson, they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the 1986 NBA Finals where Houston was again defeated by the Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following 1987. Rudy Tomjanovich took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a then-franchise record 58 wins and went to the 1994 NBA Finals and won the franchise's first championship against the New York Knicks. During the following season, reinforced by another All-Star, Clyde Drexler, the Rockets repeated as champions with a four-game sweep of the Orlando Magic.\nThe Rockets acquired all-star power forward Charles Barkley in 1996, but were unable to advance past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio of Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming, followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster.\nThe acquisition of franchise player James Harden in 2012 launched the Rockets back into perennial championship contention throughout the rest of the 2010s, with no losing seasons in Harden's nine-season tenure with the team. Harden led the team to two Western Conference Finals appearances (both times losing to the Golden State Warriors). Prior to the 2020\u201321 season, head coach Mike D'Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey left the organization, prompting Harden to seek a trade. He was traded to the Brooklyn Nets which started a rebuilding period.\nMoses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, and James Harden have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, when piloted by Morey, were renowned for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to sabermetrics in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\nHistory.\n1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets.\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in San Diego by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75\u00a0million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the 1967\u201368 season. The NBA wanted to add more teams in the Western United States and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an ice hockey team owned by Breitbard, the San Diego Gulls of the Western Hockey League. The San Diego International Sports Center, which opened the previous year and was also owned by Breitbard, would serve as home to the new franchise. A local contest to name the franchise chose the name \"Rockets\", as it paid homage to San Diego's theme of \"a city in motion\" and the local arm of General Dynamics developing the Atlas missile and booster rocket program.\nBreitbard brought in Jack McMahon, then-coach of the Cincinnati Royals, to serve as the Rockets' coach and general manager. The team, which would join the league along with the Seattle SuperSonics, then built its roster with both veteran players at an expansion draft, and college players from the 1967 NBA draft, where San Diego's first ever draft pick was Pat Riley. In their first two games of the season, the Rockets were up against the St. Louis Hawks, and lost both of those games. Their first win in franchise history came the very next game which occurred three days after against the SuperSonics. The Rockets won on the road, 121\u2013114. Johnny Green recorded 30 points and 25 rebounds for the Rockets. The following game, the SuperSonics held a 15-point lead for most of the first half, before the Rockets mounted a comeback to force overtime. The SuperSonics eventually pulled away and won the game, 117\u2013110, though Art Williams recorded the first ever triple-double in franchise history, as he recorded 17 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists for the Rockets. The expansion Rockets ultimately lost 67 games in their inaugural season, which was an NBA record for losses in a season at the time.\nIn 1968, after the Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to determine who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes improved the Rockets' record to 37 wins and 45 losses, enough for the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. The Rockets limped to a 27\u201355 finish in the 1969\u201370 season, before missing the playoffs by just one game in the 1970\u201371 season.\nOff the court, Breitbard was facing serious financial losses due to a controversial ongoing tax-assessment issue that had plagued his San Diego Sports Arena since it was built. He was also still on the hook for paying off the NBA expansion fee for the Rockets, in addition to construction-related bonds on the arena, which he had built with private funding. To make matters worse, the American professional sports economy had begun to plummet in the late 1960s, and professional basketball was being hit particularly hard with nearly all franchises in the NBA and ABA operating at a financial loss at this time.\nOn January 26, 1970, during an emotional press conference on the floor of the Sports Arena, Breitbard addressed the San Diego fans regarding his dire finances and the state of his Rockets basketball and Gulls hockey teams. \"...We have been served an eviction notice...\" Breitbard announced. \"I've tried to work quietly, to iron this out. But, at the moment it appears impossible. I don't want to sell. I'm not interested in selling outside of San Diego. It seems to me the Rockets and Gulls are part of this town. This arena, the Gulls, the Rockets, are a part of me, and our fans have been wonderful to us.\" Over the next nearly year and a half, numerous fans circulated petitions and lobbied local officials to help keep the Rockets and Gulls afloat and in San Diego. Several proposals surrounded providing financial aid or payment relief to Breitbard, or having the City and/or County of San Diego take ownership of the arena were discussed, but Breitbard was running out of time. At least 14 private offers for the Rockets were made to Breitbard, though all would have resulted in the team being relocated out of San Diego, which Breitbard was adamantly opposed to. The tax-assessment situation surrounding the Sports Arena (which was the only large arena in the region) ultimately made the prospect of another local owner purchasing the team infeasible.\nOn January 12, 1971, the Rockets hosted the 1971 NBA All-Star Game at the San Diego Sports Arena, a close contest in which the West beat the East 108\u2013107 in front of a packed house of 14,378 fans.\nOn June 23, 1971, the San Diego Rockets were abruptly sold by Breitbard to a Houston\u2013based investment group. The NBA hurriedly approved the sale, believing the franchise was on the verge of folding. News of the sale broke before the coaches, players, and team employees and executives could even be notified. Local officials in San Diego were also caught by surprise.\nIn their fourth and final season in existence, the San Diego Rockets missed the playoffs by just one game in the standings.\n1971\u20131976: Move to Houston and improvement with Murphy and Rudy-T.\nTexas Sports Investments bought the franchise for $5.6\u00a0million and moved the team to Houston before the start of the 1971\u201372 season. The franchise became the first NBA team in Texas, and the nickname \"Rockets\" took on even greater relevance after the move, given Houston's long connection to the space industry. Houston previously was awarded an NBA expansion franchise along with Buffalo, Cleveland and Portland on February 6, 1970, but the new entry folded six weeks later on March 20 when its investment group led by Alan Rothenberg failed to make the $750,000 down payment on the $3.7 million entrance fee required before the league's college player draft.\nBefore the start of the season, Hannum left for the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association \u2013 later renamed Denver Nuggets, who joined the NBA in 1976 \u2013 and Tex Winter was hired in his place. In the first six games of the 1971\u201372 season in Winter's first head coaching season, the Rockets all lost those games with an average of around 15 points per game. Their first win of the season came on October 26, 1971, with a 104\u2013103 win over the home team, Detroit Pistons. Their second win of the season came five days later, a 102\u201387 win over the Buffalo Braves. After that game, the Rockets lost their next 8 games, against the Knicks, Trail Blazers, Bullets (twice), Warriors, Celtics, Bucks and Bulls. Their next win was on November 17 on the road against the 76ers. However, Winter's clashes with Hayes, due to a system that contrasted with the offensive style to which Hayes was accustomed, made Hayes ask for a trade, leaving for the Baltimore Bullets at the end of the 1971\u201372 season.\nIt was also around this time that the Rockets would unveil their classic yellow and red logo and accompanying uniforms used until the end of the 1994\u201395 season. Winter left soon after, being fired in January 1973 following a ten-game losing streak, and was replaced by Johnny Egan. Egan led the Rockets back to the playoffs in 1975, where the franchise also won their first round against the New York Knicks, subsequently losing to the veteran Boston Celtics in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, selling out several home games during the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then selling out all of their home playoff games.\n1976\u20131982: The Moses Malone era.\nIn the 1975\u201376 season the Rockets finally had a permanent home in Houston as they moved into The Summit, which they would call home for the next 29 years. During the period, the franchise was owned by Kenneth Schnitzer, developer of the Greenway Plaza which included The Summit. After missing the 1976 playoffs, Tom Nissalke was hired as a coach, and pressed the team to add a play-making guard in college standout John Lucas and a rebounding center through Moses Malone, who he had coached in the ABA. The additions had an immediate impact, with the 1976\u201377 Rockets winning the Central Division and going all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the Julius Erving's Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 2. The following season had the team regressing to just 28\u00a0wins due to an injury to captain Tomjanovich, who got numerous facial fractures after being punched by Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers and wound up spending five months in rehabilitation. After trading Lucas to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Rick Barry, the Rockets returned to the playoffs in 1978\u201379, with \"The Chairman Of The Boards\" Moses Malone receiving the 1979 MVP Award, but the team was swept 2\u20130 by Atlanta in the first round. Nissalke was let go, and assistant Del Harris was promoted to head coach.\nIn 1979, George Maloof, a businessperson from Albuquerque, New Mexico, bought the Rockets for $9\u00a0million. He died the following year, and while the Maloof family expressed interest in selling the team, George's 24-year-old son Gavin took over the Rockets. A buyer was eventually found in 1982 as businessman Charlie Thomas and Sidney Shlenker purchased the franchise for $11 million; the Maloofs would later own the Sacramento Kings from 1998 to 2013. The Maloof period of ownership marked the first dominant period of the Rockets, highlighted by the team's first Western Conference Championship and NBA Finals appearance in 1981, their first year after being moved from the Eastern Conference. Prior to the 1980\u201381 season, the arrival of the Dallas Mavericks led to an NBA realignment that sent the Rockets back to the Western Conference. Houston qualified for the playoffs only in the final game of the season with a 40\u201342 record. The postseason had the Rockets beat the Lakers, in-state rivals San Antonio Spurs, and the equally underdog Kansas City Kings to become only the second team in NBA history (after the 1959 Minneapolis Lakers) to have advanced to the Finals after achieving a losing record in the regular season. In the NBA Finals facing Larry Bird's Boston Celtics, the Rockets blew a late lead in Game 1 and won Game 2 at the Boston Garden. However, afterwards the team failed to capitalize on the early success against the favored Celtics, and eventually lost in six games.\nWhile new owner Charlie Thomas expressed interest in renewing with Moses Malone, who had been again chosen as MVP in 1981\u201382, the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones, as a declining regional economy made the Rockets unable to pay Malone's salary. When the Rockets finished a league worst 14\u201368, Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris, and the team won the first pick of the 1983 NBA draft, used to select Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia. Sampson had good numbers and was awarded the NBA Rookie of the Year award, but the Rockets still finished last overall, again getting the top pick at the upcoming 1984 NBA draft, used to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston.\n1984\u20132001: The Hakeem Olajuwon era.\n1984\u20131987: The \"Twin Towers\".\nIn his first season, Olajuwon finished second to Michael Jordan in NBA Rookie of the Year balloting, and the Rockets record improved by 19 games, good enough for a return to the playoffs as the third best team in the West, where they were upset by the sixth-seeded Utah Jazz. The duo of Olajuwon and Sampson earned much praise, and was nicknamed \"Twin Towers\". In the following season, Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51\u201331 record. The subsequent playoffs had the Rockets sweeping the Sacramento Kings, having a hard-fought six-game series with Alex English's Denver Nuggets, and then facing defending champion Lakers, losing the first game but eventually managing to win the series \u2013 the only Western Playoffs defeat of the Showtime Lakers \u2013 to get to the franchise's second Finals appearance. The NBA Finals once again matched the Rockets up against the Celtics, a contrast to Houston's young front challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics front court of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. The Celtics won the first two games in Boston, gave the Rockets their only home playoff defeat that season in game 4, and clinched the title as Bird scored a triple-double on Game 6.\nAfter the Finals, Boston coach K. C. Jones called the Rockets \"the new monsters on the block\" feeling they had a bright future. But the team had a poor start to the following season, followed by nearly a decade of underachievement and failure, amidst players getting injured or suspended for cocaine usage, and during the playoffs were defeated in the second round by the Seattle SuperSonics in six games, with the final game being a double-overtime classic that saw Olajuwon notching 49 points, 25 rebounds and 6 blocks in defeat. Early in the 1987\u201388 season, Sampson, who had signed a new contract, was traded to the Golden State Warriors, bringing the Twin Towers era to an end just 18 months after their Finals appearance. Sampson's once-promising career was shortened due to chronic knee injuries, which forced his retirement in 1991. Jones' prophecy of a Rockets dynasty never materialized until the early 1990s.\n1987\u20131992: Lean years.\nIn the next five seasons, the Rockets either failed to qualify for the playoffs or were eliminated in the first round. The first elimination in 1988 led to Fitch's dismissal, with Don Chaney replacing him as head coach. Chaney, like Olajuwon, also played for the Houston Cougars under Guy Lewis, having played along Elvin Hayes in the late 1960s. Chaney had his best season during 1990\u201391, where he was named the Coach of the Year after leading the Rockets to a 52\u201330 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games. Despite Olajuwon's usual strong numbers, the underwhelming roster could not be lifted out of mediocrity. However, the attempts to rebuild the team nucleus incorporated players that would later make an impact in the years to come, such as Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert Horry, Mario Elie, Sam Cassell and Otis Thorpe.\nMidway through the 1991\u201392 season, with the Rockets' record only 26\u201326, Chaney was fired and replaced by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself. While the Rockets did not make the playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered a step forward. In the next year, the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.\n1993\u20131995: Back-to-back championships for Clutch City.\nOn July 30, 1993, Leslie Alexander purchased the Rockets for $85\u00a0million. The next season, in Tomjanovich's second full year as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993\u201394 season by tying an NBA record with a start of 15\u20130. Their first loss of the season came on December 3, 1993, as the Hawks, led by Dominique Wilkins' 27 points, defeated the Rockets, 133\u2013111. The next game, the Rockets stormed a comeback against the Cleveland Cavaliers as they won by a single point, 99\u201398, on the road. The Rockets now had won their first 16 out of 17 games of the season, tying the 1948\u201349 Capitols for the best 17-game start in a season, at that time. On December 9, Olajuwon recorded 28 points, 16 rebounds and 4 blocks as the Rockets cruised past the visiting Heat in overtime to win their 18th game of the season. Led by Olajuwon, who was named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, the Rockets won 58 games, a franchise record at the time. After quickly dispatching the Portland Trail Blazers (who had made the finals just two years prior) in 4 games, they then faced the defending Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, led by the previous year's MVP Charles Barkley. The series opened up in Houston, which saw the Rockets open up a big lead going into the fourth quarter. In both games, however, the Rockets inexplicably collapsed to allow the Suns a 2\u20130 lead going back to Phoenix. Following recent heart-breaking playoff losses by the Houston Oilers, it appeared as though the Rockets were doomed. Local newspapers labeled Houston as \"Choke City\", which the Rockets took to heart and ultimately came back to win the series in seven games. As \"Choke City\" became \"Clutch City\", the name permanently became a part of Houston folklore. The Rockets then soon defeated John Stockton and Karl Malone's Utah Jazz in five in the Conference Finals to advance to their third finals. The New York Knicks opened a 3\u20132 advantage, but the Rockets won the last two games on their home court and claimed their first championship in franchise history. Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP, after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game.\nThe Rockets initially struggled in the first half of the 1994\u201395 season, which they fixed by sending Otis Thorpe to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Olajuwon's former college teammate Clyde Drexler. With only 47 wins, the Rockets entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference. Still, a strong playoff run that earned Houston the nickname \"Clutch City\" had the Rockets defeating the West's top three seeds \u2013 the Jazz, Suns and Spurs \u2013 to reach back-to-back finals, this time against the Orlando Magic, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. When Houston swept the Finals' series in four games, they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed, and the first to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. Olajuwon was again the Finals MVP, only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years in a row. It was on the floor of The Summit after they captured their second title that head coach Rudy Tomjanovich proclaimed, \"Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!\"\n1995\u20132002: Post-championship and rebuilding.\nDuring the off-season, the Rockets went for a change of visual identity, making navy blue and silver the new primary colors while adopting a new cartoon-inspired logo and pinstriped jerseys. The Rockets won 48 games in the 1995\u201396 season, in which Olajuwon became the NBA's all-time leader in blocked shots. The playoffs had the Rockets beating the Lakers before a sweep by the SuperSonics.\nBefore the start of the succeeding season, the Rockets sent four players to Phoenix in exchange for Charles Barkley. The resulting \"Big Three\" of Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley had a strong debut season with a 57\u201325 record, going all the way to the Western Conference finals before losing to the Utah Jazz 4\u20132 on a dramatic last-second shot by John Stockton. The following season was marked by injuries, and Houston finished 41\u201341 and the 8th seed, leading to another elimination by the top-seeded Jazz.\nDrexler retired after the season, and the Rockets traded to bring in Scottie Pippen to take his place. In the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in exchange for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34\u201348 and missed the playoffs, for only the second time in 15 years. Francis was named Co-Rookie of the Year.\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, the Rockets worked their way to a 45\u201337 record. However, in a competitive Western Conference where seven teams won 50 games, this left the Rockets two games out of the playoffs. In the following off-season, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign-and-trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The ensuing 2001\u201302 season\u2014the first without Hakeem in two decades\u2014was unremarkable, and the Rockets finished with only 28 wins led by first time All-Star Francis.\n2002\u20132009: The Yao Ming era.\n2002\u20132004: Early years with Yao and Francis.\nAfter Houston was awarded the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft, they selected Yao Ming, a Chinese center. The Rockets missed the 2003 playoffs by one game, improving their record by 15 victories led by All-Star starters Steve Francis and Rookie Yao Ming.\nThe 2003\u201304 season marked the Rockets' arrival to a new arena, Toyota Center, a redesign of their uniforms and logo, and their first season without Rudy Tomjanovich, who resigned as head coach after being diagnosed with bladder cancer. Led by former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, the Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 45\u201337, earning their first playoff berth since 1999, again losing to the Lakers in the first round.\n2004\u20132009: McGrady and Ming duo.\nIn the off-season, Houston saw major changes in the roster as the Rockets acquired Tracy McGrady in a seven-player deal with the Orlando Magic Including three time Rockets All-Star Steve Francis. The scoring champion McGrady and the strong rebounder Yao formed a well-regarded pair that helped the Rockets win 22 consecutive games in the 2007\u201308 season, which was at the time the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. Still, the duo was plagued with injuries \u2013 of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 \u2013 and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the Dallas Mavericks in 2005 and the Jazz in 2007. Despite this, Yao was selected to carry his home country's Five-star Red Flag at the Summer Olympics opening ceremony held at home in 2008. After the 2007 elimination, Van Gundy was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.\nFor the 2008\u201309 season, the Rockets signed forward Ron Artest. While McGrady wound up playing only half the games before enduring a season-ending microfracture surgery, the Rockets ended the season 53\u201329, enough for the Western Conference's fifth seed. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Portland Trail Blazers four games to two, winning their first playoff round since 1997. During the series, Dikembe Mutombo injured his knee, which forced him to retire after 18 seasons in the NBA. However, the second round against the Lakers had the Rockets losing 4\u20133 and Yao Ming suffering yet another season-ending injury, this time a hairline fracture in his left foot.\n2009\u20132012: Competitive rebuilding.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Rockets saw the departures of Artest in the off-season and McGrady, Joey Dorsey and Carl Landry during mid-season trades. Despite great play by Kevin Martin, who arrived from the Kings, and Aaron Brooks, who would eventually be chosen as the Most Improved Player of the season, the Rockets could not make it to the playoffs, finishing 42\u201340, 3rd in the Southwest Division. At that time, the Rockets set an NBA record for best record by a team with no All-Stars. The Rockets would also finish ninth in the Western Conference for the following two seasons, with Yao Ming getting a season-ending injury seven games into the 2010\u201311 season and deciding to retire during the 2011 off-season. Said off-season, which saw the NBA going through a lockout, had Adelman dismissed, and general manager Daryl Morey deciding to start a revamp of the Rockets based on advanced statistical analytics (similar to sabermetrics in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play. Kevin McHale was named head coach, and the roster saw significant changes.\n2012\u20132021: The James Harden era.\nAfter the roster moves made by Morey during the 2012 NBA off-season, only four players were left from the 2011\u201312 Rockets roster: Chandler Parsons, Greg Smith, Marcus Morris, and Patrick Patterson, with the latter two leaving through trades during the 2012\u201313 season. The most important acquisition was reigning Sixth Man of the Year James Harden, who Morey called a \"foundational\" player expected to be Houston's featured player after a supporting role in the Oklahoma City Thunder. Harden caused an immediate impact as part of the starting lineup for the Rockets, with 37 points, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals, and a block in the season opener against the Detroit Pistons, and an average of 25.9 points a game through the season. Combining Harden's performance and McHale's up-tempo offense, the Rockets became one of the highest-scoring offenses in the NBA, leading the league in scoring for the majority of the season. In the postseason, the Rockets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round, losing the series 4\u20132.\nEager to add another franchise player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued and then acquired free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 off-season. He officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and \u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, that postseason, the Rockets were defeated in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4\u20132. Still, in the 2014\u201315 season, without Lin and Parsons but reinforced by Trevor Ariza, the Rockets started the season well, winning the first four games of the season for the first time since 1996\u201397, and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985\u201386 Denver Nuggets. Though the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took it upon himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets beat the Jazz to claim their first-ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994, and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4\u20131 in the first round, and overcame a 3\u20131 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years. In the Conference Finals, the Rockets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4\u20131.\nThe 2015\u201316 season saw Kevin McHale fired after a bad start where the team only won 4 of its first 11 games, and assistant J. B. Bickerstaff took over coaching duties. Inconsistent play led to the Rockets struggling to remain in the playoff qualifying zone, and surrounded by trade rumors. Houston only clinched its 2016 playoffs spot by winning its last game, finishing the season 41\u201341 to earn an eight seed and a match-up against the Warriors. Like in the previous year, the Rockets were once again defeated by Golden State in five games.\n2016\u20132020: The arrival of Mike D'Antoni.\nDuring the 2016 off-season, Mike D'Antoni was named as the Rockets' new head coach, and Dwight Howard opted out of his contract's final year, becoming a free agent. In the following free-agency period, the Rockets looked to embrace the play styles of both coach D'Antoni and Harden through the signings of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two predominately perimeter players and good fits in Houston's up-tempo offense style. Morey signed Nen\u00ea Hilario to succor the roster defense and a backup behind Clint Capela and Ryan Anderson after Dwight Howard and Donatas Motiej\u016bnas left the team during free agency.\nWhen the 2016\u201317 season started, Harden was off to a great start and was widely considered a top MVP runner along with Kawhi Leonard, alongside former teammate Russell Westbrook. To gain more firepower from the bench, Morey traded Corey Brewer and the 2017 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers for Lou Williams to enhance the team's offense. When the season ended, the Rockets were third in both the Western Conference and overall rankings, a major improvement from the season before. D'Antoni was named the NBA Coach of the Year, Eric Gordon the Sixth Man of the Year, and Harden finished second in MVP voting to Russell Westbrook. In the playoffs, the Rockets faced the sixth seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in a battle of the MVP frontrunners, as the winner was not announced until after the finals. The Rockets won the series 4\u20131 including Nene Hilario's perfect 12\u201312 in field goals in Game 4. In the following round, Houston opened with a dominating 27 points win over the San Antonio Spurs, lost the following two games and then tied the series again. The fifth game went into overtime and had both Manu Ginobili blocking James Harden's game tying three point attempt at the final second, and Nene injuring himself out of the postseason. Without Nene, the Rockets could not guard LaMarcus Aldridge, who scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the series-closing match.\nDuring the 2017 off-season, the Rockets were purchased by Houston restaurant billionaire Tilman Fertitta for $2.2 billion, breaking the record for the price to purchase an American professional sports team. The team also acquired 8-time All-NBA player and 9-time All-Star Chris Paul in a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers, in exchange for seven players, cash considerations, and a top three protected 2018 first round draft pick. Even if Paul missed many games due to a knee injury, he was a key addition to the Rockets. The team finished the season with 65 wins, a record both league-leading and the best in franchise history. During the playoffs, Houston beat the Minnesota Timberwolves and Utah Jazz in five games before another confrontation with the Golden State Warriors. In Game 5 of the Conference Finals, the Rockets took a 3\u20132 lead in the series, but they saw Paul leave with an injured hamstring. His absence was felt in the two remaining games, where Houston led by halftime in Game 7 only to suffer a comeback by Golden State.\nThe Rockets had one draft pick entering the off-season, and they used it to select De'Anthony Melton, packaging him in a trade with the Phoenix Suns alongside Ryan Anderson to receive Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss. In free agency, they signed James Ennis III, Michael Carter-Williams, and Carmelo Anthony. They started the season with a 1\u20134 record, and after 13 games where they went 6\u20137, Houston and Anthony mutually agreed to part ways, who was eventually traded to the Chicago Bulls and subsequently waived. After falling to the 14th seed in the Western Conference, James Harden went on a 32-game streak scoring at least 30 points per game\u2014the second-longest in NBA history\u2014with Harden averaging 41.1 points per game in that run. He drove the Rockets through a 21\u201311 push in that streak; and after beginning the season 11\u201314, the Rockets finished the season 42\u201315, winning 20 of their last 25 games and finishing fourth in the Western Conference after losing the final two games of the season, which would have potentially given them the second or third seed. After what was determined to be poor fits of the acquisitions made in free agency, on top of injuries, Daryl Morey traded the players acquired in the off-season at the trade deadline and replaced them with Austin Rivers, Kenneth Faried, Danuel House, and Iman Shumpert during the season. On April 7, 2019, against the Phoenix Suns, Houston became the first team in NBA history to make 25+ two-pointers and 25+ three-pointers in the same game, outscoring their last four opponents by 117 points, second-best in a four-game span in franchise history (127+ in February 1993). They beat their own record for most three-pointers made by one team in a single game in NBA history two times with 26 and 27. The Rockets clinched a division title and a playoff berth for a seventh straight appearance. After defeating the Utah Jazz in five games, Houston faced Golden State for the fourth time in five years. The series began with a tight Game 1 decided by four points along with officiating that received scrutiny. With both teams winning their home games, putting the series at 2\u20132, Golden State won the next two games to eliminate the Rockets for the second year in a row along with the fourth time in five years.\nDuring the 2019 off-season, Morey sought out to once again retool the roster. As part of a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Rockets traded Chris Paul, two future first round picks, and two future first round pick swaps in exchange for James Harden's former Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook. Nearing the trade deadline of the 2019\u201320 season, the Rockets were involved in a blockbuster, four-team trade which was centered around bringing Robert Covington back to the Rockets and sending centers Clint Capela and Nen\u00ea to the Atlanta Hawks. The trade cemented the Rockets' total commitment to a small ball, 5-out offense, a style of play which was considered revolutionary for its time. In their first twelve games since going 6'7\" or shorter in their lineups, the Rockets went 10\u20132, being in the top percentile in win percentage, offensive rating, and point differential. In February, the month they made the trade, the double-MVP backcourt of Harden and Westbrook became the first teammates in NBA history to average 30+ points and 5+ assists per game. By the end of the season, Harden and Westbrook scored a combined 61.5 points per game, breaking Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal's previous record for the highest-scoring basketball duo since the ABA-NBA merger.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Rockets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.\nAfter the Rockets were eliminated in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Lakers, D'Antoni and Morey informed the Rockets that they would both not return to the team for the 2020\u201321 season. Rafael Stone was hired as the general manager after serving in general counsel and as an assistant general manager. Stephen Silas was hired as the Rockets' head coach. Stone traded Robert Covington to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for former Houston veteran Trevor Ariza, a first-round pick, and the rights to Isaiah Stewart, who was the 16th overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft. Stone then traded Ariza, the rights to Stewart, a second round pick, and cash considerations to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Christian Wood, a first-round pick, and a second round pick. A few days later, the Rockets signed former All-Star DeMarcus Cousins in a one-year deal. A week later, Westbrook was traded to the Washington Wizards in December 2020 in an exchange for Cousins former Kentucky teammate John Wall and a lottery-protected first-round pick.\nIn January 2021, Harden was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in a four-team trade. In return, the Rockets received Victor Oladipo from the Indiana Pacers, Rodions Kurucs from the Brooklyn Nets, Dante Exum from the Cleveland Cavaliers, four 1st-round picks, and four 1st-round picks swap. The Rockets began the season with an 11\u201310 start but ended up with a 17\u201355 record, the worst in the league despite with many injuries and trades.\n2021\u2013present: \u015eeng\u00fcn and Thompson era.\nIn the 2021 NBA draft, the team selected Jalen Green with the second overall pick out of the NBA G League Ignite, pairing him alongside Kevin Porter Jr., who was acquired via trade the season prior for a top-55 protected second-round pick. Because of their additions in the draft, including first round selections of Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn and Josh Christopher, the team began focusing on developing and rebuilding around their young core, which resulted in John Wall being benched for the entire season. In the 2021\u201322 season, the Rockets were once again at the bottom of the league, with a 20\u201362 record. Jalen Green was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team with averages of 17.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists.\nIn the 2022 NBA draft, the Rockets selected Jabari Smith Jr. with third overall pick and Tari Eason with the 17th overall picks. The Rockets made some adjustments by sending forward Christian Wood to the Dallas Mavericks in an exchange for Boban Marjanovi\u0107, Sterling Brown, Trey Burke and Marquese Chriss and traded all of them to the Oklahoma City Thunder during the off-season to develop their young core while keeping Marjanovi\u0107. The Rockets bought out John Wall's contract, who had been demanding a trade for a while and did not participate in the Rockets' 2021\u201322 season.\nOn February 9, 2023, the Rockets traded long-time veteran Eric Gordon to the Clippers in a three-team trade in exchange of Danny Green and John Wall and were later waived. The Rockets ended the 2022\u201323 regular season with a 22\u201360 record, tying with the San Antonio Spurs for last in the Western Conference. The Rockets fired head coach Stephen Silas after they chose not to pick up his fourth year option and replaced him with former Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka.\nOne-time All-Star Fred VanVleet joined the Rockets via free agency signing a three-year, $130 million contract. The next day, former Memphis Grizzlies forward Dillon Brooks joined the team signing a four-year, $86 million contract after a first-round exit against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets selected Amen Thompson with the fourth pick and Cam Whitmore with the 20th pick in the 2023 NBA draft. \u015eeng\u00fcn improved this season, averaging 21.1 points per game, 9.3 rebounds per game, and 5 assists per game. He was announced out for the season on March 21 with an ankle injury.\nThe Houston Rockets selected Kentucky guard Reed Sheppard with the third overall pick in the 2024 NBA draft. Building on momentum from last year, they had a breakout season, finishing 52\u201330 and securing the second seed in the Western Conference. The team specifically leaned on \u015eeng\u00fcn, who made his first All-Star Game appearance, and a breakout campaign from Amen Thompson. The Rockets made their first playoff appearance in five years, ultimately falling to the Golden State Warriors in a seven-game first-round series.\nOn July 6, 2025, The Rockets traded Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks to the Phoenix Suns in a seven-team trade in exchange for perennial All-Star Kevin Durant.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Rockets. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Houston Rockets seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nHome arenas.\nDuring the four years the Rockets were in San Diego, they played their games in the San Diego Sports Arena, which had a seating capacity of 14,400. In their first season after moving to Houston, the Rockets did not have their own arena, and they played their first two years at various venues in the city, including the Astrodome, AstroHall, Sam Houston Coliseum and Hofheinz Pavilion, the latter eventually being adopted as their home arena until 1975. They also had to play \"home\" games in other cities such as San Antonio, Waco, Albuquerque, and even San Diego in efforts to extend the fan-base. During their first season, the Rockets averaged less than 5,000 fans per game (roughly half full), and in one game in Waco, there were only 759 fans in attendance.\nTheir first permanent arena in Houston was the 10,000 seat Hofheinz Pavilion on the campus of the University of Houston, which they moved into starting in their second season. They played in the arena for four years, before occupying The Summit in 1975. The arena, which could hold 16,611 spectators, was their home for the next 28 years. It was renamed the Compaq Center from 1998 to 2003. Following the 1994 title, the Rockets had a sellout streak of 176 consecutive home games, including the playoffs, which lasted until 1999. However, the struggling 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons saw Houston having the worst attendance average in the league, with less than 12,000 spectators each season.\nFor the 2003\u201304 season, the Rockets moved into their new arena, Toyota Center, with a seating capacity of 18,500. During the 2007\u201308 season where the team achieved a 22-game winning streak, the Rockets got their best numbers to date, averaging 17,379 spectators. These were exceeded once James Harden joined the team in 2012. The Rockets averaged 18,123 spectators during the 2013\u201314 season, selling out 39 out of the 41 home games. The 2014\u201315 season had even better numbers, with 40 sellouts and an average of 18,230 tickets sold.\nTeam identity.\nUniforms and logos.\nWhen the Rockets debuted in San Diego, their colors were green and gold. Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red. They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words \"Houston Rockets\" below it.\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the Rockets introduced the famous \"ketchup and mustard\" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with \"Houston\" atop the first red trail and \"Rockets\" (all capitalized save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the Cooper Black fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their 1994 and 1995 championships.\nFollowing the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of Missouri City artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill. Nash would later sue the Rockets for breach of contract, given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes. The NBA suggested that the identity should follow the cartoon-inspired imagery that other teams adopted during the 1990s, leading to a rocket painted with sharkmouth nose art orbiting a basketball. Red was retained, but navy blue and silver became the uniform's primary colors. Both the home white and away navy uniforms featured gradient-fading pinstripes and futuristic number fonts, with side stripes of navy fading to red. This was used until the 2002\u201303 season.\nThe Rockets released simplified logos and uniforms in the 2003\u201304 season, which were created by Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka in collaboration with Rafael Esquer of New York-based Alfalfa Studio. The Rockets identity was the third creative collaboration by Ishioka and Esquer; she focused on the uniform, and he on the logo and custom typeface. The logo is a stylized 'R' in the shape of a rocket during takeoff, surrounded by a red orbit streak that can be interpreted as the central circle of a basketball court; it won the Merit Award from Graphis in their Logo Design 6 competition. Said \"R\" inspired the team's new custom typeface, which Esquer designed so that every single digit could be read well from a distance, whether in the arena or on television. Red once again became the dominant color, with silver and black as secondary. Because the uniforms and the logo were designed in tandem by Ishioka and Esquer, the complete look was organic and fluid. Julius Wiedemann, an editor at Taschen, wrote, \"\"\"Their organic and collaborative design process has produced the most innovative and popular identity the NBA has seen in years.\" In 2009, the Rockets invoked the championship years with an alternate red uniform, featuring gold numbers and side stripes. The Rockets had two sleeved alternate jerseys for the 2015\u201316 season, an alternate silver-colored uniform whose design referenced the design of NASA's Gemini-Titan rocket, and a red and gold jersey featuring the nickname \"Clutch City\". For the 2016\u201317 season, the Rockets began to wear a black alternate uniform.\nFollowing the switch to Nike in 2017, the Rockets made some slight tweaks to the uniform. While the black \"Statement\" uniform remained mostly unchanged, the red \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" uniforms now feature truncated side striping that no longer wrap around the shoulders. The Rockets also wore a \"City\" uniform that was similar to their red \"Icon\" uniforms but with Chinese lettering in place of \"Rockets\" in front; the design was tweaked the following season with a deeper red and old gold accents.\nOn June 6, 2019, the Rockets unveiled a new secondary logo that depicts a basketball as a planet, and the ring has the \"Houston Rockets\" displayed with the classic \"R\" in the middle. A new uniform set was unveiled two weeks later. The red \"Icon\" and white \"Association\" designs featured updated block lettering and bold side panels that depict a launching rocket. The black \"Statement\" uniform remained with a few alterations. In addition, the Rockets brought back their throwback \"ketchup and mustard\" 1976\u201395 red uniform as part of Nike's \"Classic\" series. For the 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, the Rockets eschewed the Chinese New Year-themed designs and went with a NASA-inspired space theme.\nThe Rockets' \"City\" uniform for the 2020\u201321 season featured a powder blue base as a nod to the city of Houston. The colors resembled those of Houston's former NFL team, the Houston Oilers. For the 2021\u201322 season, the Rockets announced a partnership with Credit Karma to be featured on the team's jerseys as a sponsor.\nThe 2021\u201322 Rockets' \"City\" uniform referenced various uniform designs from the past. The navy base and white pinstripes were taken from the 1995\u20132003 uniforms. The modified \"ketchup and mustard\" logo on the waist, as well as a diagonally arranged \"Houston\" wordmark and block numbers, paid tribute to the 1975\u20131995 uniforms. The modern \"R\" logo and white double arches on the side were an homage to the 2003\u20132019 uniforms. The Rockets retained this \"City\" uniform in the 2022\u201323 season.\nFor the 2023\u201324 \"City\" uniform, the Rockets drew inspiration from the uniforms worn by the Phi Slama Jama-era Houston Cougars of the early 1980s. A nod to both teams' legends Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, the white-based uniform featured \"H-Town\" in red cursive letters with white and blue trim, along with block numbers. The uniforms would also be paired with an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament, featuring a red base with a middle blue strip and silhouettes of the NBA Cup. This uniform was reused in the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe \"H-Town\" theme returned for the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform, this time honoring the 30th anniversary of the Rockets' 1994 and 1995 championships. The design featured \"H-Town\" (with 't' and 'n' in lowercase letters) in a wordmark similar to the team's 1972\u20131995 logo, and the black trim along the uniform was shaped after the team's championship banners. The logo of the team's previous home The Summit was emblazoned on the beltline, and the center court logo from that era was placed on the white space between the black piping. Signatures of Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, along with the phrases \"BELIEVE IT! AGAIN!\", were placed on the bottom of the jersey.\nMascots.\nThe mascot was introduced on March 14, 1995, formerly known as \"Clutch\" . From 1993 to 1995, the mascot was Turbo, a costumed man that performed acrobatic dunks and other maneuvers. In 1995, the Rockets debuted Clutch the Bear as a second mascot, a large teddy bear-like mascot that performs a variety of acts during the games. After eight years of serving as dual mascots, the performer playing Turbo retired, making Clutch the sole mascot for the team. The mascot was considered and voted fifth for the most recognizable mascot in the league, and was also inducted in the 2006 Mascot Hall of Fame.\nRivalries.\nThe Rockets have developed many rivalries within the Western Conference ever since the team returned there in 1980. Two are intrastate rivalries, with the San Antonio Spurs, who moved along with the Rockets after four years with them in the Eastern Conference, and the Dallas Mavericks, introduced that very season. Houston has faced both Texas teams in the playoffs since 1980, beating the Spurs three times and losing once. The Rockets lost twice to the Mavericks, while beating them once. Other famed rivalries were with the Los Angeles Lakers, who in the 1980s Showtime era only missed the NBA Finals when beaten by the Rockets, and the Utah Jazz, who the Rockets beat in both championship seasons but were defeated by Utah in five other occasions.\nHonors and statistics.\nIndividual honors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll-Star Weekend.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with team.\n\"Italics\" denotes still active but not with team.\nPoints scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther Statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Rockets currently do not own the draft rights to unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.\nA drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams.

Morey later deleted the tweet. Morey's tweet resulted in the Chinese Basketball Association's suspension of its relationship with the Rockets and the issuance of a statement of dissatisfaction from the consulate office of China in Houston. On October 6, Morey and the NBA each issued a separate statement addressing the original tweet; Morey said that he never intended his tweet to cause any offense, while the NBA said the tweet was \"Regrettable\". The statements drew attention and subsequent bipartisan criticism from several US politicians. Chinese media outlets, including the Chinese Communist Party-run \"People's Daily\", described Morey and the NBA's statements as non-apologetic and unacceptable, because they did not contain the word \"apologize\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72886", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72886", "title": "Memphis Grizzlies", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Memphis, Tennessee\nThe Memphis Grizzlies (referred to locally as the Grizz) are an American professional basketball team based in Memphis, Tennessee. The Grizzlies compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The Grizzlies play their home games at FedExForum. The Grizzlies are currently the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the city of Memphis, one of 4 professional teams in the state of Tennessee, along with the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League, the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League, and Nashville SC of Major League Soccer all of which play in Nashville, and the only professional basketball team in the state.\nThe team was originally established in Canada as the Vancouver Grizzlies in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, an expansion team that joined the NBA for the \u00a0season. After the 2000\u201301 season concluded, the Grizzlies left Vancouver and moved to Memphis.\nHistory.\n1995\u20132001: Vancouver Grizzlies.\nThe Vancouver Grizzlies were a Canadian professional basketball team based in Vancouver, British Columbia. They were part of the Midwest Division of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1995, along with the Toronto Raptors, as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. Original proposals were for the team to be called the Vancouver Mounties, but objections from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forced the team to find a new name. The nickname, \"Grizzlies\" was eventually selected, named after the grizzly bear indigenous to British Columbia. The Grizzlies played their home games at General Motors (GM) Place for the entirety of their six seasons in Vancouver.\nRelocation to Memphis.\nThe Vancouver Grizzlies applied to the NBA to relocate to Memphis, Tennessee on March 26, 2001, which was granted on July 3 leaving the Toronto Raptors as the only Canadian basketball team in the NBA. The team relocated following the 2000\u201301 season and were renamed the Memphis Grizzlies. After moving to Memphis, the team explored the possibility of changing \"Grizzlies\" to another name that better reflected the Memphis area. However, the community strongly supported the existing name. This is, primarily, because of the city's proud history with a previous team, also named Memphis Grizzlies. The original Memphis Grizzlies franchise played in the World Football League from 1974 to 1975. Memphis became the easternmost city in the Western Conference. In their first three seasons in Memphis, the Grizzlies played their home games at the Pyramid Arena.\nThe city of Memphis was previously represented by the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association (ABA) from 1970 to 1975.\n2001\u20132007: The Pau Gasol era.\nIn the 2001 NBA draft, the Atlanta Hawks chose Pau Gasol as the third overall pick, trading him to the Grizzlies. Forward Shane Battier was selected with the sixth pick in the same draft by the Vancouver Grizzlies. They also acquired Jason Williams from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Mike Bibby that same year. After the Grizzlies' first season in Memphis, Gasol won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. However, despite the strong draft class, general manager Billy Knight was let go. After Knight's departure and the season, the team hired former Los Angeles Laker and Hall of Famer Jerry West as general manager in 2002, who later received the 2003\u201304 NBA Executive of the Year Award. After West's arrival the team was changed a great deal from Knight's team, with the removal of Sidney Lowe as head coach after 0\u20138 start to the season and a great deal of player movement, with players such as Mike Miller and James Posey becoming vital to the team's success. During the 2002\u201303 season, Hubie Brown was hired to coach the Grizzlies.\nBefore the team could improve, though, one final mistake from the Vancouver era happened to bite them. Their first round pick in the 2003 NBA draft, in which they could have had their choice of future All-Stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, or Dwyane Wade, had been traded to the Detroit Pistons in 1997 for Otis Thorpe. Due to the structure of the lottery, the Grizzlies ended up losing the second overall pick, one which likely could have changed their future course by selecting any of the aforementioned players, for a player who didn't even play a full season for the team, playing only 47 games for the team before being released. Even considering the Pistons themselves used the pick on Darko Mili\u010di\u0107, widely considered one of that year's biggest draft busts, the Grizzlies had indirectly performed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history.\nBrown won the NBA Coach of the Year Award during the next season when the Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs for the first time in team history in 2004 as the sixth seed in the Western Conference in a drastic change from being perennially one of the worst teams in the NBA. They also won a then-record 50 games under Gasol and Williams. In the playoffs, they faced the San Antonio Spurs, who swept them out of the playoffs in four games.\n2004\u20132007.\nBrown stepped down as head coach during the 2004\u201305 season. At the time of his resignation, the Grizzlies had a losing record but West hired TNT analyst and former coach Mike Fratello to replace Brown. The Grizzlies' record improved and the team advanced to the post-season for the second consecutive season. However, the Grizzlies were swept out in the first round again, this time by the Phoenix Suns. After the season, which ended with anger between Fratello and many of the players, namely Bonzi Wells and Jason Williams, the team had an active 2005 off-season in which they revamped the team and added veterans. While the Grizzlies lost Wells, Williams, Stromile Swift, and James Posey, they acquired Damon Stoudamire, Bobby Jackson, Hakim Warrick, and Eddie Jones. They made the playoffs for the third consecutive year as well.\nWith their record they had the fifth seed in the Western Conference playoffs and would face the Dallas Mavericks, who swept the Grizzlies in four games.\nFollowing the 2006 NBA draft, Jerry West traded Shane Battier to the Houston Rockets for their first-round pick Rudy Gay and Stromile Swift. Before the 2006\u201307 season, they suffered a blow when Gasol broke his left foot while playing for Spain in the World Championships. The Grizzlies started the season 5\u201317 without Gasol, and then went 1\u20137 while he was limited to about 25 minutes per game. At that point, Fratello was fired and replaced by Tony Barone Sr. as interim coach. Barone was the team's player personnel director and had never coached an NBA game though he had coached at the collegiate level for both Creighton and Texas A&amp;M being named coach of the year in their conferences three times during his tenure.\n2007\u20132010: Rebuilding.\nThe Grizzlies finished the 2006\u201307 season with a league-worst 22\u201360 record, and Jerry West announced his resignation from his position as the team's general manager shortly after the end of the regular season. The team also hired Marc Iavaroni, who was previously with the Phoenix Suns as an assistant coach, to be the team's new head coach. Despite the last-place finish, the Grizzlies, who held the best chance of landing the first pick, ended up with the fourth pick in the 2007 NBA draft, with which the Grizzlies selected Mike Conley Jr.\nOn June 18, 2007, the Grizzlies named former Boston Celtics general manager Chris Wallace as the team's general manager and vice president of basketball operations, replacing the retired West. A few days later, they hired former Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic head coach Johnny Davis, longtime NBA assistant coach Gordon Chiesa, and the head coach of the 2007 NBA Development League champion Dakota Wizards, David Joerger, as the team's new assistant coaches. Gene Bartow was named the Grizzlies' president of basketball operations on August 16, 2007. On February 1, 2008, Pau Gasol was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first-round draft picks.\nOn January 22, 2009, head coach Marc Iavaroni was fired and replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Johnny Davis for two games. Lionel Hollins was named the Grizzlies' permanent head coach on January 25, 2009.\nOn June 25, 2009, with the second overall pick in the NBA draft, Memphis selected Hasheem Thabeet, then selected DeMarre Carroll with the 27th overall pick. On September 9, 2009, the Grizzlies signed free agent Allen Iverson to a one-year, $3.5 million deal. He only played three games (none in Memphis) before he left for \"personal problems\". He was then waived by the Grizzlies. Following Iverson's departure, the Grizzlies improved. With new acquisition Zach Randolph playing at an All-Star level, Marc Gasol's improvement, and a commitment to defense, the Grizzlies were in playoff contention for much of the 2009\u201310 season, before finishing 10th in the Western Conference with a win\u2013loss record of 40\u201342.\n2010\u20132019: The \"Grit and Grind\" era.\n2010\u20132017: Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Mike Conley and Tony Allen era.\nGoing into the 2010\u201311 season the Grizzlies celebrated the tenth year of basketball in Memphis. The season started with tremendous enthusiasm by the fan base in the Memphis area. Although the Grizzlies and their fans were celebrating the tenth season, the Grizzlies were also cheering for the eighth spot in the Western Conference playoffs. They finished with a 46\u201336 record. The Grizzlies found their way back into the post-season for the first time in five years in the 2010\u201311 season after a 101\u201396 home victory over the Sacramento Kings on April 8, 2011. While in the playoff hunt in February 2011, the Grizzlies traded Hasheem Thabeet, DeMarre Carroll, and a protected future first-round pick to the Houston Rockets for Shane Battier, and Ishmael Smith.\nThe team became known locally and nationally for its \"Grit and Grind\"-style of basketball which means disruptive defense through high pressure on the ball (they were the team with the most steals per game in 2010\u201311) and their inside-out offense (they were the highest-scoring team in the paint also). The Grizzlies achieved several firsts in franchise history during the 2011 NBA playoffs. Entering the playoffs as an eighth seed, the team won their first playoff game in franchise history on April 17 with a 101\u201398 victory on the road against the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs. Memphis then won their first home playoff game when they beat the Spurs 91\u201388 on April 23. Finally, on April 29, the team won their first playoff series when they beat the Spurs in Game 6, 99\u201391 to win the series 4\u20132. This was only the fourth time in NBA history that an #8 seed defeated a #1 seed, and only the second time in a best-of-seven series (the first two were in a best-of-five series). The Grizzlies' historic season came to an end after the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated them in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals.\nThe team re-signed Marc Gasol and Hamed Haddadi after the 2010\u201311 season.\nThe Grizzlies found their way back into the post-season for the second time in six years in the 2011\u201312 season after a 103\u201391 home victory over the New Orleans Hornets on April 18, 2012. They finished the 2011\u201312 season with a 41\u201325 record, fourth in the Western Conference. However, they were eliminated in the first round by the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games.\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Grizzlies drafted Tony Wroten with the 25th overall pick. Their biggest signing in an effort to improve their bench was bringing in Jerryd Bayless. They also acquired Wayne Ellington from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Dante Cunningham.\nOn June 11, Michael Heisley reportedly had an agreement in principle to sell the Memphis Grizzlies to communications technology magnate Robert J. Pera, who at 34 had a spot on Forbes' 2012 list of the 10 youngest billionaires in the world. The purchase price was in the $350 million range. On August 23, Pera reached an agreement with a group of local partners including J.R. \"Pitt\" Hyde, Staley Cates, Ed Dobbs, Duncan Williams and Billy Orgel. On October 25, Robert Pera was officially approved as the owner of the Memphis Grizzlies. On November 4, Pera named Jason Levien the chief executive officer and managing partner of the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 13, 2012, ESPN announced that John Hollinger was hired by the Grizzlies as their new vice president of basketball operations.\nOn January 23, 2013, the Grizzlies acquired Jon Leuer from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Marreese Speights, Wayne Ellington, Josh Selby, and a future first-round pick. On January 30, the Grizzlies traded Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to the Toronto Raptors in a three team deal also involving the Detroit Pistons. The Grizzlies acquired Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye from the Pistons and Ed Davis and a future second-round pick from the Raptors.\nAt the end of the season, Memphis finished with their best franchise record of 56\u201326, second in the division and as the fifth seed in the playoffs. Also, Marc Gasol was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year. In the opening round, Memphis defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in six games after trailing in the series 0\u20132. This avenged their defeat from the previous year at the hands of the Clippers. Memphis then went on to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history when they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4\u20131 in their semi-finals series. This was a rematch of their meeting in the 2011 playoffs, which the Thunder won in seven games. However, the Grizzlies' season ended in the Conference Finals as they were swept by the eventual conference champions, San Antonio Spurs in yet another rematch/reversal from the 2011 playoffs.\nThe Grizzlies struggled to begin the 2013\u201314 season, starting out at 14\u201318 with Marc Gasol out, and entered the All-Star break with a win\u2013loss record of 29\u201323. They went 21\u20139 after, finishing in third place in the Southwest division and in seventh place in the Western Conference with a win\u2013loss record of 50\u201332, including a 14-game winning streak at FedExForum. They faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the playoffs and had a record four straight overtimes from games 2\u20135, going 3\u20131 in the overtimes. The Grizzlies fell 4\u20133, despite an effort by Gasol in Game 7 without Randolph after he was suspended for punching Thunder center Steven Adams in Game 6.\nOn October 29, 2014, the Grizzlies defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 105\u2013101 for the franchise's first victory in a season opener since 2000, the year before the team moved to Memphis.\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, the Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs as the fifth seed in the Western Conference. In the first round, the Grizzlies defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in five games. Games 4 and 5 were played without Mike Conley Jr., who in Game 3 suffered multiple facial fractures in a collision with Blazers guard CJ McCollum. In the second round, they found themselves facing off against the top-seeded Golden State Warriors and MVP Stephen Curry. The Warriors took Game 1, and Conley returned in Game 2 to lead the Grizzlies to a 108\u201395 victory. Memphis took a 2\u20131 series lead before Golden State ultimately dispatched the Grizzlies in six games.\nOn April 1, 2016, the Grizzlies signed their 28th player for the season, an NBA record. On July 6, 2017, the team's management announced that Randolph's number 50 jersey would be retired in the future after he became a free agent, and eventually signed with the Sacramento Kings. Tony Allen also left and signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, closing the door on the \"Grit and Grind\" era.\n2017\u20132019: End of an era.\nWith the departures of Randolph and Allen, the 2017\u201318 Grizzlies missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2009\u201310 season, and tied their longest losing streak in franchise history near the end of the season with 19 straight losses from January 31 to March 17, 2018, while suffering from their worst loss in franchise history during the regular season on March 22, losing to the Charlotte Hornets 140\u201379, all with their point guard Mike Conley Jr. missing all but 12 games due to injuries. The Grizzlies tried to be competitive again with Conley and others back in the beginning of the 2018\u201319 season, but were on the outside looking in as the trade deadline approached and they were standing at the 14th seed with a 22\u201333 record by February 5. The Grizzlies decided to move on from their two franchise players and the last remnants of the \"Grit and Grind\" era with Marc Gasol getting traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, Delon Wright, C. J. Miles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick. After the season, on July 6, Mike Conley Jr. was traded to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Grayson Allen, Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder and the 23rd pick of the 2019 NBA draft.\n2019\u2013present: The Ja Morant era.\nAfter the end of the 2018\u201319 season, controlling owner Robert Pera announced a restructuring of the Grizzlies' basketball operations department: \"In order to put our team on the path to sustainable success, it was necessary to change our approach to basketball operations\". J. B. Bickerstaff was relieved from his duties as head coach and general manager Chris Wallace was reallocated to a role exclusively in player scouting. Jason Wexler was announced as team president and Zachary Kleiman was promoted to general manager and EVP of basketball operations.\nOn June 12, 2019, the Grizzlies announced Taylor Jenkins as the team's new head coach.\nWith the second pick in the 2019 NBA draft, the Grizzlies selected Ja Morant. Additionally, they received Brandon Clarke after he was selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the 21st pick, and then immediately traded to the Grizzlies for the 23rd pick (via the Utah Jazz) and the Grizzlies' 2024 second-round pick. The Grizzlies rebuilt their roster with a young core consisting of Morant, Clarke, Allen, Dillon Brooks, and Jaren Jackson Jr.\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, the Grizzlies were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season. They finished in ninth place in the Western Conference and had a chance to make it to the 2020 NBA playoffs, needing to win two games against the Portland Trail Blazers to advance. In the first and only play-in game, the Trail Blazers defeated the Grizzlies 126\u2013122. At the conclusion of the season, Morant, who averaged 17.8 points and 7.3 assists per game, was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, earning 99 out of 100 first place votes on the ballot. Morant and teammate Brandon Clarke were also named to the 2019\u201320 NBA All-Rookie First Team.\nThe Grizzlies finished the COVID-shortened 2020\u201321 NBA season with a 38\u201334 record, earning them the ninth best record in the Western Conference and a chance to make the NBA playoffs through the play-in tournament by winning two games in a row. The Grizzlies did so with a 100\u201396 victory over the 10th-place San Antonio Spurs, at home on May 19, 2021 followed by a 117\u2013112 victory over the 8th-place Golden State Warriors in San Francisco on May 21, 2021, to claim the Western Conference's 8th seed behind 35 points from Morant. The Grizzlies' first-round match-up pitted them against the Utah Jazz, who boasted the top record in the league. The Grizzlies upset the Jazz in Salt Lake City with a 112\u2013109 victory in Game 1 but went on to lose the series in five games. Rookie wing Desmond Bane, acquired by Memphis with the 30th overall pick in the 2020 NBA draft, was selected to the 2020\u201321 NBA All-Rookie Second Team for his campaign that season.\nThe Grizzlies saw greater success in the following 2021\u201322 NBA season. By the All-Star break, the Grizzlies had recorded a record of 41\u201319, good for 3rd place in the West. On March 30, 2022, the Grizzlies clinched their first division title in franchise history and the Western Conference's second seed, their highest ever seeding placement, when they defeated the San Antonio Spurs. The Grizzlies finished the regular season with a record of 56\u201326. They would go on to defeat Minnesota in the first round before losing to the Golden State Warriors in the second round in 6 games.\nThe 2022\u201323 NBA season saw the Grizzlies finish 51\u201331, setting them up with the second seed in the West. Jaren Jackson Jr. was named an All Star for the first time and was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year during the season. After a season plagued by injuries and off the court issues, Memphis marched into the playoffs that saw them matched up against the Lakers. The Grizzlies would lose the first round series against the seventh seed Los Angeles Lakers (2\u20134).\nIn the off-season, the Grizzlies signed veteran and former MVP Derrick Rose and acquired Josh Christopher in a trade for Dillon Brooks. They started the 2023\u201324 NBA season off with zero wins and six losses, their worst start since the 2002\u201303 season. After being suspended for 25 games, Morant returned and hit the game winning buzzer beater in his first game back. After nine games back, Morant suffered a shoulder injury and was declared to miss the rest of the season. Additionally, Marcus Smart only appeared in 20 games this season, similar to how Derrick Rose only played in 24 games including 7 starts, as the Grizzlies wrapped up an injury riddled season with a record of 27\u201355, setting a record for the most players used in a season.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Grizzlies. For the full season-by-season history, see list of Memphis Grizzlies seasons.\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W\u2013L% = Winning percentage\"\nUniforms.\nUpon their arrival in Memphis, the Grizzlies retained the same uniforms they wore in their final season in Vancouver, but with the city name emblazoned on both the white and black uniform. Turquoise and red served as the accent colors. After one season, the Grizzlies made a minor tweak, replacing the \"G-bear\" logo with the \"howling bear\" logo on the right leg. The \"ball and claws\" logo was also added above the player's name.\nCoinciding with the move from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004, the Grizzlies released a new uniform design featuring navy blue, Beale Street blue, smoke blue, and gold. It also brought back the team name on the home uniform. The letters and numbers employed a distinct split-letter style reminiscent of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Cavaliers' 1990s uniforms. The logo also changed from a \"howling bear\" to a more stoic bear head. As a result of their logo change, the Grizzlies are currently one of nine NBA teams without a basketball on their logo, along with the Bulls, the Cavaliers, the Bucks, the Hawks, the Trail Blazers, the Warriors, the Rockets, and the Spurs.\nIn 2009, the Grizzlies released an alternate uniform with Beale Street blue as the base color. Unlike the primary uniforms, this design featured the city name and player's name arranged in a straight alignment; the primaries had a radially arched alignment.\nWhen the Grizzlies switched to Adidas' Revolution 30 system in 2010, the numbers changed from a split-letter style to a bolder, single-color style, presumably due to the difficulty of producing such design. In 2017, the Grizzlies wore a black sleeved uniform as a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.\nAfter switching to Nike in 2017, the Grizzlies made minimal changes to their uniforms, with the exception of the Beale Street alternates now featuring the player's name below the number. However, the following season, the Grizzlies drastically changed their uniforms. The white \"Association\" and navy blue \"Icon\" uniform featured player names below the number and straight alignment for the city name and team name respectively. Both uniforms featured three alternating lines on the beltline, which spelled \"MEM\", the primary logo on the left leg, and asymmetrical striping. On the Beale Street blue \"Statement\" uniform, player names were placed above the number, and the team name was arranged in a radial arch. The primary logo is on the beltline and on the left leg while the aforementioned alternating \"MEM\" lines surround the logo. In 2022, the \"Statement\" uniform was modified, featuring the full team name (\"Memphis\" in gold, \"Grizzlies\" in navy/smoke/navy split letters) in front, the primary logo on the right leg, and \"MEM\" lines on the striping and beltline.\nAs part of the Nike contract, the Grizzlies also wore a fourth uniform, the \"City\" uniform. The original \"City\" uniform had a white base and featured lettering based on the \"I am a Man\" protest banners from the Memphis sanitation strike of 1968. The 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform, which featured a grey base and gold letters, paid tribute to professional wrestling in Memphis. The Grizzlies did not wear a \"City\" uniform for the 2019\u201320 season, opting for the throwback Vancouver Grizzlies uniforms instead. In the 2020\u201321 season, the Grizzlies returned to wearing \"City\" uniforms, this time with a black base, metallic gold lettering and turquoise trim as a tribute to Isaac Hayes and Stax Records. This uniform was recolored to the Grizzlies' current color scheme in a white base and was used as their \"City\" uniform in the 2025\u201326 season. In the 2021\u201322 season, the Grizzlies wore a commemorative \"City\" uniform featuring a mix of styles used by the team. The midnight-based uniform featured elements from the Vancouver era as well as the \"Grit and Grind\" and modern eras. Then for the 2022\u201323 \"City\" uniform, the Grizzlies wore black uniforms with Beale Street blue, chrome and gold accents in homage to the Memphis rap genre. The \"City\" uniform for the 2023\u201324 season, according to the team, \"represents the pure simple joy of growing up playing basketball on local courts dreaming of representing your hometown team\". The black-based uniform features the \"MEM\" lines in white with gold numbers. The \"City\" uniform used in the 2024\u201325 season celebrated the 50th anniversary of the rebranding of Memphis' former ABA team, the Memphis Sounds, using a red base, Beale Street blue and gold accents, and a throwback \"Memphis\" wordmark in homage to the Sounds' logo.\nPersonnel.\nRetained draft rights.\nThe Grizzlies hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends. This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Grizzlies originally planned to retire Tony Allen's no. 9 jersey on January 28, 2022. However, in November 2021, the ceremony was postponed at the request of Allen. In September 2024, it was announced that the ceremony would go ahead on March 15, 2025.\nAfter trading Mike Conley Jr., the team announced they would retire Conley Jr.'s no. 11 jersey.\nThe NBA retired Bill Russell's no. 6 for all its member teams on August 11, 2022.\nTelevision and radio.\nThe Grizzlies appear on television on the pay-TV channel FanDuel Sports Network Southeast, owned and operated by FanDuel Sports Network. The TV broadcast crew is play-by-play announcer Pete Pranica, analyst Brevin Knight and sideline reporter Rob Fischer. Since the 2024\u201325 season, 5 games are simulcast over-the-air on Gray Media owned WMC-TV, WSMV-TV and WBXX-TV.\nOn radio, the Grizzlies are heard on their flagship station WMFS-FM \"ESPN 92.9\". The radio broadcast crew is play-by-play announcer Eric Hasseltine, and analysts Hank McDowell and Elliot Perry.\nTraditions.\nMascot.\nGrizz is the official mascot of the Memphis Grizzlies. He was first introduced in 1995 when the team was in Vancouver, British Columbia. Grizz was named 2011 NBA Mascot of the Year.\nFriends of Grizz.\nIn 2007, the performer playing Grizz was diagnosed with cancer. As a show of support, the Grizzlies chose not to have Grizz appear until he recovered. During this period, mascots from other teams performed at Grizzlies home games in Grizz's place. The franchise also launched a program called \"Friends of Grizz\", with donations and proceedings going to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\nGrowl Towels.\nGrowl Towels are the Grizzlies' trademark gold rally towels given to fans at every home playoff game. Originally white, they made their debut in 2004 in the third and fourth games of the franchise's first ever playoff series. They switched to gold when the Grizzlies changed their team colors for the 2004\u20132005 season. Since 2013, Growl Towels have rotated various popular team slogans such as \"Grit &amp; Grind\", \"All Heart\", or \"Ain't No Runnin' in the M\", and each towel identifies the playoff year, round and game number it was released. They became notable across the league during Memphis' seven consecutive playoff runs starting in 2011. During their 2013 run to the Western Conference Finals, the Grizzlies printed over 100,000 towels.\n\"Whoop that Trick\".\nThe popular song by Memphis rapper Al Kapone from the locally filmed \"Hustle &amp; Flow\" has become a standard during Grizzlies games since erupting as a spontaneous chant among fans during the 2013 playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers.\nRivalries.\nLos Angeles Clippers.\nDespite being one of the youngest squads in the NBA, the Grizzlies are rivals with the Los Angeles Clippers, since the 2011\u201312 season, when the Clippers eliminated the Grizzlies in seven games in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. The Grizzlies returned the favor in the 2012\u201313 season, eliminating the Clippers in six games in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs. There have also been violent scuffles between the players, mainly between the Grizzlies Zach Randolph and the Clippers Blake Griffin. The Grizzlies are also the first team to draw an ejection on Clippers guard Chris Paul after he elbowed Marc Gasol in the ribs in the closing minutes of Game 6. When asked about a rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers center DeAndre Jordan stated, \"I don't think it'll ever be a rivalry. You guys [in the media] want it to be, though. I would say Memphis more than the Lakers. I hate every other NBA team in the league. If anybody [is our rival], I'd say Memphis.\" Although the two teams never met in the 2014 playoffs, they still engaged in close, heated matchups in the 2014\u201315 season. In a Grizzlies home game against the Clippers, the crowd was given flip-flop sandals designating Clippers players as \"floppers\". Clippers leads all time meeting 52\u201349.\nOklahoma City Thunder.\nThe Grizzlies also have a rivalry brewing with the Oklahoma City Thunder, dating back to when the teams were based in Vancouver and Seattle, respectively. The squads have faced each other in the playoffs in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2025 with the Thunder beating the Grizzlies in the conference semifinals in 2011 and in the conference quarterfinals in 2014, both in seven games. The Grizzlies handled the Thunder in five games during the conference semifinals in 2013 before getting beaten by the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals that same year. Thunder leads all time meeting 66\u201335.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThe Grizzlies' rivalry with the San Antonio Spurs goes way back in 2004 when the Spurs swept the Grizzlies in the first round. Seven years later, they would meet again in the 2011 NBA playoffs. The Grizzlies upset the Spurs in six games, which made it the fourth time ever an 8th seed beat a first seed in the playoffs. They would then meet again in the conference finals in 2013, where the Spurs once again swept the Grizzlies to go to the NBA Finals. The Grizzlies got swept again by the Spurs in 2016 due to a multitude of injuries suffered during the season. They met again the following year, where the Grizzlies lost in six games. The Grizzlies got payback on the Spurs in the 2021, play-in tournament by the score of 100\u201396. Spurs leads all time meeting 74\u201335.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72887", "revid": "51022763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72887", "title": "Minnesota Timberwolves", "text": "National Basketball Association team in Minneapolis\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves (often referred to as the Wolves or T-wolves) are an American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. The team was founded during the league expansion in 1989 and has played its home games at Target Center since 1990. In 2025, longtime owner Glen Taylor completed the sale of the team to former MLB star Alex Rodriguez and his partner Marc Lore, finalizing an agreement that began in 2021. In June 2025, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously signed off on the sale. Alex Rodriguez, Marc Lore, and a consortium of unnamed limited partners purchased the franchise for $1.5 billion.\nLike most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, contributing to their having the lowest win percentage of all active NBA teams. But after acquiring Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft, the team qualified for the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals that same season. Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player for that season. The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007. Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 off-season. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in 2018.\nThe Timberwolves experienced a renaissance in the 2020s, sparked by the selection of number one overall pick Anthony Edwards in 2020 and the hiring of head coach Chris Finch in 2021. The two have led the team to four straight playoff berths, including two straight Western Conference Finals appearances.\nHistory.\n1989\u20131995: team creation and early years.\nNBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers (1947\u20131960) departed to Los Angeles in 1960. The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Miami Heat) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the 1989\u201390 season. There were two previous American Basketball Association (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the Minnesota Muskies (1967\u201368), and the Minnesota Pipers (1968\u201369). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.\nThe franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2\u20131. The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the contiguous 48 states.\nThe NBA held an expansion draft on June 15, 1989 to allocate players to the Timberwolves and Magic. The team selected Pistons forward Rick Mahorn with their first pick. Fresh off an NBA championship and unhappy with the prospect of playing for a team destined to lose, Mahorn refused to report to training camp. He was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers just before the season began.\nThe Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106\u201394. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, losing to the Chicago Bulls 96\u201384. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125\u2013118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2\u00a0ppg, went on to a 22\u201360 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Despite their losing record, the Timberwolves set an NBA record for attendance, drawing over 1\u00a0million fans to their home games. This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99\u201388 in the final home game of the season.\nThe next season, the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29\u201353. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991\u201392 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15\u201367 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19\u201363 and 20\u201362 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".\nAs winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21\u201361 in 1994\u201395, and the future looked bleak.\n1995\u20132007: the Kevin Garnett era.\nIn the 1995 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall), and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb. Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors' forward Tom Gugliotta. These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26\u201356 record.\nIn 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury, the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40\u201342. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games. The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor.\nIn 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA. Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45\u201337, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98\u201393. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98\u201390. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.\nIn 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25\u201325 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.\nIn 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft. He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50\u201332. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games. The Wolves opened the 1999\u20132000 regular season with two home games against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome on November 6 and 7.\nIn the summer of 2000, guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.\nAlso in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001\u20132005), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47\u201335 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.\nA number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including Gary Trent, Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith. The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30\u201310. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50\u201332 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak, who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.\nThe 2002\u201303 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51\u201331 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After losing at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3\u20131 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.\n2003\u20132004: Western Conference finals appearance.\nIn 2003, Rob Babcock was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager Kevin McHale made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward Joe Smith and guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson, Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell. They also signed sharp-shooter Fred Hoiberg, and former first overall pick Michael Olowokandi as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson, and Mark Madsen.\nDespite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man Wally Szczerbiak (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the 2003\u201304 NBA season, finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58\u201324. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made the all-star team, and after the season, Garnett was named 1st Team All NBA, and earned his first MVP award averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.\nDuring the 2004 NBA playoffs, the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, before beating the Sacramento Kings in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference finals. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Sam Cassell injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous \"big balls\" dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series. Many around the NBA, including both Flip Saunders and Phil Jackson believe that had he been healthy, the Wolves would have advanced to the finals.\nDeparture of Flip Saunders.\nGoing into the 2004\u201305 season, the Wolves roster remained virtually the same from the previous season; however, Babcock left to become the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and the team was also plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, and Troy Hudson during the off-season. After a disappointing start to the season, head coach Flip Saunders was replaced by general manager and long-time friend Kevin McHale, who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies, ending the season with a record of 44\u201338.\nDuring the 2005 off-season, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Dwane Casey, San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo, former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman, Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting, among others.\nOn June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.\nIn the 2005 draft, the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants, a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round. The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright, a guard from Indiana, with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).\nDuring the off-season, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jari\u0107 and Lionel Chalmers. They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili.\nOn January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi, and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics. In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis, center Mark Blount, forward Justin Reed, guard Marcus Banks, and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.\nIn the 2006 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the 6th overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash.\nOn January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman. McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53\u201369. They finished the 2006\u201307 season with a record of 32\u201350, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.\n2007\u20132010: post-Kevin Garnett era.\nOn July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history. Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThat summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard. In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick.\nIn the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer, with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, both being from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators.\nMinnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul, as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92\u201381. To start the season, the Wolves began 0\u20135 before ending the drought with a home win over the Sacramento Kings. That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jari\u0107 were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22\u201360. On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams.\nIn the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner, and Marko Jari\u0107 to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Jason Collins, and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, \"a deal we couldn't pass up.\"\nIn 2008, in celebration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the team unveiled an updated version of its logo and uniforms. The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center, returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood.\nOn December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4\u201315, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years.\nThose questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10\u20134 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans, sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks. Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24\u201358 record.\nOn June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying \"this is going to be a transition period.\" For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis, then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers, to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis's first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15\u201367 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets, who finished at 12\u201370.\n2010\u20132014: the Timberwolves Process era.\nOn July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley, the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft. In a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks, the NBA's first 30\u201330 game in 28 years. Love was later named an All Star for the 2010\u201311 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011, in a win over the Houston Rockets. On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers. The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100\u201377 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN.\nOn February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.\nOn the downside, with a 121\u2013102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17\u201365, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010\u201311 NBA season's worst record. During the off-season, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft, with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona. The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiej\u016bnas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller, the draft rights to Nikola Miroti\u0107 (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic's rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.\nOn July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32\u2013132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.\nThe Timberwolves began the 2011\u201312 NBA season with a 17\u201317 record before the All-Star break. On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant. The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players. The team finished with a record of 26\u201340, with the only win of the team's final 14 games coming against the Detroit Pistons. The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger.\nOn June 26, 2012, the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft. During the off-season, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract. The deal was announced on July 31. With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the off-season included Andrei Kirilenko, Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson. While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free-agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio. But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3. One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs, albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury. On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach. This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster. The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended, with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him. In the 2013 NBA draft, the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.\nOn March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular season game with a 143\u2013107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005\u201306 season. The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2004\u201305 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year, despite holding the league's highest point differential at the end of the season. On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97\u2013133 record in three seasons with the team.\n2014\u20132015: the arrival of Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine.\nOn August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved, Luc Mbah a Moute, and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.\nThe 2014\u201315 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105\u2013101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97\u201391 victory over the Detroit Pistons. On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played an international home game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets. The Timberwolves had a 16\u201366 record for the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year.\nDespite this, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year, the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest. LaVine and Wiggins, dubbed \"The Bounce Brothers\", were seen as being the future of the franchise.\n2015\u20132020: the Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins era.\n2015\u20132016: the arrival of Karl-Anthony Towns.\nDue to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014\u201315 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25, the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick and acquired Minnesota's own Tyus Jones through a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThe 2014\u201315 season also saw the return of Kevin Garnett. In February 2015, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets, waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In his first game back, Garnett resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolves player since his departure and the team defeated the Washington Wizards 97\u201377 at the Target Center.\nOn June 6, 2014, Flip Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint. During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a result, during his recovery, he would delegate his coaching position over to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. Mitchell took over as head coach. In honor of Saunders, the team announced that they would wear a patch reading \"FLIP\" on their uniforms for the duration of the 2015\u201316 season.\n2016\u20132019: the Tom Thibodeau saga.\nOn April 20, 2016, the Timberwolves agreed to sign Tom Thibodeau to be their head coach and president of basketball operations. He was previously an assistant coach for the team from 1989 to 1991. On September 23, 2016, Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. He expressed interest in playing one more year for the Timberwolves but felt that his knees would be unable to hold up for the duration of the season. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 31\u201351 record, having only a two-game improvement from their previous season.\n2018: the arrival of Jimmy Butler and the return to the playoffs.\nOn June 22, 2017, the Timberwolves acquired Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall pick in the 2017 draft in trade for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick in the draft (used to select Lauri Markkanen). This trade marked the end of the LaVine and Wiggins duo, dubbed \"Bounce Brothers\". Later that night, the Timberwolves selected center Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick in the draft. Later, the team added Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford and Derrick Rose during free agency. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 47\u201335 record, which became the first winning season since the 2004\u201305 season, and secured the last spot in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season with a 112\u2013106 win over the Denver Nuggets. The 2017\u201318 season also ended the longest streak without a playoff appearance at 13 seasons. The Timberwolves would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets in five games.\nOn November 12, 2018, the Timberwolves traded Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario \u0160ari\u0107, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick. On January 6, 2019, Thibodeau was fired as head coach and president of basketball operations. After Thibodeau's firing, it was announced that Ryan Saunders would serve as interim head coach until a permanent head coach is found.\n2020\u2013present: the Anthony Edwards era and new ownership.\n2020\u20132024: Edwards and Towns duo.\nOn May 1, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Gersson Rosas, who previously served as the Houston Rockets' executive vice president of basketball operations, as their new president of basketball operations. On May 20, after conducting interviews with several candidates, the Timberwolves announced that Ryan Saunders had been hired to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his \"interim\" status. With Rosas' hiring, the Timberwolves also made several front office changes in the organization. The Timberwolves held both a first- and second-round draft pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The 11th pick (which was Cameron Johnson) along with Dario \u0160ari\u0107 was traded to the Suns in exchange for the 6th pick in Jarrett Culver, a small forward from Texas Tech. With the 43rd pick, the Timberwolves selected Jaylen Nowell, a point guard from Washington. They would also sign Naz Reid, an undrafted center from Louisiana State.\nOn February 6, 2020, The Timberwolves traded Andrew Wiggins to the Golden State Warriors for Karl-Anthony Towns' longtime friend D'Angelo Russell. At the season's end the Timberwolves got the 1st pick in the 2020 NBA draft. With that pick, the team drafted Anthony Edwards out of Georgia. In that same draft, they would trade up to select Jaden McDaniels with the 28th pick.\nOn February 21, 2021, head coach Ryan Saunders was fired, and Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch was hired to replace him. The Timberwolves finished the season 23-49 and missed the playoffs.\nIn April 2021, the Timberwolves announced that owner Glen Taylor had reached a deal with Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to sell the team. According to the deal, Lore and Rodriguez would become majority owners over the course of two years. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Lore and Rodriguez had purchased 20% of the team. They went on to purchase 20% more in 2022 before the deal stalled in 2024. The transaction also includes ownership in the Timberwolves' WNBA sister-club, the Minnesota Lynx. The deal valued the team at $1.5 billion.\nIn the off-season the Wolves traded guard Ricky Rubio to the Cleveland Cavaliers for forward Taurean Prince. The Wolves then acquired guard Patrick Beverley in exchange for Juancho Hernangomez and former first round pick Jarrett Culver. The final move they made was signing former 2020 draft pick Leandro Bolmaro to a 4-year, 11.8-million-dollar rookie contract.\nOn September 22, 2021, after Gersson Rosas was relieved of his President of Basketball Operations duties, Sachin Gupta was promoted as the new interim president of basketball operations, while keeping his role as EVP of basketball operations. The Timberwolves finished the 2021\u201322 season with a 46\u201336 record, the second-most regular season wins since making the conference finals in 2004. Despite All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out with 11 points in 24 minutes, the Wolves beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the play-in game to secure their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Timberwolves were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round in six games.\nOn May 23, 2022, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Tim Connelly, who previously served as the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, as their president of basketball operations, taking over Gupta's job. He was reportedly signed to a 5-year, $40 million contract by the Timberwolves, that includes ownership equity.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Timberwolves traded Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and 2022 22nd pick Walker Kessler and 4 future first round draft picks for 3x NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.\n2022\u201323: rise of Anthony Edwards and arrival of Rudy Gobert.\nThe Timberwolves began the 2022\u201323 season with high expectations following the Gobert trade. They were dealt a blow on November 28, 2022, when Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a severe calf strain that cost him 52 games. The injury pushed Anthony Edwards into a leadership role, with the first-time All-Star guiding the team to a 42\u201340 finish and a play-in tournament berth. After falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first game, the Timberwolves secured the 8th seed with a 25-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. They went on to lose to the first seed (and eventual NBA champion), the Denver Nuggets, in the first round in five games.\n2023\u201324: second conference finals appearance.\nThe 2023\u201324 season was their best since 2004, as they recorded 56 wins and landed the third seed in the Western Conference. They were the no. 1 defense in the league, anchored by eventual DPOY winner Rudy Gobert and All-Defensive selection Jaden McDaniels. Anthony Edwards made his first All-NBA Team, Karl-Anthony Towns made his fourth All-Star Appearance, and fan favorite Naz Reid was named Sixth Man of the Year.\nOn March 28, 2024, Glen Taylor announced that the sale of the team to prospective owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez was off. Lore and Rodriguez were expected to make their third and final payment installment to Taylor on March 27, 2024, raising their ownership interest from 40% to 80% in both the Timberwolves and Lynx, stemming from the April 2021 agreement to purchase the team. However, Lore and Rodriguez's payment was not made by the deadline. It is unclear what exactly transpired leading to the deal falling through. On March 20, 2024, it was reported the Lore and Rodriguez lost the financial backing of the Carlyle Group that had previously pledged $300 million towards the final installment. On March 21, 2024, it appeared as if Lore and Rodriguez had secured the backing of Blue Owl Capital to keep the sale on track. Lore and Rodriguez state they filed the necessary paperwork for league approval prior to the March 27, 2024, payment deadline, which should have granted them a ninety-day extension to submit the funds to Taylor. The parties met to mediate the dispute on May 1, 2024, but no agreement was reached. On June 6, 2024, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would join Rodriguez and Lore's ownership group.\nIn the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns 4\u20130. It was their first series win since 2004, and the first series sweep in Minnesota men's professional sports history. The series saw Anthony Edwards ascend into rarefied air, becoming the 2nd player under 22 to record a 30/5/5 statline in multiple playoff games. His performance spurred widespread comparisons to a young Michael Jordan, even from Jordan himself.\nIn the conference semifinals, the Timberwolves squared off with the Denver Nuggets in a highly anticipated rematch of their 2023 first round series. After a nailbiter Game 1, the teams spent the next five games trading blowouts, leaving things 3\u20133 heading back to Denver for Game 7. Down 15 points at half, the Timberwolves led a miraculous comeback, winning the game 98\u201390 and securing a spot in the Western Conference finals \u2014 20 years to the day of their last conference finals appearance. Their run ended when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in five games.\nIn the 2024 NBA draft, the Timberwolves acquired the rights to Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham, the 8th overall pick, from the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for a 2031 unprotected first-round pick and a 2030 first-round pick swap (top-1 protected). They also selected Terrence Shannon Jr., a guard from the University of Illinois, with the 27th overall pick.\n2024\u2013present: Julius Randle ande Donte Divincenzo/Karl-Anthony Towns trade.\nDuring the 2024 off-season, the Timberwolves traded All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for fellow big man All-Star Julius Randle, sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo and a first round pick.\nIn February 2025, Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez announced that they had won the arbitration case with Glen Taylor regarding the ownership transfer of the Timberwolves and WNBA's Lynx, stemming from their original 2021 agreement to acquire the franchises. The arbitration ruling validated Lore and Rodriguez's claim that they had submitted the necessary paperwork for an extension prior to their March 2024 payment deadline. On April 2, 2025, Glen Taylor publicly announced that he would not appeal the arbitration decision, officially clearing the path for Lore and Rodriguez to assume full control of the organization, pending final NBA Board of Governors approval.\nAmidst the transition in ownership, the Timberwolves also made significant roster moves to solidify their core. On October 23, 2024, the team reached a three-year, $110 million contract extension with reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert. The extension ensured that the Timberwolves retained the anchor of their league-leading defense and one of the most decorated defensive big men in NBA history, who had just won his record-tying fourth Defensive Player of the Year award. Gobert's presence, alongside rising superstar Anthony Edwards, All-Defensive forward Jaden McDaniels, and Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid, underscored Minnesota\u2019s commitment to competing at the highest level in the Western Conference for years to come.\nThe 2024\u201325 season began with the Timberwolves adjusting to their new roster. Julius Randle averaged 18.9 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 4.5 assists across his first 48 games, adding a physical presence and playmaking ability alongside Anthony Edwards and Gobert. However, the team faced a rocky stretch in November, including a four-game losing streak that led Edwards to publicly express frustration with the team\u2019s communication and chemistry.\nIn late January 2025, Randle suffered a right adductor strain during a game against the Utah Jazz, sidelining him for at least two weeks. Upon his return, the Timberwolves regained momentum, including a dramatic 140\u2013139 double-overtime win over the Denver Nuggets on April 1. On January 25, Anthony Edwards became the franchise's all-time leader in made three-pointers during a 133\u2013104 win over the Denver Nuggets. He surpassed Karl-Anthony Towns by hitting his 976th career three-pointer, finishing the game with 34 points on 14-of-23 shooting, including three made threes.\nThe Timberwolves finished the season with a 49\u201333 record, good for sixth place in the Western Conference and pitting them against the third-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. The Timberwolves defeated the Lakers in five games to advance to the conference semifinals in back-to-back years for the first time in franchise history. They then defeated the Golden State Warriors 4\u20131, earning them a trip to their second consecutive Western Conference Finals\u2014where they would lose 4\u20131 to the top-seeded and eventual champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\nLogos and uniforms.\nIn their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or \"Wolves\" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan. There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead. The Timberwolves would resurrect the blue uniforms from this era during the 2009\u201310 season, as part of the franchise's 20th anniversary.\nAfter drafting Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms in 1996. This time, the team added black and gray to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue. The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name \"Timberwolves\" in a different font. For the 1997\u201398 season, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007\u201308 season. The Timberwolves unveiled a new alternate logo on June 25, 2008.\nThe uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading \"Minnesota\" and the home jerseys reading \"Wolves\", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, gray and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts. The Timberwolves unveiled modified uniforms on August 16, 2010. The new uniforms eliminated the green from the collar, jersey and shorts, and the team also adjusted its number font again. On November 23, 2010, the Timberwolves unveiled a black alternate uniform. On November 27, 2013, the team changed their black road alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys.\nOn April 11, 2017, the team unveiled a new logo to coincide with the massive roster turnaround of the past few years. The Timberwolves revealed four new uniforms for the 2017\u201318 season as a part of a Nike-sponsored, league-wide initiative to redesign team uniforms. All four uniforms used \"Wolves\" for the team name and included the Nike Swoosh and Fitbit logos. The Association Edition uniform, revealed on August 10, 2017, consisted of a white uniform with navy and blue stripes and lettering. The Icon Edition uniform, which was revealed alongside its Association counterpart, has a navy body with white stripes and lettering. On September 15, the Timberwolves revealed their Statement Edition uniform which is primarily neon green with navy stripes, navy lettering for the team and player names, and white text with a navy stroke for the jersey numbers. The City Edition uniform, which is primarily gray with white lettering, was the last to be revealed on December 27.\nOn August 30, 2018, the Timberwolves unveiled their first \"Classic\" edition uniforms based on the black alternates used from 1997 to 2008. They also unveiled a dark purple \"City\" uniform inspired by Prince's 1984 album \"Purple Rain\", as well as a white \"Earned\" version that was exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 playoffs. The Prince-inspired \"City\" uniform was brought back in the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe Timberwolves' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform, which was unveiled on November 20, 2019, featured a sky blue base with white letters and trim that paid homage to the waters of the Mississippi River and the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (the \"Twin Cities\").\nFor the 2020\u201321 season, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the North Star, featuring a midnight black base and aurora green trim. A green star is affixed below the neckline and above the abbreviation \"MINN\" in gray.\nAs part of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform in the 2021\u201322 season mixed various elements from the franchise's previous uniforms. The royal blue base recalled the original 1989\u20131996 uniforms. The tree accents and lettering visually honored the 1996\u20132008 uniforms. The dark blue accents were inspired by the 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniforms. The original 1989\u20131996 logo was placed on the right leg, while the current logo was affixed on the left leg.\nBeginning with the 2022\u201323 season, the Timberwolves unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform, relegating neon green to trim color and featured a dark gray base. The full name \"Timberwolves\" was featured in front along with green-trimmed gray numbers. Also during the season, a new \"City\" uniform was unveiled, featuring a white base, black letters and stripes, and rainbow palette to represent Minnesota's colorful community.\nThe \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season featured a mostly blue base with white lake water gradients; the design represented the fun summertime activities of Minnesota's citizens, from camping to fishing and swimming. A special alternate court for the 2023 NBA in-season tournament was also unveiled to go with this uniform, featuring a light blue base with a lakewater blue strip in the middle. Also for the season, the Timberwolves brought back the original 1989\u20131996 white uniform for its \"Classic\" edition, this to celebrate the franchise's 35th season. This was paired with a modernized version of the original court used at the Target Center.\nThe 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform served as the inverse of last season's \"City\" uniform, this time with a mostly white base, ice blue gradients and black accents. The design was meant to capture Minnesota's winter landscape, with white and ice blue gradients representing the state's frozen lakes during winter.\nThe Timberwolves brought back the 1997\u20132008 black uniform as a \"Classic\" uniform. Unlike in 2018\u201319, the last time the team wore said uniform, it would be paired with an updated version of the maple parquet court the team used from 1996 to 2008.\nMascot.\nCrunch the Wolf is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves, According to the team's official website, \"Crunch was born in the northernmost part of Minnesota\u2019s wilderness areas. Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota\u2019s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Timberwolves.

A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.

WCCO had been the team's radio home from 2011 until the end of the 2022\u201323 season. Before that, KFAN/KFXN had been the Timberwolves' Twin Cities flagship station since the team's inception, except for a brief two-year hiatus to KLCI BOB 106.1 FM for the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons. Alan Horton has been the team's radio play-by-play announcer since the 2007\u201308 season.\nTelevision.\nThe Timberwolves' games are broadcast primarily on FanDuel Sports Network North. But if the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Wild occupy both FanDuel Sports Network North and FanDuel Sports Network North Extra, the game will be aired on WUCW as FanDuel Sports North Extra on The CW Twin Cities, and the Bally Sports app for viewers outside of WUCW's coverage area. The broadcasters are Michael Grady and Jim Petersen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He taught at the University of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine) and worked in its observatory. He lived in Paris in 1780\u201383, and in London from 1783 to 1786 as tutor in the house of the Saxon ambassador, Hans Moritz von Br\u00fchl. In Paris and London he entered the circles of astronomers like J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande, Pierre-Simon Laplace and William Herschel. In 1786 he was appointed by Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg director of the new observatory on Seeberg hill at Gotha, which was finished in 1791. At the close of the 18th century, he organised the first European congress of astronomers in 1798 and established the \"celestial police\", a group of twenty-four astronomers, to prepare for a systematic search for the \"missing planet\" predicted by the Titius\u2013Bode law between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was discovered by accident just as the search was getting underway. Using predictions made of the position of Ceres by Carl Friedrich Gauss, on 31 December 1801/1 January 1802, Zach (and, independently one night later, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers) recovered Ceres after it was lost during its passage behind the Sun. After the death of the duke in 1804, Zach accompanied the duke's widow on her travels in the south of Europe, and the two settled in Genoa in 1815 where he directed an observatory. He moved back to Paris in 1827 and died there in 1832.\nZach published \"Tables of the Sun\" (Gotha, 1792; new and improved edition, Gotha, 1804), and numerous papers on geographical subjects, particularly on the geographical positions of many towns and places, which he determined on his travels with a sextant.\nHis principal importance was, however, as editor of three scientific journals of great value: \"Allgemeine Geographische Ephemeriden\" (4 vols., Gotha, 1798\u20131799), \"Monatliche Correspondenz zur Bef\u00f6rderung der Erd- und Himmels-Kunde\" (28 vols., Gotha, 1800\u20131813, from 1807 edited by Bernhard von Lindenau), and \"\" (Genoa, 1818\u20131826, 14 vols., and one number of the 15th, the suppression of which was instigated by the Jesuits).\nHe was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1794, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1798, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1804, and an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1832.\nIn 1808, von Zach was in Marseille where he observed and explained the phenomenon of the Canigou mountain in eastern Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es which can be seen twice a year from there, 250\u00a0km away, by refraction of light.\nAsteroid 999 Zachia and the crater Zach on the Moon are named after him, while asteroid 64 Angelina is named after an astronomical station he set up near Marseille.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "72889", "revid": "50961602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72889", "title": "San Antonio Spurs", "text": "National Basketball Association team in San Antonio\nThe San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team based in San Antonio. The Spurs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Frost Bank Center. The Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association (ABA) teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA\u2013NBA merger, one of two former ABA teams to have won an NBA championship (the other being the Denver Nuggets), and the only former ABA team to have won multiple championships.\nThe franchise has won NBA championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. As of the 2022\u201323 season, the Spurs had the highest winning percentage among active NBA franchises. As of May 2017, the Spurs had the best winning percentage of any franchise in the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada over the previous three decades. From 1999\u20132000 to 2016\u201317, the Spurs won 50 games each season, setting a record of 18 consecutive 50-win seasons. In the 2018\u201319 season, the Spurs matched an NBA record for most consecutive playoff appearances with 22. The team's success has coincided with the tenure of former head coach Gregg Popovich, as well as with the playing careers of Spurs icons David Robinson (1989\u20132003) and Tim Duncan (1997\u20132016). In the 2022\u201323 season, the Spurs celebrated the club's 50th anniversary.\nThe Spurs in San Antonio.\nSpurs players are active members of the San Antonio community, and many former Spurs are still active in San Antonio, including David Robinson with the Carver Academy, and George Gervin with the George Gervin Youth Center. The Spurs set several NBA attendance records while playing at the Alamodome including the largest crowd ever for an NBA Finals game in 1999, and the Spurs continue to sell out the smaller Frost Bank Center (formerly SBC Center and AT&amp;T Center) on a regular basis. Since 2003, the team has been forced into an extended road trip for much of February since the Frost Bank Center hosts the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo during that month. This is informally known as the \"Rodeo Road Trip\". The Spurs have consistently posted winning road records during this period, including an NBA-record longest single road-trip winning streak (eight games out of nine, achieved in 2003). When the Spurs have won the NBA title, the team's victory parades have been boat trips on the San Antonio River Walk.\nHistory.\n1967\u20131973: Beginnings as the Dallas/Texas Chaparrals.\nThe San Antonio Spurs started out as the Dallas Chaparrals of the original version of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Coached by player/coach Cliff Hagan, the Dallas Chaparrals were one of 11 teams to take the floor in the inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps' second season was a bit of a disappointment, as the team finished in fourth place with a mediocre 41\u201337 record. In the playoffs, the Chaparrals quickly fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers. The team suffered from poor attendance and general disinterest in Dallas. During the 1970\u201371 season, the name \"Dallas\" was dropped in favor of \"Texas\" and an attempt was made to make the team a regional one, playing games in Fort Worth, at the Tarrant County Convention Center, as well as Lubbock, at the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum, but this proved a failure and the team returned full-time to Dallas in time for the 1971\u201372 season, splitting their games at Moody Coliseum and Dallas Convention Center Arena.\n1973\u20131976: Moving to San Antonio.\nWhile the Chaparrals had been modestly successful on the court, they were sinking financially by their third season. The financial difficulties were largely caused by the ownership group's refusal to invest much money on the team. After missing the playoffs for the first time in their existence in the 1972\u201373 season, nearly all of the owners wanted out. The team decided to sell the team to a different city, and the Chaparrals had to choose between San Antonio and El Paso. A group of 35 San Antonio businessmen\u2014led by Angelo Drossos, John Schaefer, and Red McCombs\u2014worked out a \"lend-lease\" deal with the Dallas ownership group. Drossos and his group would lease the team for three years with an option to purchase.\nAfter the deal was signed, the team was renamed the San Antonio Gunslingers; however, before they even played a game under that name, the team name was changed to the Spurs instead. It's debated whether the name related to a winning entry in a local \"Name That Team\" contest or if it related to one of the team owners being born in Spur, Texas. In any case, the team's primary colors were changed from the red, white, and blue of the Chaparrals to the now-familiar black, silver and white motif of the Spurs, with the branding taking effect for the 1973\u201374 season. In their first game at HemisFair Arena, the Spurs lost to the San Diego Conquistadors despite attracting a crowd of 6,000 fans. A smothering defense was the team's trademark, as they held opponents to less than 100 points in an ABA-record 49 games. The early Spurs were led by ABA veteran James Silas, and the team grew stronger by acquiring Swen Nater (who would go on to win the Rookie of the Year award) and George Gervin from the Virginia Squires in January. The ABA tried to halt the Gervin deal, claiming it was detrimental to the league; however, a judge ruled in the Spurs' favor and Gervin made his Spurs debut on February 7, 1974. The Spurs finished their inaugural season under that banner with a 45\u201339 record, good for third place in the Western Division. In the playoffs, the team was defeated by the Indiana Pacers in seven games in the first round. San Antonio embraced the Spurs with open arms; the Spurs drew 6,303 fans per game, surpassing the Chaparrals' entire total attendance in only 18 games. Drossos, Schaefer and McCombs knew a runaway hit when they saw it. After only one year, they exercised their option to tear up the lease agreement, buy the franchise outright and keep the team in San Antonio for good.\nThe team quickly made themselves at home at HemisFair Arena, playing to increasingly large and raucous crowds. Despite a respectable 17\u201310 start during the 1974\u201375 season, Coach Tom Nissalke was fired as the team's ownership become tired of the Spurs' slow playing style. He was replaced by Bob Bass, who said, \"It is my belief that you cannot throw a set offense at another professional team for 48 minutes. You've got to let them play some schoolyard basketball.\" Gervin and Silas took that style to heart, as the Spurs became an exciting fast-break team. The team finished the season with a 51\u201333 record and finished in second place in the West. In the playoffs, the Spurs fell to the Pacers in six games.\nEven though playoff success would elude the team before the merger, the Spurs had suddenly found themselves among the best teams in the ABA. Moreover, their gaudy attendance figures made them very attractive to the NBA, even though San Antonio, then as now, was a medium-sized market. Although San Antonio proper had over 650,000 people at the time (and has since grown to become the seventh-largest city in the United States), the surrounding suburban and rural areas have never been much larger than the city itself. In June 1976, the ABA\u2013NBA merger took place, moving San Antonio's sole professional sports franchise into a new league. The Spurs, the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers, and the New York Nets joined the NBA for the 1976\u201377 season. The Spurs and the other three ABA teams added in the merger agreed to pay the owners of two other strong ABA teams that folded instead of joining the NBA (a third ABA team, the Virginia Squires, had survived their final regular season of play, but folded operations a month before merger talks began). John Y. Brown, Jr., the owner of the Kentucky Colonels, received $3\u00a0million, which he used to purchase the NBA's Buffalo Braves and later the Boston Celtics, after selling star guard Louie Dampier to the Spurs. The owners of the Spirits of St. Louis received a portion of all television profits during their NBA tenure, which amounted to approximately one-seventh of the Spurs' television profit every year. This agreement placed particular financial pressure on the Spurs and the other three surviving former ABA teams. In 2014, 38 years after the completion of the merger, the Spirits' owners reached an agreement with the NBA to end the perpetual payments and take a lump sum of $500\u00a0million instead.\n1976\u20131985: The George Gervin era.\nAlthough there was some initial skepticism in league circles regarding the potential success and talent levels of the incoming ABA teams, the Spurs would prove worthy of NBA inclusion during the 1976\u201377 season with a record of 44\u201338, good for a tie for fourth place overall in the Eastern Conference. This was done in spite of significant handicaps the NBA imposed on the incoming ABA teams, limiting their draft picks and television revenues during their early time in the merged league. They gained a new rival in the form of the Houston Rockets, who had played in Texas for five years prior to the merger.\nDuring the 1977\u201378 season, Gervin battled David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets all year long for the NBA scoring title. On the final day of the season, Thompson took the lead by scoring 73 points in an afternoon game against the Detroit Pistons. That night Gervin knew that he needed 58 points against the Jazz in New Orleans. Gervin got off to a good start by scoring 20 points in the first quarter. In the second, Gervin set a single period record with 33 points. Early on in the third period, Gervin scored his 58 points on the way to 63 capturing the scoring title. While Gervin was lighting up the scoreboard the Spurs were winning the Central Division with a 52\u201330 record.\nHowever, in the playoffs, the Spurs would be stunned in six games by the Washington Bullets despite an outstanding series from Gervin who averaged 33.2 points per game. The following season in the 1979 Conference Finals the Spurs led the series 3\u20131 but the Bullets came back to win the last three games and came from behind to win the seventh game 107\u2013105 handing the Spurs a heartbreaking loss. The Spurs would have to wait another 20 years to make it to their first NBA Finals. The Spurs would go on to capture five division titles in their first seven years in the NBA and became a perennial playoff participant. However, in the playoffs, the Spurs could never catch a break, losing to teams like the Washington Bullets, the Boston Celtics, the Houston Rockets, and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAs the 1980s progressed, the Spurs would see their shares of highs and lows. For the first few seasons of the decade, the Spurs continued their success of the 1970s with records of 52\u201330 in 1980\u201381 (in that season, the Spurs were moved to the Midwest Division of the Western Conference), 48\u201334 in 1981\u201382, and 53\u201329 in 1982\u201383. Despite their regular-season success, the Spurs were unable to win any NBA championships, losing in the Western Conference playoffs to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the 1981 and the Los Angeles Lakers in four games in 1982 and in six games in the 1983 Western Finals despite getting both wins at the Forum in the 1983 series. They lost every home game in both series in 1982 and 1983 vs the Lakers as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and co. were too strong. The Spurs did not make the conference finals until 1995. After the 1984\u201385 season, Gervin, who had been the Spurs' biggest star, was traded to the Chicago Bulls in what effectively signaled the end of the era that began when the Spurs first moved to San Antonio.\n1985\u20131989: Difficult years.\nThe next four seasons were a dark time in Spurs' history with the team having a combined record of 115\u2013213 from 1985\u201386 until 1988\u201389. The losing seasons and dwindling attendance often caused the Spurs to be mentioned as a potential candidate for relocation to another city. The lone bright spot during this period was the Spurs being awarded the top pick in the 1987 NBA draft through NBA draft lottery. The Spurs used this selection on United States Naval Academy standout David Robinson. Although Robinson was drafted in 1987, the Spurs would have to wait until the 1989\u201390 season for Robinson to be a Spur because of his prior two-year commitment to serve in the United States Navy. The Spurs seemingly bottomed out in 1988\u201389 with a record of 21\u201361, the worst in franchise history at the time. However, the 1989\u201390 season was notable for several reasons. It was the first season of full ownership for Red McCombs, who was an original investor in the team and helped solidify local ownership for the team. Additionally, the 1988\u201389 season featured the debut of Larry Brown as the Spurs head coach who moved to San Antonio after winning the NCAA National Championship with Kansas in 1988.\n1989\u20131997: The David Robinson era.\nAlthough there was speculation that Robinson might choose not to sign with the Spurs and to become a free agent once his Navy service ended, Robinson decided in the end to come to San Antonio for the 1989\u201390 season. While it was thought that Robinson's arrival would make the Spurs respectable again, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Led by Robinson, 1989 draftee Sean Elliott from Arizona, and trade acquisition Terry Cummings from the Milwaukee Bucks, the Spurs achieved the biggest one-season turnaround in NBA history, finishing with a record of 56\u201326\u2013vaulting from the worst record in franchise history to the best in franchise history. They also jumped all the way to first place in the Midwest Division, their first division title in seven years. Robinson had one of the most successful rookie seasons for a center in NBA history, finishing the season as the unanimous Rookie of the Year while averaging 24.3 points and 12.0 rebounds.\nThe Spurs began the 1990s with great optimism. The team became a perennial playoff presence, although unable to advance further than the second round of the NBA playoffs under Brown's tutelage. Midway through the 1991\u201392 season, McCombs fired Brown and replaced him with Bob Bass for the remainder of the season. Without a healthy David Robinson, the Spurs were swept out of the first round of the playoffs by the Phoenix Suns. McCombs made national headlines during the summer of 1992 with the hiring of former UNLV head coach Jerry Tarkanian. The Tarkanian experiment proved a flop, as the coach was fired 20 games into the 1992\u201393 season with the Spurs record at 9\u201311. After Rex Hughes filled the coaching shoes for one game, NBA veteran John Lucas was named head coach. It was Lucas' first NBA coaching assignment, although he had gained recognition in league circles for his success in helping NBA players rehab from drug abuse. The Lucas era started out successfully. His coaching propelled the team to a 39\u201322 finish over the rest of the regular season, and the team reached the Western Conference semi-finals.\nIn 1993, local businessman Peter M. Holt and a group of 22 investors purchased the Spurs from Red McCombs for $75\u00a0million. In the 1993\u201394 season, the Spurs' first in the newly built Alamodome, Lucas led the team to a 55\u201327 record but the team suffered a loss in the first round of the playoffs, which led to the immediate firing of Lucas as head coach. Prior to the season, the Spurs traded fan-favorite Elliott to the Detroit Pistons in return for rebounding star Dennis Rodman. Elliott returned to the Spurs at the following year. Lucas was replaced by former Pacers coach Bob Hill for the 1994\u201395 season. On their first game of the season, they were defeated by the visiting Golden State Warriors despite a strong performance by David Robinson who recorded 27 points, 16 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 blocks for the Spurs. The next game, Sean Elliott recorded 23 points and David Robinson added 18 points and 19 rebounds as the Spurs got their first win of the season against the visiting New Jersey Nets.\nThe Spurs finished with the NBA's best record at 62\u201320, cracking the 60-win mark for the first time in franchise history. Robinson was named the league's Most Valuable Player. The Spurs reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual NBA Champion Houston Rockets. Throughout the season, and particularly in the playoffs, there appeared to be friction developing between Rodman and several Spurs' teammates, most notably Robinson. Rodman was traded to the Chicago Bulls after the season, and helped the Bulls win three titles from 1996 to 1998. Rodman was named All-NBA Third Team for the Spurs that season.\nThe Spurs finished the 1995\u201396 season under Hill at 59\u201323 and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals. Few observers could have predicted how far the Spurs would fall during the 1996\u201397 season, especially with the signing of Dominique Wilkins. Robinson missed the first month of the season due to a back injury. He returned in December, but played only six games before a broken foot sidelined him for the rest of the season. Elliott also missed more than half the season due to injury. Forward Chuck Person would miss the entire season with a back injury. Without Robinson and Elliott, the Spurs were a rudderless team. The lone bright spot was Wilkins, leading the team in scoring with an average of 18.2 points per game. The Spurs ended the season with a 20\u201362 record, the worst in franchise history\u2014and the last time they missed the playoffs until the 2019\u201320 season. Hill only lasted 18 games as coach that season, eventually being fired and replaced by general manager Gregg Popovich, who had also served a stint under Brown as an assistant coach. Wilkins would play his lone season in 1996\u201397 for San Antonio, knowing his minutes and playing time would greatly diminish next season. As disastrous as the 1996\u201397 season was for the Spurs, the off-season proved to be the opposite. With the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA draft lottery, which gave them the top pick in the 1997 draft. The Spurs used their pick to select Wake Forest product and consensus All-American Tim Duncan.\n1997\u20132016: The Tim Duncan era.\n1997\u20132003: The \"Twin Towers\".\nPaired together, the 7'1\" Robinson and the 6'11\" Duncan became known as the Twin Towers. The Twin Towers played together for the Spurs from 1997 to 2003. Both Robinson and Duncan were skilled offensive players, and the Twin Towers also anchored the Spurs' formidable defense. The duo helped lead the team to NBA championships in 1999 and 2003.\nDuncan quickly emerged as a dominant force in the NBA during the 1997\u201398 season, averaging 21.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per game as a power forward. He was named First Team All-NBA while winning Rookie of the Year honors. The team ended up at 56\u201326, breaking their own record from 1989 to 1990 for the biggest single-season improvement for wins, but once again lost to the Jazz in the Western Conference semi-finals. While both Duncan and Robinson played low-post roles, the two seamlessly meshed on the court. With a healthy Robinson and Duncan and the additions of playoff veterans such as Mario Elie and Jerome Kersey, the Spurs looked forward to the 1998\u201399 season. Prior to the beginning of training camps, the NBA owners, led by commissioner David Stern, locked out the players in order to force a new collective bargaining agreement with the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). The season was delayed for over three months until resolution on a new labor agreement was reached in January 1999.\nPlaying a shortened 50-game season, the Spurs won their first two games of the season, against the Kings and the Timberwolves respectively. However, the Spurs lost their next three games to the Lakers, Timberwolves, and Cavaliers, the latter a 99\u201389 road loss. The Spurs finished the regular season with an NBA-best 37\u201313 record (.740 win percentage), the only season during Duncan's tenure with the Spurs that the team did not win at least 50 games in a season (.610 win percentage in an 82-game season), a feat that extended through the 2016\u201317 season. The team was just as dominant in the playoffs, rolling through the Western Conference with a record of 11\u20131. In the NBA Finals, they faced the New York Knicks, who had made history by becoming the first eighth seed to ever make the NBA Finals. The Spurs won the series 4-1 and the franchise's first NBA Championship in Game 5 at the Knicks' home arena, Madison Square Garden. Duncan was named the NBA Finals MVP. The Spurs became the first former ABA team to reach and win the NBA Finals.\nComing off their first NBA Championship, the Spurs were among the best teams in the West and battling for first place in the Midwest Division during the 1999\u20132000 season. On March 14, the Spurs playoff spirits got a lift when Sean Elliott, who received a kidney transplant from his brother prior to the season, returned and played in the last 19 games. As the season wound down, Duncan suffered a knee injury and the Spurs finished in second place with a 53\u201329 record. Without Duncan, the Spurs were knocked out of the playoffs by the Phoenix Suns in four games. The long-term viability of the Spurs franchise in San Antonio was, however, achieved during the 1999\u20132000 season, as Bexar County voters approved increases in car rental and hotel taxes which would allow for the construction of a new arena next to the Freeman Coliseum. The Spurs finished with 58\u201324 records for both the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons but found themselves suffering playoff ousters in both seasons from the eventual NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers, getting swept from the 2001 Conference Finals and losing in five games during the second round in 2002.\nEntering the 2002\u201303 season, the team knew it would be memorable for at least two reasons, as David Robinson announced that it would be his last in the NBA and the Spurs would begin play at their new arena, the SBC Center, named after telecommunications giant SBC, whose corporate headquarters were located in San Antonio (SBC became AT&amp;T after its acquisition of its former parent company). To mark this occasion, the Spurs revamped their \"Fiesta Colors\" logo and reverted to the familiar silver and black motif (though, during the time of the Fiesta logo, the uniform remained silver and black).\nThis version of the Spurs was very different from the team that had won the title a few years earlier. Second-year French star Tony Parker, drafted by the Spurs in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft, was now the starting point guard for the Spurs. The squad featured a variety of newly acquired three-point shooters, including Stephen Jackson, Danny Ferry, Bruce Bowen, Steve Kerr, Steve Smith and Argentine product Manu Gin\u00f3bili, a 1999 second-round draft choice playing in his first NBA season.\nThe Spurs started the 2002\u201303 season with an 87\u201381 road win over the defending champions, the Los Angeles Lakers. The following game, the Spurs bowed down to the home team, the Golden State Warriors, 106\u201398. The Spurs christened the SBC Center in style on November 1, 2002, by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91\u201372. The next game, the Spurs were on the road to face the winless Memphis Grizzlies. In that game, the Spurs and the Grizzlies went to overtime. In the first minutes of the OT, the Grizzlies held a 7-point lead before Tim Duncan answered the run with a 9-point run by himself. With a tied score of 111\u2013111 with 0.8 seconds remaining, Duncan made a 12-foot jumpshot to defeat the Grizzlies. The following game, the Spurs were down by three points at halftime against the visiting Warriors, but then scored 31 points in the third quarter to put the game away, clinching their fourth win of the season. Tony Parker led the Spurs after scoring 21 points. Three days after, the Spurs were dealt by the visiting Trail Blazers their first home loss of the season. The Spurs would not get off to a flying start as they had just a 19\u201313 record heading into January. In January, the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16; however, it would be hardly a bump in the road for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for the best record in the NBA (60\u201322). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP. In the playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Suns, Lakers and Mavericks en route to facing the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals. The series against the Nets marked the first time two former ABA teams played each other for the NBA Championship. The Spurs won the series 4\u20132, giving them their second NBA Championship in franchise history. Duncan, after having been named NBA MVP, was also named Finals MVP.\n2003\u20132011: The \"Big Three\".\nComing off their second NBA Championship, the retirement of David Robinson left a void in San Antonio's daunting defense. Meanwhile, backup point guard Speedy Claxton left for the Golden State Warriors, and Stephen Jackson left for the Atlanta Hawks. With several holes to fill in their rotation, the Spurs would make several key signings in the off-season. Rasho Nesterovi\u0107 and Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu were brought in to replace Robinson and Jackson, respectively. What proved to be the most important off-season acquisition would be the signing of veteran Robert Horry.\nThe Spurs, playing with nine new players, struggled early as they missed the presence of Robinson while the new players struggled to fit in, as they held a 9\u201310 record on December 3. However, the Spurs would turn it around, as they ended December on a 13-game winning streak and quickly climbed back to the top of the NBA standings. They would battle all year for the top spot in the Western Conference, as they ended the season on another strong note winning their final 11 games. However, they would fall one game short of a division title and the best record in the West, posting a record of 57\u201325. In the second round of the playoffs, the Spurs found themselves in another showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs would win Games 1 and 2 at home, but drop the next two in Los Angeles. In Game 5 back in San Antonio, Duncan seemingly delivered the Spurs a 73\u201372 win as he hit a dramatic shot with just 0.4 seconds remaining. However, the Lakers' Derek Fisher would launch a game-winner as time expired, giving the Lakers a stunning 74\u201373 win to take a 3\u20132 series lead. Demoralized the Spurs would head back to Los Angeles where they would lose the series in six games.\nAfter their disappointing second-round collapse, the Spurs looked to regain the NBA crown. With the acquisition of guard Brent Barry from Seattle, the Spurs would get off to a quick start, posting a 12\u20133 record in November. The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25\u20136 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency, alongside regulars Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, Manu Gin\u00f3bili, and Tim Duncan, the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for the best record in the NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a bump in the road when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59\u201323. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return.\nIn the postseason, The Spurs went through the West relatively easily, culminating with a 5-game victory in the Conference Finals over the Phoenix Suns. In the NBA Finals, the Spurs would face the defending champion Detroit Pistons. The first two games in San Antonio were both Spurs' victories as Gin\u00f3bili led the way with 26 and 27 points respectively. However, as the series shifted to Detroit, the Spurs lost Games 3 and 4 by big margins as the Pistons tied the series. Faced with a third straight loss in Detroit, the Spurs would play tougher in Game 5, which would go into overtime. After going scoreless in the first half, Robert Horry hit a clutch three-point shot with nine seconds remaining to give the Spurs a dramatic 96\u201395 win.&lt;ref name=\"sports.yahoo.com/nba\"&gt;https:// , sports.yahoo.com, June 20, 2005, accessed May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The series moved back to San Antonio for game six, but the Spurs were unable to close out the series, setting up a deciding Game 7. In Game 7, Duncan had 25 points as the Spurs pulled away late to win their third NBA Title in seven years with an 81\u201374 win. Duncan was named Finals MVP, becoming the fourth player to win the MVP award three times (joining Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Michael Jordan).\nComing off their third NBA Championship in seven years, there was a sense that the Spurs were the class of the NBA, and once again would be the team to beat in the NBA for the Championship. For the 2005\u201306 season, the Spurs acquired the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel. Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise-best record of 63\u201319. The Spurs met the Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4\u20133, including a 119\u2013111 overtime victory in Game 7.\nThe Spurs struggled during the first half of the 2006\u201307 season, which led to discussions of trading away veteran players to build for the future. The team remained intact, and the Spurs would win 13 games in a row during February and March, and were an NBA-best 25\u20136 in the final 31 games, as the Spurs were able to claim the 3-seed in the West. The Spurs cruised through the first round, while the first-seeded Dallas Mavericks were upset. This set up a second-round series with the Phoenix Suns as the key series in the entire NBA playoffs, as this series featured the teams with the two best records remaining in the NBA.\nThe Spurs went on to win 4\u20132 in the contentious and controversial series versus the Suns. The series featured a Robert Horry foul on Steve Nash toward the end of Game 4 which resulted in Horry being suspended for two games. Those who said the second-round series against the Suns was the true NBA Finals would be proven right, as the Spurs easily dispatched the Utah Jazz in five games to reach the NBA Finals. In the Finals, the Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers and captured their fourth title in nine years. Tony Parker, who dominated in the Finals averaging 24.5 points per game on 57 percent shooting, was named Finals MVP and became the first European-born player to win the award.\nThe 2007\u20132008 season saw the Spurs go 56\u201326 and finish third in the Western Conference. The Spurs faced hurdles but would make it to the Western Conference Finals, but lose to the Lakers in five games. The next season would see the Spurs drop off in wins to 54\u201328 and lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. Two days before the 2009 NBA draft, general manager R. C. Buford acted to address the team's age and health concerns by acquiring 29-year-old swingman Richard Jefferson from the Milwaukee Bucks. The Spurs sent 38-year-old Bruce Bowen, 36-year-old Kurt Thomas, and 34-year-old Fabricio Oberto to the Bucks, who swapped Oberto to the Detroit Pistons for Amir Johnson. The Spurs held three picks in the second round in the 2009 draft. Their selection of Pittsburgh Panthers forward DeJuan Blair with the 37th pick was described as a \"steal\" by analysts; the Spurs later drafted two guards they had been targeting with the No. 37 pick, taking Miami Hurricanes shooting guard Jack McClinton and point/shooting guard Nando de Colo from France with the No. 51 and No. 53 picks, respectively. On July 10, 2009, the Spurs signed Detroit Pistons power forward Antonio McDyess to a three-year deal worth approximately $15\u00a0million in guaranteed money.\nThe Spurs struggled with injuries during the 2009\u201310 regular season, but managed another 50-win season, finishing at 50\u201332. The seventh-seeded Spurs would once again battle the Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. After falling to the Mavericks in Game 1, the Spurs went on to avenge their 2009 defeat to Dallas by winning the series in six games. The Spurs, however, were swept out of the playoffs in the following round by the Phoenix Suns. During the 2010 NBA draft, the Spurs management held the highest draft pick since the Tim Duncan draft a decade earlier. They drafted rookie James Anderson from Oklahoma State with the 20th overall pick. However, Anderson was soon sitting out of the first half of the season due to injuries. In 2010\u201311, the Spurs finished 61\u201321 to be the first seed, but an injury to Gin\u00f3bili in the final regular season game took a toll on the team, and they were upset by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.\n2011\u20132016: Arrival of Kawhi Leonard.\nIn 2011, a change to the Spurs' philosophy set the stage for the next successful run in the club's history. Out went the stream of last-legs, wizened veterans that the Spurs had relied on to fill out the rotation behind the Big Three. Minutes went to younger and more athletic talent like Danny Green, Gary Neal, and Tiago Splitter, to whom Popovich would teach The Spurs' Way \u2013 a fast pace, unselfish passing, and accountability on defense. The biggest personnel move of the Spurs' off-season had the team sending guard George Hill to his hometown Indiana Pacers for San Diego State's Kawhi Leonard, a hyper-athletic forward selected 15th overall by the Pacers in the 2011 NBA draft. The team also selected Texas Longhorns' Cory Joseph as the 29th overall pick.\nAfter the lockout that delayed the 2011\u201312 season, the Spurs signed T. J. Ford, who would eventually retire in the middle of the season after playing only 14 games due to a stinger. Before the trade deadline, the Spurs decided to part ways with Richard Jefferson and sent him to the Golden State Warriors for Stephen Jackson, who had been a member of the 2003 championship team. Leonard then became the starting small forward. In the week following the trade deadline, the Spurs also signed forward Boris Diaw after his contract was bought out by the Charlotte Bobcats, and former Portland Trail Blazers guard Patrick Mills who played for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in the CBA during the lockout. This gave the Spurs a deeper bench for their playoff run.\nDespite the shortened 66-game NBA season due to the NBA lockout, the Spurs won 50 games and tied the Chicago Bulls for the best record in the league. They extended their streak of 50+ win seasons to 13 since the 1999\u20132000 season, an NBA record. Popovich won his second Coach of the Year. The Spurs swept the first two rounds of the playoffs. With those two sweeps, a 10-game win streak to end the season, and wins in Games 1 and 2 of the Western Conference Finals, the Spurs won 20 straight games. However, the Oklahoma City Thunder ended up winning the next four games in the West Finals, to take the series 4\u20132. During the 2012 off-season, the Spurs re-signed swingman Danny Green, who was a welcome surprise for them from the previous season, and Tim Duncan, both for three years. The Spurs would have a strong 2012\u201313 season, going 58\u201324 and earning the second seed in the West.\nThe Spurs clinched the playoffs for a 16th consecutive season, as well as extended the NBA record with 50+ games for 14 consecutive seasons. On April 16, the Spurs signed two-time scoring champion, and seven-time All-Star Tracy McGrady to help in the playoffs after waiving Stephen Jackson. The Spurs finished the regular season second in the Western Conference behind the Oklahoma City Thunder with a record of 58\u201324, and swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, 4\u20130. In the second round of the 2013 playoffs, the Spurs faced Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors. They beat the Warriors four games to two. In the conference finals, the Spurs swept the Memphis Grizzlies, with Tony Parker having an 18-assist performance in Game 2 and a 37-point performance in Game 4. The Spurs would meet the defending champion Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\nThe Spurs and Heat would alternate wins the first six games in the series. In Game 6, the Spurs were on the verge of winning their fifth NBA title. San Antonio was up five points with 28 seconds to go in regulation. An unlikely and uncharacteristic series of mishaps would doom the Spurs down the stretch, including the benching of Duncan by Popovich at the end of regulation with the Spurs on defense. The Heat missed their field goal attempt, but the undersized Spurs could not grab the defensive rebound. Chris Bosh rebounded the ball and Ray Allen hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with five seconds left in regulation to send it to overtime, during which the Spurs were defeated 103\u2013100. In Game 7, San Antonio jumped out to a lead early and kept the game close the entire way. Toward the end of the game, however, and despite a 24-point, 12 rebound effort, Duncan failed to convert on two attempts to tie the game: a missed layup and missed tip-in that allowed LeBron James to hit a jumper and increase the Heat's lead to 92\u201388. After a steal from Gin\u00f3bili, James hit two free throws after being fouled by Duncan, and when Gin\u00f3bili missed a subsequent 3-pointer, Dwyane Wade hit one out of two from the free-throw line to put the game on ice, as the Heat would win their second straight championship.\nThe Spurs returned with their core roster largely intact, adding free agents Marco Belinelli and Jeff Ayres (formerly Jeff Pendergraph) while losing Gary Neal to the Milwaukee Bucks. The Spurs clinched the best record in the NBA with 62 wins, which included a franchise-record 19 straight wins in February and March. In the first round of the playoffs, the eighth-seeded Dallas Mavericks surprised the Spurs by taking the series to seven games, but the Spurs prevailed in convincing fashion in the deciding Game 7. In the second round, Tim Duncan surpassed Karl Malone for fifth place in NBA playoffs all-time points scored while the Spurs cruised past the Portland Trail Blazers in five games. San Antonio played the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals, which marked the third straight appearance in the Western Conference Finals for the Spurs, and defeated them in six games to advance to the Finals for a second straight year for a rematch with the Miami Heat. It was also the first time that they had advanced to the Finals in consecutive years. This made it the first time since the 1998 NBA Finals that the same two teams faced off in the Finals in consecutive years. With a victory in the second game of the series, Duncan, Gin\u00f3bili, and Parker won more playoff games together than any other three players on the same team in NBA history. The Spurs would go on to win the 2014 NBA championship in five games (4\u20131). The Spurs blew out Miami in all of their wins, each of them by 15 or more points. Kawhi Leonard had a breakout performance and was named NBA Finals MVP for his big game performance and is the third-youngest to win it, behind Magic Johnson and teammate Duncan. In the 2014 NBA draft, they selected Kyle Anderson out of UCLA as the 30th overall pick.\nDuring the 2014 off-season, the Spurs made headlines when they announced that they had hired Becky Hammon as an assistant coach, effective with her retirement as a player at the end of the 2014 WNBA season. Hammon became the first full-time female coach in any of the four major U.S. professional leagues. The 2014\u201315 season was an up-and-down season, but finishing strong with a 55\u201327 regular-season record and sixth seed in the West, they qualified for the playoffs. They faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. The Spurs went up 3\u20132 heading into Game 6 at San Antonio. However, the Clippers would win that game and go on to win Game 7 at home. The San Antonio Spurs became the first defending champions since the 2011\u201312 Dallas Mavericks to be eliminated in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\nThe Spurs acquired four-time All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldridge and veteran big man David West during the off-season. On their first game of the season, the Spurs were defeated by the home team, Oklahoma City Thunder, despite a 32 point-performance from Kawhi Leonard Two days after, Duncan and Leonard led the Spurs towards a 102\u201375 win over the visiting Brooklyn Nets. On November 2, the Spurs defeated the home team, the Boston Celtics, thanks to a double-double performance of LaMarcus Aldridge who recorded 24 points and 14 rebounds. On November 4, the Spurs defeated the home team, the New York Knicks, 94\u201384, to win their third game of the season, and more importantly, Tim Duncan clinched his 954th career win passing John Stockton (953 wins) for most wins by a player for a single franchise. The Spurs finished the 2015\u201316 season with a 67\u201315 record, earning them the Southwest Division title. They also set a franchise record for most wins in a season with 67 and an NBA record for most home wins in a season with 40 (tying the 1985\u201386 Boston Celtics 40\u20131 home record). The Spurs also had the league's best defense. During the playoffs, they swept the shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies in the first round before losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games in the second round. They would become the first team since the 2006\u201307 Dallas Mavericks to finish with 67 wins and be eliminated before the conference finals. On July 11, 2016, Duncan announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with the Spurs. He became one of two players in NBA history to record at least 26,000 points, 15,000 rebounds and 3,000 blocks in his career (along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) while also being the only NBA player to reach 1,000 wins with a single team.\n2016\u20132023: Post-Duncan era.\n2016\u20132018: Leonard and Aldridge.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, despite the retirement of longtime captain Tim Duncan, the Spurs\u2014led by Kawhi Leonard\u2014remained a title contender and finished with a record of 61\u201321. After defeating the Grizzlies and the Rockets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Spurs\u2014who suffered injuries to Leonard, Parker, and David Lee\u2014were swept by the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. In the third quarter of Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals, Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia's foot after attempting a field goal and re-aggravated an existing ankle injury; he sat out the remainder of the series. During the 2017 season, the San Antonio Spurs joined into a partnership with Methodist Healthcare System and Sports Medicine Associates of San Antonio (SMASA). In the following off-season, the Spurs re-signed Aldridge, Pau Gasol and Patty Mills and signed Rudy Gay, but lost Dewayne Dedmon and Jonathon Simmons to free agency.\nThe Spurs' 2017\u201318 season was overshadowed by an injury to star Kawhi Leonard and reports of ensuing disputes between Leonard and the Spurs regarding the handling of that injury. Leonard missed the first 27 games of the 2017\u201318 season with a right quadriceps injury. In January 2018, after a brief comeback, he was ruled out for an indefinite period of time to continue his rehabilitation process from right quadriceps tendinopathy. Leonard was subsequently cleared to play by the Spurs medical staff, but he solicited a second opinion from his own doctors. In March, the Spurs held a players-only meeting in which Leonard's teammates reportedly asked him to return to the court; the meeting was described as \"tense and emotional\". Leonard did not play again in 2018. On April 3, 2018, the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Spurs 113\u2013110, handing San Antonio its 33rd loss of the season. This loss ended the Spurs' record streak of eighteen 50-win seasons that had stretched back to 2000, including the 2011\u201312 season, which was shortened by a lockout (the Spurs finished 50\u201316). The Spurs eventually finished the season with a record of 47\u201335 and were defeated 4\u20131 by the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. Following the season, LaMarcus Aldridge was named to the All-NBA Second Team and point guard Dejounte Murray was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.\nIn June 2018, following months of reports of growing tension between Leonard's camp and the Spurs stemming from a disagreement over his injury rehabilitation process, reports indicated that Leonard had requested a trade. On July 18, 2018, Leonard and Danny Green were traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob P\u00f6ltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick. On July 6, 2018, Tony Parker signed with the Charlotte Hornets after having played his entire 17-year career with the Spurs. On August 27, Manu Gin\u00f3bili announced his retirement after a 16-year career with the Spurs. The Spurs signed forwards Dante Cunningham and Quincy Pondexter, guard Marco Belinelli, and re-signed guard Bryn Forbes, and forward Rudy Gay.\nIn 2018, the Spurs began training camp without a member of the Big Three for the first time since the 1997\u201398 season. Despite losing Dejounte Murray for the season to an ACL tear, the Spurs finished the 2018\u201319 season with a 48\u201334 record and the seventh seed in the Western Conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the 22nd consecutive playoff season. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the second-seeded Denver Nuggets, and lost the series in seven games.\n2019\u20132023: Difficult years.\nOn March 11, 2020, the NBA suspended the 2019\u201320 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. On June 4, it was announced that the season would restart on July 31 for the Spurs and 21 other teams in the NBA Bubble, and would finish no later than October 12. For the first time since the 1996\u201397 season, the Spurs failed to qualify for the postseason when the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Milwaukee Bucks on August 13, 2020. The Spurs' failure to make the postseason ended an NBA record-tying streak of 22 consecutive playoff appearances. The Spurs finished the COVID-shortened season with a record of 32\u201339. The 2019\u20132020 season was also the first season since 1996\u20131997 in which the Spurs finished with a losing record.\nBecause of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020-2021 NBA regular season was shortened to 72 games and began on December 22, 2020. The season began only 72 days after the 2020 NBA Finals ended, making the 2020 offseason the shortest offseason in league history. At one point, the 2020\u20132021 Spurs held a record of 22\u201316; however, the team faltered down the stretch, and finished the season with a 33\u201339 record. Thirty-five-year-old star LaMarcus Aldridge left the team midway through the season, agreeing to a contract buyout. The Spurs were hurt by poor three-point shooting and by injuries to starting guard Derrick White; however, Keldon Johnson and other young players made positive strides over the course of the season. DeMar DeRozan led the team in scoring, averaging 21.6 points per game.\nAt the conclusion of the 2020\u20132021 season, the NBA held a play-in tournament. As the tenth seed in the Western Conference, the Spurs participated in the tournament. The team was defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies, 100\u201396. The loss marked the first time in Spurs history that the team missed the playoffs in two consecutive seasons. Following the 2020\u20132021 season, DeRozan was traded to the Chicago Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal for Thaddeus Young, Al-Farouq Aminu, a protected first-round draft pick, and the Bulls\u2019 2022 and 2025 second-round picks. In addition, longtime Spur Patty Mills left the team in free agency, and the Spurs signed sharpshooter Doug McDermott.\nThe Spurs picked up Joshua Primo in the NBA Draft at number 12. At the trade deadline, Derrick White was dealt to the Celtics as part of a three team trade. Dejounte Murray had a breakout year, representing the Spurs at the All-Star Game, the first Spur to do so since Lamarcus Aldridge in 2019. The Spurs finished 34-48 and would make the play-in but fail to advance to the playoffs.\nThe 2022\u201323 season was San Antonio's worst since the 1996\u201397 season. During the off-season, Dejounte Murray and Jock Landale were traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Danilo Gallinari and future draft picks. The Spurs picked Jeremy Sochan, Malaki Branham and Blake Wesley in the first round of the draft, going 9th, 20th and 25th respectively. On January 13, 2023, the Spurs set a regular season single-game attendance record with 68,323 spectators at the Alamodome in a game against the Golden State Warriors. San Antonio finished the season 22\u201360 at the bottom of the West.\n2023\u2013present: The Victor Wembanyama era.\n2023\u20132024: Wemby's arrival and historic rookie year.\nOn May 16, 2023, the Spurs won the draft lottery, allowing them to receive the first pick in the 2023 NBA draft. This marked their third time selecting first overall, having previously chosen David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. The Spurs used their number one pick to select Victor Wembanyama, who had long been expected to be drafted first overall. The team ended up at the 14th spot in the western conference and Wembanyama was unanimously elected Rookie of the Year. Wembanyama also came second in Defensive Player of the Year voting as well as setting many more rookie records.\n2024\u20132025.\nDuring the following off-season, the Spurs signed veterans Chris Paul and Harrison Barnes. They also drafted Stephon Castle and Rob Dillingham, although Dillingham was later traded away to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Near the start of the season, Gregg Popovich was announced indefinitely out for the season due to health issues and was replaced by Mitch Johnson. A few days before the trade deadline, the Spurs acquired All-Star point guard De'Aaron Fox as part of a three-team deal with the Chicago Bulls and the Sacramento Kings. After 46 games, Wembanyama was announced to miss the rest of the season due to blood clots. Following the season, Castle was named Rookie of the Year. On May 2, 2025, Popovich announced that he would step down as the head coach but remain president of basketball operations. Mitch Johnson was named the team's permanent head coach.\nRivalries.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nFrom 1999 to 2004, the rivalry between the Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers was considered the NBA's best. The two teams met in the playoffs five times in six seasons, and one of the two teams advanced to the NBA Finals every year from 1999 to 2005.\nDallas Mavericks.\nThe rivalry between the San Antonio Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks features two teams with Dallas roots. The Mavericks were swept in the 2012\u201313 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1998 season, Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last matchup of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 95\u201394 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With that win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for a 16th straight season. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for a 14th consecutive season, the longest streak in NBA history.\nPhoenix Suns.\nSince 1992, the Spurs and the Phoenix Suns have met 10 times in the playoffs, in which the Spurs have won six series and the Suns have won four. Some of the most notable moments of their rivalry include Charles Barkley's game-winning jump shot in the 1993 playoffs in the final game at the HemisFair Arena, Stephon Marbury's buzzer-beating three-pointer in Game 1 of the first round of the 2003 playoffs, Robert Horry's hip check on Steve Nash in Game 4 of the 2007 playoffs, Tim Duncan's game-tying three-pointer in Game 1 of the 2008 first round, and Goran Dragi\u0107's 23-point outburst in the fourth quarter of Game 3 in the West semifinals of the 2010 playoffs.\nHouston Rockets.\nThe rivalry between the Spurs and the Houston Rockets was renewed in the 2017 playoffs, in which the two teams met in the Western Conference Semifinals. The match-up was the first between the two teams in the playoffs since the 1995 Western Conference Finals. In Game Two of the series, starting point guard Tony Parker suffered a ruptured quadriceps tendon, forcing him to miss the remainder of the playoffs. In Game Five, all-star small forward Kawhi Leonard suffered an injury to his right ankle in the third quarter, resulting in him sitting out for the closing portions of the game. Despite the injury issues, the Spurs were able to send Game Five to overtime. In the overtime period, Manu Gin\u00f3bili blocked James Harden's three-point attempt in the final seconds to secure the 110\u2013107 victory for the Spurs. The Spurs would close out the series in a Game Six with a 114\u201375 win.\nLogo and uniforms.\nSince becoming the San Antonio Spurs in 1973, the team colors have been black, silver and white. The distinctive logo of the word Spurs in Eurostile font, with the stylized spur substituting for the letter U, has been a part of the team's identity since their move to San Antonio. The logo incorporated 'Fiesta colors' of pink, orange and turquoise, used from 1989 to 2002 (though the uniforms remained the same), and alignment from straight to arched beginning with the 2002\u201303 NBA season.\nThe Spurs have always worn black on the road and white at home, except during the 1973\u201376 ABA seasons and their first NBA season when the home uniform was always silver. Until the 1988\u201389 NBA season, the road uniform had \"San Antonio\" on the front while the home uniform featured the team nickname adopted from the Spurs logo; from 1973 to 1982, the road uniform lettering was black with silver trim. In addition, from 1977 to 1981 a saddle-like striping was featured on the back of the home shorts. Since the 1989\u201390 NBA season the Spurs uniform has remained practically the same, with the road uniform now using the team nickname from their logo; a minor change included the addition of another black (road) and white (home) trim to the already silver-trimmed block numbers in the 2002\u201303 season. In 2003\u201304 and later in 2006\u201307, they wore silver throwback jerseys to honor their late 1970s team. The Spurs wear black sneakers and socks on the road, and white sneakers and socks at home (except for select games with the silver alternates), a practice that began in the 2002\u201303 season. When the NBA moved to the Adidas \"Revolution 30\" technology for the 2010\u201311 season, the Spurs changed to V-neck jerseys and eliminated striping on the shorts' beltline.\nOn September 19, 2012, the Spurs unveiled a silver alternate uniform. In breaking from the traditional practice of placing the team or city name in front, the Spurs' new uniform features only the stylized spur logo, with the black number trimmed in white and silver on the upper right. The Spurs primary logo is atop the player name and number on the back (replaced by the NBA logo prior to the 2014\u201315 season), while the Eurostile 'SA' initials (for San Antonio) are on the left leg of the shorts. They also wore ABA throwbacks of Chaparrals team. Black, silver and white side stripes are also featured on the uniform. The uniforms are worn for select home games. A variation of this uniform, featuring military camouflage patterns instead of the usual silver, was used for two games in the 2013\u201314 season; a sleeved version was used the next season. Another variation, this time in black, was unveiled for the 2015\u201316 season.\nAt times throughout the season, the Spurs wear a jersey that says \"Los Spurs\" on the front, in recognition of Latino fans both at home and across the US and Latin America. The Spurs (located in a city with a large Hispanic population) were one of the first NBA teams to wear these branded jerseys. In 2014, the jerseys were sleeved. These events are called \"Noches Latinas\", first launched during the 2006\u201307 NBA season, part of a Hispanic marketing campaign known as \"\u00e9ne-b\u00e9-a\". Six teams in the NBA participate in these events. The Spurs have had the most players from Latin America and are one of only three NBA teams who have had at least five players on their rosters who originate from Latin America and Spain (if one includes Puerto Rico as part of Latin America, although it is a U.S. territory), the others being the Memphis Grizzlies and the Portland Trail Blazers.\nThe switch to Nike as the uniform provider in 2017 eliminated the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. The Spurs' black \"Icon\", silver \"Statement\" and white \"Association\" uniform remained identical to the previous set save for the manufacturer's logo and switch from Eurostile to custom block lettering on the team name. They also continued to wear their camouflage-style uniforms as part of the \"City\" edition. However, the Spurs retired their camouflage-style \"City\" uniforms prior to the 2020\u201321 season in favor of a design influenced by the team's 1989\u20132002 \"Fiesta\" era. This design was brought back in the 2025\u201326 season after the NBA chose to revisit past \"City\" uniform designs for that season. The Spurs reprised the \"Fiesta\" theme for the 2021\u201322 season, but mixed in a few elements from previous uniforms. The shorts featured turquoise diamonds in homage to the George Gervin-era uniforms, and the logo on the left leg honored the Dallas Chaparrals. In 2022, the Spurs replaced their silver \"Statement\" uniforms with a black one, but with silver letters, a new \"SATX\" wordmark, a new \"Texas spur\" alternate logo, and grayscale patterns inspired from traditional serapes and saddle blankets. Also during the season, the Spurs wore a turquoise \"City\" uniform with elements based on the uniforms worn in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game. The \"City\" uniform in the 2023\u201324 season paid homage to Hemisfair '68, featuring a white base, tan and orange stripes. Also featured is a psychedelic-style \"San Antonio\" wordmark in brown along with neon light-inspired numbers in sand, white and brown accents. The Hemisfair-themed design, albeit in light blue, was reused for the 2024\u201325 \"City\" uniform.\nIn the 2025\u201326 season, the Spurs released a new \"Statement\" uniform, returning to a silver base but with a block \"San Antonio\" on the chest. This marked the first time since the 1988\u201389 season that the city name was featured on a core Spurs uniform.\nMascot.\nThe Coyote has been the Spurs' mascot since 1983. Created by and portrayed for 21 years by Tim Derk, Coyote is known for his slapstick humor, rehearsed skits and previous dance numbers with Spurs' cheerleaders, the \"Silver Dancers\", who were replaced in 2018 after 26 years. The Coyote was a 2007 inductee into the Mascot Hall of Fame and has been featured in local and national media.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Spurs.

The typical pattern is to allow the player to develop in leagues outside the United States. The player is free to negotiate contracts in other leagues and is not obligated to play in the NBA. Sometimes, a player's overseas contract may have an expensive buyout clause that would discourage the Spurs from seeking to bring him in. The Spurs have had past success in finding foreign talent; some examples of this success include the selections of second-rounder Manu Gin\u00f3bili (57th overall in 1999) and first-rounder Tony Parker (28th overall in 2001), who both went on to become All-Stars.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFIBA Hall of Famers.\nNotes:\nFranchise leaders.\nBold denotes still active with the team. \"Italics\" denotes still active, but not with the team. \"Name*\" includes combined statistics for the team from both the ABA and NBA.\nPoints scored (regular season) as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther statistics (regular season) as of the end of the 2024\u201325 season\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndividual awards.\nNBA individual awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNBA Most Valuable Player\nNBA Finals MVP\nNBA Rookie of the Year\nNBA Defensive Player of the Year\nNBA Sixth Man of the Year\nNBA Most Improved Player Award\nNBA Coach of the Year\nNBA Executive of the Year\nNBA Sportsmanship Award\nJ.
