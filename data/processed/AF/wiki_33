Before his reign, he spent 23 years in exile from France beginning in 1791, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire.\nUntil his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI, the last king of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence claimed the throne as Louis XVIII.\nFollowing the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, Great Britain, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition first defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored the Napoleonic Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne.\nLouis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. His Bourbon Restoration government was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the absolutist \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" in France before the Revolution. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. His return in 1815 led to a second wave of White Terror headed by the Ultra-royalist faction. The following year, Louis dissolved the unpopular parliament (the \"Chambre introuvable\"), giving rise to the liberal Doctrinaires. His reign was further marked by the formation of the Quintuple Alliance and a military intervention in Spain. Louis had no children, and upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last king or emperor of France to die a reigning monarch: his successor, Charles X (r. 1824\u20131830) abdicated; and both Louis Philippe I (r. 1830\u20131848) and Napoleon III (r. 1852\u20131870) were deposed.\nYouth.\nLouis Stanislas Xavier, styled Count of Provence from birth, was born on 17 November 1755 in the Palace of Versailles, a younger son of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France, and his wife Maria Josepha of Saxony. He was the grandson of the reigning King Louis XV. As a son of the Dauphin, he was a \"Fils de France\". He was christened Louis Stanislas Xavier six months after his birth, in accordance with Bourbon family tradition, being nameless before his baptism. By this act, he also became a Knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit.\nThe name of \"Louis\" was bestowed because it was typical of a prince of France; Stanislas was chosen to honour his great-grandfather King Stanislaus I of Poland who was still alive at the time; and Xavier was chosen for Saint Francis Xavier, whom his mother's family held as one of their patron saints.\nAt the time of his birth, Louis Stanislas was fourth in line to the throne of France, behind his father and his two elder brothers: the Duke of Burgundy, and the Duke of Berry. The former died in 1761, leaving Louis Auguste as heir to their father until the Dauphin's own premature death in 1765. The two deaths elevated Louis Stanislas to second in the line of succession, while his brother Louis Auguste acquired the title of Dauphin.\nLouis Stanislas found comfort in his governess, Madame de Marsan, Governess of the Children of France, as he was her favourite among his siblings. Louis Stanislas was taken away from his governess when he turned seven, the age at which the education of boys of royal blood and of the nobility was turned over to men. Antoine de Qu\u00e9len de Stuer de Caussade, Duke of La Vauguyon, a friend of his father, was named as his governor.\nLouis Stanislas was an intelligent boy, excelling in the classics. His education was of the same quality and consistency as that of his older brother, Louis Auguste, despite the fact that Louis Auguste was heir and Louis Stanislas was not. Louis Stanislas's education was quite religious in nature; several of his teachers were priests, such as Jean-Gilles du Co\u00ebtlosquet, Bishop of Limoges; the Abb\u00e9 Jean-Antoine Nollet; and the Jesuit Guillaume-Fran\u00e7ois Berthier. La Vauguyon drilled into young Louis Stanislas and his brothers the way he thought princes should \"know how to withdraw themselves, to like to work,\" and \"to know how to reason correctly\".\nIn April 1771, when he was 15, Louis Stanislas's education was formally concluded, and his own independent household was established, which astounded contemporaries with its extravagance: in 1773, the number of his servants reached 390 In the same month his household was founded, Louis was granted several titles by his grandfather, Louis XV: Duke of Anjou, Count of Maine, Count of Perche, and Count of Senoches. During this period of his life he was often known by the title Count of Provence.\nOn 17 December 1773, he was inaugurated as a Grand Master of the Order of St. Lazarus.\nMarriage.\nOn 16 April 1771, Louis Stanislas was married by proxy to Princess Maria Giuseppina of Savoy. The in-person ceremony was conducted on 14 May at the Palace of Versailles. Marie Jos\u00e9phine (as she was known in France) was a daughter of Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy (later King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia), and his wife Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain.\nA luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and ignorant of the customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At the time of his marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.\nDespite the fact that Louis Stanislas was not infatuated with his wife, he boasted that the two enjoyed vigorous conjugal relations\u00a0\u2013 but such declarations were held in low esteem by courtiers at Versailles. He also proclaimed his wife to be pregnant merely to spite Louis Auguste and his wife Marie Antoinette, who had not yet consummated their marriage. The Dauphin and Louis Stanislas did not enjoy a harmonious relationship and often quarrelled, as did their wives. Louis Stanislas did impregnate his wife in 1774, having conquered his aversion. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. A second pregnancy in 1781 also miscarried, and the marriage remained childless.\nAt his brother's court.\nOn 27 April 1774, Louis XV fell ill after contracting smallpox and died a few days later on 10 May, aged 64. Louis Stanislas' elder brother, the Dauphin Louis Auguste, succeeded their grandfather as King Louis XVI. As eldest brother of the King, Louis Stanislas received the title Monsieur. Louis Stanislas longed for political influence. He attempted to gain admittance to the King's council in 1774, but failed. Louis Stanislas was left in a political limbo that he called \"a gap of 12 years in my political life\". Louis XVI granted Louis Stanislas revenues from the Duchy of Alen\u00e7on in December 1774. The duchy was given to enhance Louis Stanislas's prestige. However, the appanage generated only 300,000 livres a year, an amount much lower than it had been at its peak in the fourteenth century.\nLouis Stanislas travelled about France more than other members of the Royal Family, who rarely left the \u00cele-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chamb\u00e9ry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Victoire while they were taking the waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.\nOn 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, confirmed her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was named Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. That the baby was a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette gave birth to the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the Queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.\nIn 1780, Anne Nompar de Caumont, Countess of Balbi, entered the service of Marie Jos\u00e9phine. Louis Stanislas soon fell in love with his wife's new lady-in-waiting and installed her as his mistress, which resulted in the couple's already limited affection for each other cooling entirely. Louis Stanislas commissioned a pavilion for his mistress on a parcel of land at Versailles which became known as the \"Parc Balbi\".\nLouis Stanislas lived a quiet and sedentary lifestyle at this point, not having a great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10\u00a0million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.\nAn Assembly of Notables (the members consisted of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 to ratify the financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, his long-awaiting opportunity to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies which would have a say in local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, \u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.\nBrienne's reforms were then submitted to the \"Parlement\" of Paris in the hopes that they would be approved. (A \"parlement\" was responsible for ratifying the King's edicts; each province had its own \"parlement\", but the \"Parlement\" of Paris was the most significant of all.) The \"Parlement\" of Paris refused to accept Brienne's proposals and declared that any new taxation would have to be approved by an Estates-General (the nominal parliament of France). Louis XVI and Brienne took a hostile stance against this rejection, and Louis XVI had to implement a \"bed of justice\" (\"Lit de justice\"), which automatically registered an edict in the \"Parlement\" of Paris, to ratify the desired reforms. On 8 May, two of the leading members of the \"Parlement\" of Paris were arrested. There was rioting in Brittany, Provence, Burgundy and B\u00e9arn in reaction to their arrest. This unrest was engineered by local magistrates and nobles, who enticed the people to revolt against the \"Lit de Justice\", which was quite unfavourable to the nobles and magistrates. The clergy also joined the provincial cause, and condemned Brienne's tax reforms. Brienne conceded defeat in July and agreed to a convocation of the Estates-General to meet in 1789. He resigned from his post in August and was replaced by the Swiss magnate Jacques Necker.\nIn November 1788, a second Assembly of Notables was convened by Jacques Necker, to consider the makeup of the next Estates-General. The \"Parlement of Paris\" recommended that the Estates should be the same as they were at the last assembly, in 1614 (this would mean that the clergy and nobility would have more representation than the Third Estate). The notables rejected the \"dual representation\" proposal. Louis Stanislas was the only notable to vote to increase the size of the Third Estate. Necker disregarded the notables' judgment, and convinced Louis XVI to grant the extra representation. The king duly obliged on 27 December.\nOutbreak of the French Revolution.\nThe Estates-General were convened in May 1789 to ratify financial reforms. The Count of Provence favoured a stalwart position against the Third Estate and its demands for tax reform. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly, an Assembly not of the Estates, but of the people.\nThe Count of Provence urged the King to act strongly against the declaration, while the King's popular minister Jacques Necker aimed at reaching a compromise with the new assembly. Louis XVI was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a National Constituent Assembly that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, Louis XVI dismissed Necker, which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the \"R\u00e9giment Royal\u2013Allemand Cavalerie\" \"(Royal German Cavalry Regiment)\" of Charles-Eug\u00e8ne de Lorraine, Prince de Lambesc, against a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, sparked the Storming of the Bastille two days later.\nOn 16 July, the King's brother, Charles, Comte d'Artois, left France with his wife and children, along with many other courtiers. Artois and his family took up residence in Turin, the capital city of his father-in-law's (Carlo Emanuele IV) Kingdom of Sardinia, with the family of Louis Joseph, \"Prince de Cond\u00e9\".\nThe Count of Provence decided to remain at Versailles. When the Royal Family plotted to abscond from Versailles to Metz, Provence advised the King not to leave, a suggestion he accepted.\nThe Royal Family was forced to leave the palace at Versailles on the day after the Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789. They were taken to Paris. There, the Count of Provence and his wife lodged in the Luxembourg Palace, while the rest of the Royal Family stayed in the Tuileries Palace. In March 1791, the National Assembly created a law outlining the regency of Louis Charles in case his father died while he was still too young to reign. This law awarded the regency to Louis Charles' nearest male relative in France (at that time the Count of Provence), and after him, the Duke of Orleans, thus bypassing the Count of Artois. If Orleans were unavailable, the regency would be submitted to election.\nThe Count of Provence and his wife fled to the Austrian Netherlands in conjunction with the royal family's failed Flight to Varennes in June 1791.\nExile.\nEarly years.\nWhen the Count of Provence arrived in the Low Countries, he proclaimed himself regent of France. He exploited a document that he and Louis XVI had written before the latter's failed escape to Varennes-en-Argonne. The document gave him the regency in the event of his brother's death or inability to perform his role as king. He would join the other princes-in-exile at Coblenz soon after his escape. It was there that he, the Count of Artois, and the Cond\u00e9 princes proclaimed that their objective was to invade France. Louis XVI was greatly annoyed by his brothers' behaviour. Provence sent emissaries to various European courts asking for financial aid, soldiers, and munition. Artois secured a castle for the court in exile in the Electorate of Trier (or \"Treves\"), where their maternal uncle, Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, was the Archbishop-Elector. The activities of the \"\u00e9migr\u00e9s\" bore fruit when the rulers of Prussia and the Holy Roman Empire gathered at Dresden. They released the Declaration of Pillnitz in August 1791, which urged Europe to intervene in France if Louis XVI or his family were threatened. Provence's endorsement of the declaration was not well received in France, either by the ordinary citizens or by Louis XVI himself.\nIn January 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared that all of the were traitors to France. Their property and titles were confiscated. The monarchy of France was abolished by the National Convention on 21 September 1792.\nLouis XVI was executed in January 1793. This left his young son, Louis Charles, as the titular King. The princes-in-exile proclaimed Louis Charles \"King Louis XVII\". The Count of Provence now unilaterally declared himself regent for his nephew, who was too young to be head of the House of Bourbon.\nLouis XVII, still a minor, died in prison in June 1795. His only surviving sibling was his sister Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who was not considered a candidate for the throne because of France's traditional adherence to Salic law. Thus on 16 June, the princes-in-exile declared the Count of Provence \"King Louis XVIII\". The new king accepted their declaration soon after and busied himself drafting a manifesto in response to Louis XVII's death. The manifesto, known as the \"Declaration of Verona\", was Louis XVIII's attempt to introduce the French people to his politics. The Declaration of Verona beckoned France back into the arms of the monarchy, \"which for fourteen centuries was the glory of France\".\nLouis XVIII negotiated the release of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se from her Paris prison in 1795. He desperately wanted her to marry her first cousin, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame, the son of the Count of Artois. Louis XVIII deceived his niece by telling her that her parents' last wishes were for her to marry Louis-Antoine, and she duly agreed to Louis XVIII's wishes.\nLouis XVIII was forced to abandon Verona when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Republic of Venice in 1796.\n1796\u20131807.\nLouis XVIII had been vying for the custody of his niece Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se since her release from the Temple Tower in December 1795. He succeeded when Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to relinquish his custody of her in 1796. She had been staying in Vienna with her Habsburg relatives since January 1796. Louis XVIII moved to Blankenburg in the Duchy of Brunswick after his departure from Verona. He lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment over a shop. Louis XVIII was forced to leave Blankenburg when King Frederick William II of Prussia died. In light of this, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se decided to wait a while longer before reuniting with her uncle.\nIn 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis the use of Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). The Tsar also guaranteed Louis' safety and bestowed on him a generous pension, though later discontinued payment. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798\u20131799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled . Moreover, being surrounded at Jelgava with many old courtiers, he attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles, re-establishing various of the former court ceremonies, including the and (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).\nOn 9 June 1799, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se married her cousin Louis-Antoine at the Jelgava Palace. Desperate to display to the world a united family, Louis XVIII ordered his wife Queen Marie Jos\u00e9phine, who at the time was living apart from her husband in Schleswig-Holstein, to attend the wedding. Furthermore, she was to come without her long-time friend (and rumoured lover) Marguerite de Gourbillon. The Queen refused to leave her friend behind, creating an unpleasant situation that rivalled the wedding in notoriety. Louis XVIII knew that his nephew Louis-Antoine was not compatible with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Despite this, he still pressed for the marriage, which proved to be quite unhappy and produced no children.\nIn 1800, Louis XVIII attempted to strike up a correspondence with Napoleon Bonaparte (by then First Consul of France), urging him to restore the Bourbons to their throne, but the future emperor was impervious to this idea and continued to consolidate his own position as ruler of France.\nLouis XVIII encouraged his niece to write her memoirs, as he wished them to be used as Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.\nMarie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se persuaded Queen Louise of Prussia to give her family refuge on Prussian territory. Though Louise consented, the Bourbons were forced to assume pseudonyms. With Louis XVIII using the title , named after his estate in Languedoc and at times spelt as Comte de Lille. After an arduous journey from Jelgava, he and his family took up residence in the years 1801\u20131804 at the \u0141azienki Palace in Warsaw, which after the partitions of Poland became part of the province of South Prussia. According to Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary living there at the time, the Prussian local authorities, wishing to honour the arrivals, had music played, but trying to give this a national and patriotic character, unwittingly chose La Marseillaise, the hymn of the French Republic with unflattering allusions to both Louis XVI and Louis XVIII. They later apologised for their mistake.\nInitially, Louis resided in the Wasilewski\u2019s House, located right next to the Castle Square. However, it soon proved to be too small. In this situation, Ludwika Maria Zamoyska, the sister of the Polish king Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, offered Louis her nearby palace on the Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie street. Right next to the palace was a church and a monastery of the Discalced Carmelite nuns, where, thanks to the foundation of Louis\u2019s aunts, Sophie and Louise, sermons were held in French, which members of the court listened to daily. During the winter, Louis lived in there, while in the summer, he was moving to the so-called White House, small villa-type building in the \u0141azienki Park, which had been granted to him by the Prussian government.\nIt was very soon after their arrival that Louis and Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se learned of the death of Tsar Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would repudiate his father's banishment of the Bourbons, which he later did. Louis then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis-Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, to him in Edinburgh, but the King did not do so at that time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and he sent some money to Louis, whose court-in-exile was not only being spied on by Napoleonic agents but was also being forced to make significant economies, financed as it was mainly from interest owed by the Emperor Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France.\nIn 1803, Napoleon tried to force Louis XVIII to renounce his right to the throne of France, but Louis refused. In May the following year, 1804, Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French. In July, Louis XVIII and his nephew departed for Sweden for a Bourbon family conference, where Louis XVIII, the Count of Artois, and the Duke of Angoul\u00eame issued a statement condemning Napoleon's move. When the King of Prussia decreed that Louis XVIII would have to leave Prussian territory, and hence Warsaw, Tsar Alexander I invited Louis XVIII to resume residence in Jelgava, which he did. However, having to live under less generous conditions than those enjoyed under Paul I, Louis XVIII decided to embark for England as soon as possible.\nAs time went on, Louis XVIII realised that France would never accept an attempt to return to the . Accordingly, in 1805 he reformulated his public policies with a view to reclaiming his throne, issuing a declaration that was far more liberal than his earlier pronouncements. This repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain the Napoleonic administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of Antoine de B\u00e9siade, Count of Avaray, Louis's closest advisor in exile.\nLouis XVIII was forced once again to leave Jelgava when Tsar Alexander informed him that his safety could not be guaranteed in continental Europe. In July 1807, Louis boarded a Swedish frigate bound for Stockholm, bringing with him only the Duke of Angoul\u00eame. This stay in Sweden was short-lived since in November 1807 he disembarked at Great Yarmouth, on the Eastern coast of England. He then took up residence in Gosfield Hall in Essex, leased to him by the Marquess of Buckingham.\nEngland, 1807\u20131814.\nIn 1808, Louis brought his wife and queen, Marie Jos\u00e9phine, to join him in England. His stay at Gosfield Hall did not last long; he soon moved to Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where over one hundred courtiers were housed. The King paid \u00a3500 in rent each year to the owner of the estate, Sir George Lee. The Prince of Wales (the future George IV) was very charitable to the exiled Bourbons. As Prince Regent, he granted them permanent right of asylum and extremely generous allowances.\nThe Count of Artois did not join the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to continue his frivolous life in London. Louis's friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Jos\u00e9phine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis had a particularly severe attack of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, and he had to take to a wheelchair.\nIn 1812, Napoleon I embarked on an invasion of Russia, initiating a war which would prove to be the turning point in his fortunes. The expedition failed miserably, and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.\nIn 1813, Louis XVIII issued another declaration from Hartwell. The Declaration of Hartwell was even more liberal than his Declaration of 1805, asserting that those who had served Napoleon or the Republic would not suffer repercussions for their acts, and that the original owners of the (lands confiscated from the nobility and clergy during the Revolution) would be compensated for their losses.\nAllied troops entered Paris on 31 March 1814. Louis, unable to walk, had sent the Count of Artois to France in January 1814 and issued letters patent appointing Artois Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom in the event of his being restored as king. On 11 April, five days after the French Senate had invited Louis to resume the throne of France, Napoleon I abdicated.\nBourbon Restoration.\nFirst Restoration (1814\u20131815).\nThe Count of Artois ruled as Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom until his brother's arrival in Paris on 3 May. Upon his return, the King displayed himself to his subjects by staging a procession through the city. He took up residence in the Tuileries Palace the same day. His niece, the Duchess of Angoul\u00eame, fainted at the sight of the Tuileries, where she had been imprisoned during the time of the French Revolution.\nNapoleon's senate called Louis XVIII to the throne on the condition that he would accept a constitution that entailed recognition of the Republic and the Empire, a bicameral parliament elected every year, and the tri-colour flag of the aforementioned regimes. Louis XVIII opposed the senate's constitution and stated that he was \"disbanding the current senate in all the crimes of Bonaparte, and appealing to the French people\". The senatorial constitution was burned in a theatre in royalist Bordeaux, and the Municipal Council of Lyon voted for a speech that defamed the senate.\nThe Great Powers occupying Paris demanded that Louis XVIII implement a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature composed of a lower house styled the Chamber of Deputies and an upper house, styled the Chamber of Peers. The press would enjoy a degree of freedom, and there would be a provision that the former owners of the \"Biens nationaux\", confiscated during the Revolution, would be compensated. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The King would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.\nLouis XVIII signed the Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which extended east of the Rhine. She had to pay no war indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew immediately from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).\nIt did not take Louis XVIII long to go back on one of his many promises. He and his Comptroller-General of Finance Baron Louis were determined not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75\u00a0million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditure on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget\u00a0\u2013 in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.\nLouis XVIII admitted the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoul\u00eame and of Berry to the Royal Council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large interest in the goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, to which he was attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parma branch of the Bourbons, and not to the former Empress Marie-Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested at the Allies' inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.\nOn behalf of the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it was learned that Murat corresponded with Napoleon, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty. In fact, Murat never did actually write to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, had taken care to have such a correspondence forged, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25\u00a0million francs.\nLouis XVIII succeeded in getting the Neapolitan Bourbons restored immediately. Parma, however, was bestowed upon Empress Marie-Louise for life, and the Parma Bourbons were given the Duchy of Lucca until the death of Marie-Louise.\nHundred Days.\nOn 26 February 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped his island prison of Elba and embarked for France. He arrived with about 1,000 troops near Cannes on 1 March. Louis XVIII was not particularly worried by Bonaparte's excursion, as such small numbers of troops could be easily overcome. There was, however, a major underlying problem for the Bourbons: Louis XVIII had failed to purge the military of its Bonapartist troops. This led to mass desertions from the Bourbon armies to Bonaparte's. Furthermore, Louis XVIII could not join the campaign against Napoleon in Southern France, because he was having another case of gout. Minister of War Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult dispatched Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (later King Louis Philippe I), the Count of Artois, and Marshal \u00c9tienne MacDonald to apprehend Napoleon.\nLouis XVIII's underestimation of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, the army stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital with a small escort at midnight, first travelling to Lille, and then crossing the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, halting in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Tsar Alexander I, debated whether in the case of a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.\nHowever, Napoleon did not rule France again for very long, suffering a decisive defeat at the hands of the armies of the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. The Allies came to the consensus that Louis XVIII should be restored to the throne of France.\nSecond Restoration (from 1815).\nLouis returned to France promptly after Napoleon's defeat to ensure his second restoration \"in the baggage train of the enemy\", i.e. with Wellington's troops. The Duke of Wellington used King Louis' person to open up the route to Paris, as some fortresses refused to surrender to the Allies, but agreed to do so for their king. King Louis arrived at Cambrai on 26 June, where he released stating that those who served the Emperor in the Hundred Days would not be persecuted, except for the \"instigators\". It was also acknowledged that Louis's government might have made mistakes during the First Restoration. King Louis was worried that the counter-revolutionary element sought revenge. He promised to grant a constitution that would guarantee the public debt, freedom of the press and of religion, and equality before the law. It would guarantee the full property rights of those who had purchased national lands during the revolution. He kept his promises.\nOn 29 June, a deputation of five from among the members of the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers approached Wellington about putting a foreign prince on the throne of France. Wellington rejected their pleas outright, declaring that \"[Louis is] the best way to preserve the integrity of France\" and ordered the delegation to espouse King Louis' cause. The King entered Paris on 8 July to a boisterous reception: the Tuileries Palace gardens were thronged with bystanders, and, according to the Duke of Wellington, the acclamation of the crowds there were so loud during that evening that he could not converse with the King.\nAlthough the Ultra faction of returning exiles wanted revenge and were eager to punish the usurpers and restore the old regime, the new king rejected that advice. He instead called for continuity and reconciliation, and a search for peace and prosperity. The exiles were not given back their lands and property, although they eventually received repayment in the form of bonds. The Catholic Church was favoured. The electorate was limited to the richest men in France, most of whom had supported Napoleon. In foreign policy he removed Talleyrand, and continued most of Napoleon's policies in peaceful fashion. He kept to the policy of minimizing Austria's role but reversed Napoleon's friendly overtures to Spain and the Ottomans.\nThe King's role in politics was voluntarily diminished; he assigned most of his duties to his council. During the summer of 1815, he and his ministry embarked on a series of reforms. The Royal Council, an informal group of ministers that advised Louis, was dissolved and replaced by a tighter knit privy council, the \"Minist\u00e8re du Roi\". Artois, Berry and Angoul\u00eame were purged from the new \"minist\u00e8re\", and Talleyrand was appointed as the first \"Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil\", i.e. Prime Minister of France. On 14 July, the ministry dissolved the units of the army deemed \"rebellious\". Hereditary peerage was re-established by the ministry at Louis' behest.\nIn August, elections for the Chamber of Deputies returned unfavourable results for Talleyrand. The ministry hoped for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in what King Louis called the \"Chambre introuvable.\" The Duchess of Angoul\u00eame and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was acceptable to Louis' family and to the reactionary Chamber of Deputies. Louis dissolved the \"Chambre introuvable\" on 5 September 1816, after a rise in anti-monarchical sentiments.\nAnti-Napoleonic sentiment was high in Southern France, and this was prominently displayed in the White Terror, which saw the purge of all important Napoleonic officials from government, along with the execution or assassination of others. Popular vengeance led to barbarous acts against some of these officials. Guillaume Marie Anne Brune (a Napoleonic marshal) was savagely assassinated, and his remains thrown into the Rh\u00f4ne River. Louis publicly deplored such illegal acts, but vehemently supported the prosecution of those marshals of the army who had helped Napoleon in the Hundred Days. Louis's government executed Napoleon's Marshal Michel Ney in December 1815 for treason. The King's confidants Charles Fran\u00e7ois, Marquis de Bonnay, and Louis, duc de La Chastre advised him to inflict firm punishments on the \"traitors\".\nThe King was reluctant to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the \"traitors\" in January 1816, but such trials as had already begun took their course. That same declaration also banned any member of the House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France. It is estimated that between 50,000\u00a0\u2013 80,000 officials were purged from the government during what was known as the Second White Terror.\nIn November 1815, Louis's government had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France's borders were now less extensive, being drawn back to their 1790 extent. France had to pay for an army to occupy her, for at least five years, at a cost of 150\u00a0million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700\u00a0million francs to the Allies.\nIn 1818, the Chambers passed a military law that increased the size of the army by over 100,000. In October of the same year, Louis's foreign minister, the Duke of Richelieu, succeeded in convincing the Allied Powers to withdraw their armies early in exchange for a sum of over 200\u00a0million francs.\nLouis chose many centrist cabinets, as he wanted to appease the populace, much to the dismay of his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist government for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.\nKing Louis disliked the \"premier prince du sang\", Louis-Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, and took every opportunity to snub him, denying him the title of \"Royal Highness\", partly out of resentment for the Duke's father's role in voting for Louis XVI's execution. Louis XVIII's nephew, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, was assassinated at the Paris Opera on 14 February 1820. The royal family was grief-stricken and Louis broke an ancient tradition by attending his nephew's funeral, whereas previous kings of France could not have any association with death. The death of the Duke of Berry meant that the House of Orl\u00e9ans was more likely to succeed to the throne.\nBerry was the only member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed \"Dieudonn\u00e9\" (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon succession was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of Angoul\u00eame to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each d\u00e9partement. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the \"law of the two votes\", Louis began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zo\u00e9 Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of \"tabati\u00e8re\" (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, in a campaign headed by the Duke of Angoul\u00eame.\nDeath.\nLouis XVIII's health began to fail in the spring of 1824. He was experiencing obesity, gout and gangrene, both dry and wet, in his legs and spine. Louis died on 16 September 1824 surrounded by the extended royal family and some government officials. He was succeeded by his youngest brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X. As a historical footnote, the young science of disinfection had advanced in the early 1820s to the point where it was recognized that chlorides of lime could be used to both eliminate smells and slow decomposition. The body of Louis XVIII was washed with chlorides by a French scientist, Antoine Germain Labarraque, permitting his corpse to be \"presented to the public \"without any odour\"\" (emphasis in the original) in 1824.\nHonours.\nLouis XVIII was the last French monarch, and the only one after 1774, to die while still ruling. He was interred at the Basilica of St Denis, the necropolis of French kings.\nSuccession.\nThe French line of succession upon the death of Louis XVIII in 1824.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62115", "revid": "1159327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62115", "title": "Love Affair (1939 film)", "text": "1939 American romance film directed by Leo McCarey\nLove Affair is a 1939 American romance film, co-starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, and featuring Maria Ouspenskaya. It was directed by Leo McCarey and written by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart, based on a story by McCarey and Mildred Cram. Controversial on concept, the official screenplay was re-tooled and rewritten to appease Hollywood censorship and relied on actor input and improvisation, causing long delays and budget extensions.\nThe movie became a surprise hit of 1939, showing McCarey's versatility after a long career of comedic films, and launching the surprising team-up of Dunne and Boyer. Academy Award nominations include Best Actress for Dunne, Best Supporting Actress for Ouspenskaya, Best Original Song, Best Writing (Original), and Best Picture. Its popularity was later dwarfed by McCarey's 1957 remake \"An Affair to Remember\", which spawned its own remakes with 1994's \"Love Affair\" and a few Indian adaptations.\nPlot.\nOne December, French painter (and famed womanizer) Michel Marnet meets American singer Terry McKay aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke, she to Kenneth Bradley. They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his worldwide reputation makes them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou, who bonds with Terry and admits wanting Michel to settle down.\nAs the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet in the new year, six months later on top of the Empire State Building, giving Michel enough time to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry. His paintings fail to sell, so he finds work designing advertising billboards around the city, while Terry breaks off her engagement to Kenneth and successfully negotiates a contract with a Philadelphia nightclub to perform through to June.\nWhen the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building. However, Terry is struck by a car on a nearby street and is told by doctors she may be paralyzed for the rest of her life, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Michel, who waits until closing time, travels to Madeira to discover his grandmother has recently died, and continues working in New York City. Terry is overheard singing in the garden of her physiotherapy by the owner of a children's orphanage, who hires her as a music teacher.\nSix months pass by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, she and Michel meet by accident at a theater on Christmas Eve, though since she is already seated, Terry is able to conceal her disability. The next morning on Christmas Day, after the children visit Terry at her apartment, Michel makes a surprise visit and finally learns the truth. Terry, delighted Michel proved he had changed his ways, tells him it is her turn to prove she can change hers, but Michel assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis is.\nCast.\nOther uncredited actors include Joan Leslie, Oscar O'Shea, Bess Flowers and Harold Miller (as couple on liner), Phyllis Kennedy, and Gerald Mohr.\nDevelopment.\nDespite the popularity of his romantic and screwball comedies, Leo McCarey had become tired of directing them. His wife suggested they should go on a cruising vacation around Europe to combat his writer's block, and when they returned to the United States, they watched the Statue of Liberty pass. McCarey immediately told her his idea about two passengers who fall in love on a cruise, but realize they are both \"obligated to somebody else.\" With the premise created, Mildred Cram\nco-developed the rest of the story under the working title \"Memory of Love\", then later \"Love Match\", as Delmer Daves created the screenplay and Donald Ogden Stewart helped McCarey with the comedy. James Anderson stood as assistant director, Edward Dmytryk and George Hively were the movie's editors, and Roy Webb composed the film score. Filming took place in the fall of 1938. The rough cut was screened in January 1939.\nActresses such as Helen Hayes and Greta Garbo developed interest in starring, but the McCarey couple preferred Irene Dunne, who had previously appeared in McCarey's \"The Awful Truth\" and was a close family friend; Terry's occupation as nightclub singer intended to display Dunne's singing talents. Charles Boyer's reputation as a romantic actor (from starring in \"History is Made at Night\" and \"Algiers\") made him McCarey's first choice. Concurrently, Boyer rejected Harry Cohn's offer of the leading role in \"Good Girls Go to Paris\" to do \"Love Affair\", instead. He and McCarey were acquaintances and Boyer believed McCarey was an underestimated director, so he canceled many acting plans for the rest of 1938 to work with McCarey and Dunne. \"Any picture that Leo McCarey directs is its own guarantee[;] he can't make a bad picture,\" he later explained.\nIrene Dunne later noted that the dialog changed frequently, and the cast received pieces of paper between filming; McCarey's common directing tactic of improvisation also continued throughout. Both he and Boyer were unimpressed with the final draft, despite Boyer being used to memorizing his dialog very quickly. News columnists visiting the set observed the actors waiting around for their dialog as scenes would be rewritten moments before shooting: \"'I've been here doing nothing since 8 o'clock this morning,' [Boyer tells] me (it is now 4 in the afternoon),\" reported Sheilah Graham. Delays and rewrites caused the film to go over its budget of $800,000 by about $600,000.\nMcCarey reused and retooled the line \"According to you, everything I like to do is either illegal, immoral or fattening,\" from his 1934 movie \"Six of a Kind\", and gave it to Terry; W. C. Fields (who ad-libbed the retort in the original film) approved but critics hated the reference, McCarey later revealed. Boyer was allowed input in Michel's characterization; he suggested that Michel visiting his grandmother should have a prominent appearance so Terry's accident would not create a tonal shift. The champagne industry used the film to promote pink champagne to the audience, which caused a sales boost.\nMcCarey gave Dunne the opportunity to choose the signature song for the movie: she decided upon \"Wishing\", which became one of the most popular songs of 1939; the orphans were dubbed by Robert Mitchell's Boys Choir. Other songs performed are \"Sing My Heart\" and \"Plaisir d'Amour\", performed by Terry in a Philadelphian night-club and at Michel's grandmother's home, respectively.\nMaria Ouspenskaya described working on the film as \"an atmosphere of work that is inspirational. [...] Actor, electricians, and cameramen loved their work and did not want to break away from that atmosphere.\" Boyer would later praise McCarey's filmmaking for the movie's success; he was described in an interview years later as \"still speak[ing] of Mr. McCarey with sincere awe.\"\nControversy.\nThe initial screenplay was rejected by the Production Code Administration, accusing the story of endorsing adultery. Another related argument believed Terry had not been punished for her kept behavior, while Michel had been given redemption, so this led to Terry's paralysis. \"You dissolved to her in a hospital with her realizing that God hadn't wanted her to meet [Michel] until she was sorry for what she had done before,\" explained Donald Ogden Stewart.\nInitially a period piece set in the 1850s about the tragic romance of a French ambassador, the final draft of the script was complete and filming was announced to begin September 15, but it was later pushed back a month. Due to concerns of a potential war in Europe, the French embassy wanted stronger allyship with the United States and had concerns about a movie about a French diplomat and an American woman having an affair. McCarey and Daves reworked the story as a modern tale, with Terry's characterization now based on a woman Daves met on a cruise who was rumored to be returning to the United States after hiding in Europe for being caught as the mistress of a small-town government official.\nRelease.\n\"Film Daily\" reported that \"Love Affair\"'s release had the potential to be premiered in late January or early February 1939 at Radio City Music Hall; later issues would give the initial release date as February 17 and March 10. The film premiered March 16 at the Music Hall with a pink champagne-themed cocktail party for Dunne, emceed by W. G. Van Schmus; McCarey was on vacation in Santa Monica and could not attend.\nReception.\nThe praise for \"Love Affair\" among film critics was reflected in Clark Wales' quip: \"Recommending a Leo McCarey production is something like recommending a million dollars or beauty or a long and happy life. Any of these is a very fine thing to have and the only trouble is that there are not enough of them.\" \"Liberty\" magazine wrote \"a pleasant little seriocomedy,\" \"New York World-Telegram\" called the film \"the most absorbing and delightful entertainment of its kind [in] a long time\" and \"New York Daily News\" called the film \"tender, poignant [and] sentimental without being gooey\". \"Put this one down among the contenders of the Academy Awards of 1939,\" declared \"Associated Press\", \"and [one] of the most satisfactory movie endings.\"\n\"The screenplay is an exceptionally intelligent effort,\" wrote the \"Box Office Digest\", \"[and] McCarey's skill in handling individual scenes with the old [Hal] Roach technique carries through this tough spot and on to a grand climax,\" but the review added: \"It must be unfortunately recorded that there is a let down in interest for a half reel when [Michel and Terry] are separated.\" Meanwhile, \"The Charlotte Observer\" found the movie refreshing, describing it as \"outdoing\" other romances that are \"slap-happy wherein boy spanks girl or shoves her into the fish pond by way of displaying his affections.\" Pare Lorentz described the film as \"a mood, rather than a story\" as McCarey effortlessly balanced the conflicting tones of comedy and melodrama, \"[keeping] it alive by expert interpolations.\" \"Stage\" also praised the direction: \"McCarey is the man responsible for shifting, with no detectable trickery, from the brittle comedy of the early sequences to the genuine emotionalism of the later. It is superior entertainment all the way through.\"\nOn characterization, \"The New York Times\" remarked on \"the facility with which [Boyer and Dunne] have matched the changes of their script\u2014playing it lightly now, soberly next, but always credibly, always in character, always with a superb utilization of the material at hand.\" Leo Mishkin added: \"Certainly, this Terry McKay of Miss Dunne's is one of the greatest things she has ever done on the screen[.]\" \"Variety\" described Boyer's performance of Michel as \"a particularly effective presentation of the modern Casanova;\" \"Under no circumstances miss it,\" said Jesse Zunser, \"Mr. Boyer proves beyond the shadow of a cinematic doubt that there are few better players on the American dream[.]\" \"Box Office Digest\" wrote, \"[Boyer and Dunne have] never done more delightful work, and to say that they step along in stride \u2014 step for step, is a tribute to either one in red hot competition.\" \"The Film Daily\" described the performances as \"gorgeously acted\" and \"stand[s] out as the best of many months\", and \"Photoplay\" remarked that Maria Ouspenskaya's \"extraordinary\" performance \"stole\" the scenes in Madeira. The only notable criticism of characters came from Dunne herself, who told \"Silver Screen\" years later: \"If I had been in that girl's place, far from hiding, I would've trundled my wheelchair up and down the sidewalks of New York looking for [Michel].\"\n\"Love Affair\" was RKO Pictures' second-most popular film, after \"Gunga Din\". It was colloquially classified as \"Mature.\"\nLegacy.\nYears after its release, \"Love Affair\" would continue to receive high praise. Tom Flannery's filmography book \"1939: The Year in Movies\" wrote that Dunne and Boyer \"generated [the most] chemistry, charisma [and] sensuality\" in Hollywood, despite 1939 producing the best couples in \"Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh [in \"Gone with the Wind\"], Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon [in \"Wuthering Heights\"], Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman [in \"Intermezzo\"].\" William K. Everson joined the critics of the past that praised McCarey balancing the comedy and drama perfectly, and noted Terry saying goodbye to Grandma Janou was realistically \"tender and poignant[;] such moments all too rarely are in film.\" Rotten Tomatoes gave it a critics' score of 86% based on 7 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a critics' score of 91 on 8 reviews.\nHowever, the release of its remake, \"An Affair to Remember\", spawned comparisons. \"An Affair to Remember\" became better-known in popular culture, later placed at number 5 on AFI's 100 Passions list, and was frequently parodied, referenced, and alluded to in other media, causing \"Love Affair\" to become lost in time. Screenwriter Nora Ephron, first introduced to the movie when she was a child, referenced it heavily in \"Sleepless in Seattle\", allegedly causing rentals of the film to increase. Irene Dunne and Deborah Kerr's Terry performances did not receive as much comparison as Charles Boyer's Michel and Cary Grant's Nicky, whose characters divided critics and analysts per review. Larry Swindell called Boyer's portrayal/performance chaste which overshadows the dialog's frequent references to Michel's womanizing, whereas Megan McGurk argued Grant was too self-conscious and refused to make Nicky appropriately vulnerable, particularly in Nicky and Terry's reunion.\nBoyer and Dunne.\nThe partnership of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne would be called the most romantic in Hollywood. With a positive reaction to the pairing, Hollywood developed them as the newest team-up, so the duo starred together twice more in \"When Tomorrow Comes\" (1939) and \"Together Again\" (1944). Critics judged the rest of the \"trilogy\" with the praised qualities of \"Love Affair\", with \"When Tomorrow Comes\" receiving the least positive reception.\nThe two actors remained family friends after performing together. To promote \"When Tomorrow Comes\", they were asked by \"Photoplay\" to describe each other in the style of a parlor game where a player who briefly left the room guesses the secret noun other contestants chose by asking questions like \"If I were that person, what kind of car would I be?\" Their essays appeared in the October issue under the names \"Irene: As Seen by Charles Boyer\" and \"Charles: As Seen by Irene Dunne\" with the editor noting: \"Surely, working together as they do and have done, and being analytical, intelligent people, each would give a clear-limned portrait of the other; unbiased, colorful, exciting.\" Boyer described Dunne in prose, while Dunne described Boyer under topical subtitles, but Wes D. Gehring pointed out both essays' frequent references to fine art, as well as Dunne personifying Boyer through French impressionism.\nDunne called Boyer one of her favorite screen partners, along with Cary Grant, and referred to him as the \"perfect gentleman\" at the American Film Institute's retrospective screening.\nFilm remakes and adaptations.\n\"Lux Radio Theatre\" aired two versions of \"Love Affair\" radio adaptations on April 1, 1940 and July 6, 1942. Irene Dunne reprised her role in both, whereas Charles Boyer co-starred in the 1942 version; William Powell starred alongside Dunne in the 1940 version.\nPlans for a \"Love Affair\" remake were first reported in 1952, which had Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl attached to the project. Eventually, McCarey remade it in 1957 as \"An Affair to Remember\" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles, using a very similar screenplay. Despite agreeing to remake it in response to Hollywood's current romantic offerings, McCarey would still prefer his original work. Glenn Gordon Caron also remade the film in 1994 as \"Love Affair\", starring Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, and in her last feature film, Katharine Hepburn. Bollywood cinema made two versions: 1965's \"Bheegi Raat\" and 1999's \"Mann\", which were both adaptations of \"An Affair to Remember\".\nAvailability.\nIn 1967, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Because of this, the film is widely available on home video and online. The film can be downloaded legally for free on the Internet Archive. However, since the only film prints available were in lower-resolution 16mm (along with poor quality web video), in 2020 the Museum of Modern Art and Lobster Films (Paris) worked on a new 4K version created from film elements that MoMA had in its archives.\nThe Criterion Collection released this newly restored version on Blu-ray and DVD in February 2022.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nStreaming audio"}

He was the son of Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Marie Louise, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria.\nNapoleon II had been Prince Imperial of France and King of Rome since birth. After the fall of his father, he lived the rest of his life in Vienna and was known in the Austrian court as Franz, Duke of Reichstadt for his adult life (from the German version of his second given name, along with a title his grandfather granted him in 1818). He was posthumously given the nickname L'Aiglon (\"the Eaglet\").\nWhen Napoleon I tried to abdicate on 4 April 1814, he said that his son would rule as emperor. However, the coalition victors refused to acknowledge his son as successor, and Napoleon I was forced to abdicate unconditionally some days later. Although Napoleon II never actually ruled France, he was briefly the titular Emperor of the French after the second fall of his father. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 21.\nHis cousin, Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, founded the Second French Empire in 1852 and ruled as Emperor Napoleon III. He was also the maternal great-great-grandson of Empress Maria Theresa, Empress of Habsburg Dominions and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and great-grandson of Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily.\nEarly life.\nNapoleon II was born on 20 March 1811, at the Tuileries Palace, the son of Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Marie Louise. On the same day he underwent \"ondoiement\" (a traditional French ceremony which is a simple baptism unaccompanied by the usual additional ceremonies) by Joseph Fesch with his full name of \"Napoleon Fran\u00e7ois Charles Joseph\".\nThe baptism, inspired by the baptismal ceremony of Louis, Grand Dauphin of France, was held on 9 June 1811 in Notre Dame de Paris. Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, Austrian ambassador to France, wrote of the baptism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The baptism ceremony was beautiful and impressive; the scene in which the emperor took the infant from the arms of his noble mother and raised him up twice to reveal him to the public [thus breaking from long tradition, as he did when he crowned himself at his coronation] was loudly applauded; in the monarch's manner and face could be seen the great satisfaction that he took from this solemn moment.\nHe was put in the care of Louise Charlotte Fran\u00e7oise de Montesquiou, a descendant of Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, who was named Governess of the Children of France. Affectionate and intelligent, the governess assembled a considerable collection of books intended to give the infant a strong grounding in religion, philosophy, and military matters.\nSuccession rights.\nAs the only legitimate son of Napoleon I, he was already constitutionally the Prince Imperial and heir apparent, but the Emperor also gave his son the title of King of Rome. Three years later, the First French Empire collapsed. Napoleon I saw his second wife and their son for the last time on 24 January 1814. On 4 April 1814, he abdicated in favour of his three-year-old son after the Six Days' Campaign and the Battle of Paris. The child became Emperor of the French under the regnal name of Napoleon II. However, on 6 April 1814, Napoleon I fully abdicated and renounced not only his own rights to the French throne, but also those of his descendants. The Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814 gave the child the right to use the title of Prince of Parma, of Piacenza, and of Guastalla, and his mother was styled the Duchess of Parma, of Piacenza, and of Guastalla.\nReign.\nOn 29 March 1814, Marie Louise, accompanied by her entourage, left the Tuileries Palace with her son. Their first stop was the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet; then, fearing the advancing enemy troops, they continued on to the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois. On 13 April, with her entourage much diminished, Marie Louise and her three-year-old son were back in Rambouillet, where they met her father, Emperor Francis I of Austria, and Emperor Alexander I of Russia. On 23 April, escorted by an Austrian regiment, mother and son left Rambouillet and France forever, for their exile in Austria.\nIn 1815, after his resurgence and then his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon I abdicated for the second time in favour of his four-year-old son, whom he had not seen since his exile to Elba. The day after Napoleon's abdication, a Commission of Government of five members took the rule of France, pending the return to Paris of the Bourbon King Louis XVIII, who was still in Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis. The Commission held power for two weeks, but never formally summoned Napoleon II as Emperor or appointed a regent. The entrance of the Allies into Paris on 7 July brought a rapid end to the hopes of supporters of the young Napoleon: instead, he remained in Austria with his mother.\nThe next Bonaparte to ascend a French imperial throne, in 1852, would be Louis-Napoleon, who took the regnal name Napoleon III. He was the son of Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte, who had been made King of Holland by his brother in 1806.\nLife in Austria.\nFrom the spring of 1814 onwards, the young Napoleon lived in Austria and was known as \"Franz\", a German language cognate of his second given name, Fran\u00e7ois. In 1818, he was awarded the title of Duke of Reichstadt by his maternal grandfather, Emperor Francis. He was educated by a staff of military tutors and developed a passion for soldiering, dressing in a miniature uniform like his father's and performing maneuvers in the palace. At the age of 8, it was apparent to his tutors that he had chosen his career.\nBy 1820, Napoleon had completed his elementary studies and begun his military training, learning German, Italian and mathematics as well as receiving advanced physical training. His official army career began at age 12, in 1823, when he was made a cadet in the Austrian Army. Accounts from his tutors describe Napoleon as intelligent, serious, and focused. Additionally, he was very tall, having grown to nearly 1.8\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft) by the time he was 17.\nIn 1822, in France, the Four Sergeants of La Rochelle were put to death for attempting to return Napoleon II to the throne, although it is unclear to what extent they were committed Bonapartists. There is no evidence that Napoleon II endorsed the attempt at insurrection.\nHis budding military career gave some concern and fascination to the monarchies of Europe and French leaders over his possible return to France. However, he was allowed to play no political role and instead was used by Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich in bargaining with France to gain advantage for Austria. Fearful of anyone in the Bonaparte family regaining political power, Metternich even rejected a request for Franz to move to a warmer climate in Italy. He received another rejection when his grandfather refused to allow him to join the army traveling to Italy to put down a rebellion.\nUpon the death of his stepfather, Adam Albert von Neipperg, and the revelation that his mother had borne two illegitimate children to Neipperg prior to their marriage, Franz grew distant from his mother and felt that his Austrian family were holding him back to avoid political controversy. He said to his friend, Anton von Prokesch-Osten, \"If Jos\u00e9phine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried at Saint Helena, and I should not be at Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved\".\nDeath.\nIn 1831, Franz was given command of an Austrian battalion, but he never got the chance to serve in any meaningful capacity. In 1832, he caught pneumonia and was bedridden for several months. His poor health eventually overtook him and on 22 July 1832 Franz died of tuberculosis at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna. He had no children; thus the Napoleonic claim to the throne of France passed to his uncle Joseph Bonaparte and later (through Louis Bonaparte) to Franz's cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, who later founded and reigned over the Second French Empire, styling himself Napoleon III. \nFranz's last words were, \"My story is my birth and death. Between my cradle and my grave, there is a big zero\".\nDisposition of his remains.\nOn 15 December 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the remains of Napoleon II to be transferred from the Imperial Crypt in Vienna to the dome of Les Invalides in Paris. The remains of Napoleon I had been returned to France in December 1840, at the time of the July Monarchy. In December 1969, the remains of Napoleon II were moved underground to the \"cella\" of Napoleon's tomb.\nWhile most of his remains were transferred to Paris in 1940, his heart and intestines remained in Vienna, which is traditional for members of the Habsburg family. His heart is in Urn 42 of the \"Herzgruft\" ('Heart Crypt'), and his viscera are in Urn 76 of the Ducal Crypt.\nLegacy.\nHe was noted for his friendship with Sophie, a Bavarian princess of the House of Wittelsbach. Intelligent, ambitious and strong-willed, Sophie had little in common with her husband Franz Karl, the brother of Napoleon II's mother, Empress Marie Louise. There were rumors of a love affair between Sophie and Napoleon II, as well as the possibility that Sophie's second son, Maximilian I of Mexico, born in 1832, was the result issue of the affair.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film is about a naive, newly appointed United States senator who fights against government corruption, and was written by Sidney Buchman, based on Lewis R. Foster's unpublished story \"The Gentleman from Montana\". It was loosely based on the life of Montana US Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who underwent a similar experience when he was investigating the Warren G. Harding administration's Teapot Dome scandal.\nThe film was controversial in the US when it was first released, with attacks from many politicians claiming that it brought Washington into disrepute, but it was very successful at both the domestic and international box offices, and it made Stewart a major star.\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, winning Best Original Story. Considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, the film was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1989, for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nIn the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert \"Happy\" Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governor's children. Corrupt political boss Jim Taylor sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics was expected to make him easy to manipulate.\nSmith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's na\u00efve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a yokel.\nTo keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine.\nUnwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill in the Senate, the machine in his state \u2014 through Paine \u2014 accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine's betrayal to defend himself and runs away.\nSaunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme's true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced.\nConstituents try to rally around Smith, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers' effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's gangsters.\nAlthough all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate. Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith's innocence to Clarissa's delight. The President of the Senate observes the ensuing chaos with amusement.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jean Arthur as Clarissa Saunders\nIn addition, uncredited appearances include: Dick Jones as Dickie, the Senate page boy who helps Smith; Milton Kibbee, who has a bit as a reporter; Lafe McKee; and Matt McHugh of the McHugh acting family.\nProduction.\nColumbia Pictures originally purchased Lewis R. Foster's unpublished story, variously called \"The Gentleman from Montana\" and \"The Gentleman from Wyoming\", as a vehicle for Ralph Bellamy, but once Frank Capra came on board as director\u00a0\u2013 after Rouben Mamoulian had expressed interest\u00a0\u2013 the film was to be a sequel to his \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", called \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington\", with Gary Cooper reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds. Because Cooper was unavailable, Capra then \"saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur\", and Stewart was borrowed from MGM. Capra said of Stewart: \"I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith ... He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him.\"\nAlthough a youth group is featured in the story, the Boy Scouts of America refused to allow their name to be used in the film and instead the fanciful \"Boy Rangers\" was used.\nIn January 1938, both Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures submitted Foster's story to the censors at the Hays Office, likely indicating that both studios had an interest in the project before Columbia purchased it. Joseph Breen, the head of that office, warned the studios: \"[W]e would urge most earnestly that you take serious counsel before embarking on the production of any motion picture based on this story. It looks to us like one that might well be loaded with dynamite, both for the motion picture industry, and for the country at large.\" Breen specifically objected to \"the generally unflattering portrayal of our system of Government, which might well lead to such a picture being considered, both here, and more particularly abroad, as a covert attack on the Democratic [\"sic?\"] form of government\", and warned that the film should make clear that \"the Senate is made up of a group of fine, upstanding citizens, who labor long and tirelessly for the best interests of the nation.\"\nLater, after the screenplay had been written and submitted, Breen reversed course, saying of the film, \"It is a grand yarn that will do a great deal of good for all those who see it and, in my judgment, it is particularly fortunate that this kind of story is to be made at this time. Out of all Senator Jeff's difficulties there has been evolved the importance of a democracy and there is splendidly emphasized the rich and glorious heritage which is ours and which comes when you have a government 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.'\"\nThe film was in production from April 3, 1939, to July 7 of that year. Some location shooting took place in Washington, D.C., at Washington Union Station, the United States Capitol, and other locations for background use.\nFollowing Capra's usual habits, working with people he knew well, he brought together again three of the leading actors from his previous film production for Columbia Pictures in 1938, \"You Can't Take It with You\", with Arthur, Stewart, and Arnold in lead roles again.\nIn the studio, to ensure authenticity, an elaborate set was created, consisting of Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms, and hotel suites, as well as specific Washington, D.C., monuments, all based on a trip Capra and his crew made to the capital. Even the Press Club of Washington was reproduced in minute detail, but the major effort went into a faithful reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. James D. Preston, a former superintendent of the Senate gallery, acted as technical director for the Senate set, as well as advising on political protocol. The production also used the \"New York street set\" on the Warner Bros. lot, using 1,000 extras when that scene was shot.\nThe ending of the film was apparently changed at some point, as the original program describes Stewart and Arthur returning to Smith's hometown, where they are met by a big parade, with the implication that they are married and starting a family. In addition, the Taylor political machine is shown being crushed; Smith, riding a motorcycle, visits Senator Paine and forgives him; and a visit to Smith's mother is included. Some of this footage can be seen in the film's trailer.\nImpact.\nThe film premiered in Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., on October 17, 1939, sponsored by the National Press Club, an event to which 4,000 guests were invited, including 45 senators. \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was attacked by the Washington press, and politicians in the U.S. Congress, as anti-American and pro-Communist/Socialist for its portrayal of corruption in the American government. Frederic William Wile of \"The Washington Star\" wrote that the film showed \"the democratic system and our vaunted free press in exactly the colors Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin like to paint them.\" While Capra claims in his autobiography that some senators walked out of the premiere, contemporary press accounts are unclear about whether this occurred or not, or whether senators yelled back at the screen during the film.\nHowever, it is known that Alben W. Barkley, a Democrat and the Senate Majority Leader, called the film \"silly and stupid\", and said it \"makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks\". He also remarked that the film was \"a grotesque distortion\" of the Senate, \"as grotesque as anything ever seen! Imagine the Vice President of the United States winking at a pretty girl in the gallery in order to encourage a filibuster!\" Barkley thought the film \"showed the Senate as the biggest aggregation of nincompoops on record!\"\nPete Harrison, a respected journalist and publisher of the motion picture trade journal \"Harrison's Reports\", suggested that the Senate pass a bill allowing theater owners to refuse to show films that \"were not in the best interest of our country\". That did not happen, but one of the ways that some senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the Neely Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which put forward the film's patriotism and support of democracy and publicized the film's many positive reviews.\nOther objections were also voiced. Joseph P. Kennedy, the American Ambassador to Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head Harry Cohn to say that he feared the film would damage \"America's prestige in Europe\", and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release. Capra and Cohn responded, citing the film's review, which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he never followed up, although he privately still had doubts about the film.\nThe film was banned in Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and in Franco's Spain. In the Soviet Union, the film was released to cinemas in as \"The Senator\". According to Capra, the film was also dubbed in certain European countries to alter the message of the film so it conformed with official ideology.\nWhen a ban on American films was imposed in German occupied France in 1942, some theaters chose to show \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" as the last movie before the ban went into effect. One theater owner in Paris reportedly screened the film nonstop for 30 days after the ban was announced.\nThe critical response to the film was more measured than the reaction by politicians, domestic and foreign. When it premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, the critic for \"The New York Times\", for instance, Frank S. Nugent, wrote that \"[Capra] is operating, of course, under the protection of that unwritten clause in the Bill of Rights entitling every voting citizen to at least one free swing at the Senate. Mr. Capra's swing is from the floor and in the best of humor; if it fails to rock the august body to its heels\u00a0\u2013 from laughter as much as from injured dignity\u00a0\u2013 it won't be his fault but the Senate's, and we should really begin to worry about the upper house.\"\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" has been called one of the quintessential whistleblower films in American history. Dr. James Murtagh and Dr. Jeffrey Wigand cited this film as a seminal event in U.S. history at the first \"Whistleblower Week in Washington\" (May 13\u201319, 2007). Others have highlighted the film's vigorous support for free speech as a check of tyranny, and have pointed to the parallels between the strong-armed tactics of the Taylor Machine depicted in the film and those which had recently been deployed by Mayor Frank Hague against protestors in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" has often been listed as among Capra's best, but it has been noted that it \"marked a turning point in Capra's vision of the world, from nervous optimism to a darker, more pessimistic tone. Beginning with \"American Madness\" (1932), such Capra films as \"Lady for a Day\" (1933), \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936), and \"You Can't Take It With You\" (1938) had trumpeted their belief in the decency of the common man. In \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", however, the decent common man is surrounded by a venal, petty and thuggish group of crooks. Everyone in the film \u2013 except for Jefferson Smith and his tiny cadre of believers \u2013 is either in the pay of the political machine run by Edward Arnold's James Taylor or complicit in Taylor's corruption through their silence, and they all sit by as innocent people, including children, are brutalized and intimidated, rights are violated, and the government is brought to a halt.\"\nNevertheless, Smith's filibuster and the tacit encouragement of the Senate President are both emblematic of the director's belief in the difference that one individual can make. This theme would be expanded further in Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) and other films.\nBox office.\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was a box office success upon its release, earning theatrical rentals of $3.5 million in the United States alone. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1939 and was also the third highest-grossing film of the 1930s, behind only \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937).\nAwards and honors.\nAcademy Awards.\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but won only one.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

It was written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and Walter Reisch, based on a story by Melchior Lengyel. \"Ninotchka\" marked the first comedy role for Garbo, and her penultimate film; she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.\nIn 1990, \"Ninotchka\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It has been listed as one of the greatest films of all time by \"Empire\" in 2008 and \"Time\" in 2011. \"Ninotchka\" has a rating on the review-aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews.\nPlot.\nIranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski, three agents from the Soviet Board of Trade, arrive in Paris to sell jewelry confiscated from the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1917.\nCount Alexis Rakonin, a White Russian nobleman reduced to employment as a waiter in the hotel where the trio are staying, overhears details of their mission and informs the former Russian Grand Duchess Swana that her family jewels are to be sold by the three men. Swana's debonair paramour, Count L\u00e9on d'Algout, offers to help retrieve the jewelry before it is sold.\nIn their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski are negotiating with Mercier, a prominent Parisian jeweler, when L\u00e9on interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels were seized illegally by the Soviet government and a petition has been filed in Paris preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewelry until the lawsuit is settled.\nThe amiable, charming and cunning L\u00e9on treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their friendship and confidence. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise.\nDispleased by the telegram, Moscow then sends Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova, a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewelry sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission.\nNinotchka and L\u00e9on first meet on the street near the hotel, their identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, L\u00e9on follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Ninotchka tells him he might be an interesting subject of study and suggests they go to his apartment.\nAt his apartment, L\u00e9on tells Ninotchka he finds her fascinating and believes that he is falling in love with her; she acknowledges they share a mutual chemical attraction. They begin to kiss, but are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Both then realize they are each other's adversaries over the jewelry and Ninotchka promptly leaves, despite L\u00e9on's protestations.\nThe next day, L\u00e9on follows Ninotchka to a working class bistro where she again rebuffs him. However, after several attempts at making her laugh, L\u00e9on finally breaks down her resistance and she falls in love with him. \nWhile attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the West. At a dinner date with L\u00e9on where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewelry and for L\u00e9on's affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakened by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewelry during the night. Swana has come to offer Ninotchka a proposition: the jewels will be returned and the litigation dropped if Ninotchka returns to Moscow immediately so that Swana can have L\u00e9on to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees to Swana's proposal and, after completing the sale of the jewelry to Mercier, she, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski fly back to Russia.\nLater that evening, L\u00e9on visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs L\u00e9on that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility.\nSometime later in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to dinner at her communal apartment and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. After dinner, Ninotchka finally receives a letter from L\u00e9on, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated.\nMore time passes. Commissar Razinin informs Ninotchka that Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski were sent to Constantinople to sell furs but once again have failed to complete their mission. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is again sent by Razinin to investigate the situation and retrieve the trio.\nAfter Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, her three comrades inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to the Soviet Union. When Ninotchka asks them who is responsible for this idea, Buljanoff points to the balcony where L\u00e9on is standing. L\u00e9on explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and the three Russians conspired to get her to leave the country. He asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees.\nThe final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because, unlike theirs, his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Greta Garbo as Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova\nRelease.\n\"Ninotchka\" was released in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, where it became a great success. It was banned in the Soviet Union and its satellites. It went on to make $2,279,000 worldwide. USA: $1,187,000. International: $1,092,000. Profit: $138,000.\nIn a play on the famous \"Garbo Talks!\" ad campaign used for her \"talkie\" debut in \"Anna Christie\" (1930), \"Ninotchka\" was marketed with the catchphrase \"Garbo Laughs!\", commenting on Garbo's largely somber and melancholy image (though Garbo laughs several times in many of her previous pictures).\nReception.\nCritical response.\nWhen the film was shown at the Radio City Music Hall, \"The New York Times\" film critic Frank S. Nugent praised it:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The comedy, through Mr. Douglas's debonair performance and those of Ina Claire as the duchess and Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach as the unholy three emissaries; through Mr. Lubitsch's facile direction; and through the cleverly written script of Walter Reisch, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, has come off brilliantly. Stalin, we repeat, won't like it; but, unless your tastes hew too closely to the party line, we think you will, immensely.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"Ninotchka\" is recognized as well by the American Film Institute in the AFI 100 Years... series in the following lists:\nOrigins.\n\"Ninotchka\" is based on a three-sentence story idea by Melchior Lengyel that made its debut at a poolside conference in 1937, when a suitable comedy vehicle for Garbo was being sought by MGM: \"Russian girl saturated with Bolshevist ideals goes to fearful, capitalistic, monopolistic Paris. She meets romance and has an uproarious good time. Capitalism not so bad, after all.\"\nRevival.\nAn attempt by MGM to release \"Ninotchka\" later during World War II was suppressed on the grounds that the Soviets were then allies of the West. The film was released after the war ended.\nLegacy.\nIn 1955, the musical \"Silk Stockings\", based on \"Ninotchka\", opened on Broadway. Written by Cole Porter, the stage production was based on \"Ninotchka's\" story and script and starred Hildegard Neff and Don Ameche. MGM then produced a 1957 film version of the musical directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Actor George Tobias, who appeared uncredited in \"Ninotchka\" as the Soviet visa official, is featured in \"Silk Stockings\" as Commissar Markovitch. Rolfe Sedan, who portrayed the hotel manager in \"Ninotchka\", appears uncredited as a stage manager in \"Silk Stockings\". The MGM films \"Comrade X\" (1940), starring Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr, and \"The Iron Petticoat\" (1956), starring Bob Hope and Katharine Hepburn, both borrow heavily from \"Ninotchka\".\nMGM had scheduled \"Madame Curie\" as Garbo's next film, but pleased with the success of \"Ninotchka\", the studio quickly decided to team Garbo and Douglas in another romantic comedy. \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941) was the result and Garbo received the worst reviews of her entire career. It turned out to be her final film and Greer Garson eventually starred in \"Madame Curie\".\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited \"Ninotchka\" as one of his favorite films.\nFilipino writer and activist Ninotchka Rosca revealed during a 1966 Philippine congressional hearing that her pen name was inspired by the film.\nNazi German Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels remarked in his meeting notes on June 9, 1940 that \"The German press should go and see the excellent American anti-Soviet film \"Ninotchka\".\" He would later tell multiple German actors that he thought it was one of the best films he had ever seen. During the 1948 Italian general election the US State Department encouraged film distributors to show the film as a means of countering the increasingly popular Italian Communist Party.\nCultural influences.\n\"Colonel Ninotchka\" was a character in the 1980s women's professional wrestling promotion, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62119", "revid": "158436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62119", "title": "Bradford's law", "text": "Pattern of references in science journals\nBradford's law is a pattern first described by Samuel C. Bradford in 1934 that estimates the exponentially diminishing returns of searching for references in science journals. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n2. There are a number of related formulations of the principle.\nIn many disciplines, this pattern is called a Pareto distribution. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core scientific journals for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier \"b\"\"m\" is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in \"b\"\"m\" times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.\nDifferent researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like Zipf's law, to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty, it is sufficient to identify the \"core publications\" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.\nHowever, its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by Vannevar Bush's famous article \"As We May Think\", Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His Science Citation Index (SCI) made it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as \"Nature\" and \"Science\", were core for all of hard science. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.\nThe result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of \"core journals\" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.\nScattering.\nBradford's law is also known as Bradford's law of scattering or the Bradford distribution, as it describes how the articles on a particular subject are scattered throughout the mass of periodicals. Another more general term that has come into use since 2006 is information scattering, an often observed phenomenon related to information collections where there are a few sources that have many items of relevant information about a topic, while most sources have only a few. This law of distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the World Wide Web as well.\nHj\u00f8rland and Nicolaisen identified three kinds of scattering:\nThey found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.\nLaw's interpretations.\nThe interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko, who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals. V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReprinted as:"}

It describes the experiences of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers, as they move from place to place in California, searching for jobs during the Great Depression.\nSteinbeck based the novella on his own experiences as a teenager working alongside migrant farm workers in the 1910s, before the arrival of the Okies whom he would describe in his novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\". The title is taken from Robert Burns' poem \"To a Mouse\": \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley\" (\"The best-laid plans of mice and men / Often go awry\").\nAlthough the book is taught in many schools, \"Of Mice and Men\" has been a frequent target of censorship and book bans for vulgarity and for what some consider offensive and racist language. Consequently, it appears on the American Library Association's list of the \"Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century\".\nPlot.\nDuring the Great Depression in California, two migrant field workers \u2013 George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a bulky, strong but mentally disabled man \u2013 are on their way from Soledad to another part of the state. They share a dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to care for and pet rabbits. He loves touching soft animals, although he always accidentally kills them by petting them too hard. George constantly retells the dream, which is one of Lennie's favorite stories. They fled from Weed after Lennie grabbed a young woman's skirt because he thought it was pretty. He would not let go, because he holds on tighter when stressed. This led to an accusation of rape and a mob forming to find and lynch Lennie. Throughout the introduction, it becomes clear that Lennie relies on George because he is unable to function independently.\nAfter they are hired at a farm, Curley, the Boss's small, aggressive son, confronts the pair. Curley, who has a Napoleon complex, dislikes larger men, and targets Lennie. Lennie is instantly attracted to Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, which also poses a problem. In contrast, the pair meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle jerkline-skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives puppies to Lennie and to Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was put down by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.\nIn spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 () toward the purchase of a farm, in return for permission to live with them. They will be able to buy a farm at the end of the month. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley's fist while urged on by George.\nNevertheless, George feels more relaxed. He even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable hand, who is isolated from the other workers because he is black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm, even though he scorns the possibility of the dream coming true. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, she shows her spiteful side when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks lynched. They hear the ranch hands returning, and she leaves.\nThe next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to him, admitting that she is lonely. Her dreams of becoming a movie star have been crushed. She finds out about Lennie's love of soft things and offers to let him stroke her hair, but when she feels his strength, she panics and begins to scream. Lennie becomes frightened and unintentionally breaks her neck. He runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, they form a lynch mob intent on killing him, sending for the police before beginning the search. George quickly realizes that their dream is at an end and hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.\nGeorge finds Lennie at the meeting spot, and the two sit together while George retells the beloved story of the dream, although he now knows it will never happen. George hears the lynch mob coming and shoots Lennie, giving him a more merciful death than the one he would receive at the hands of the mob. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds later. Only Slim understands what has happened. He leads George away, trying to console him. Curley and Carlson look on, neither understanding why Slim and George are feeling the way they are.\nThemes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In every bit of honest writing in the world there is a base theme. Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love. There are shorter means, many of them. There is writing promoting social change, writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always that base theme. Try to understand each other.\nSteinbeck emphasizes aspirations throughout the book. George aspires to become independent, to be his own boss, to have a homestead, and, most important, to be \"somebody\". Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead, and to quench his fixation on soft objects. Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age\u2014on George's homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley's wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.\nLoneliness is a significant factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for\u2014she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as \"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who the guy is, long's he's with you.\" The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of Soledad, which means \"solitude\" in Spanish.\nDespite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley's wife is upheld by Curley's jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the stable; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie's ignorance.\nSteinbeck's characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action-oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to earn enough money to fulfill their dream. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.\nRegarding human interaction, the evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley's Napoleon complex is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the Penguin Teacher's Guide for \"Of Mice and Men\", Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.\nFate is felt most heavily as the characters' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger). Steinbeck presents this as \"something that happened\" or as his friend coined for him \"non-teleological thinking\" or \"is thinking\", which postulates a non-judgmental point of view.\n\"Of Mice and Men\" can be associated with the idea that inherent limitations exist and despite all the squirming and struggling, sometimes the circumstances of one's existence limits their capacity to live the fairy tale lives they wish to. Even the title of the novel itself references this \"the title is, of course, a fragment from the poem by Robert Burns, which gives emphasis to the idea of the futility of human endeavor or the vanity of human wishes\".\nAnimals play a role in the story as well; the heron shifts from a beautiful part of the scenery from the beginning of the novel to a predator near the end. The ending chapter has the heron return, preying upon snakes that get too curious in a repetitive nature, symbolic of the dreams of men constantly being snatched away.\nDevelopment.\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was Steinbeck's first attempt at writing in the form of novel-play termed a \"play-novelette\" by one critic. Structured in three acts of two chapters each, it is intended to be both a novella and a script for a play. It is only 30,000 words in length. Steinbeck wanted to write a novel that could be played from its lines, or a play that could be read like a novel.\nSteinbeck originally titled it \"Something That Happened\" (referring to the events of the book as \"something that happened\" because nobody can be really blamed for the tragedy that unfolds in the story). However, he changed the title after reading Robert Burns's poem \"To a Mouse\". Burns's poem tells of the regret the narrator feels for having destroyed the home of a mouse while plowing his field.\nSteinbeck wrote this book and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" in what is now Monte Sereno, California. An early draft of \"Of Mice and Men\" was eaten by Steinbeck's dog. As he explained in a 1936 letter:My setter pup [Toby], left alone one night, made confetti of about half of my [manuscript] book. Two months [sic] work to do over again. It sets me back. There was no other draft. I was pretty mad, but the poor little fellow may have been acting critically.\nIn the introduction to Penguin's 1994 edition of the book, Susan Shillinglaw writes that Steinbeck, after dropping out of Stanford University, spent almost two years roaming California, finding work on ranches for Spreckels Sugar where he harvested wheat and sugar beets. Steinbeck told \"The New York Times\" in 1937:I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell. I worked in the same country that the story is laid in. The characters are composites to a certain extent. Lennie was a real person. He's in an insane asylum in California right now. I worked alongside him for many weeks. He didn't kill a girl. He killed a ranch foreman. Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach. I hate to tell you how many times. I saw him do it. We couldn't stop him until it was too late.\nReception.\nAttaining the greatest positive response of any of his works up to that time, Steinbeck's novella was chosen as a Book of the Month Club selection before it was published. Praise for the work came from many notable critics, including Maxine Garrard (\"Enquirer-Sun\"), Christopher Morley, and Harry Thornton Moore (\"New Republic\"). \"New York Times\" critic Ralph Thompson described the novella as a \"grand little book, for all its ultimate melodrama\". In the UK, it was listed at number 52 of the \"nation's best loved novels\" on the BBC's 2003 survey The Big Read.\nCensorship.\nThe novella has been banned from various US public and school libraries or curricula for allegedly \"promoting euthanasia\", \"condoning racial slurs\", being \"anti-business\", containing profanity, and generally containing \"vulgar\", \"offensive language\", and containing racial stereotypes, as well as the negative impact of these stereotypes on students. Many of the bans and restrictions have been lifted and it remains required reading in many other American, Australian, Irish, British, New Zealand and Canadian high schools.\nAs a result of being a frequent target of censors, \"Of Mice and Men\" appears on the American Library Association's list of the Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000\u20132009 (number five) and Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2010\u20132019 (number 28). \"Of Mice and Men\" has been proposed for censorship 54 times since it was published in 1936. However, scholars including Thomas Scarseth have fought to protect the book by arguing its literary value. According to Scarseth \"in true great literature the pain of Life is transmuted into the beauty of Art\".\nAdaptations.\nStage.\nAs a \"playable novel\", it was performed by the Theater Union of San Francisco as written. This version opened on May 21, 1937 \u2013 less than three months after the novel's publication \u2013 and ran for about two months.\nTo create a Broadway production, Steinbeck adapted and slightly revised his original text and this version, produced by Sam H. Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman, opened on November 23, 1937, in the Music Box Theatre on Broadway and ran for 207 performances. It starred Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as Lennie. The role of Crooks was performed by Leigh Whipper, the first African-American member of the Actors' Equity Association. (Whipper repeated this role in the 1939 film version.) The production was chosen as Best Play in 1938 by the New York Drama Critics' Circle.\nIn 1939 the production was moved to Los Angeles, still with Wallace Ford in the role of George, but with Lon Chaney, Jr., taking on the role of Lennie. Chaney's performance in the role resulted in his casting in the movie.\nIn 1958, a musical theater adaptation by Ira Bilowit (1925\u20132016) was produced Off-Broadway in New York City. The cast included several in-demand performers of their day, including Art Lund and Jo Sullivan, re-teamed after performing together in the hit musical \"The Most Happy Fella\", as well as Leo Penn. However, a newspaper strike negatively affected the production and it closed after six weeks. A revival of the work was mounted at the Western Stage in Salinas, California in 2019.\nThe play was revived in a 1974 Broadway production in the Brooks Atkinson Theatre starring Kevin Conway as George and James Earl Jones as Lennie. Noted stage actress Pamela Blair played Curley's Wife in this production.\nIn 1970 Carlisle Floyd wrote an opera based on this novella. One departure between Steinbeck's book and Floyd's opera is that the opera features The Ballad Singer, a character not found in the book.\nA new version of the play opened on Broadway at The Longacre Theater on March 19, 2014 for a limited 18-week engagement, starring James Franco, Chris O'Dowd, Leighton Meester and Jim Norton.\nA ballet adaptation was created by Cathy Marston with original music by Thomas Newman. It debuted on April 27, 2022 at the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago.\nFilm.\nThe first film adaptation was released in 1939, two years after the publication of the novella, and starred Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie, with Burgess Meredith as George, and was directed by Lewis Milestone. It was nominated for four Academy Awards.\nA TV version, produced by David Susskind in 1968, starred George Segal as George, Nicol Williamson as Lennie, Will Geer as Candy, Moses Gunn as Crooks, and Don Gordon and Joey Heatherton as Curley and his wife, respectively.\nIn 1981, a TV movie version was released, starring Randy Quaid as Lennie, and Robert Blake as George, and directed by Reza Badiyi.\nAnother theatrical film version was made in 1992, directed by Gary Sinise, who was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Sinise played George, and the role of Lennie was played by John Malkovich, both reprising their roles from the 1980 Steppenwolf Theatre Company stage production.\nThe 1992 Malayalam film \"Soorya Manasam\" directed by Viji Thampi is also based on the novel.\nRadio.\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was adapted by Donna Franceschild as a radio play directed by Kirsty Williams starring David Tennant and Liam Brennan broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 7 March 2010. Earlier BBC productions were aired in 1966 and 1992.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Burgess Meredith, Betty Field, and Lon Chaney Jr., and features Charles Bickford, Roman Bohnen, Bob Steele, and Noah Beery Jr. The film tells the story of two men, George and his intellectually disabled partner Lennie, trying to survive during the dustbowl of the 1930s and pursuing a dream of owning their own ranch instead of always working for others. Starring in the lead roles were relative Hollywood newcomer Burgess Meredith as George and veteran actor Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of famed silent film actor Lon Chaney) as Lennie. Chaney had appeared in more than 50 films by that point in his career, but \"Of Mice and Men\" was his first major role. Betty Field's role as Mae was her breakthrough role in film.\nThe film, produced by the Hal Roach Studios, was adapted by Eugene Solow and directed by Lewis Milestone. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The musical score was by American composer Aaron Copland. Released in 1939, it appeared in the 1980s and 1990s in revival theater houses, video and cable, and it earned a following of fans (both audience members and film critics) who praised the movie for its interpretation of the Steinbeck novella.\nPlot.\nThe film tells the story of two migrant field workers in California during the Great Depression, George Milton and the mentally-challenged Lennie Small, who hope to one day attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land.\nThey arrive at a ranch near Soledad and meet Candy, the aged, one-handed ranch-hand. After meeting with the ranch boss, Jackson, the pair are confronted by Curley, the violent son of the ranch owner. To make matters worse, Curley's seductive and conniving wife, Mae, flirts with the other ranch hands. George orders Lennie not to talk to, or even look at her, as he senses the troubles that Mae could bring to them.\nCandy offers to join with George and Lennie so they can buy the farm and the dream appears to move closer to reality. Curley appears and makes a scene in the bunkhouse as the workers mock him after he accused Slim of keeping company with his wife. Curley catches Lennie laughing, grabs him from his bunk, and starts punching him in the face. When George tells him to fight back, Lennie crushes Curley's hand. Slim gives Curley an ultimatum: if Curley tells his father, Slim will tell everyone what happened. Curley is told to say that he got his hand caught in a piece of machinery.\nDespite Slim's efforts, Mae discovers the truth. When Mae tries to be kind to Lennie, George tells her to return to the house. Mae refuses to do so, saying that she has the right to talk to and flirt with whomever she likes.\nThe next morning, Mae confronts Curley, calling him \"a punk with a crippled hand!\" Curley tells her that their marriage is over, and that she is going to be kicked off the ranch due to her carnal behavior with the ranch hands. Before she can leave, Mae enters the barn to pet a few of Slim's puppies, when she spots Lennie sobbing. Lennie says he killed his puppy when it tried to bite him. Mae explains to Lennie what she wanted to be before Curley shattered her dream. When Lennie tells Mae that he loves to stroke soft things, Mae allows him to stroke her hair. Mae starts to resist and scream when Lennie strokes her hair too hard. When Lennie tries to silence Mae, he accidentally kills her by breaking her neck.\nWhen Candy and George find Mae's body, they tell the others and a lynch mob gathers to kill Lennie. George finds Lennie and, wanting to spare Lennie a painful death, shoots him in the back of the head before the mob can find him.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReception.\nCritical response.\nWhen the film was first released, Frank S. Nugent, the film critic of \"The New York Times\", praised the film and the acting, writing \"...New York, unless we have miscalculated again, will endorse its film version, at the Roxy, as heartily as it has endorsed the film of the Joads. The pictures have little in common as narrative, but they have much in common as art; the same deft handling of their material, the same understanding of people, the same ability to focus interest sharply and reward it with honest craftsmanship and skill... No small share of that credit belongs to the men and the one young woman Hal Roach has recruited for his production. Miss Field has added stature to the role of the foreman's wife by relieving her of the play's box-office-conscious order that she behave like a hoyden.\"\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine also reviewed the film favorably, writing \"Under skillful directorial guidance of Lewis Milestone, the picture retains all of the forceful and poignant drama of John Steinbeck's original play and novel, in presenting the strange palship and eventual tragedy of the two California ranch itinerants. In transferring the story to the screen, the scripter Eugene Solow eliminated the strong language and forthright profanity. Despite this requirement for the Hays Code, Solow and Milestone retain all of the virility of the piece in its original form.\"\nThe film received positive reviews, earning a 100% score on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews. Review aggregator Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100 based on seven reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nAccolades.\nIt was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Sound Recording (Elmer A.

The screenplay by Dudley Nichols is an adaptation of \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox. The film follows an eclectic group of travelers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory.\nThe film has long been recognized as an important work transcending the Western genre, and is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry. Still, \"Stagecoach\" has not avoided controversy. Like most Westerns of the era, its depiction of Native Americans as mere savages has been criticized.&lt;ref name=\"Aleiss 2005 https://archive.org/details/makingwhitemansi00alei/page/60 60\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\"Stagecoach\" was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot in Monument Valley, on the Arizona\u2013Utah border in the American Southwest. Some scenes blended shots of Monument Valley with those filmed on the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, RKO Encino Ranch, and elsewhere, and as a result geographic incongruities appear.\nPlot.\nIn June 1880, stage driver Buck prepares a stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona Territory, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Among the passengers are Dallas, a prostitute driven out of town by the \"Law and Order League\"; the alcoholic doctor Josiah Boone; snobbish belle Lucy Mallory, who is travelling to join her cavalry officer husband; and diminutive whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock.\nMeanwhile, Henry the \"Ringo Kid\" has broken out of prison to avenge the murder of his father and brother by Luke Plummer, a dangerous gunslinger who is in Lordsburg with his two brothers. The Plummers also accused Ringo of killing their foreman, which led to Ringo's conviction. Marshal Curley Wilcox decides to ride shotgun on the stage and find Ringo. U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard announces that Geronimo and his Apache warriors are on the warpath, therefore Blanchard's troop will provide a temporary escort to Dry Fork station. Hatfield, a chivalrous gambler and former Confederate Army officer, offers Mallory his protection and climbs aboard. Ellsworth H. Gatewood, an arrogant banker, also boards.\nEn route, the stage encounters Ringo, stranded after his horse went lame. Though Curley and Ringo are friends, Curley takes Ringo into custody. When they reach Dry Fork, they learn the expected cavalry detachment has gone on to Apache Wells station. Most of the party votes to proceed. The group is taken aback when Ringo, unaware of her profession, bonds with Dallas as the journey progresses.\nAt Apache Wells, Mallory learns that her husband was wounded in battle with the Apaches and rushed to Lordsburg. She faints, and stunning the group, goes into labor. Doc Boone sobers up and delivers the baby with Dallas assisting. Later that night, Ringo asks Dallas to marry him and live on a ranch he owns across the border in Mexico. Afraid to reveal her past, she is evasive. The next morning, she accepts with Boone's encouragement, but is unwilling to leave Mallory and the newborn; instead, she encourages Ringo to escape, promising to meet him in Mexico later. Before Ringo can leave, he sees smoke signals heralding nearby Apache and returns to custody.\nThe stage reaches a ferry crossing, which the Apaches have murderously sacked. Curley uncuffs Ringo to help lash logs to the stagecoach and float it across the river. The Apache eventually attack and a long chase ensues, during which Buck and Peacock are wounded. Down to his last bullet, Hatfield prepares to humanely dispatch Mallory when he is mortally wounded. The stage is then rescued by the 6th Cavalry.\nAt Lordsburg, Gatewood is arrested for attempting to abscond with his bank's funds. Mallory learns that her wounded husband will fully recover; she thanks Dallas, who gives Mallory her shawl. Peacock invites Dallas to visit his home in Kansas City, Kansas. Ringo escorts Dallas to her destination in a seedy part of town and finally learns who she is, but he reiterates his desire to marry her.\nLuke Plummer, who is playing poker in one of the saloons, hears of Ringo's arrival and summons his brothers to join him in the showdown. Ringo guns down the Plummers in a shootout, then surrenders to Curley, expecting to go back to prison. As Ringo takes his seat on a buckboard, Curley invites Dallas to ride with them to the edge of town. But when she gets aboard, Curley and Boone stampede the horses, happily letting the couple speed off together towards Ringo's ranch.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Claire Trevor as Dallas\nUncredited:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Chief John Big Tree as Apache scout\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe screenplay is an adaptation by Dudley Nichols of \"The Stage to Lordsburg,\" a short story by Ernest Haycox. The film rights to the work were bought by John Ford soon after it was published in \"Collier's\" magazine on April 10, 1937. According to Thomas Schatz, Ford claimed that his inspiration in expanding \"Stagecoach\" beyond the bare-bones plot created by Haycox was his familiarity with another short story, \"Boule de Suif\" by Guy de Maupassant, although Schatz believes \"this scarcely holds up to scrutiny\". Ford's statement also seems to be the basis for the claim that Haycox himself relied upon Guy de Maupassant's story. However, according to a Haycox biographer, there is no direct evidence of Haycox being familiar with Maupassant's tale, especially as he was documented as going out of his way to avoid reading the work of others that might unconsciously influence his writing, and he focused his personal reading in the area of history.\nJohn Ford admitted that he took inspiration from a 1907 painting by Frederic Remington named \"Downing the Nigh Leader\" for the chase scene.\nBefore production, Ford shopped the project around to several Hollywood studios, all of which turned him down because big budget Westerns had been out of vogue since the silents, and because Ford insisted on using then-B-movie actor John Wayne in the key role in the film. Independent producer David O. Selznick finally agreed to produce it, but was frustrated by Ford's indecision about when shooting would begin, and had his own doubts over the casting. Ford withdrew the film from Selznick's company and approached independent producer Walter Wanger about the project. Wanger had the same reservations about producing an \"A\" Western and even more about one starring John Wayne. Ford had not directed a Western since the silent days. Wanger said he would not risk his money unless Ford replaced John Wayne with Gary Cooper and brought in Marlene Dietrich to play Dallas.\nFord refused to budge; it would be Wayne or no one. Eventually the pair compromised, with Wanger putting up $250,000, a little more than half of what Ford had been seeking, and Ford would give top billing to Claire Trevor, better known than John Wayne at the time.\nFilming.\nThe members of the production crew were billeted in Kayenta, in Northeastern Arizona, in an old CCC camp. Conditions were spartan, production hours long, and weather conditions at the elevation were extreme, with constant strong winds and low temperatures. Nonetheless, director John Ford was satisfied with the crew's location work, which took place near Goulding's Trading Post on the Utah border, about 25 miles from Kayenta. Additional scenes were filmed in Monument Valley locations, as well as the Iverson Movie Ranch and the RKO Encino Ranch. \"Stagecoach\" was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using Monument Valley as a location, many of which also starred John Wayne. Anatopic incongruencies of landscape and vegetation are thus evident throughout the film, up to the closing scene of Ringo and Dallas departing Lordsburg, in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, by way of the unmistakable topography of Monument Valley's Colorado Plateau location.\nReception.\nThe film was released on March 2, 1939, and met with immediate critical and trade paper praise. The picture cemented John Wayne's standing as an A-list leading man, and made a profit of $297,690. Cast member Louise Platt, in a letter recounting the experience of the film's production, quoted Ford on saying of Wayne's future in film: \"He'll be the biggest star ever because he is the perfect 'everyman'\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Typifying the best that the Western genre has to offer, Stagecoach is a rip-roaring adventure given dramatic heft by John Ford's dynamic direction and John Wayne's mesmerizing star turn.\"\n\"Stagecoach\" has been lauded as one of the most influential films ever made. Orson Welles argued that it was a perfect textbook of filmmaking and claimed to have watched it more than 40 times in preparation for the making of \"Citizen Kane\". In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry; it was also included in the Vatican's list of films that year under the category of \"Art\".\nThe film has been recognized as transcending the Western genre. Robert B. Pippin has observed that both the collection of characters and their journey \"are archetypal rather than merely individual\" and that the film is a \"mythic representation of the American aspiration toward a form of politically meaningful equality.\" Nevertheless, its depiction of Native Americans is not above criticism. Writing in 2011, Roger Ebert noted, \"The film's attitudes toward Native Americans are unenlightened. The Apaches are seen simply as murderous savages; there is no suggestion the white men have invaded their land.\"\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"Stagecoach\" as having the best stunts of 1939.\nRe-releases and restoration.\nThe film was originally released through United Artists, but under the terms of its seven-year-rights rule, the company surrendered distribution rights to producer Walter Wanger in 1946. Numerous companies have held the rights to the picture in the years since. The film's copyright (originally by Walter Wanger Productions) was renewed by 20th Century Fox, which produced a later 1966 remake of \"Stagecoach\". The rights to the original 1939 film were subsequently acquired by Time-Life Films during the 1970s. The copyright has since been reassigned to Wanger Productions through the late producer's family under the Caidin Trust/Caidin Film Company, the ancillary rights holder. However, distribution rights are now held by Shout! Factory, which in 2014 acquired Jumer Productions/Westchester Films (which in turn had bought the Caidin Film holdings after the folding of former distributor Castle Hill Productions). Warner Bros. Pictures handles sales and additional distribution.\nThe original negative of \"Stagecoach\" was either lost or destroyed. Wayne had one unscreened positive print that director Peter Bogdanovich noticed in Wayne's garage while visiting. In 1970, Wayne allowed it to be used to produce a new negative, often seen at film festivals. UCLA fully restored the film in 1996 from surviving elements and premiered it on cable's American Movie Classics network. The previous DVD releases by Warner Home Video did not contain the restored print but rather a video print held in the Castle Hill/Caidin Trust library. A digitally restored Blu-ray/DVD version was released in May 2010 via The Criterion Collection.\nLone Ranger radio play.\nThe theme of the movie has been reproduced as a Lone Ranger radio episode \"The Last Coach West\", which played August 22, 1945. Most main characters in the movie had a counter-part in the radio play.\nThe plot of the radio play closely paralleled that of the movie in spite of the character changes, with exception of the Lone Ranger and Tonto heroically saving the stagecoach occupants from Geronimo's warriors.\nThe radio play run time was only about 22 minutes, less than one quarter of the movie's 96.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nStreaming"}

He portrayed the suspected murderer in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller \"Rear Window\" (1954), and he also had a role in the 1956 film \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\", which he reprised in the 1985 film \"Godzilla 1985\". He won Emmy Awards for acting in 1959 and 1961 for the role of Perry Mason, which he played for nine seasons (1957\u20131966) and reprised in a series of 26 \"Perry Mason\" TV movies (1985\u20131993). His second TV series, \"Ironside,\" earned him six Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations.\nBurr died due to liver cancer in 1993, and his personal life came into question, as many details of his biography appeared to be unverifiable. He was ranked number 44 of the 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time by \"TV Guide\" magazine in 1996.\nEarly life.\nRaymond William Stacy Burr was born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia. His father, William Johnston Burr (1889\u20131985), was a hardware salesman; his mother, Minerva Annette (n\u00e9e Smith, 1892\u20131974), was a pianist and music teacher.\nWhen Burr was six, his parents divorced. He moved to Vallejo, California, with his mother and younger siblings Geraldine and James, while his father remained in New Westminster. Burr briefly attended San Rafael Military Academy in San Rafael, California, and graduated from Berkeley High School.\nIn 1986, he told journalist Jane Ardmore that, when he was 12 years old, his mother sent him to New Mexico for a year to work as a ranch hand. (As with many of Burr's self-reported autobiographical details about his early life, this is unverified and open to question). According to Burr's story, he was already his full adult height and rather large and \"had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn't realize how young Raymond was, and they let him tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle.\" In the same article, Burr also stated he developed a passion for growing things and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for a year in his teens. He did some acting in his teen years, making his stage debut at age 12 in a Vancouver stock company. The experiences Burr described when he was the age of 12 (working in radio in San Francisco, spending a year in New Mexico, appearing in Vancouver theatre, working for the Civilian Conservation Corps) are sometimes mutually contradictory; this would be a pattern that would recur in Burr's autobiographical reminiscences about his pre-Perry Mason personal life. \nActing career.\nTheatre.\nBurr grew up during the Great Depression and hoped to study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, but he was unable to afford the tuition. By his own account, in 1934 he joined a repertory theatre company in Toronto that toured throughout Canada, then joined another company that toured India, Australia, and England. He briefly attended Long Beach Junior College and taught for a semester at San Jose Junior College, working nights as a radio actor and singer. Burr began his association with the Pasadena Playhouse in 1937.\nBurr moved to New York in 1940 and made his first Broadway appearance in \"Crazy With the Heat\", a two-act musical revue produced by Kurt Kasznar. Despite the veteran cast of stars Willie Howard, Luella Gear, and Gracie Barrie, the show folded after three months. Burr's first starring role on the stage came in November 1942 when he was an emergency replacement in a Pasadena Playhouse production of \"Quiet Wedding\". He became a member of the Pasadena Playhouse drama faculty for 18 months, and he performed in some 30 plays over the years. He returned to Broadway for Patrick Hamilton's \"The Duke in Darkness\" (1944), a psychological drama set during the French Wars of Religion. His performance as the loyal friend of the imprisoned protagonist led to a contract with RKO Radio Pictures. In 1944, he performed in multiple plays during his summer residency at Elitch Gardens Theater in Denver Colorado.\nFilm.\nBurr appeared in more than 50 feature films between 1946 and 1957, creating an array of villains that established him as an icon of film noir. Film historian Alain Silver concluded that Burr's most significant work in the genre is in ten films: \"Desperate\" (1947), \"Sleep, My Love\" (1948), \"Raw Deal\" (1948), \"Pitfall\" (1948), \"Abandoned\" (1949), \"Red Light\" (1949), \"M\" (1951), \"His Kind of Woman\" (1951), \"The Blue Gardenia\" (1953), and \"Crime of Passion\" (1957). Silver described Burr's private detective in \"Pitfall\" as \"both reprehensible and pathetic,\" a characterization also cited by film historian Richard Schickel as a prototype of film noir, in contrast with the appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous. \"He tried to make you see the psychosis below the surface, even when the parts weren't huge,\" said film historian James Ursini. \"He was able to bring such complexity and different levels to those characters, and create sympathy for his characters even though they were doing reprehensible things.\"\nOther titles in Burr's film noir legacy include \"Walk a Crooked Mile\" (1948), \"Borderline\" (1950), \"Unmasked\" (1950), \"The Whip Hand\" (1951), \"FBI Girl\" (1951), \"Meet Danny Wilson\" (1952), \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"They Were So Young\" (1954), \"A Cry in the Night\" (1956), and \"Affair in Havana\" (1957). His villains were also seen in Westerns, period dramas, horror films, and adventure films.\n\"I was just a fat heavy,\" Burr told journalist James Bawden. \"I split the heavy parts with Bill Conrad. We were both in our twenties playing much older men. I never got the girl but I once got the gorilla in a 3-D picture called \"Gorilla at Large\". I menaced Claudette Colbert, Lizabeth Scott, Paulette Goddard, Anne Baxter, Barbara Stanwyck. Those girls would take one look at me and scream and can you blame them? I was drowned, beaten, stabbed and all for my art. But I knew I was horribly overweight. I lacked any kind of self esteem. At 25 I was playing the fathers of people older than me.\"\nBurr's occasional roles on the right side of the law include the aggressive prosecutor in \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951). His courtroom performance in that film made an impression on Gail Patrick and her husband Cornwell Jackson, who had Burr in mind when they began casting the role of Los Angeles district attorney Hamilton Burger in the CBS-TV series \"Perry Mason\".\nRadio.\nBy the age of 12, Burr was appearing in national radio dramas broadcasting in nearby San Francisco.\nAs a young man Burr weighed more than , which limited his on-screen roles. \"But in radio this presented no problems, given the magnificent quality of his voice\", reported \"The Globe and Mail\". \"He played romantic leads and menacing villains with equal authority, and he earned a steady and comfortable income.\"\nWorking steadily in radio since the 1940s, often uncredited, Burr was a leading player on the West Coast. He had a regular role in Jack Webb's first radio show, \"Pat Novak for Hire\" (1949), and in \"Dragnet\" (1949\u201350) he played Joe Friday's boss, Ed Backstrand, chief of detectives. Burr worked on other Los Angeles-based series including \"Suspense\", \"Screen Directors Playhouse\", \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", \"Family Theater\", \"Hallmark Playhouse\" and \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\". He performed in five episodes of the experimental dramatic radio anthology series \"CBS Radio Workshop\", and had what is arguably his best radio role in \"The Silent Witness\" (1957), in which his is the only voice.\nFrom March 1951 through June 1952 Burr used the name of Ray Hartman approximately 30 times when appearing on radio, mostly on \"Dangerous Assignment\", \"The Lineup\" and \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\". This was verified by perusing the scripts for both series.\nIn 1956, Burr was the star of CBS Radio's \"Fort Laramie\", an adult Western drama produced, written and directed by the creators of \"Gunsmoke\". He played the role of Lee Quince, captain of the cavalry, in the series set at a post-Civil War military post where disease, boredom, the elements and the uncharted terrain were the greatest enemies of \"ordinary men who lived in extraordinary times\". The half-hour transcribed program aired Sundays at 5:30\u00a0pm. ET January 22 \u2013 October 28, 1956. Burr told columnist Sheilah Graham that he had received 1,500 fan letters after the first broadcasts, and he continued to receive letters praising the show's authenticity and presentation of human dignity.\nIn August 1956, CBS announced that Burr would star in the television series \"Perry Mason\". Although the network wanted Burr to continue work on \"Fort Laramie\" as well, the TV series required an extraordinary commitment and the radio show ended.\nKnown for his loyalty and consciousness of history, Burr went out of his way to employ his radio colleagues in his television programs. Some 180 radio celebrities appeared on \"Perry Mason\" during the first season alone.\nTelevision.\nBurr emerged as a prolific television character actor in the 1950s. He made his television debut in 1951, appearing in episodes of \"Stars Over Hollywood\", \"The Bigelow Theatre\", \"Family Theater\" and the debut episode of \"Dragnet\". He went on to appear in such programs as \"Gruen Playhouse\", \"Four Star Playhouse\", \"Ford Theatre\", \"Lux Video Theatre\", \"Mr. and Mrs. North\", \"Schlitz Playhouse of Stars\" and \"Playhouse 90\".\n\"Perry Mason\".\nIn 1956, Burr auditioned for \"Perry Mason\", a new CBS-TV courtroom drama based on the highly successful novels by Erle Stanley Gardner. Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. had already been tentatively cast as Perry Mason. Burr told associate producer Sam White, \"If you don't like me as Perry Mason, then I'll go along and play the part of the district attorney, Hamilton Burger.\" Executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson had been impressed with Burr's courtroom performance in \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951), and she told Burr that he was perfect for Perry Mason but at least overweight. He went on a crash diet over the following month; he then tested as Perry Mason and was cast in the role. While Burr's test was running, Gardner reportedly stood up, pointed at the screen, and said, \"That's Perry Mason.\" William Hopper also auditioned as Mason, but he was cast instead as private detective Paul Drake. The series also starred Barbara Hale as Della Street, Mason's secretary, William Talman as Hamilton Burger, the district attorney who loses nearly every case to Mason, and Ray Collins as homicide detective Lieutenant Arthur Tragg.\nThe series ran from 1957 to 1966 and made Burr a star. In the early 1960s, the show had 30 million viewers every Saturday night and Burr received 3,000 fan letters a week. Burr received three consecutive Emmy Award nominations and won the award in 1959 and 1961 for his performance as Perry Mason. The series has been rerun in syndication ever since, and was released on DVD between 2006 and 2013. Burr's character is often said never to have lost a case, although he did lose two murder cases off-screen in early episodes of the series.\n\"Ironside\".\nBurr moved from CBS to Universal Studios, where he played the title role in the television drama \"Ironside\", which ran on NBC from 1967 to 1975. In the pilot episode, San Francisco Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside is paralyzed by a sniper during an attempt on his life and, after his recovery, uses a wheelchair for mobility, in the first crime drama show to star a policeman with a disability. The show earned Burr six Emmy nominations\u2014one for the pilot and five for his work in the series\u2014and two Golden Globe nominations.\nOther series.\nAfter \"Ironside\" went off the air, NBC failed in two attempts to launch Burr as the star of a new series. In a two-hour television movie format, \"Mallory: Circumstantial Evidence\" aired in February 1976 with Burr again in the role of the lawyer who outwits the district attorney. Despite good reviews for Burr, the critical reception was poor, and NBC decided against developing it into a series.\nIn 1977, Burr starred in the short-lived TV series \"\" as R.B. Kingston, a publishing magnate similar to William Randolph Hearst, owner of numerous newspapers and TV stations, who, in his spare time, solved crimes along with a group of employees. It was a critical failure that was scheduled opposite the extraordinarily popular \"Charlie's Angels\". It was cancelled after 13 weeks.\nBurr took on a shorter project next, playing an underworld boss in a six-hour miniseries, \"79 Park Avenue\".\nOne last attempt to launch a series followed on CBS. The two-hour premiere of \"The Jordan Chance\" aroused little interest.\nOn January 20, 1987, Burr hosted the television special that later served as the pilot for the long-running series \"Unsolved Mysteries\".\nTelevision films.\nIn 1985, Burr was approached by producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman to star in a made-for-TV movie, \"Perry Mason Returns\". The same week, Burr recalled, he was asked to reprise the role he played in \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" (1956), in a low-budget film that would be titled \"Godzilla 1985\".\n\"When they asked me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and everybody thought I was out of my mind,\" Burr told Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\". \"But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them.\" Although Burr is best remembered for his role as Perry Mason, a devoted following continues to appreciate him as the actor that brought the Godzilla series to America.\nHe agreed to appear in the Mason movie if Barbara Hale returned to reprise her role as Della Street. Hale agreed, and when \"Perry Mason Returns\" aired in December 1985, her character became the defendant. The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale's real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake Jr. The movie was so successful that Burr made a total of 26 Perry Mason television movies before his death. Many were filmed in and around Denver, Colorado.\nAfter several of the TV movies, Burr's age and health issues forced him to use a cane onscreen, which was jokingly explained as a \"skiing accident.\" By 1993, when Burr signed with NBC for another season of Mason films, he was using a wheelchair full-time because of his failing health. In his final Perry Mason movie, \"The Case of the Killer Kiss\", he was shown either sitting or standing while leaning on a table, but only once standing unsupported for a few seconds. Twelve more Mason movies were scheduled before Burr's death, including one scheduled to film the month he died.\nAs he had with the \"Perry Mason\" TV movies, Burr decided to do an \"Ironside\" reunion movie. \"The Return of Ironside\" aired in May 1993, reuniting the entire original cast of the 1967\u201375 series. Like many of the Mason movies, it was set and filmed in Denver.\nPersonal life.\nPhysical characteristics.\nBurr said that he weighed 12.75 pounds (5.8\u00a0kg) at birth, and was chubby throughout his childhood. \"When you're a little fat boy in public school, or any kind of school, you're just persecuted something awful,\" he said. His weight was always an issue for him in getting roles, and it became a public relations problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his \"Tonight Show\" monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told \"Us Weekly\" years later: \"I have been asked a number of times to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he does about everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC.\"\nFamily life.\nBurr married actress Isabella Ward (1919\u20132004) on January 10, 1948. They met in 1943 while she was a student at the Pasadena Playhouse where Burr was teaching. They met again in 1947 when she was in California with a theater company. They were married shortly before Burr began work on the 1948 film noir \"Pitfall\". In May 1948, they appeared on stage together in a Pasadena Playhouse production based on the life of Paul Gauguin. They lived in the basement apartment of a large house in Hollywood that Burr shared with his mother and grandparents. The marriage ended within months, and Ward returned to her native Delaware. They divorced in 1952, and neither remarried.\nIn 1960, Burr met actor Robert Benevides on the set of \"Perry Mason\". Benevides gave up acting in 1963, and became a production consultant for 21 of the \"Perry Mason\" TV movies. They owned and operated an orchid business and then a vineyard in California's Dry Creek Valley. They were domestic partners until Burr's death in 1993. Burr bequeathed his entire estate to Benevides, and Benevides renamed the Dry Creek property Raymond Burr Vineyards (reportedly against Burr's wishes) and managed it as a commercial enterprise. In 2017, the property was sold.\nAlthough Burr had not revealed that he was homosexual during his lifetime, it was reported in the press upon his death.\nBiographical contradictions.\nAt various times in his career, Burr and his managers and publicists offered spurious or unverifiable biographical details to the press and public. Burr's obituary in \"The New York Times\" states that he entered the U.S. Navy in 1944, after \"The Duke in Darkness\", and left in 1946, weighing almost . Although Burr may have served in the Coast Guard, reports of his service in the U.S. Navy are false, as apparently are his statements that he sustained battle injuries at Okinawa.\nOther false biographical details include years of college education at a variety of institutions, being widowed twice, a son who died young, world travel, and success in high school athletics. Most of these claims were apparently accepted as fact by the press during Burr's lifetime, up until his death and by his first biographer, Ona Hill.\nBurr reportedly was married at the beginning of World War II to an actress named Annette Sutherland\u2014killed, Burr said, in the same 1943 plane crash that claimed the life of actor Leslie Howard. However, multiple sources have reported that no one by that name appears on any of the published passenger manifests from the flight. A son supposedly born during this marriage, Michael Evan, was said to have died of leukemia in 1953 at the age of ten. Another marriage purportedly took place in the early 1950s to a Laura Andrina Morgan\u2014who died of cancer, Burr said, in 1955. Yet no evidence exists of either marriage, nor of a son's birth, other than Burr's own claims. As late as 1991, Burr stood by the account of this son's life and death. He told \"Parade\" that when he realized Michael was dying, he took him on a one-year tour of the United States. \"Before my boy left, before his time was gone,\" he said, \"I wanted him to see the beauty of his country and its people.\" After Burr's death, his publicist confirmed that Burr worked steadily in Hollywood throughout 1952, the year that he was supposedly touring the country with his son.\nIn the late 1950s, Burr was rumored to be romantically involved with Natalie Wood. Wood's agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers, and so the men she dated could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates helped to disguise Wood's relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. Burr reportedly resented Warner Bros.' decision to promote her attachment to another gay actor, Tab Hunter, rather than him. Robert Benevides later said, \"He was a little bitter about it. He was really in love with her, I guess.\"\nLater accounts of Burr's life say that he hid his homosexuality to protect his career. \"That was a time in Hollywood history when homosexuality was not countenanced\", Associated Press reporter Bob Thomas recalled in a 2000 episode of \"Biography\". \"Ray was not a romantic star by any means, but he was a very popular figure ... If it was revealed at that time in Hollywood history it would have been very difficult for him to continue.\"\nArthur Marks, a producer of \"Perry Mason\", recalled Burr's talk of wives and children: \"I know he was just putting on a show. ... That was my gut feeling. I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were a bit of a cover.\" Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason TV films, said in 2006, \"I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I did know that I had trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past ... tended to grow as time went by.\"\nHobbies and businesses.\nBurr had many hobbies over the course of his life: cultivating orchids and collecting wine, art, stamps, and seashells. He was very fond of cooking. He was interested in flying, sailing, and fishing. According to \"A&amp;E Biography\", Burr was an avid reader with a retentive memory. He was also among the earliest importers and breeders of Portuguese water dogs in the United States.\nBurr developed his interest in cultivating and hybridizing orchids into a business with Benevides. Over 20 years, their company, Sea God Nurseries, had nurseries in Fiji, Hawaii, the Azores, and California, and was responsible for adding more than 1,500 new orchids to the worldwide catalog. Burr named one of them the \"Barbara Hale Orchid\" after his \"Perry Mason\" costar. Burr and Benevides cultivated Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and grapes for Port wine, as well as orchids, at Burr's farm/estate in Sonoma County, California.\nIn 1965, Burr purchased Naitauba, a island in Fiji, rich in seashells. There, he and Benevides oversaw the raising of copra (coconut meat) and cattle, as well as orchids. Burr planned to retire there permanently. However, medical problems made that impossible and he sold the property in 1983.\nPhilanthropy.\nBurr was a well-known philanthropist. He gave enormous sums of money, including his salaries from the Perry Mason movies, to charity. He was also known for sharing his wealth with friends. He sponsored 26 foster children through the Foster Parents' Plan or Save the Children, many with the greatest medical needs. He gave money and some of his \"Perry Mason\" scripts to the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.\nBurr was an early supporter of the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, raising funds and chairing its first capital campaign. He also donated to the museum a large collection of Fijian cowries and cones from his island in Fiji.\nIn 1993, Sonoma State University awarded Burr an honorary doctorate. He supported medical and educational institutions in Denver, and in 1993, the University of Colorado awarded him an honorary doctorate for his acting work. Burr also founded and financed the American Fijian Foundation that funded academic research, including efforts to develop a dictionary of the language.\nBurr made repeated trips on behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffin Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, \"My only position on the war is that I wish it were over.\" In October 1967, NBC aired \"Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam\", a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. \"The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing\", wrote the \"Chicago Tribune\"; the \"Los Angeles Times\" said Burr's questions were \"intelligent and elicited some interesting replies\".\nBurr had a reputation in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, Ray Collins, who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original \"Perry Mason\" series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines he was supposed to speak, stated, \"There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that's no bull. If there's anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and does what he can to help. He's a great star\u2014in the old tradition.\"\nIllness and death.\nDuring the filming of his last \"Perry Mason\" movie in the spring of 1993, Burr fell ill. A Viacom spokesman told the media that the illness might be related to the renal cell carcinoma (malignant kidney tumor) that had been removed from Burr that February. It was determined that the cancer had spread to his liver and was at that point inoperable. Burr threw several \"goodbye parties\" before his death on September 12, 1993, at his Sonoma County ranch near Healdsburg. He was 76 years old.\nThe day after Burr's death, American Bar Association President R. William Ide III released a statement: \"Raymond Burr's portrayals of Perry Mason represented lawyers in a professional and dignified manner. ... Mr. Burr strove for such authenticity in his courtroom characterizations that we regard his passing as though we lost one of our own.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that Perry Mason had been named second\u2014after F. Lee Bailey, and before Abraham Lincoln, Thurgood Marshall, Janet Reno, Ben Matlock and Hillary Clinton\u2014in a 1993 \"National Law Journal\" poll that asked Americans to name the attorney, fictional or not, they most admired.\nBurr was interred with his parents and sister Geraldine (1920-2001) at Fraser Cemetery, New Westminster, British Columbia. On October 1, 1993, about 600 family members and friends paid tribute to Burr at a private memorial service at the Pasadena Playhouse.\nBurr bequeathed his estate to Robert Benevides, and excluded all relatives, including a sister, nieces, and nephews. His will was challenged, without success, by the two children of his late brother, James E. Burr. Benevides' attorney said that tabloid reports of an estate worth $32\u00a0million were an overestimate.\nAccolades.\nFor his work in the TV series \"Perry Mason\", Burr received the Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series at the 11th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1959. Nominated again in 1960, he received his second Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Series (Lead) at the 13th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1961. Burr was named Favorite Male Performer, for \"Perry Mason\", in \"TV Guide\" magazine's inaugural \"TV Guide\" Award readers poll in 1960. He also received the second annual award in 1961.\nIn 1960, Burr was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6656 Hollywood Boulevard. Burr received six Emmy nominations (1968\u201372) for his work in the TV series \"Ironside\". He was nominated twice, in 1969 and 1972, for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama. A benefactor of legal education, Burr was principal speaker at the founders' banquet of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan, in June 1973. The Raymond Burr Award for Excellence in Criminal Law was established in his honor.\nBurr was ranked No. 44 on \"TV Guide\"'s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time in 1996. Completed in 1996, a circular garden at the entrance to the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, honored Burr for his role in establishing the museum. Burr was a trustee and an early supporter who chaired the museum's first capital campaign, and made direct contributions from his own shell collection. A display about Burr as an actor, benefactor and collector opened in the museum's Great Hall of Shells in 2012.\nFrom 2000 to 2006, the Raymond Burr Performing Arts Society leased the historic Columbia Theatre from the city of New Westminster, and renamed it the Raymond Burr Performing Arts Centre. Although the nonprofit organization hoped to raise funds to renovate and expand the venue, its contract was not renewed. The group was a failed bidder when the theater was sold in 2011.\nIn 2008, Canada Post issued a postage stamp in its \"Canadians in Hollywood\" series featuring Burr. Burr received the 2009 Canadian Legends Award and a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009. A 2014 article in \"The Atlantic\" that examined how Netflix categorized nearly 77,000 different personalized genres found that Burr was rated as the favorite actor by Netflix users, with the greatest number of dedicated microgenres.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62124", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62124", "title": "Perry Mason", "text": "Fictional attorney\nPerry Mason is a fictional American criminal defense lawyer who is the main character in works of detective fiction written by Erle Stanley Gardner. Perry Mason features in 82 novels and four short stories, all of which involve a client being charged with murder, usually involving a preliminary hearing or jury trial. Typically, Mason establishes his client's innocence by finding the real murderer. The character was inspired by famed Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Earl Rogers.\nThe character of Perry Mason was adapted for motion pictures and a long-running radio series. These were followed by the best known adaptation, the CBS television series \"Perry Mason\" (1957\u20131966) starring Raymond Burr. A second television series, \"The New Perry Mason\" starring Monte Markham, ran from 1973 to 1974; and 30 \"Perry Mason\" television films ran from 1985 to 1995, with Burr reprising the role of Mason in 26 of them up to his death in 1993. A third television series, HBO's \"Perry Mason\" starring Matthew Rhys, aired from 2020 to 2023.\nThe Perry Mason series ranks third in the top ten best selling book series. In 2015, the American Bar Association's publishing imprint, Ankerwycke, began reissuing Gardner's Perry Mason books, which had been out of print in the United States.\nCharacter.\nAs a child, Gardner read the magazine \"Youth's Companion\", published by the Perry Mason Company - a name Gardner later borrowed for his fictional attorney. Gardner provided more information about Mason's character in earlier novels while knowledge of his character is largely taken for granted in the later works, the television series and movies. In the first novel (\"The Case of the Velvet Claws\", 1933), Mason describes himself in the following way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You'll find that I'm a lawyer who has specialized in trial work, and in a lot of criminal work...I'm a specialist on getting people out of trouble. They come to me when they're in all sorts of trouble, and I work them out... If you look me up through some family lawyer or some corporation lawyer, he'll probably tell you that I'm a shyster. If you look me up through some chap in the District Attorney's office, he'll tell you that I'm a dangerous antagonist but he doesn't know very much about me.\"\nGardner depicts Mason as a relentless attorney attracted to complex, unconventional cases that appear unwinnable. He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In \"The Case of the Caretaker's Cat\" (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: \"You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth.\" In \"The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink\" (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: \"Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests.\"\nAnother frequent antagonist, Lieutenant Arthur Tragg of the homicide squad, has a discussion with Mason about his approach to the law. Mason is recovering from having been poisoned, and Tragg is investigating. In \"The Case of the Drowsy Mosquito\" (1943) he says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"How does it feel to be the victim for once? \u2026 You've been sticking up for criminals and now you can see the other side of the picture.\"\"Not 'sticking up for criminals,'\" (Mason) protested indignantly. \"I have \"never\" stuck up for any criminal. I have merely asked for the orderly administration of an impartial justice... Due legal process is my own safeguard against being convicted unjustly. To my mind, that's government. That's law and order.\"\nOther than what is learned of his character from the novels themselves, very little is known about Perry Mason. His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of \"The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece\" (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake. Della Street is Mason's only evident (though not sharply delineated) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver as shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there is so little physical description of him that the reader is not even sure what he looks like.\nThe 1930s films were not closely based on the character of Perry Mason as revealed in the books, and contain plot and character developments which are not accepted as canonical in the remainder of the books and adaptations. For instance, in one film, Mason marries his longtime secretary Della Street, while Paul Drake turns into comic sidekick Spudsy Drake.\nLikewise the TV series diverges at times significantly from the books, which was a practical necessity considering that there were only about 80 Perry Mason novels written altogether and over 270 episodes of the TV series. Thus there was a need for a great deal of invented material, background, plots, and characters \u2013 none of which material Gardner incorporated into his ongoing series of Perry Mason novels. In fact, Gardner would write over 30 more Perry Mason novels from between 1957 when the TV series began up until his death in 1970.\nThe television series contains some hints of what Mason did in the past. In \"The Case of the Misguided Missile\", he says that he served in the Navy on Ulithi atoll during World War II. In \"The Case of the Travelling Treasure\", he says that he served aboard a minesweeper. In \"The Case of the Bluffing Blast\", he states that he was \"on the deck of a destroyer in the Pacific, the engine room blew up.\"\nThe HBO series presents him as being a private detective, becoming a lawyer by necessity in order to salvage the case he's working on. In this series, he lives on what remains of a dairy farm which has been in his family for at least two prior generations. He is also a veteran of World War I, having been discharged with a \"blue ticket\" (i.e. with negative connotations), probably because he mercy-killed some comrades who were about to die from a poison gas attack which they were too severely wounded to escape. Episode 1 shows Mason with a tattoo of the Cross of Lorraine with the number 79 and the inscription \"infantry\", indicating he was an infantryman in the 79th Division whose emblem of the cross signifies its service in France during the war. Mason is also an alcoholic, divorced father who is struggling to maintain ownership of his deceased parents' farm.\nNovels.\nJulian Symons noted that Erle Stanley Gardner \"had spent more than twenty years practicing law in California, and the knowledge he gained was put to good use in the Perry Mason stories, which hinge on points of law, forensic medicine or science as clever as a watch mechanism \u2026 and also the total lack of characterization\".\nWhile the Mason novels were largely a form of pulp fiction of the sort that began Gardner's writing career, they are unusual in that the whodunit mysteries usually involved two solutions: a very plausible but inaccurate one in which the authorities believed (wherein Mason's client was guilty) and an entirely alternative (and true) explanation, wherein Mason's client was innocent and another party had committed the crime. Almost always, the second half of each novel is devoted to a courtroom scene, during which Mason arrives at the alternative explanation and proves it to the satisfaction of the court. \"It is perfectly true that our author works to formula; in one sense, the plot never varies,\" wrote Jacques Barzun. \"Having said this, one must add that the variety of persons and circumstances and the ingenuity in contriving the details that Gardner dreamed up in his dozens of cases are astonishing and entrancing.\"\nA hallmark of the stories is that as soon as Perry Mason (with the assistance of his secretary Della Street and private investigator Paul Drake) accepts a case, he will juggle the evidence using unusual (even bizarre) tactics to mislead the police \u2013 but (except for the very earliest novels) always in an ethical fashion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's my contention, Della, that an attorney doesn't have to sit back and wait until a witness gets on the stand and then test his recollection simply by asking him questions. If facts can be shuffled in such a way that it will confuse a witness who isn't absolutely certain of his story, and if the attorney doesn't suppress, conceal, or distort any of the actual evidence, I claim the attorney is within his rights.\u2014\u200a\nThe influence of the television series has given the general public the impression that Mason is highly ethical. In the earliest novels, however, Mason was not above skulduggery to win a case. In \"The Case of the Counterfeit Eye\" (1935) he breaks the law several times, including manufacturing false evidence (glass eyes). Mason manipulates evidence and witnesses, resulting in the acquittal of the murderer in \"The Case of the Howling Dog\" (1934). \"The Case of the Curious Bride\" (1934) is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2026 a good Perry Mason except for one great flaw, which the author would scarcely have been guilty of later on: he tampers with the evidence, by having a friend move into an apartment and testify to the state of the doorbells. \u2026 One is left with the uncomfortable idea that maybe the murder did not take place as Mason reconstructs it.\u2014\u200a\nIn the later novels, the only crime which he can be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And even then, he would expect to put up a strong and effective defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason has done something illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In \"The Case of the Fugitive Nurse,\" for instance, close scrutiny of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.\nCritic Russel B. Nye saw a pattern in Gardner's novels, calling them as formal as Japanese Noh drama. He described fairly rigid plot points:\nThe Perry Mason series ranks third in the top ten best selling book series, with sales of 300 million.\nIn June 2015, the American Bar Association announced that its new publishing imprint, Ankerwycke, would reissue Gardner's Perry Mason novels. \"The Case of the Velvet Claws\", \"The Case of the Sulky Girl\", \"The Case of the Lucky Legs\", \"The Case of the Howling Dog\" and \"The Case of the Curious Bride\" were the first five novels announced for trade paperback release. The Perry Mason books had been out of print in the United States.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nWarner Bros. released a series of six Perry Mason films in the 1930s.\nThe six Perry Mason films are available on DVD as a single-set release from the Warner Bros. Archive Collection.\nThe 1940 Warner Bros. film, \"Granny Get Your Gun\", was loosely based on the 1937 Perry Mason novel \"The Case of the Dangerous Dowager\". May Robson stars as Minerva Hatton. The film does not include Perry Mason or any of the regular characters.\nRadio.\nPerry Mason was adapted for radio as a 15-minute daily crime series that aired from 1943 to 1955 on CBS Radio. It had little in common with the usual portrayal of Mason, so much so that Gardner withdrew his support for a TV version of the daytime serial that began airing on CBS in 1956. The general theme of the radio series was continued, with a different title and characters, as \"The Edge of Night\".\nTV.\n\"Perry Mason\" (1957\u20131966).\nThe best-known incarnation of Perry Mason is from CBS which ran from 1957-66, with Raymond Burr as the title role. The series also featured Barbara Hale as Della Street, William Hopper as Paul Drake, William Talman as Hamilton Burger and Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg. The entire series has been released on DVD and reruns are a staple in syndication.\nParamount+ has made available most of the episodes from seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 on its website for streaming.\n\"The New Perry Mason\" (1973\u20131974).\nSeveral years after \"Perry Mason\" was cancelled, a new series, \"The New Perry Mason\", aired in 1973 featuring Monte Markham in the title role. A total of 15 episodes aired before being cancelled halfway through its first season.\nTelevision films (1985\u20131995).\nAmerican television producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman resurrected the Perry Mason character in a series of television films for NBC beginning in 1985. The two surviving stars of the CBS-TV series, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale, reprised their roles as Mason and Della Street. In the first telefilm, \"Perry Mason Returns\", Mason is an appellate court judge who resigns his position to successfully defend his secretary Della on murder charges. William Katt, Hale's son, was cast as Paul Drake, Jr. William Hopper, who played private investigator Paul Drake in the original TV series, had died years earlier; Hopper's photograph appears on Paul Drake Jr.'s desk. In the later TV movies, Mason used the services of attorney Ken Malansky, played by William R. Moses.\nThe Perry Mason series of TV movies continued until Burr's death from kidney cancer in 1993. \"The Case of the Killer Kiss\" was Burr's final portrayal of Mason. The film aired after his death, and was dedicated to Burr's memory. Thereafter, the title of the series was changed to \"A Perry Mason Mystery\" and starred either Paul Sorvino or Hal Holbrook as lawyers and friends of Mason. Hale and Moses continued in their roles; Mason was ostensibly out of town.\n\"Perry Mason\" (2020).\nIn August 2016, HBO announced a potential new series. In August 2017 a change in the writing staff for the project was announced, with Rolin Jones and Ron Fitzgerald taking over for Nic Pizzolatto. In January 2019, Robert Downey Jr. announced on his Twitter page that Matthew Rhys would be portraying Perry Mason in the new production; Downey was originally going to portray Mason, but was forced to bow out due to scheduling conflicts. The HBO revival and reboot adapted its setting to Great Depression-era Los Angeles, some twenty years earlier than the CBS show (but in line with the earliest novels by Gardner). It features John Lithgow and Tatiana Maslany in additional roles.\nThis miniseries was created with a budget of around $74.3 million and released its first episode on June 21, 2020. In July 2020, HBO announced that the mini-series had been picked up for a second season, and that the show would become a regular series.\nOther adaptations.\nThe Perry Mason character has appeared in comic books and a short-lived (October 16, 1950\u2013 June 21, 1952) comic strip. He was also the inspiration for \"The Whole Truth\" (1986) by James Cummins, a book-length collection of sestinas.\nIn 2008, \"The Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air\" began producing a series of full-cast audio theater dramatizations of Gardner's Perry Mason novels, adapted by M. J. Elliott.\nRegular characters.\nRecurring characters in the Perry Mason stories include the following:\nInfluence.\nIn her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2009, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor prefaced her remarks on the role of the prosecutor by saying that she was inspired by watching the \"Perry Mason\" television series as a child:\nI was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was \"Perry Mason\" \u2026 In one of the episodes, at the end of the episode \u2026 Perry said to the prosecutor, \"It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed.\" And the prosecutor looked up and said, \"No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not.\" And I thought to myself that's quite amazing to be able to serve that role \u2026\nThe Perry Mason novels inspired Robert M. Bell, former Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, to become a lawyer. \"I used to read those growing up,\" he recalled in 2012. \"I got the sense that a lawyer could do good things for folk and was important to our community. That\u2019s what I wanted to do.\"\nThe singer Ozzy Osbourne released a song called \"Perry Mason\" in his album Ozzmosis in 1995, about a hitman undercovered as a painter, which only a mind like Perry Mason's could unmask him.\nCultural references.\nA British Solicitor references many Perry Mason novels in the BBC television show 'May to December' 1989. He even has a picture of Raymond Burr in his office with whom he talks. Raymond Burr portrays Perry Mason in the 1957 television series.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Private investigators often work for attorneys in civil and criminal cases.\nHistory.\nIn 1833, Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq, a French soldier, criminal, and privateer, founded the first known private detective agency, \"Le Bureau des Renseignements Universels pour le commerce et l'Industrie\" (\"The Office of Universal Information For Commerce and Industry\") and hired ex-convicts. Much of what private investigators did in the early days was to act as the police in matters for which their clients felt the police were not equipped or willing to do. Official law enforcement tried many times to shut it down. In 1842, police arrested him in suspicion of unlawful imprisonment and taking money on false pretences after he had solved an embezzlement case. Vidocq later suspected that it had been a set-up. He was sentenced to five years and fined 3,000 francs, but the Court of Appeals released him. Vidocq is credited with having introduced record-keeping, criminology, and ballistics to criminal investigation. He made the first plaster casts of shoe impressions. He created indelible ink and unalterable bond paper with his printing company. His form of anthropometrics is still partially used by French police. He is also credited for philanthropic pursuits\u00a0\u2013 he claimed he never informed on anyone who had stolen for real need.\nIn the United Kingdom, Charles Frederick Field set up an enquiry office upon his retirement from the Metropolitan Police in 1852. Field became a friend of Charles Dickens, and the latter wrote articles about him. In 1862, one of his employees, the Hungarian Ignatius Paul Pollaky, left him and set up a rival agency. Although little-remembered today, Pollaky's fame at the time was such that he was mentioned in various books of the 1870s and immortalized as \"Paddington\" Pollaky for his \"keen penetration\" in the 1881 comic opera, \"Patience\".\nIn the United States, Allan Pinkerton established the Pinkerton National Detective Agency\u2014a private detective agency\u2014in 1850. Pinkerton became famous when he foiled a plot to assassinate then President-elect Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Pinkerton's agents performed services which ranged from undercover investigations and detection of crimes, to plant protection and armed security. At the height of its existence, the number of Pinkerton National Detective Agency active agents and reserves rivaled the number of active soldiers and reserves in the United States Army. Allan Pinkerton hired Kate Warne in 1856 as a private detective, making her the first female private detective in America.\nA larger role for this new private investigative industry was to assist companies in labor disputes. Some early private investigators provided armed guards to act as a private militia. During the union unrest in the US in the late 19th century, industrialists would hire Pinkerton agents as undercover operatives to infiltrate and disrupt union activity or serve as armed guards for factories. In the aftermath of the Homestead Riot of 1892, several states passed so-called \"anti-Pinkerton\" laws restricting the importation of private security guards during union strikes. The federal Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893 continues to prohibit an \"individual employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization\" from being employed by \"the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia.\"\nPinkerton agents were also hired to track western outlaws Jesse James, the Reno brothers, and the Wild Bunch, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\nEmployment.\nMany private detectives/investigators with special academic and practical experience often work with defense attorneys on capital punishment and other criminal defense cases. Others are insurance investigators who investigate suspicious claims. Before the advent of no-fault divorce, many private investigators sought evidence of adultery or other conduct within marriage to establish grounds for a divorce. Despite the lack of legal necessity for such evidence in many jurisdictions today, collecting evidence of spouses' and partners' adultery or other \"bad behaviour\" remain one of their most profitable undertakings, as the stakes nowadays are child custody, alimony, or marital property.\nPrivate investigators can also perform due diligence for an investor considering investing with an investment group, fund manager, or other high-risk business or investment venture. This could help the prospective investor avoid being the victim of fraud. A licensed and experienced investigator could reveal the investment is risky and/or the investor has a suspicious background. This is called investigative due diligence, and is becoming more prevalent in the 21st century with the public reports of large-scale Ponzi schemes and other fraudulent investment vehicles.\nThere are also cases of corrupt private detectives who, at times, have been known to work for criminals such as stalkers and crime bosses to track down escaped victims, rival criminals and/or witnesses that have gone into hiding or to gather compromising evidence against witnesses, informants, prosecutors and/or police investigators that could be used in upcoming trials.\nResponsibilities.\nPrivate investigators also engage in a variety of work not often associated with the industry in the mind of the public. For example, many are involved in process serving, the personal delivery of summons, subpoenas, and other legal documents to parties in a legal case. The tracing of absconding debtors can also form a large part of a PI's work load. Many agencies specialize in a particular field of expertise. For example, some PI agencies deal only in tracing.\nA handful of firms specialize in technical surveillance counter-measures, sometimes called electronic counter measures, which is the locating and dealing with unwanted forms of electronic surveillance (for example, a bugged boardroom for industrial espionage purposes). This niche service is typically conducted by those with backgrounds in intelligence/counterintelligence, executive protection, and a small number from law enforcement entities whose duties included the covert installation of eavesdropping devices as a tool in organized crime, terrorism and narco-trafficking investigations. \nOther PIs, also known as corporate investigators, specialize in corporate matters, including antifraud work, loss prevention, internal investigations of employee misconduct (such as Equal Employment Opportunities violations and sexual harassment), the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets, antipiracy, copyright infringement investigations, due diligence investigations, malware and cyber criminal activity, and computer forensics work. Some PIs act as professional witnesses where they observe situations with a view to reporting the actions or lack of them to a court or to gather evidence in antisocial behavior.\nUndercover investigator.\nAn undercover investigator, undercover detective, or undercover agent is a person who conducts investigations of suspected or confirmed criminal activity while impersonating a disinterested third party. Undercover investigators often infiltrate a suspected insurgent group, posing as a person interested in purchasing illegal goods or services with the ultimate aim of obtaining information about their assigned target.\nMany undercover investigators carry hidden cameras and recorders strapped to their bodies to help them document their investigations. The period of the investigation could last for several months, or in some extreme cases, years. Due to the dangerous nature of the job, their real identities are typically kept secret throughout their active careers.\nEconomic investigations, business intelligence and information on competitors, security advice, special security services information, criminal investigation, investigations background, and profile polygraph tests are all typical examples of such a role.\nCertain types of undercover investigators, depending on their employer, will investigate allegations of abuse of workman's compensation. Those claiming to be injured are often investigated and recorded with a hidden camera/recorder. This is then presented in court or to the client who paid for the investigation.\nAround the world.\nMany jurisdictions require PIs to be licensed. Depending on local laws, they may or may not carry a firearm. Equipment can vary greatly, but generally involves a wide variety of surveillance equipment and recording devices. While PIs may investigate criminal matters, they typically do not hold any law enforcement authority by virtue of the position, regardless of licensure. Private investigators\u2019 authority is usually identical to other citizens\u2019 (off-duty or retired law enforcement officers serving as a PI may retain their police powers at all times, depending on the jurisdiction). They are expected to keep detailed notes and to be prepared to testify in court regarding any of their observations on behalf of their clients, irregular hours may also be required when performing surveillance work. Great care is required to remain within the scope of the law; otherwise, the private investigator may face criminal charges. However, there are also cases around the world, of corrupt or rogue private investigators who have obtained people's private data and information through illegal means. These include phone hacking, pretexting, identity theft and other illegal means of accessing government, insurance and police databases to obtain highly sensitive private information on their targets.\nAustralia.\nPrivate investigators in Australia must be licensed by the licensing authority relevant to the state where they are located. This applies to all states except the Australian Capital Territory. Companies offering investigation services must also hold a business licence and all their operatives must hold individual licences. Generally, the licences are administered and regulated by the state police; however, in some states, this can also be managed by other government agencies. The evidence collected by private investigators must adhere to strict rules of admissibility. If proper protocols are not followed during the investigation services, the evidence may be deemed inadmissible in the court of law.\nTo become registered in New South Wales requires a Class 2E licence, which can be applied for through the NSW Fair Trading website.\nThe Australian Capital Territory does not require PIs to be licensed, although they are still bound by legislation. PIs working in the ACT cannot enter the NSW area without a CAPI license, else they will be in breach of the law.\nIn Queensland, a private investigator need to be licensed under the Queensland Government and apply for a private investigator licence by completing an application for a security provider licence. Applicant will need to have a criminal history check and submit fingerprint.\nCanada.\nPrivate investigators in Canada are licensed at the provincial level by the appropriate body. For instance, in the province of Ontario, private investigators are licensed and regulated by the Ministry of Community Safety &amp; Correctional Services (MCSCS). In the province of Alberta, private investigators are licensed and regulated by the Alberta Justice and Solicitor General. Similar licensing requirements apply in other provinces and territories of Canada. As per the Ontario text of the https://, private investigators are forbidden from referring to themselves as detective or private detective. In order to become a licensed private investigator, you must be 18 years of age or older in Ontario (in other Provinces and territories of Canada the eligible age to work may be higher); have a clean criminal record or obtain a waiver; and submit a correctly completed application for a license. You are required to complete 50-hours of basic training with an accredited source such as a university, college, or through private agencies licensed to administer the course. Upon completion of basic training, individuals are required to write and pass the basic test to obtain a private investigator's license\nUK.\nIn 2001, the Private Security Industry Act empowered the Security Industry Authority (SIA) to introduce licensing for private investigators in the United Kingdom. Although the SIA regulates various other sectors of the private security industry, the specific licensing framework for private investigators has never been fully implemented, and remains unimplemented as of August 2025. As a result, there is no government-backed licensing scheme for private investigators in the UK.\nThe SIA has periodically announced potential dates for when private investigator licensing might take effect, including a proposal for discussion in Parliament in May 2015. However, no formal scheme has emerged. In December 2014, Corporate Livewire published an article by a UK private investigator at BAR Investigations, discussing the implications of the unimplemented licensing regime and other industry concerns. The cost of hiring a private investigator in the UK varies according to the complexity of the inquiry and the investigator\u2019s level of experience, with typical daily rates ranging from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500.\nUnited States.\nPrivate investigators in the United States may or may not be licensed or registered by a government licensing authority or state police of the state where they are located. Licensing varies from state to state and can range from: a) no state license required; b) city or state business license required (such as in five states (Idaho, Alaska, Mississippi, South Dakota, and Wyoming); c) to needing several years of experience and licensing-related training classes and testing (as is the case with Virginia, West Virginia, and California). In some states (Indiana, Michigan, Rhode Island), work experience can be substituted with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. In many states, companies offering investigation services must hold an agency license, and all of their investigators or detectives must hold individual licenses or registrations; furthermore, certain states such as Washington have separate classes of licensing for roles such as trainers of private investigators, individual private investigators, and private investigative agencies. A few states require character references from people not related to the applicant by blood or marriage (3 in Massachusetts, 5 in Minnesota). A few reciprocity agreements allow a US private investigator working in one state to continue work in another for a limited time without getting a separate license, but not all states participate in these agreements.\nIn 1887, Colorado became the first state in the union to institute licensing requirements for private investigators. Section 12-21-101 of the 1973 edition of Colorado Revised Statutes mandated license for \"detective business\", section 12-21-109 declared unlicensed operation a misdemeanor. However, on February 7, 1977, after El Paso County challenged a local security company Ro'Mar Investigation and Security, Inc.'s right to conduct investigations without a license, the Colorado Supreme Court deemed the law unconstitutional in People v. Ro'Mar, citing that the statute did not define a \"detective business\" and the Secretary of State lacked the ability to define it by rule. Following this, several private investigators formed Professional Private Investigators Association of Colorado (PPIAC) in order to try to get the licensing laws reinstated, but the bills died in the General Assembly. Four reviews carried out by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies in 1985, 1987, 2000 and 2006 recommended against state regulation due to the lack to harm to consumers. On June 10, 2011, Governor John Hickenlooper signed into law Colorado House Bill 1195, which reinstated licenses for private investigators on voluntary basis effective July 1, 2012. A license applicant would have to be of 21 years of age or older, hold United States citizenship and have at least 4,000 hours of work experience as an investigator or part of a local, state or federal law enforcement agency; or 2,000 hours with post-secondary education.\nOn June 6, 2014, Hickenlooper signed into law Senate Bill 133, which effective June 1, 2015, made licensure mandatory. This split the licenses into two categories: Class I, requiring the applicant to be 21 years of age or older, hold United States citizenship and pass the Colorado Jurisprudence Exam. Class II requires in addition to Class I requirements a minimum of 4,000 hours of work experience as an investigator or part of a local, state or federal law enforcement agency. In 2019, following a review, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies' Office of Policy, Research and Regulatory Reform suggested licensure requirement elimination, predicting \"little to no consumer harm\". In June 2020, Governor Jared Polis vetoed House Bill 1207 to keep licensure requirements, causing the licensure requirements to expire on August 31, 2021.\nFlorida has 3 types of licenses: Class CC for private investigator intern, C for private investigator, and MA for manager of a private investigative agency. As Class C license requires at least two years of experience, most applicants start with Class CC, which allows them to work under a sponsorship of a licensed Class C investigator.\nFor a Private Investigator License in New York, an investigator needs three years of verifiable experience, and to pass a NY State Department of State Division of licensing Services exam.\nIn 1893 a federal law was passed explicitly barring the government from employing the Pinkerton Detective Agency or a similar agency.\nVietnam.\nCurrent Vietnamese law stipulates that investigation is the authority of state agencies. According to the Investment Law and Decrees 108/2006/N\u0110-CP and 52/2008/N\u0110-CP, businesses providing security services are not allowed to conduct investigations or private detective activities in any form. However, due to social demand, private detective offices have rapidly developed.\nRecently, private detective services have grown significantly, primarily in the form of information provision. Common services in Vietnam include information investigation, address finding, surveillance, phone number tracking, information verification, missing person searches, DNA testing, and counterfeit goods investigation. The cost of hiring a private investigator is around one million VND per day. For cases involving infidelity surveillance or searching for missing children, clients may pay tens of millions of VND per contract. Additionally, some internet service providers have shown signs of participating in this service. In general, Vietnam needs a clear legal framework for the private detective profession. In reality, many private detectives operate illegally, leading to calls for proper regulation of this profession.\nFiction.\nThe PI genre in fiction dates to Edgar Allan Poe, who created the character C. Auguste Dupin in the 1840s. Dupin, an amateur crime-solver residing in Paris, appeared in three Poe stories. In addition, Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1880s, is arguably the most prominent private investigator in fiction.\nNotable private investigators.\nIn reality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn fiction.\nAmericas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAsia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEurope.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62131", "revid": "756128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62131", "title": "Nicolas Poussin", "text": "French Baroque painter (1594\u20131665)\nNicolas Poussin (, , ; June 1594 \u2013 19 November 1665) was a leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th\u00a0century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\nDetails of Poussin's artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters\u2014especially Raphael, who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as \"The Death of Germanicus\", \"The Massacre of the Innocents\", and the first of his two series of the \"Seven Sacraments\".\nHe was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are \"Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun\", \"Landscape with Hercules and Cacus\", and \"The Seasons\".\nBiography.\nEarly years \u2013 Les Andelys and Paris.\nNicolas Poussin's early biographer was his friend Giovanni Pietro Bellori, who relates that Poussin was born near Les Andelys in Normandy and that he received an education that included some Latin, which would stand him in good stead. Another early friend and biographer, Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien, reported that \"He was busy without cease filling his sketchbooks with an infinite number of different figures which only his imagination could produce.\" His early sketches attracted the notice of Quentin Varin, who passed some time in Andelys, but there is no mention by his biographers that he had a formal training in Varin's studio, though his later works showed the influence of Varin, particularly by their storytelling, accuracy of facial expression, finely painted drapery and rich colors. His parents apparently opposed a painting career for him, and around 1612, at the age of eighteen, he ran away to Paris.\nHe arrived in Paris during the regency of Marie de' Medici, when art was flourishing as a result of the royal commissions given by Marie de' Medici for the decoration of her palace, and by the rise of wealthy Paris merchants who bought art. There was also a substantial market for paintings in the redecoration of churches outside Paris destroyed during the French Wars of Religion, which had recently ended, and for the numerous convents in Paris and other cities. However, Poussin was not a member of the powerful guild of master painters and sculptors, which had a monopoly on most art commissions and brought lawsuits against outsiders like Poussin who tried to break into the profession.\nHis early sketches gained him a place in the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. Afterward, he is thought to have studied for one month in the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. Moreover, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, in which several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the \"valet de chambre\" of Marie de' Medici. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.\nHe first tried to travel to Rome in 1617 or 1618, but made it only as far as Florence, where, as his biographer Bellori reported, \"as a result of some sort of accident, he returned to France.\" On his return, he began making paintings for Paris churches and convents. In 1622 made another attempt to go to Rome, but went only as far as Lyon before returning. In the summer of the same year, he received his first important commission: the Order of Jesuits requested a series of six large paintings to honor the canonization of their founder, Saint Francis Xavier. The originality and energy of these paintings (since lost) brought him a series of important commissions.\nGiambattista Marino, the court poet to Marie de' Medici, employed him to make a series of fifteen drawings, eleven illustrating Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and four illustrating battle scenes from Roman history. The \"Marino drawings\", now at Windsor Castle, are among the earliest identifiable works of Poussin. Marino's influence led to a commission for some decoration of Marie de' Medici's residence, the Luxembourg Palace, then a commission from the first Archbishop of Paris, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi, for a painting of the death of the Virgin (since lost) for the Archbishop's family chapel at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Marino took him into his household, and, when he returned to Rome in 1623, invited Poussin to join him. Poussin remained in Paris to finish his earlier commissions, then arrived to Rome in the spring of 1624.\nFirst residence in Rome (1624\u20131640).\nPoussin was thirty when he arrived in Rome in 1624. The new Pope, Urban VIII, elected in 1623, was determined to maintain the position of Rome as the artistic capital of Europe, and artists from around the world gathered there. Poussin could visit the churches and convents to study the works of Raphael and other Renaissance painters, as well as the more recent works of Carracci, Guido Reni and Caravaggio (whose work Poussin detested, saying that Caravaggio was born to destroy painting). He studied the art of painting nudes at the Academy of Domenichino, and frequented the Accademia di San Luca, which brought together the leading painters in Rome, and whose head in 1624 was another French painter, Simon Vouet, who offered lodging to Poussin.\nPoussin became acquainted with other artists in Rome and tended to befriend those with classicizing artistic leanings: the French sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Duquesnoy whom he lodged with in 1626 in via dei Maroniti; the French artist Jacques Stella; Claude Lorraine; Domenichino; Andrea Sacchi; and joined an informal academy of artists and patrons opposed to the current Baroque style that formed around Joachim von Sandrart. Rome also offered Poussin a flourishing art market and an introduction to an important number of art patrons. Through Marino, he was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the brother of the new Pope, and to Cassiano dal Pozzo, the Cardinal's secretary and a passionate scholar of ancient Rome and Greece, who both later became his important patrons. The new art collectors demanded a different format of paintings; instead of large altarpieces and decoration for palaces, they wanted smaller-size religious paintings for private devotion or picturesque landscapes, mythological and history paintings.\nThe early years of Poussin in Rome were difficult. His patron Marino departed Rome for Naples in May 1624, shortly after Poussin arrived, and died there in 1625. His other major sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was named a papal legate to Spain and also departed soon afterwards, taking Cassiano dal Pozzo with him. Poussin became ill with syphilis, but refused to go to the hospital, where the care was extremely poor, and he was unable to paint for months. He survived by selling the paintings he had for a few scudi. Thanks to the assistance of a chef, Jacques Dughet, whose family took him in and cared for him, he largely recovered by 1629, and on 1 September 1630 he married Anne-Marie Dughet, the daughter of Dughet. His two brothers-in-law were artists, and Gaspard Dughet later took Poussin's surname.\nCardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo returned to Rome in 1626, and by their patronage Poussin received two major commissions. In 1627, Poussin painted \"The Death of Germanicus\" (Minneapolis Institute of Arts) for Cardinal Barberini. The painting's erudite use of ancient textual and visual sources (the \"Histories\" of Tacitus and the Meleager sarcophagus), stoic restraint and pictorial clarity established Poussin's reputation as a major artist. In 1628, he was living on the via Paolino (Babuino) with Jean le Maire.\nThe success of the Germanicus led to an even more prestigious commission in 1628 for an altarpiece depicting the \"Martyrdom of St. Erasmus\", for the Erasmus Chapel in St. Peter's Basilica (now in the Vatican Pinacoteca). The Fabricca di San Pietro had originally awarded the commission to Pietro da Cortona, who had produced only preliminary designs for the altarpiece when he was unexpectedly transferred to another project. Thanks to Cassiano dal Pozzo's influence, Poussin was chosen to paint the Saint Erasmus altarpiece, following Pietro da Cortona's original design.\nWith its plunging diagonal composition and high narrative drama, the \"Martyrdom of St. Erasmus\" is Poussin's most overtly \"baroque\" work. Despite its adherence to the pictorial idiom of the day, for unknown reasons, the \"Martyrdom of St. Erasmus\" seems to have met with official displeasure and generated no further papal commissions. This disappointment, and the loss of a competition for a fresco cycle in San Luigi dei Francesi, convinced Poussin to abandon the pursuit of large-scale, public commissions and the burdensome competitions, content restrictions, and political machinations they entailed. Instead, Poussin would re-orient his art towards private collectors, for whom he could work more slowly, with increasing control over subject matter and style.\nAlong with Cardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo, for whom he painted the first \"Seven Sacraments\" series, Poussin's early private patrons included the Chanoine Gian Maria Roscioli, who bought \"The Young Pyrrhus Saved\" and several other important works; Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, for whom he painted the second version of \"The Shepherds of Arcadia\"; and Cardinal Luigi Omodei, who received the \"Triumphs of Flora\" (c.\u20091630\u201332, Louvre). He painted the \"Massacre of the Innocents\" for the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani; the jewel thief and art swindler, Fabrizio Valguarnera, bought \"Plague of Ashdod\" and commissioned \"The Empire of Flora\". He also received his first French commissions from Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy, the French envoy to Italy, later, from Cardinal Richelieu for a series of \"Bacchanales\".\nBuoyed by this commercial success, Poussin bought a life interest in a small house on Via Paolina (Babuino) for his wife and himself in 1632 and entered his most productive period. His house was at the foot of Trinit\u00e9 des Monts, near the city gate, where other foreigners and artists lived; its exact location is not known but it was opposite the church of Sant'Atanasio dei Greci.\nReturn to France (1641\u201342).\nAs the work of Poussin became well known in Rome, he received invitations to return to Paris for important royal commissions, proposed by Fran\u00e7ois Sublet de Noyers, the Superintendent of the B\u00e2timents du Roi for Louis XIII. When Poussin declined, Noyers sent his cousins, Roland Fr\u00e9art de Chambray and Paul Fr\u00e9art, to Rome to persuade Poussin to come home, offering him the title of First Painter to the King, plus a substantial residence at the Tuileries Palace. Poussin yielded, and in December 1640 he was back in Paris.\nThe correspondence of Poussin to Cassiano dal Pozzo and his other friends in Rome show that he was appreciative of the money and honors, but he was quickly overwhelmed by a large number of commissions, particularly since he had taken the habit of working slowly and carefully. His new projects included \"The Institution of the Eucharist\" for the chapel of the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and \"The Miracle of Saint Francis-Xavier\" for the altar of the church of the novitiate of the Jesuits. In addition, he was asked to the ceilings and vaults for the Grand Galerie of the Louvre Palace, and to paint a large allegorical work for the study of Cardinal Richelieu, on the theme \"Time Defending Truth from the Attacks of Envy and Discord\", with the figure of \"Truth\" clearly standing for Cardinal Richelieu. He was also expected to provide designs for royal tapestries and the front pieces for books from the royal printing house. He was also subjected to considerable criticism from the partisans of other French painters, including his old friend Simon Vouet. He completed a painting of the \"Last Supper\" (now in the Louvre), eight cartoons for the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, drawings for a proposed series of grisaille paintings of the \"Labors of Hercules\" for the Louvre, and a painting of the \"Triumph of Truth\" for Cardinal Richelieu (now in the Louvre). He was increasingly unhappy with the court intrigues and the overwhelming number of commissions. In the autumn of 1642, when the King and court were out of Paris in Languedoc, he found a pretext to leave Paris and to return permanently to Rome.\nFinal years in Rome (1642\u20131665).\nWhen he returned to Rome in 1642, he found the art world was in transition. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644, and the new Pope, Innocent X, was less interested in art patronage, and preferred Spanish over French culture. Poussin's great patrons, the Barberinis, departed Rome for France. He still had a few important patrons in Rome, including Cassiano dal Pozzo and the future Cardinal Camillo Massimi, but began to paint more frequently for the patrons he had found in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1642, and Louis XIII died in 1643, and Poussin's Paris sponsor, Sublet de Noyer, lost his position, but Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin, began to collect Poussin's works. In October 1643, Poussin sold the furnishings of his house in the Tuileries in Paris, and settled for the rest of his life in Rome.\nIn 1647, Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien, the secretary of the French Embassy in Rome, became a friend and painting student of Poussin, and published the first book devoted entirely to his work. His growing number of French patrons included the Abb\u00e9 Louis Fouquet, brother of Nicolas Fouquet, the celebrated Superintendent of Finances of the young Louis XIV. In 1655 Fouquet obtained for Poussin official recognition of his earlier title as First Painter of the King, along with payment for his past French commissions. To thank Fouquet, Poussin made designs for the baths Fouquet was constructing at his ch\u00e2teau at Vaux-le-Vicomte.\nAnother important French patron of Poussin in this period was Paul Fr\u00e9art de Chantelou, who came to Rome in 1643 and stayed there for several months. He commissioned from Poussin some of his most important works, including the second series of the \"Seven Sacraments\", painted between 1644 and 1648, and his \"Landscape with Diogenes\". In 1649 he painted the \"Vision of St Paul\" for the comic poet Paul Scarron, and in 1651 the \"Holy Family\" for Charles III de Cr\u00e9quy. Landscapes had been a secondary feature of his early work; in his later work nature and the landscape was frequently the central element of the painting.\nHe lived an austere and comfortable life, working slowly and apparently without assistants. The painter Charles Le Brun joined him in Rome for three years, and Poussin's work had a major influence on Le Brun's style. In 1647, his patrons Chantelou and Pointel requested portraits of Poussin. He responded by making two self-portraits, completed together in 1649.\nHe suffered from declining health after 1650, and was troubled by a worsening tremor in his hand, evidence of which is apparent in his late drawings. Nonetheless, in his final eight years he painted some of the most ambitious and celebrated of his works, including \"The Birth of Bacchus\", \"Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun\", \"Landscape with Hercules and Cacus\", the four paintings of \"The Seasons\" and \"Apollo in love with Daphn\u00e9\".\nHis wife Anne-Marie died in 1664, and thereafter his own health sank rapidly. On 21 September he dictated his will, and he died in Rome on 19 November 1665 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina.\nSubjects.\nEach of Poussin's paintings told a story. Though he had little formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the \"affetti\", or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.\nReligion.\nReligion was the most common subject of his paintings, as the church was the most important art patron in Rome and because there was a growing demand by wealthy patrons for devotional paintings at home. He took a large part of his themes from the Old Testament, which offered more variety and the stories were often more vague and gave him more freedom to invent. He painted different versions of the stories of Eliazer and Rebecca from the Book of Genesis and made three versions of \"Moses saved from the waters\". The New Testament provided the subject of one of his most dramatic paintings, \"The Massacre of the Innocents\", where the general slaughter was reduced to a single brutal incident. In his \"Judgement of Solomon\" (1649), the story can be read in the varied facial expressions of the participants.\nHis religious paintings were sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ in the sky in his painting of Saint Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having \"Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy\". Poussin responded that \"he could not and should not imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face\".\nThe most famous of his religious works were the two series called \"The Seven Sacraments\", representing the meaning of the moral laws behind each of the principal ceremonies of the church, illustrated by incidents in the life of Christ. The first series was painted in Rome by his major early patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo, and was finished in 1642. It was viewed by his later patron, Paul Fr\u00e9art de Chantelou, who asked for a copy. Instead of making copies, Poussin painted an entirely new series of paintings, which was finished by 1647. The new series had less of the freshness and originality of the first series, but was striking for its simplicity and austerity in achieving its effects; the second series illustrated his mastery of the balance of the figures, the variety of expressions, and the juxtaposition of colors.\nMythology and classical literature.\nClassical Greek and Roman mythology, history and literature provided the subjects for many of his paintings, particularly during his early years in Rome. His first successful painting in Rome, \"The Death of Germanicus\", was based upon a story in the \"Annals\" of Tacitus. In his early years he devoted a series of paintings, full of color, movement and sensuality, to the Bacchanals, colorful portrayals of ceremonies devoted to the god of wine Bacchus, and celebrating the goddesses Venus and Flore. He also created \"The Birth of Venus\" (1635), telling the story of the Roman goddess through an elaborate composition full of dynamic figures for the French patron, Cardinal Richelieu, who had also commissioned the Bacchanals. Many of his mythological paintings featured gardens and floral themes; his first Roman patrons, the Barberini family, had one of largest and most famous gardens in Rome. Another of his early major themes was the Rape of the Sabine Women, recounting how the King of Rome, Romulus, wanting wives for his soldiers, invited the members of the neighboring Sabine tribe for a festival, and then, on his signal, kidnapped all of the women. He painted two versions, one in 1634, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the other in 1637, now in the Louvre. He also painted two versions illustrating a story of Ovid in the \"Metamorphoses\" in which Venus mourning the death of Adonis after a hunting accident, transforms his blood into the color of the anemone flower.\nThroughout his career, Poussin frequently achieved what the art historian Willibald Sauerl\u00e4nder terms a \"consonance ... between the pagan and the Christian world\". An example is \"The Four Seasons\" (1660\u201364), in which Christian and pagan themes are mingled: \"Spring\", traditionally personified by the Roman goddess Flora, instead features Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden; \"Summer\" is symbolized not by Ceres but by the biblical Ruth.\nIn his later years, his mythological paintings became more somber, and often introduced the symbols of mortality and death. The last painting he was working on before his death was \"Apollo in love with Daphne\", which he presented to his patron, the future Cardinal Massimi, in 1665. The figures on the left of the canvas, around Apollo, largely represented vitality and life, while those on the right, around Daphne, were symbols of sterility and death. He was unable to complete the painting because of the trembling of his hand, and the figures on the right are unfinished.\nPoetry and allegory.\nBesides classical literature and myth, he drew often from works of the romantic and heroic literature of his own time, usually subjects decided in advance with his patrons. He painted scenes from the epic poem \"Jerusalem Delivered\" by Torquato Tasso (1544\u20131595), published in 1581, and one of the most popular books in Poussin's lifetime. His painting \"Renaud and Armide\" illustrated the death of the Christian knight Renaud at the hands of the magician Armide; who, when she saw his face, saw her hatred turn to love. Another poem by Tasso with a similar theme inspired \"Tancred and Hermiene\"; a woman finds a wounded knight on the road, breaks down in tears, then finds the strength through love to heal him.\nAllegories of death are common in Poussin's work. One of the best-known examples is \"Et in Arcadia ego\", a subject he painted in about 1630 and again in the late 1630s. Idealized shepherds examine a tomb inscribed with the title phrase, \"Even in Arcadia I exist\", reminding that death was ever-present.\nA fertile source for Poussin was Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, who wrote moralistic theatrical pieces which were staged at the Palazzo Barberini, for his early patron. One of his most famous works, \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", was inspired by another Rospigliosi piece. According to his early biographers Bellori and Felibien, the four figures in the dance represent the stages of life: Poverty leads to Work, Work to Riches, and Riches to Luxury; then, following Christian doctrine, luxury leads back to poverty, and the cycle begins again. The three women and one man who dance represent the different stages and are distinguished by their different clothing and headdresses, ranging from plain to jeweled. In the sky over the dancing figures, the chariot of Apollo passes, accompanied by the Goddess Aurora and the Hours, a symbol of passing time.\nLandscapes and townscapes.\nPoussin is an important figure in the development of landscape painting. In his early paintings the landscape usually forms a graceful background for a group of figures, but later the landscape played a larger and larger role and dominated the figures, illustrating stories, usually tragic, taken from the Bible, mythology, ancient history or literature. His landscapes were very carefully composed, with the vertical trees and classical columns carefully balanced by the horizontal bodies of water and flat building stones, all organized to lead the eye to the often tiny figures. The foliage in his trees and bushes is very carefully painted, often showing every leaf. His skies played a particularly important part, from the blue skies and gray clouds with bright sunlit borders (a sight often called in France \"a Poussin sky\") to illustrate scenes of tranquility and the serenity of faith, such as the \"Landscape with Saint John on Patmos\", painted in the late 1630s before his departure for Paris; or extremely dark, turbulent and threatening, as a setting for tragic events, as in his \"Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe\" (1651). Many of his landscapes have enigmatic elements noticeable only with closer inspection; for example, in the center of the landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe, despite the storm in the sky, the surface of the lake is perfectly calm, reflecting the trees.\nBetween 1650 and 1655, Poussin also painted a series of paintings now often called \"townscapes\", where classical architecture replaces trees and mountains in the background. The painting \"The Death of Saphire\" uses this setting to illustrate two stories simultaneously; in the foreground, the wife of a wealthy merchant dies after being chastised by St. Peter for not giving more money to the poor; while in the background another man, more generous, gives alms to a beggar.\nStyle and method.\nThroughout his life Poussin stood apart from the popular tendency toward the decorative in French art of his time. In Poussin's works a survival of the impulses of the Renaissance is coupled with conscious reference to the art of classical antiquity as the standard of excellence. Rejecting the emotionalism of Baroque artists such as Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, he emphasized the cerebral. His goal was clarity of expression achieved by \"disegno\" or 'nobility of design' in preference to \"colore\" or color.\nDuring the late 1620s and 1630s, he experimented and formulated his own style. He studied the Antique as well as works such as Titian's Bacchanals (\"The Bacchanal of the Andrians\", \"Bacchus and Ariadne\", and \"The Worship of Venus\") at the Casino Ludovisi and the paintings of Domenichino and Guido Reni.\nIn contrast to the warm and atmospheric style of his early paintings, Poussin by the 1630s developed a cooler palette, a drier touch, and a more stage-like presentation of figures dispersed within a well defined space. In \"The Triumph of David\" (c.\u20091633\u201334; Dulwich Picture Gallery), the figures enacting the scene are arranged in rows that, like the architectural facade that serves as the background, are parallel to the picture plane. The violence of \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" (c.\u20091638; Louvre) has the same abstract, choreographed quality seen in \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" (1639\u201340).\nContrary to the standard studio practice of his time, Poussin did not make detailed figure drawings as preparation for painting, and he seems not to have used assistants in the execution of his paintings. He produced few drawings as independent works, aside from the series of drawings illustrating Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" he made early in his career. His drawings, typically in pen and ink wash, include landscapes drawn from nature to be used as references for painting, and composition studies in which he blocked in his figures and their settings. To aid him in formulating his compositions he made miniature wax figures and arranged them in a box that was open on one side like a theatre stage, to serve as models for his composition sketches. Pierre Rosenberg described Poussin as \"not a brilliant, elegant, or seductive draughtsman. Far from it. His lack of virtuosity is, however, compensated for by uncompromising rigour: there is never an irrelevant mark or a superfluous line.\"\nLegacy.\nIn the years following Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to Charles Le Brun, who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later the head of the French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of Jacques Stella and S\u00e9bastien Bourdon, the Italian painter Pier Francesco Mola, and the Dutch painter Gerard de Lairesse.\nA debate emerged in the art world between the advocates of Poussin's style, who said the drawing was the most important element of a painting, and the advocates of Rubens, who placed color above the drawing. During the French Revolution, Poussin's style was championed by Jacques-Louis David in part because the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican severity and civic-mindedness. The influence of Poussin was evident in paintings such as \"Brutus\" and \"Death of Marat\". Benjamin West, an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of \"The Death of General Wolfe\" in Poussin's \"The Death of Germanicus\".\nThe 19th century brought a resurgence of enthusiasm for Poussin. French writers were seeking to create a national art movement and Poussin became one of their heroes: the founding father of the French School; he appears in plays, stories and novels as well as physiognomic studies. He also became the model for the myth of the child genius, who becomes the miserable artist rejected by society, as can be seen in Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet's painting of the death of Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was Ingres, who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, \"Only great painters of history can paint a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; so much so that when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is \"Poussinesque\". Another 19th-century admirer of Poussin was Ingres' great rival, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix; he wrote in 1853: \"The life of Poussin is reflected in his works; it is in perfect harmony with the beauty and nobility of his inventions...Poussin was one of the greatest innovators found in the history of painting. He arrived in the middle of the school of mannerism, where the craft was preferred to the intellectual role of art. He broke with all of that falseness\".\nPaul C\u00e9zanne appreciated Poussin's version of classicism. \"Imagine how Poussin entirely redid nature, that is the classicism that I mean. What I don't accept is the classicism that limits you. I want that a visit to a master will help me find myself. Every time I leave a Poussin, I know better who I am.\" C\u00e9zanne was described in 1907 by Maurice Denis as \"the Poussin of Impressionism\". Georges Seurat was another Post-Impressionist artist who admired the formal qualities of Poussin's work.\nIn the 20th century, some art critics suggested that the analytic Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were also founded upon Poussin's example. In 1963 Picasso based a series of paintings on Poussin's \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\". Following in Picasso's footsteps, Herman Braun-Vega produced a series of twenty paintings in 1974 on \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" in the Louvre, which he placed in perspective with the tragic events of his time. One of the paintings in this series, \"Poussin au quartier de porc\", is part of the collection of the Centre National des Arts Plastiques. Andr\u00e9 Derain, Jean H\u00e9lion, Balthus, and Jean Hugo were other modern artists who acknowledged the influence of Poussin. Markus L\u00fcpertz made a series of paintings in 1989\u201390 based on Poussin's works.\nThe finest collection of Poussin's paintings today is at the Louvre in Paris. Other significant collections are in the National Gallery in London; the National Gallery of Scotland; the Dulwich Picture Gallery; the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly; the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; and the Museo del Prado, Madrid.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62132", "revid": "40781349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62132", "title": "Hyacinthe Rigaud", "text": "Catalan-French baroque painter (1659\u20131743)\nJacint Rigau-Ros i Serra (; 18 July 1659 \u2013 29 December 1743), known in French as Hyacinthe Rigaud (), was a Catalan-French baroque painter most famous for his portraits of Louis XIV and other members of the French nobility.\nBiography.\nRigaud was born in Perpignan, then part of the Crown of Aragon, a few months before Spain ceded the city to France under the Treaty of the Pyrenees (7 November 1659). His family, the \"Rigau\", were Catalan; he was the son of a tailor, the grandson of painter-gilders from Roussillon, and the elder brother of Gaspard Rigaud, also a painter.\nRigaud was baptised with his Catalan name in the old Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Perpignan on 20 July 1659, two days after his birth at rue de la Porte-d'Assaut. His baptismal name was \"Jyacintho Rigau or Jacint Rigau i Ros\" This is sometimes transliterated as \"H\u00edacint Francesc Honrat Mathias Pere Martyr Andreu Joan Rigau\" After the Roussillon and the Cerdanya were ceded to France the following 7 November owing to the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the Rigau remained in Roussillon, and became French subjects.\nHe was trained in tailoring in his father's workshop, but perfected his skills as a painter under Antoine Ranc at Montpellier from 1671 onwards, before moving to Lyon four years later. It was in these cities that he became familiar with Flemish, Dutch and Italian painting, particularly that of Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and Titian, whose works he later collected. Arriving in Paris in 1681, he won the prestigious scholarship known as the prix de Rome in 1682, but on the advice of Charles Le Brun did not make the trip to Rome which was included in the scholarship. Rigaud was received into the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1710, and he rose to the top of this institution before retiring from it in 1735.\nSince Rigaud's paintings captured very exact likenesses along with the subject's costumes and background details, his paintings are considered precise records of contemporary fashions. \nFamily.\nHyacinthe's father, Josep Matias Pere Ramon Rigau, was a tailor (\"sastre\" in Catalan) in the parish of Saint-Jean de Perpignan, \"as well as a painter\", descended from a line of well-established artists in the Perpignanian basin who had been commissioned to decorate several tabernacles and other panels for liturgical use. Few of these have survived to the present (Palau-del-Vidre, Perpignan, Montalba-d'Am\u00e9lie, Joch...). Hyacinthe's grandfather, Jacinto \"major\", and even more Jacinto's father, Honorat \"minor\", were heads of the family and the local art world from 1570 to 1630; probably as much as gilders as painters, since in their studios were to be found \"many prints and books treating on the art of painting, and other things, such as brushes and palettes for painting\".\nWorking for the coll\u00e8ge Saint-\u00c9loi in his city since 1560, and acting as representative of its guild of painters and gilders, on 22 November 1630 Jacinto \"major\" and other gilders and colleagues participated in the development of the statutes and minutes of the city's coll\u00e8ge Saint-Luc\n. Honorat \"minor\" is generally identified as the painter of \"The Canonisation of Saint Hyacinthe\", formerly in Perpignan's Dominican convent and now at Joch, the tabernacle of the church of Palau-del-Vidre (28 March 1609) and the retable at Montalba near Am\u00e9lie-les-Bains. The father of Honorat \"minor\" is generally identified as the painter of the retable of Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol (1623) in the \u00e9glise Saint-Jacques de Perpignan and formerly in the couvent des Minimes, whilst Honorat \"major\" is usually identified as the painter of the paintings of the retable of the \u00e9glise Saint-Jean-l'\u00c9vang\u00e9liste at Peyrestortes.\nOn 13 March 1647, Hyacinthe's father Matias Rigau married Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Faget (1634\u20131655), daughter of a carpenter. Widowed shortly after, he decided to speedily remarry, to Maria Serra, daughter of a Perpignan textile merchant (\"pentiner\" in Catalan), on 20 December 1655. In 1665, he acquired a house \"en lo carrer de las casas cremades\" (now rue de l'Incendie, near the cathedral) and received the income from a parcel of vineyards in the Bompas territory. By his second marriage, he also acquired a house on place de l'Huile, but he soon sold it.\nJourney to Lyon.\nLittle is known about Rigaud's activities in Lyon, due to the lack of surviving documents. However, as per tradition, artists from Montpellier had strong ties with this city, as had, for example, Samuel Boissi\u00e8re who was trained in there, in Lyon. The identity of Rigaud's future depicted models shows that he worked for the city's cloth merchants, whose flourishing trade had long since given the city its profitable income.\nEven if they had only been registered from 1681 onwards, the date when he moved to Paris, his \"youthful\" portraits were probably , like those of Antoine Domergue, the king's councillor and provincial governor of Lyon, in 1686, and \"Mr Sarazin de Lion\", of a famous dynasty of bankers of Swiss origins, in 1685. Rigaud's portrait of Jean de Brunenc, painted in 1687, a silk merchant, banker and consul of Lyon, assembles all the ingredients for which the painter was later successful.\nIn her thesis on the engravers from the Drevet family, Gilberte Levallois-Clavel revealed certain aspects of the private relations between Rigaud and Pierre Drevet; their friendship came about at the beginning of the 1700s, after the painter produced a portrait of the engraver, in which he depicted himself as well.\nIn 1681, when Hyacinthe Rigaud decided to move to Paris, inspired by Drevet who was also attracted to the capital, he had already established a good reputation amongst the local clientele, from Switzerland to Aix-en-Provence.\nGoing back to the artist's biography, Dezallier d'Argenville states that one of Rigaud's main reasons for his 1695 voyage was to paint his mother's portrait: \"He painted her from many angles, and had her marble bust made by the notable Coysevox, which was his cabinet's ornament for the rest of his life\". In his first will, dated 30 May 1707, the artist left the bust to the Grand Dauphin, Louis XIV's son, though the sculpture would then be left to the Academy which explains its presence in the Louvre. Also in the document, Rigaud bequeathed the portrait containing the two profiles of Maria Serra to the elder son of his brother Gaspard, named Hyacinthe.\nIn reality, Rigaud painted a second painting, bearing the three stances presented to Coysevox: an oval painting kept in a private collection, copied by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, in Dijon, and the subject of one of Drevet's engravings. He also applied sketches of his sister Claire, accompanied by her husband and their first daughter, to the canvas.\nThe year 1695 also saw the production of two versions of \"Christ expiant sur la Croix\", with a distinct Flemish influence, proof of Rigaud's rare incursion into the domain of historical depictions or the \"great genre\". He bequeathed his mother the first version which would then, at her death, be left to the Grands Augustins convent in Perpignan, and gave the second, in 1722, to the Dominican convent of his city of birth.\nIn spring 1696, Hyacinthe Rigaud returned to Paris, where he painted one of his most important portraits of the year. This was in fact solicited by the duke of Saint-Simon, to depict Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Ranc\u00e9, an abbot, using a skillful subterfuge that remains notable in the history of painting.\nIn 1709, he was made a noble by his hometown of Perpignan. In 1727, he was made a knight of the Order of Saint Michael.\nFollowing the death of \"directeur\" Louis de Boullogne on 28 November 1733, Rigaud proposed that the four rectors of the Acad\u00e9mie, Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re, Claude-Guy Hall\u00e9, Guillaume Coustou, and himself, rotate the post. This oligarchy would persist until the election of Coustou as sole director on 5 February 1735.\nRigaud died in Paris on 29 December 1743 at the age of 84.\nClientele.\n He was one of the most important portrait painters during the reign of King Louis XIV. His instinct for impressive poses and grand presentations precisely suited the tastes of the royal personages, ambassadors, clerics, courtiers, and financiers who sat for him. Rigaud owes his celebrity to the faithful support he received from the four generations of Bourbons whose portraits he painted; namely King Louis XIV, next his son Louis, Grand Dauphin, then the King's grandson (the Grand Dauphin's son) Louis, Duke of Burgundy (also called the Petit Dauphin), and finally the Grand Dauphin's grandson (the Petit Dauphin's son), who became the next king\u2014Louis XV, who succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV in 1715. He garnered the core of his clientele among the richest circles as well as among the bourgeois, financiers, nobles, industrialists and government ministers, also courting all the major ambassadors of his time and several European monarchs. His \u0153uvre reads as a near-complete portrait gallery of the chief movers in France from 1680 to 1740. Some of that \u0153uvre (albeit a minority) also includes those of more humble origins \u2013 Rigaud's friends, fellow artists or simple businessmen.\nRigaud is inseparable from his best-known work, a 1701 painting of Louis XIV in his coronation costume which today hangs in the Louvre in Paris, as well as the second copy also requested by Louis XIV that now hangs at the Palace of Versailles.\nHe is renowned for his portrait paintings of Louis XIV, the royalty and nobility of Europe, and members of their courts and considered one of the most notable French portraitists of the classical period. For Jacques Thuillier, professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France: {\nAccording to the French art historian Louis Hourticq, {\nTrue \"photographs\", faces that Diderot called \"letters of recommendation written in the common language of all men\", Rigaud's works today populate the world's major museums.\nLegacy.\nRigaud's works today populate the world's major museums. The exact number of paintings he produced remains in dispute, since he left a highly detailed catalogue but also more than a thousand different models which specialists agree he used. To these may be added the large number of copies in Rigaud's , as well as the hundreds of other paintings rediscovered since the account's publication in 1919. Rigaud painted many important figures in the world of art such as the sculptors Desjardins (to whom, as an old friend, he delivered three successive portraits), Girardon and Coysevox; the painters Joseph Parrocel, La Fosse and Mignard; the architects De Cotte, Hardouin-Mansart and Gabriel. He also painted portraits of poets such as La Fontaine or Boileau, as well as religious figures such as the cardinal de Fleury and Bossuet; many influential archbishops and bishops paid large sums of money for a portrait.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'art Hyacinthe Rigaud, a museum dedicated to Rigaud's artwork, opened in Perpignan in 1833. The museum has since expanded to include works by Aristide Maillol, Raoul Dufy, and other artists. It received over 65,000 visitors in 2017 following its renovation and a temporary exhibition dedicated to Picasso.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62133", "revid": "50685154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62133", "title": "Pierre Berton", "text": "Canadian author (1920\u20132004)\nPierre Francis de Marigny Berton, CC, O.Ont. (July 12, 1920 \u2013 November 30, 2004) was a Canadian historian, writer, journalist and broadcaster. Berton wrote 50 best-selling books, mainly about Canadiana, Canadian history and popular culture. He also wrote critiques of mainstream religion, anthologies, children's books and historical works for youth. He was a reporter and war correspondent, an editor at \"Maclean's Magazine\" and \"The Toronto Star\" and, for 39 years, a panelist on Front Page Challenge. He was a founder of the Writers' Trust of Canada, and won many honours and awards.\nEarly years.\nBerton was born on July 12, 1920, in Whitehorse, Yukon, where his father had moved for the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush. His family moved to Dawson City, Yukon in 1921. His mother, Laura Beatrice Berton (maiden name Laura Beatrice Thompson), was a schoolteacher in Toronto until she was offered a job as a teacher in Dawson City at the age of 29 in 1907. She met Frank Berton in the nearby mining town of Granville shortly after settling in Dawson and teaching kindergarten. Laura Beatrice Berton's autobiography of life in the Yukon entitled \"I Married the Klondike\" was published in her later years and gave her what her son Pierre describes as \"a modicum of fame, which she thoroughly enjoyed.\" At the time, Dawson City was a highly remote place. After visiting Dawson City in the summer of 1939 to see some old friends, it took Berton a week to go from Dawson City to Whitehorse as the only means of transport was an old paddle-wheeler named the \"Casca\" that moved slowly up the Yukon River. Growing up in Dawson City, which had briefly during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s been one of Canada's largest cities, left Berton with an eye for the colourful. During his childhood he encountered numerous eccentric people who had gone north during the gold rush and ended up staying in Dawson City after the gold rush ended.\nBerton's family moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1932. At age 12, he joined the Scout Movement. Berton later wrote that \"The Scout Movement was the making of me\". He credited Scouting with keeping him from becoming a juvenile delinquent. He started his journalism career in scouting and later wrote that \"the first newspaper I was ever associated with was a weekly typewritten publication issued by the Seagull Patrol of St. Mary\u2019s Troop.\" He remained in scouting for seven years and wrote about his experiences in an article titled \"My Love Affair with the Scout Movement\". Like his father, Pierre Berton worked in Klondike mining camps during his years as a history major at the University of British Columbia, where he also worked on the student paper \"The Ubyssey\".\nWar-time career.\nHe spent his early newspaper career in Vancouver, where at 21 he was the youngest city editor on any Canadian daily, at the Vancouver News-Herald, replacing editorial staff that had been called up to serve in the Second World War. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese Navy bombed the American naval base at Pearl Harbor while on the same day, the Japanese Army invaded the British colonies of Hong Kong and Malaya. The extent and rapidity of the Japanese victories in the winter of 1941-1942 came as a considerable surprise, and Berton stated that from his vantage in Vancouver that the war felt much closer than it had done before. In February 1942, he noted Japanese-Canadians being held in Vancouver's Hastings Park prior to being sent to internment camps in the interior of the province. Meanwhile all over Greater Vancouver the businesses and homes of Japanese-Canadians were seized by the federal government, which proceeded to promptly auction off most of the assets it seized.\nBerton himself was conscripted into the Canadian Army under the National Resources Mobilization Act in 1942 and attended basic training in British Columbia, nominally as a reinforcement soldier intended for The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. Under the National Resources Mobilization Act, the government had the power to impose conscription for the defence of Canada and only volunteers were sent to fight overseas until late 1944. The men who were conscripted and chose to remain in Canada were popularly known as \"the Zombies\", a term that was highly disparaging. Because the \"Zombies\" refused to fight overseas, in many quarters they were viewed as cowards. He elected to \"go Active\" (the euphemism for volunteering for overseas service). By 1942, the Axis powers were winning the war, and Berton came to feel that the two very different visions of the world offered up by the respective sides were such that he had to take a stand by \"going active\", instead of remaining safely in Canada as a \"Zombie\". His aptitude as a soldier was such that he was appointed Lance Corporal and attended NCO school, and became a basic training instructor in the rank of corporal. Due to a background in university Canadian Officers' Training Corps (COTC) and inspired by other citizen-soldiers who had been commissioned, he sought training as an officer.\nBerton spent the next several years attending a variety of military courses, becoming, in his words, the most highly trained officer in the military. He was warned for overseas duty many times, and was granted embarkation leave many times, each time finding his overseas draft being cancelled. A coveted trainee slot with the Canadian Intelligence Corps saw Berton, now a Captain, trained to act as an Intelligence Officer (IO), and after a stint as an instructor at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, he finally went overseas in March 1945. In the UK, he was told that he would have to requalify as an IO because the syllabus in the UK was different from that in the intelligence school in Canada. By the time Berton had requalified, the war in Europe had ended. During his time in Britain, he dated a woman named Frances who informed him on V Day that she was pregnant with his child and did not want him involved, as told by Berton in his autobiography and retold in his Biography. Berton never knew his British child. He volunteered for the Canadian Army Pacific Force (CAPF), granted a final \"embarkation leave\", and found himself no closer to combat employment by the time the Japanese surrendered in September 1945.\nFame as a journalist.\nIn 1947 he went on an expedition to the Nahanni River with pilot Russ Baker. Berton's account for the \"Vancouver Sun\" was picked up by International News Service, making him a noted adventure-travel writer. On 1 February 1948, an article by Berton appeared in \"Maclean's\" under the title \"They're Only Japs\", which was the first account of the internment of Japanese Canadians to appear in the Canadian media that provided interviews with some of the interned people. Most notably, Berton interviewed Marie Suzuki, a second-generation Japanese Canadian school-teacher whose career had been ruined by the internment. Berton was quite critical of the decision made by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to order the internment on 24 February 1942 that saw all Japanese Canadians interned, regardless if they were immigrants or Canadian-born, unlike the case-by-case policy with interning German Canadians and the partial internment of Italian Canadians that saw all Italian immigrants interned. Berton's article was also the first to note that greed was a major factor behind the demand for the internment as many of the people in British Columbia who agitated for total internment of all Japanese Canadians were very interested in seizing their assets for themselves.\nWar correspondent in Korea.\nIn 1951, Berton covered the Korean War as the war correspondent of \"Maclean's\". To make up for not seeing action in World War Two, Berton was highly keen to work as a war correspondent and lobbied Ralph Allen, the editor of \"Maclean's\", to go to Korea as soon as the Korean War started in 1950. In late 1950 Berton wrote profiles in \"Maclean's\" of the two commanding officers of the all-volunteer Canadian Special Brigade, namely Brigadier John Meredith Rockingham and Colonel Jacques Dextraze, which were highly flattering to the subjects of his profiles and led the Canadian Army to expect that Berton would take a pro-war line in his reportage. In February 1951, Berton's profile of Rockingham was published in \"Maclean's\" under the title \"Rocky\" noted that Rockingham was a highly decorated Second World War veteran who had won the Distinguished Service Order at Dieppe in 1942 who was much liked and respected by the men who served under him. The arrival of Canadian Special Brigade at the front in February 1951 finally provided the occasion for him to work as a war correspondent. Berton arrived in South Korea in March 1951 at a critical moment as the Chinese had just taken Seoul and were preparing for a spring offensive that was launched in April 1951 that was aimed at winning the war by driving out United Nations forces of Korea. The Chinese Spring Offensive was launched, which saw the Anglo-Canadian-Australian-New Zealander 27th Infantry Commonwealth Brigade in the thick of the fighting. After the failure of the Chinese spring offensive, the United Nations launched a counter-offensive that saw Seoul retaken. By June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate and negotiations were opened for an armistice, which took two years to conclude with the armistice finally being signed on 27 July 1953.\nDuring the stalemate phase of the war, both sides sought limited advantages to improve their bargaining positions in the armistice talks by capturing hills, which improved the tactical situation while having no impact on the wider strategical situation in Korea. Berton in his reportage noted that the Canadian soldiers were frustrated by the \"war of the hills\", complaining that it seemed pointless to them to be used essentially as pawns to improve the bargaining positions in the armistice talks by fighting to capture or hold some barren hill in Korea. Berton reported that the average Canadian soldier in Korea hated their Chinese enemies, but had a grudging respect for their fighting abilities while holding their South Korean allies in complete and utter contempt as the South Koreans always broke under Chinese assaults. Berton also noted, but was prevented by censorship from saying that though the Canadian soldiers respected the British, Australians and New Zealand soldiers they served alongside, but held a lower opinion of the U.S. Army. The majority of American soldiers in Korea were teenage draftees, who generally came from the more poorer and less educated elements of American society, which led to morale problems. Berton's experiences in Korea left him with a dislike for the U.S. Army, whose mostly white and middle-class officers he charged were callous in their treatment of their own soldiers, especially if they were black or Hispanic. Berton was to later write in the 1990s that all of the problems that the U.S. Army had experienced during the Vietnam war such as morale issues, racial tensions, drug use, and a wide gap between officers and the other ranks he had seen first-hand in Korea, led to his conclusion that the U.S. Army had failed to learn anything from the Korean war.\nThough most of the Canadians in Korea routinely referred to the Koreans as \"gooks\", Berton's articles often mentioned the suffering of Korean civilians such as one profile he did of a Mrs. Sook whose son was shot by the North Koreans in 1950 when he refused to join the North Korean People's Army, leaving her broken and destitute. In another article entitled \"Seoul, the saddest city in the world\" Berton described the war devastated city of Seoul as being in ruins with the people living there reduced to begging to stay alive and that the deeply corrupt South Korean government of President Syngman Rhee had no interest in helping its own people. Berton complied with the requests of the military censors during his time in Korea, altering one story about the killing of 60 black American soldiers in a Chinese raid that began with the line \"Killed in their sleeping bags with their boots on\" to instead say that the 60 American soldiers were heroically killed in battle resisting the Chinese raid. Berton came to deeply dislike the censorship that he was faced during the Korean war, complaining that he was writing reports that were full of lies and half-truths. Despite agreeing to the requests of the censors, Berton's reports focusing on the bleakness and savagery of the Korean War led to accusations that he was anti-war, and hence pro-Communist. Berton was later to write that though he had much respect for the Canadian veterans of Korea, he felt that Canada's involvement in the Korean war was a major mistake.\nEditor in Toronto.\nBerton moved to Toronto in 1947. At the age of 31 he was named managing editor of \"Maclean's\". In the 1950s, he published a series of articles in \"Maclean's\" that was later turned into his 1956 book \"The Mysterious North\", which recounted his experiences in the far north of Canada in a highly romanticized way. The book had only modest sales, but it led to Berton being perceived within the Canadian media as an expert on the far north, causing him to appear on television as the resident northern expert. In 1957, he became a key member of the CBC's public affairs flagship program, Close-Up, and a permanent panelist on the popular television show \"Front Page Challenge\". That same year, he also narrated the Academy Award-nominated National Film Board of Canada documentary \"City of Gold\", exploring life in his hometown of Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush. He then released an album in conjunction with Folkways Records, entitled \"The Story of the Klondike: Stampede for Gold \u2013 The Golden Trail.\"\nIn 1958, he published his best-selling book \"Klondike The Last Great Gold Rush\", a social history about the Klondike gold rush. Berton traced the appalling hardships faced by the thousands of people who came from around the world to seek their fortunes in the Klondike, the vast majority of whom failed to achieve their dreams of riches. Berton also covered the rise and fall of Dawson City, a boomtown that was full of bars, brothels and gambling halls that catered to the gold prospectors, giving it a disreputable reputation both at the time and since. The book's hero was the tough and stern Colonel Sam Steele, the Yukon commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, a policeman with an almost legendary reputation who upheld law and order during the gold rush. Berton's background as someone who grew up in the Yukon added to the book's appeal as many reviewers praised \"Klondike The Last Great Gold Rush\" for its sense of \"authenticity\".\nBerton joined the \"Toronto Star\" as associate editor of the \"Star Weekly\" and columnist for the daily paper in 1958. In April 1959, Berton went to Cairo with a camera crew from the \"Close-Up\" television show with the aim of interviewing President Gamal Abdel Nasser who turned out to be unwilling to be interviewed. To relieve the boredom as he waited for an entire month to interview Nasser, Berton had the \"Close-Up\" camera crew make a documentary about life in Egypt, which he credited with broadening his perspective. Following the Sharpeville massacre of 21 March 1960, when the South African police opened fire on a crowd of black South Africans protesting apartheid, killing 69 people while wounding about 180 people, Berton was one of the speakers at a fundraiser at Massey Hall that sought to raise money to treat those wounded in the massacre. Greatly shaken by the massacre, Berton used his column to criticize the apartheid system in South Africa, writing: \"The time has come for this country to finally take a stand on South Africa\". At the time, there was a split within the Commonwealth (considered more important at the time than today) between its predominately white members such as Britain, Australia, and New Zealand who wanted South Africa to stay vs. nonwhite members such as India, Pakistan, Ghana, and Malaya who were pressing to have South Africa expelled while Canada initially equivocated about where it stood. At the time, there were concerns that the question of South African membership might cause the break-up of the Commonwealth. Berton argued that Canada should side with the nonwhite bloc and use its influence to have South Africa expelled from the Commonwealth and not be permitted to return until apartheid ended.\nIn 1960, he performed an experiment, which demonstrated widespread anti-Semitism in the resort industry when he first mailed out a letter under the name Sol Cohen to 106 resorts in the Ontario countryside, asking to stay for two weeks, and the next day he mailed another set of letters to the same resorts under the name D.M. Douglas, again asking to stay for two weeks. The majority of the letters sent out under the name Cohen received the reply that the resorts were all booked up and there was no space or alternatively did not answer at all. By contrast, the majority of the letters sent out under the name Douglas all received the replies that he could stay for the requested two weeks. Berton compared the replies he received, noting there was a frosty tone to the replies to the Cohen letters while there was more warmth in the replies to the Douglas letters. Only the Green Gables lodge in Muskoka had been willing to allow Berton under the name Cohen to stay. In his column, Berton named all of the resorts that they were willing to rent to someone with the typically Scottish surname of Douglas while refusing to rent to someone with the typically Jewish surname of Cohen. The column provoked much discussion at the time, and led to demands to end the anti-Semitic policies of the resort owners.\nIn 1960, he visited Japan as part of his duties as a \"Toronto Star\" columnist to investigate Japan 15 years after the end of World War Two, where he was stunned by Japanese economic miracle as he noted all of the Japanese cities had been rebuilt after having bombed to utter ruin during the war. Berton visited Hiroshima and its Peace Memorial, where he found himself sickened by the photographs of the survivors of the atomic bombing of that city, writing that: \"for sheer horror it outdoes everything save the relics of Belsen and Buchenwald...I seemed to feel the little eyes of the Japanese boring into my back as I stared at those terrible pictures of heaped and peeling human bodies...The Germans, we are told, were stunned by motion pictures of the extermination camps. No sensitive Westerner can escape the same sense of guilt in the museum of Hiroshima. We roasted people to death over a slow fire. We tortured them just as surely as the Nazis tortured the Jews\". The comparison of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima to the Holocaust provoked controversy. Berton expressed much sadness in his columns about the fading of traditional Japanese culture as he noted the most popular form of plastic surgery for Japanese women was making their eyes appear Western; that Western music was being played everywhere including Shinto shrines; and the \"this typical Japanese family [that he had stayed with] was about typical as John David Eaton's would be in Toronto\". By the early 1960s, Berton's company, Pierre Berton Enterprises, was making an annual income of $37,000 at a time when the typical Canadian had an annual income of $5,187, making him and his family comfortably upper middle-class.\nAs a columnist, he turned the beating of the gambler Maxie Bluestein by the gangster Johnny Papalia on 21 March 1961 who used a steel pipe to nearly beat Bluestein to death in public into a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\". Berton called the beating of Bluestein a \"semi-execution\" brazenly committed in the front lobby of the popular Town Tavern nightclub of Toronto, and demanded that the police bring Papalia to justice despite the unwillingness of nearly 100 witnesses to testify. Berton described the beating: \"...as terrible a beating as it is possible to give a man without killing him...Iron bars with ropes attached to them for greater leverage rained down on Bluestein's head and across his forehead, eyes and cheekbones. His scalp was split seven or eight times. Knuckledusters were smashed into his eyes and a broken bottle was ground into his mouth. When Bluestein dropped to the floor, he was kicked in the face. His overcoat, torn and slashed, was literally drenched in his own blood... When I saw Bluestein, some 10 days after the affair, he looked like a piece of meat\". Papalia finally turned himself in as the case was attracting too much media attention for the comfort of his underworld associates.\nIn 1961, Berton wrote a children's book, \"The Secret World Of Og\" based on the whimsical stories he told his daughters in the 1950s. Berton's publisher, Jack McClelland, was skeptical about the sales potential of \"The Secret World of Og\", which he reluctantly published in the fall of 1961, apparently as a favor to Berton. The book turned out be very popular, selling out its first print run of 8,284 copies by the summer of 1962, and by the 1980s \"The Secret World of Og\" had sold 70,000 copies worldwide, making it into one of Berton's most successful books. Berton always answered the fan mail he received from children who liked \"The Secret World of Og\" right up to his death, which was the only fan mail that he consistently answered.\nPublic intellectual.\nBerton left the \"Star\" in 1962 to commence \"The Pierre Berton Show\", which ran until 1973. In January 1963, Berton started to work as a \"Maclean's\" columnist, where the other writers such as Robert Fulford and Peter Gzowski wanted to have him fired because the often frivolous and trivial nature of his columns were felt to be embarrassing. In May 1963, Berton was fired from \"Maclean's\" for a column he wrote entitled \"Let's Stop Hoaxing the Kids About Sex\", where he wrote that he would not object if his teenage daughters engaged in premarital sex, saying he hoped that they had enough wisdom to use a comfortable bed instead of a dingy backseat of a car. The column, which was intended as a criticism of sexualized advertising as Berton contended that teenage sex was the logical consequence of sexualized marketing, provoked national outrage and led to calls for a boycott of \"Maclean's\" if Berton continued to write. Berton always felt that being fired was unjustified, especially because the editors of \"Maclean's\" had wanted him to write provocative columns about contemporary issues to boost circulation.\nIn 1963, Berton received death threats when an episode about the \"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" (FLQ) aired on \"The Pierre Berton Show\". The show featured an interview with Sergeant Walter \"Rocky\" Leja of the Canadian Army, who had been badly injured when he attempted to dismantle a bomb planted by the FLQ in Montreal. The same episode featured an interview with Pierre Trudeau, at the time a law professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. In his interview with Berton, Trudeau stated that Quebec had received a \"raw deal\" from the rest of Canada, but went on to denounce Quebec separatism. Trudeau stated that the FLQ's claims that Quebec's situation was analogous to Algeria under French rule (with the FLQ playing the same role as the FLN) was nonsense; he said that French-Canadians like himself had nothing remotely like the status of Algerian Muslims under French rule. Trudeau stated that if Quebec became independent, it would be a \"banana republic\". Berton's interview with Trudeau is credited with first introducing him to an English-Canadian audience. Berton was able to persuade famous people to appear on his television show; in September 1964, during a visit to London, Berton interviewed the philosopher Bertrand Russell, the actress Vivien Leigh, the singer No\u00ebl Coward and the actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\nIn November 1964, Berton devoted an episode of his show to the youth culture of Britain, which had attracted worldwide attention following the success of the Beatles. In the episode, Berton unknowingly scored a scoop when he interviewed Mick Jagger and the other members of the newly formed Rolling Stones. When Berton asked Jagger about the charge that he was a bad influence on young people, he replied, \"I don't feel morally responsible for anyone\". The episode was credited with helping to popularize hairstyles and clothing associated with the mods and rockers, the two major sub-cultures within British culture at the time. In 1964, an episode of \"The Pierre Berton Show\" attracted national controversy when Berton examined the subject of homosexuality, which was illegal in Canada at the time. Berton interviewed several American homosexuals (no Canadian gays were willing to appear on the show) about their lifestyles, but the CBC would not air the episode again after receiving a flood of complaints. Like many journalists, Berton was interested in the \"Banks affair\", concerning an American gangster, Hal C. Banks, who, with the support of the Canadian government, had been allowed to take over the Communist-dominated Seafarers International Union in 1949. The way that Banks had operated as a sort of state-sanctioned criminal who had been allowed to engage in many acts of violence was immensely controversial. In an episode aired on 22 November 1964, Berton pressed Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson about the Banks affair, leading Pearson to admit that Banks had been a major campaign donor to the Liberal Party in the 1950s, which Pearson had denied up until that time. Starting in December 1964, Berton started to broadcast a Christmas special on his TV show from his home in Kleinburg, covering his family's celebration of Christmas.\nIn 1965, Berton published a best-selling book, \"The Comfortable Pew\", which was quite critical of the Anglican Church, whose teachings Berton condemned as sanctimonious, conformist, submissive to power, and hypocritical with respect to sexuality and other social issues. Within weeks of its publication, the book's first print run of 100,000 copies sold out, making Berton about $25,000. At the time, the Church of England was one of the leading social institutions in English-Canadian society, and the book produced a storm of controversy as Berton urged church leaders to accept birth control, premarital sex and homosexuality. Berton called for the Anglican Church to accept what he called \"real Christian love, in all its flexibility, with all of its concern for real people rather than for any fixed set of principles\".\nThe controversy caused by \"The Comfortable Pew\" made Berton an ubiquitous figure in Canadian media, leading the columnist Denis Braithwaite to complain in \"The Globe &amp; Mail\" that Canadians were now living in the \"Berton era\". Braithwaite wrote: \"Virtually every media outlet is preoccupied with Pierre Berton and his new book. We get Berton in the morning and Berton at night. He is in the book section, the religion section, the TV section of our daily newspapers; he is the subject of feature articles and gossipy items in the national magazines; he is interviewed by every disc jockey, advice to the housewife dispenser, numerologist and pitchmen on every radio station in the land; he is on every television program, on every Canadian television channel, not just once in a while or two or three times a day, but all day, everyday-or so it seems. Our children lisp his name, our teenagers take his advice on sex; our wives curtsey to his image\".\nIn the 1960s, Berton was a leading member of the Sordsmen's Club [\"sic\"], a group of Toronto intellectuals and businessmen who met for expensive lunches with women who were not their wives, and who were forbidden to attend its meetings unless their husband was not present. Other members included Jack McCllelland, John C. Parkin, Harold Town, George Fryer, Chuck Rathgreb, Arthur Hailey, and Ralph McCreath. Women who attended the lunches included the columnist Nancy Philips; the journalist Adrienne Clarkson; the singer Dinah Carroll; the journalist Barbara Moon; Joan Taylor, the wife of a sports journalist; the broadcaster Joan McCormack; and the art gallery owner Dorothy Cameron. About the club, Philips said in 1986: \"We had an idea that we shouldn't go home alone, let's put it that way\". A later controversy developed when it emerged that at end of the lunches, which typically occurred on a Friday afternoon and lasted five hours, each man stood behind a woman of his choosing with whom he expected to have sex.\nIn 1968, Berton became concerned that his books dealing with contemporary issues would become dated and forgotten with the passage of time. He noted that \"Klondike\", his account of the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s, had a more timeless quality since it covered a subject that would not become dated, and indeed was the subject of enduring popular fascination. At the same time, he noted that with the notable exceptions of Donald Creighton and W. L. Morton, Canada had no story-teller historians who wrote popular and accessible narratives of Canadian history. For reasons of pride and Canadian nationalism, Berton set out to become a story-teller historian who would write books for a mass audience. For his first book, his subject was the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 19th century, which he intended as a national epic. Berton wanted to give the struggle to build the CPR a role analogous to that of the Revolutionary War in American memory, as the founding national epic. In this regard, Berton acknowledged the importance of Confederation in 1867, but argued that Canada did not truly become a nation until the CPR was completed in 1885. Berton defined the building of the railroad as a struggle of man against nature, seeing it as a triumph of human ingenuity and willpower, as the builders defeated the harsh landscape of northern Ontario, the seemingly endless Prairies, and the imposing Rocky Mountains. In the spring of 1968, Berton began his research for his railroad saga, which became \"The National Dream\" and \"The Last Spike\". Before the 1960s, the major divisions in English-Canadian society were between continentalism (i.e., moving Canada closer to the United States), associated with the Liberal Party, and imperialism (which in a Canadian context meant closer ties with Great Britain), associated with the Conservative party. The 1960s saw the emergence of the \"new nationalism\" that rejected both continentalism and imperialism as options. Berton became one of the principle spokesmen for this new nationalism, as he argued that Canada could stand alone as a great nation.\n\"The Pierre Berton Show\" was a popular television show owing to famous guests from Canada and around the world. In the 1968\u20131969 season, Berton interviewed from the United States the burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee, the actress Sharon Tate, the pornographer Bob Guccione, the \"playmate novelist\" Alice Denham, the actor Charlton Heston, and Rachel Jones (an airline stewardess who was presented at the time as one of the co-authors of the bestselling 1967 pseudo-memoir \"Coffee, Tea or Me?\" detailing her supposed erotic history). That season, Canadian guests included the singer Neil Young, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, the journalist Laurier LaPierre, the columnist Peter C. Newman and the feminist activist June Callwood. In early 1969, Berton's show aired a five-part series called \"The Indian Revolution\", about the emerging Red Power movement. One of the episodes, \"The Rape of the Languages\", featured an early expose of the residential schools. Berton interviewed several First Nations people in support of his thesis that indigenous peoples had been \"beaten, starved, and otherwise punished by church and federal schools\". The choice of guests and themes that season reflected what had become the show's main focus, namely a mixture of \"celebrities, sex, and social justice\". In July 1969, Berton had the telephone removed from his house in Kleinburg, and claimed he was leaving for Mexico. He spent the summer of 1969 writing his railroad epic, which came to be divided into two volumes owing to its length with his work finally being finished in December 1969.\nIn 1971 Berton interviewed Bruce Lee, the famous martial artist's only surviving television interview. Berton's television career included spots as host and writer on \"My Country\", \"The Great Debate\", \"Heritage Theatre\", \"The Secret of My Success\" and \"The National Dream\". From 1966 to 1984, Berton and long-time collaborator Charles Templeton made the daily syndicated radio debate show \"Dialogue\", based first at CFRB and later at CKEY.\nBerton came to be Canada's best-known intellectual. His biographer, Brian McKillop wrote: \"No one in Canada or for that matter in North America, managed to take hold of the full range of the mainstream media with the same kind of commanding presence and authority. One searches in vain for an American or British equivalent. It is if he somehow carried the DNA of Edward R. Murrow and Jack Paar, Vance Packard and Michael Harrington, Bernard DeVoto and Studs Terkel, with more than a little Garrison Keillor in the mix. Each of these figures\u2014a war correspondent who spoke truth to power; a host of the most watched and enduring television interview program of its era; a muckraking journalist in the age of the consumer; a left-wing critic of North American society; a popular and respected historian of nation and empire in North America; a collector of the kind of folklore that serves as the first draft of history; a folksy, story-telling humorist of nostalgic bent\u2014was or is a man of exceptional accomplishment in his own area. The magnitude of Berton's achievement was that he spanned them all and become more than their sum\".\nHistorian.\nIn 1970, book one of Berton's epic about the building of the CPR, \"The National Dream\" was published, becoming a great critical and commercial success by 1971. Book two of the series, \"The Last Spike\", was published in 1971 and was even more successful with the public. The success of \"The Last Spike\" transformed Berton into a sort of \"national institution\" as he became the popular story-teller historian that he set out to be. Such was the popularity of \"The Last Spike\" that in 1972 that stores sold mementoes related to the book, which was most unusual for a history book. In a review, the American historian Ralph Hidy wrote that Berton's railroad saga was an \"essentially sound\" history that was relatively free of errors. Hidy stated that though Berton broke no new ground in his railroad saga, his work was very \"lively\" and carried \"the reader through one cliff-hanging situation after another\". The sections dealing with the building of the Rocky mountains section of the CPR are generally considered to be the vivid and exciting part of Berton's railroad epic. Berton described how the railroad builders had to quite literally blast and hack their way through the sheer granite of the Rocky mountains, which was an extremely difficult, dangerous and arduous task, given the technology of the time. Hidy wrote that as a work of narrative popular history, Berton succeeded admirably in telling the story of the construction of the CPR over daunting odds, and in impressing the reader as to why the building of the CPR, which was completed five years ahead of schedule, was considered one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century. However, other historians were more critical. Michael Bliss felt that Berton's picture of the Prime Minister, Sir John A. MacDonald, was too colored by hero-worship as Bliss in a critical review stated that Berton went beyond even Creighton (whose two-volume biography of MacDonald was very sympathetic towards its subject) in portraying MacDonald as the heroic prime minister.\nIn common with many other Canadians, Berton found the 1970s to be an unpleasant decade as the recession caused by the Arab oil shock of 1973\u201374 put an end to the \"long summer\" of prosperity that had begun in 1945 while the election of the separatist PQ government in Quebec in 1976 led to doubts about whatever Canada would even last as a nation. By 1979, on the threshold of a new decade that seemed to promise only more trouble, Berton came to feel that Canada needed another national epic to give hope in dark and uncertain times. As the subject of his new national epic, Berton chose the War of 1812 with the first of his books, \"The Invasion of Canada\" dealing with the subject being published in 1980, and the second one, \"Flames Across the Border\" in 1981. Berton chose to interpret the War of 1812 as not a war between the United States and Great Britain which just happened to be fought in North America, but rather as the beginning of a Canadian national identity. Though Berton's nationalist interpretation of the War of 1812 was not accepted by most historians it certainly appealed to the Canadian public and his books dealing with the War of 1812 sold very well.\nIn his 1984 book \"The Promised Land\", he covered the settlement of the Prairie provinces in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pierre set out to debunk the heroic image of the colonization of the West by focusing on the hardships and suffering of the farmers who could be easily ruined by crop failures. He focused instead on the tenacity and sheer determination of the settlers and provided a new heroic image of the settlement of the West. In 1986, he published \"Vimy\", which was one of his more successful books dealing with the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. Berton provoked much controversy that his thesis that Vimy may have been a great victory that saw all the four divisions of the Canadian corps fight together for the first time to achieve what had been considered an impossible task, namely to take the heavily fortified Vimy ridge that towered about the Douai plain, but the victory were not worth the sacrifices of thousands of young men who were either killed or wounded. Berton noted that 1 out of 10 Canadians who stormed up the heights of Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917 were either killed or wounded, leading him to the conclusion that it would be better if the battle had not been fought at all.\n1990s-2000s.\nIn 1992, he published \"Niagara: A History\", a social history dealing with the people associated with the Niagara Falls together with a follow-up picture book of Niagara falls in 1993. Unlike his other books, the Niagara books sold poorly, which marked the beginning of his decline from his position as Canada's preeminent public intellectual. The decline of the appeal of his books was linked to the decline of the \"new nationalism\" he had been associated with. Berton almost seemed to acknowledge the decline of the \"new nationalism\" in his 1997 book \"1967 The Last Good Year\", arguing that the Centennial year of 1967 was the highpoint of Canadian history and everything that had happened since 1967 had been a story of decline and decay. In a review of \"Onward to War\" in the \"Globe &amp; Mail\" in October 2001, the historian Modris Eksteins wrote: \"'Canada's historian', as his publishers are describing him in recent advertising, takes us with his usual narrative verve across sundry battlefields, of South Africa, northern Europe and Korea, but also Ottawa and other venues of our domestic political strife...is this kind of judgmental narrative what history should be in the 21st century? If the world changed in the last century as dramatically as Berton insists, can - or should - history be written in much the same way Carlyle and Macaulay presented it over a century ago? ...That vision of the past as an interconnected whole has shattered over the century about which Berton writes, as if hit by a mammoth artillery shell, but there's no sign of this in his account.\nHonours.\nBerton served as the chancellor of Yukon College and, along with numerous honorary degrees, received over 30 literary awards such as the Governor General's Award for Creative Non-Fiction (three times), the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, and the Gabrielle L\u00e9ger Award for Lifetime Achievement in Heritage Conservation in 1989. He is a member of Canada's Walk of Fame, having been inducted in 1998. In The Greatest Canadian project, he was voted No. 31 in the list of great Canadians. Berton was named Toronto Humanist of the Year 2003 by the Humanist Association of Toronto. The honour is presented by H.A.T. to men and women who, in their actions and creative endeavours, exemplify the principles of Humanism: a commitment to reason, compassion, ethics and human dignity. In 1992, he was named a member of the Order of Ontario. In 1974, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada; in 1986, he was named a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest decoration.\nRetirement.\nIn 2004, Berton published his 50th book, \"Prisoners of the North\", after which he announced in an interview with CanWest News Service that he was retiring from writing. On October 17, 2004, the CA$12.6-million Pierre Berton Resource Library, named in his honour, was opened in Vaughan, Ontario.\nHe had lived in nearby Kleinburg, Ontario, for about 50 years.\nBerton attracted attention in October 2004 by discussing his 40 years of recreational use of marijuana on two CBC Television programs, \"Play\" and \"Rick Mercer Report\". On the latter show he gave a \"celebrity tip\" on how to roll a joint.\nPersonal life.\nBerton married Janet Walker in 1946. They had eight children. Berton was an atheist.\nDeath.\nBerton died at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, of heart failure, at the age of 84 on November 30, 2004. His cremated remains were scattered at his home in Kleinburg. He was survived by his wife and their eight children, along with 14 grandchildren.\nLegacy.\nEstablished in 1994, the Pierre Berton Award is presented annually by Canada's National History Society for distinguished achievement in presenting Canadian history in an informative and engaging manner. Berton was the first recipient and agreed to lend his name to future awards.\nHis childhood home in Dawson City, Yukon, now called Berton House, is currently used as a retreat for professional Canadian writers. Established authors apply for a three-month-long subsidized residency, adding to the area's literary community with events such as local public readings. Previously, the Berton House Writers' Retreat was administered by the Berton House Writers' Retreat Society and Elsa Franklin, Pierre Berton's long-time editor and agent. In October 2007, the deed to Berton House was passed to the Writers' Trust of Canada; the literary organization now oversees the program as part of its roster of literary support.\nA school in Vaughan, Ontario, was named for Pierre Berton in the York Region District School Board in September 2011. The Berton family visited and had an official opening of the school in front of the students.\nHonorary degrees.\nPierre Berton received many honorary degrees in recognition of his work as a writer and historian. These include:\nBibliography.\nHistory for Young Canadians.\nThe Great Klondike Gold Rush.\nThere is also Berton's abridged version of \"The National Dream\" and \"The Last Spike\" that was published in 1974 and a compendium of the two books \u201cThe Invasion of Canada\u201d and Flames Across the Border\u201d entitled the \u201cWar of 1812\u201d published in 1980,\nA comprehensive biography of Pierre Berton was written by A. B. McKillop. It was published in 2008, four years after Berton's death aged 84.\nAll of Pierre Berton's writings, including finished books and articles as well as manuscripts, drafts, and research material are now held in the Pierre Berton fonds at the McMaster University Archives.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62134", "revid": "12660694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62134", "title": "Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17", "text": "Soviet jet fighter aircraft family\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 (; NATO reporting name: Fresco) is a transonic fighter aircraft produced in the Soviet Union from 1952 and was operated by air forces internationally. The MiG-17 was license-built in China as the Shenyang J-5 and Poland as the PZL-Mielec Lim-6. The MiG-17 is still being used by the North Korean air force in the present day and has seen combat in the Middle East and Asia.\nThe MiG-17 was an advanced modification of the MiG-15 aircraft produced by the Soviet Union during the Korean War. Production of the MiG-17 was too late for use in that conflict and was first used in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. While the MiG-17 was designed to shoot down slower American bombers, it showed surprising success when used by North Vietnamese pilots to combat American fighters and fighter-bombers during the Vietnam War, nearly a decade after its initial design. This was due to the MiG-17 being more agile and maneuverable than the American F-4 Phantom and F-105 Thunderchief, which were focused on speed and long range combat, as well as the fact that MiG-17 was armed with guns, which initial models of the F-4 Phantom lacked.\nDesign and development.\nWhile the MiG-15bis introduced swept wings to air combat over Korea, the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau had already begun work on its replacement in 1949 (originally the MiG-15bis45) in order to fix any problems found with the MiG-15 in combat. The result was one of the most successful transonic fighters introduced before the advent of true supersonic types such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 and North American F-100 Super Sabre. The design ultimately proved effective into the 1960s when pressed into subsonic dogfights over Vietnam against much faster planes that were not optimized for maneuvering in such lower speed, short-range engagements.\nWhile the MiG-15 used a Mach sensor to deploy airbrakes because it could not safely exceed Mach\u00a00.92, the MiG-17 was designed to be controllable at higher Mach numbers. Early versions that retained the original Soviet copy of the Rolls-Royce Nene engine, the Klimov VK-1, were heavier with equal thrust. Later MiG-17s were the first Soviet fighter application of an afterburner, which burned extra fuel in the exhaust of the basic engine to give extra thrust at a high efficiency cost.\nThough the MiG-17 looks very similar to the MiG-15, it had a new thinner and more highly swept wing and tailplane for speeds approaching Mach\u00a01. While the F-86 introduced the \"all-flying\" tailplane, which made the aircraft more controllable near the speed of sound, this feature was not adopted on MiG aircraft until the fully supersonic MiG-19. The wing sweep was 45\u00b0 (like the U.S. F-100 Super Sabre) near the fuselage and 42\u00b0 for the outboard part of the wing. The stiffer wing resisted the tendency to bend its wingtips and lose aerodynamic symmetry unexpectedly at high speeds and wing loads.\nOther easily visible differences to its predecessor were the addition of a third wing fence on each wing, the addition of a ventral fin and a longer and less tapered rear fuselage that added about one meter in length. The MiG-17 shared the same Klimov VK-1 engine, and much of the rest of its construction such as the forward fuselage, landing gear and gun installation was carried over. The first prototype, designated I-330 \"SI\" by the construction bureau, was flown on 14 January 1950, piloted by Ivan Ivashchenko.\nIn the midst of testing, pilot Ivan Ivashchenko was killed when his aircraft developed flutter, which tore off his horizontal tail, causing a spin and crash on 17 March 1950. Lack of wing stiffness also resulted in aileron reversal which was discovered and fixed. Construction and tests of additional prototypes \"SI-2\" and experimental series aircraft \"SI-02\" and \"SI-01\" in 1951, were generally successful. On 1 September 1951, the aircraft was accepted for production, and formally given its own MiG-17 designation after so many changes from the original MiG-15. It was estimated that with the same engine as the MiG-15's, the MiG-17's maximum speed is higher by 40\u201350\u00a0km/h, and the fighter has greater maneuverability at high altitude.\nSerial production started in August 1951, but large quantity production was delayed in favor of producing more MiG-15s so it was never introduced in the Korean War. It did not enter service until October 1952, when the MiG-19 was almost ready to be flight tested. During production, the aircraft was improved and modified several times. The basic MiG-17 was a general-purpose day fighter, armed with three cannons, one Nudelman N-37 37\u00a0mm cannon and two 23\u00a0mm with 80 rounds per gun, 160 rounds total. It could also act as a fighter-bomber, but its bombload was considered light relative to other aircraft of the time, and it usually carried additional fuel tanks instead of bombs.\nAlthough a canopy that provided clear vision to the rear\u2014necessary for air-to-air combat (dogfighting), like the F-86\u2014was designed, production MiG-17Fs got a cheaper rear-view periscope, which still appeared on Soviet fighters as late as the MiG-23. By 1953, pilots got safer ejection seats with protective face curtains and leg restraints like the Martin-Baker seats in the West. The MiG-15 had suffered for its lack of a radar gunsight, but in 1951, Soviet engineers obtained a captured F-86 Sabre from Korea, and copied the optical gunsight and SRD-3 gun ranging radar to produce the ASP-4N gunsight and SRC-3 radar. The combination proved deadly over the skies of Vietnam against aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom, whose pilots lamented that guns and radar gunsights had been omitted as obsolescent.\nThe second prototype variant, \"SP-2\" (dubbed \"Fresco A\" by NATO), was an interceptor equipped with a radar. Soon a number of MiG-17P (\"Fresco B\") all-weather fighters were produced with the RP-1 Izumrud radar and front air intake modifications.\nIn early 1953 the MiG-17F day fighter entered production. The \"F\" indicated it was fitted with the VK-1F engine with an afterburner by modifying the rear fuselage with a new convergent-divergent nozzle and fuel system. Early VK-1F engines that were specifically modified to equip the MIG-17F had issues during prolonged normal afterburner usage, due to the insufficient heat resistance of the alloys used for the external nozzle body and stator vanes. Because of this, early 1953-1955 production planes had a special afterburner unit that used a separate tank filled with 90% ethanol for consumption in the afterburner due to its lower combustion temperature. This engine variant was labeled VK-1F(A). Later production jets used a normal system with on-board fuel. The afterburner doubled the rate of climb and greatly improved vertical maneuvers. But while the plane was not designed to be supersonic, skilled pilots could just dash to supersonic speed in a shallow dive, although the aircraft would often pitch up just short of Mach\u00a01. This became the most popular variant of the MiG-17. The next mass-produced variant, MiG-17PF (\"Fresco D\") incorporated a more powerful Izumrud RP-2 radar, though they were still dependent on Ground Control Interception to find and be directed to targets. In 1956 a small series (47 aircraft) was converted to the MiG-17PM standard (also known as PFU) with four first-generation Kaliningrad K-5 (NATO reporting name AA-1 'Alkali') air-to-air missiles. A small series of MiG-17R reconnaissance aircraft were built with VK-1F engine (after first being tested with the VK-5F engine).\n5,467 MiG-17, 1,685 MiG-17F, 225 MiG-17P and 668 MiG-17PF were built in the USSR by 1958. Over 2,600 were built under licence in Poland and China.\nLicense production.\nIn 1955, Poland received a license for MiG-17 production. The MiG-17F was produced by the WSK-Mielec factory under the designation Lim-5 (an abbreviation of \"licencyjny my\u015bliwiec\" \u2013 license-built fighter). The first Lim-5 was built on 28 November 1956 and 477 were built by 1960. Apart from Poland, a number were exported to Bulgaria, designated as MiG-17F. An unknown number were built as the Lim-5R reconnaissance variant, fitted with the AFA-39 camera. In 1959\u20131960, 129 MiG-17PF interceptors were produced as the Lim-5P. WSK-Mielec also developed several Polish strike variants based on the MiG-17: the Lim-5M, produced from 1960; Lim-6bis, produced from 1963 (totaling 170 aircraft). Additionally some Lim-5Ps were converted in the 1970s into attack Lim-6Ms whereas other Lim-5, Lim-6bis and Lim-5P aircraft were modified for reconnaissance role as the Lim-6R, Lim-6bis R and Lim-6MR.\nIn the People's Republic of China (PRC), an initial MiG-17F was assembled from parts in 1956, with license production following in 1957 at Shenyang. The Chinese-built version is known as the Shenyang J-5 (for local use) or F-5 (for export). Similarly the MiG-17PF was manufactured there as the J-5A (F-5A for export). Altogether 767 of these single-seater variants were built.\nOperational history.\nMiG-17s were designed to intercept straight-and-level-flying enemy bombers, not for dogfighting with other fighters. This subsonic (Mach\u00a0.93) fighter was effective against slower (Mach\u00a0.6-.8), heavily loaded U.S. fighter-bombers, as well as the mainstay American strategic bombers during the MiG-17's development cycle (such as the Boeing B-50 Superfortress or Convair B-36 Peacemaker, which were both still powered by piston engines). It was not however able to intercept the new generation of British jet bombers such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, which could both fly higher. The USAF's introduction of strategic bombers capable of supersonic dash speeds such as the Convair B-58 Hustler and General Dynamics FB-111 rendered the MiG-17 obsolete in front-line PVO service, and they were supplanted by supersonic interceptors such as the MiG-21 and MiG-23.\nMiG-17s were not available for the Korean War, but saw combat for the first time over the Straits of Taiwan when the Communist PRC MiG-17s clashed with the Republic of China (ROC, Nationalist China) F-86 Sabres in 1958.\nMiG-17s downed a spy aircraft in the 1958 C-130 shootdown incident over Armenia, with 17 casualties.\nVietnam War.\nIn 1960, the first group of approximately 50 North Vietnamese airmen were transferred to the PRC to begin transitional training onto the MiG-17. By this time the first detachment of Chinese trained MiG-15 pilots had returned to North Vietnam, and a group of 31 airmen were deployed to the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) base at Son Dong for conversion to the MiG-17. By 1962 the first North Vietnamese pilots had finished their MiG-17 courses in the Soviet Union and the PRC, and returned to their units; to mark the occasion, the Soviets sent as a \"gift\" 36 MiG-17 fighters and MiG-15UTI trainers to Hanoi in February 1964. These airmen would create North Vietnam's first jet fighter regiment, the 921st. By 1965, another group of MiG pilots had returned from training in Krasnodar, in the USSR, as well as from the PRC. This group would form North Vietnam's second fighter unit, the 923rd Fighter Regiment. While the newly created 923rd FR operated only MiG-17s, and initially these were the only types available to oppose modern American supersonic jets before MiG-21s and MiG-19s were introduced into North Vietnamese service (the 925 FR regiment was formed in 1969, flying MiG-19s).\nAmerican fighter-bombers had been in theatre flying combat sorties since 1961, and the U.S. had many experienced pilots from the Korean War and World War II, such as World War II veteran Robin Olds. Untried MiGs and pilots of the VPAF would be pitted against some of the most combat experienced airmen of the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and U.S. Navy. On 3 April 1965 six MiGs took off from Noi Bai Air Base in two groups of two and four respectively, with the first acting as bait and the second being the shooters. Their target were U.S. Navy aircraft supporting an USAF 80-aircraft strike package trying to knock out the Thanh H\u00f3a Bridge. The MiG-17 leader, Lt. Pham Ngoc Lan, attacked a group of Vought F-8 Crusaders of VF-211 from and damaged an F-8E flown by Lt. Cdr. Spence Thomas, who managed to land the aircraft at Da Nang Air Base. A second F-8 was claimed by his wingman Phan Van Tuc, but this is not corroborated by USN loss listings.\nOn 4 April 1965, the USAF made another attempt on the Thanh H\u00f3a Bridge with 48 Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) loaded with 384 x bombs. The Thunderchiefs were escorted by a MIGCAP flight of F-100 Super Sabres from the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron (416th TFS). Coming from above, four MiG-17s from the 921st Fighter Regiment bypassed the escorts and dove onto the Thunderchiefs, shooting two of them down; the leader Tran Hanh downed F\u2011105D BuNo. \"59-1754\" of Major F. E. Benett, and his element leader Le Minh Huan downed F-105D BuNo. \"59-1764\" of Captain J. A. Magnusson. The Super Sabres engaged; one AIM-9 Sidewinder was fired and missed (or malfunctioned), and another F-100D flown by Captain Donald Kilgus fired 20\u00a0mm cannons, scoring a probable kill. Tran Hanh's wingman Pham Giay went down and was killed. No other U.S. airmen reported any confirmed aerial kills during the air battle; Tran Hanh stated that three of his accompanying MiG-17s had been shot down by the opposing USAF fighters.\nThree F-100s from the MiGCAP, piloted by LtCol Emmett L. Hays, Capt Keith B. Connolly, and Capt Donald W. Kilgus, all from the 416th TFS, had engaged the MiG-17s. The four attacking MiGs from the 921st FR were flown by Flight Leader Tran Hanh, Wingman Pham Giay, Le Minh Huan and Tran Nguyen Nam. Flight Leader Tran Hanh was the only Vietnamese survivor from the air battle and believed that the others in his flight were \"... shot down by the F-105s.\" Based upon the report, the USAF F-100s could have been mistaken for F-105s, and the loss of three MiG-17s was attributed to Super Sabres, the first aerial victories of any American aircraft in the war. The F-100s themselves would never again encounter MiGs, being relegated to close air support. They were replaced in the MiGCAP role by faster and longer range but less manoeuvrable McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms.\nUSAF Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell was \"hopping mad\" to hear that two Mach-2-class F-105s had been shot down by Korean War-era subsonic North Vietnamese MiG-17s.\nIn 1965, the NVAF had only 36 MiG-17s and a similar number of qualified pilots, which increased to 180 MiGs and 72 pilots by 1968. The Americans had at least 200 USAF F-4s and 140 USAF F-105s, plus at least 100 U.S. Navy aircraft (F-8s, A-4s and F-4s) which operated from the aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin, plus scores of other support aircraft. The Americans had a multiple numerical advantage.\nThe MiG-17 was the primary interceptor of the fledgling VPAF in 1965, responsible for their first aerial victories and seeing extensive service during the Vietnam War. Some North Vietnamese pilots preferred the MiG-17 over the MiG-21 because it was more agile, though not as fast; three of the 16 VPAF Aces of the war (credited with shooting down five or more opposing aircraft) were from MiG-17s. Those were: Nguyen Van Bay (seven victories), Luu Huy Chao and Le Hai (both with six). The rest gained ace status in MiG-21s.\nMiG-17/J-5 aerial combat victories in the Vietnam War 1965\u20131972.\nThis table lists VPAF and Chinese air-to-air kills. Sources include Hobson p.\u00a0271 and Toperczer (#25) pp.\u00a088\u201390.\nVPAF flew their interceptors with guidance from ground controllers, who directed the MiGs to ambush American formations. The MIGs made fast attacks against US formations from several directions (usually the MiG-17s performed head-on attacks and the MiG-21s attacked from the rear). After shooting down a few American planes and forcing some of the F-105s to drop their bombs prematurely, the MiGs did not wait for retaliation, but disengaged rapidly. This \"guerrilla warfare in the air\" proved very successful.\nThe MiG-17 was not originally designed to function as a fighter-bomber, but in 1971 Hanoi directed that United States Navy warships were to be attacked by elements of the VPAF. This would require the MiG-17 to be fitted with bomb mountings and release mechanisms. Chief Engineer of the VPAF ground crews, Truong Khanh Chau, was tasked with the mission of modifying two MiG-17s for the ground attack role; after three months of work, the two jets were ready. On 19 April 1972, two pilots from the 923rd FR took their bomb laden MiG-17s and attacked the U.S. Navy destroyer and light cruiser . Each MiG was armed with two bombs. Pilot Le Xuan Di managed to hit the destroyer's aft 5\" (127\u00a0mm) gun mount, destroying it, but inflicting no fatalities, as the crewmen had vacated the turret earlier due to a malfunction with the gun system.\nFrom 1965 to 1972, MiG-17s from the VPAF 921st and 923rd FRs would claim 71 aerial victories against U.S. aircraft: 11 Crusaders, 16 F-105 Thunderchiefs, 32 F-4 Phantom IIs, two A-4 Skyhawks, seven A-1 Skyraiders, one C-47 cargo/transport aircraft, one Sikorsky CH-3C helicopter and one Ryan Firebee UAV, while VPAF lost 63 MiG-17s in air combat According to Russian sources, from 1965 to 1972, MiG-17s from the VPAF shot down 143 enemy aircraft and helicopters, while VPAF lost 75 MiG-17s through all causes and 49 pilots were killed\nThe American fighter community was shocked in 1965 when elderly, subsonic MiG-17s downed sophisticated Mach-2-class F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers over North Vietnam. As a result of these experiences the U.S. Air Force initiated project \"Feather Duster\" aimed at developing tactics that would enable the heavier American fighters to deal with smaller and more agile opponents like the MiG-17. To simulate the MiG-17 the U.S. Air Force chose the F-86H Sabre. One pilot who participated in the project remarked that \"In any envelope except nose down and full throttle\", either the F-100 or F-105 was inferior to the F-86H in a dogfight. The project was generally successful in that the resulting tactics effectively minimized the disadvantages of the F-105, F-100 and other heavy American fighters while minimising the advantages of slower but more manoeuvrable fighters such as the F-86 and the MiG-17.\nOther MiG-17 users.\nTwenty countries flew MiG-17s. The MiG-17 became a standard fighter in all Warsaw Pact countries in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were also bought by many other countries, mainly in Africa and Asia, that were neutrally aligned or allied with the USSR. The MiG-17 still flies today in the air forces of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Mali, Madagascar, Sudan, and Tanzania, and by extension through the Shenyang J-5, North Korea. JJ-5s trainers are still in limited use in China as well.\nMiddle East.\nThe Egyptian Air Force received its first MiG-17s in 1956, deploying them against the Israeli invasion of the Sinai during the early stages of the Suez Crisis. When Britain and France launched air attacks against Egyptian air bases on 1 November 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the Egyptian Air Force not to oppose the Anglo-French air strikes, and where possible to evacuate its aircraft to Syria or Saudi Arabia, so while Egypt lost large numbers of aircraft, including MiG-17s, losses of pilots were relatively low. The losses were quickly replaced after the end of the war, and by June 1957 Egypt had about 100 MiG-17s.&gt; Syria also operated the MiG-17, receiving 60 MiG-17Fs in 1957. The two air forces gradually switched the MiG-17 to ground-attack duties in the early 1960s, as the MiG-21 supplanted it in the interceptor role. From 1962, Egyptian forces became involved in the North Yemen Civil War, supporting the republican government, with Egyptian MiG-17s flying ground attack operations.\nThe MiG-17 formed a major part of the Arab air strength during the Six-Day War in June 1967. The war started with a massive airstrike by Israel against Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi airbases, with more than 150 Egyptian aircraft destroyed or damaged. Egypt's surviving MiG-17s were heavily deployed in ground attacks against Israeli forces in the Sinai. The Soviet Union again replaced Egypt's losses after the war, and Egypt was soon involved in the War of Attrition, a sustained series of armed clashes on and over Sinai, with Egypt's MiG-17s continuing to be used in the ground attack role. While the MiG-17 was slower and shorter-ranged than the Sukhoi Su-7 that was the other main component of Egypt's ground-attack forces, the MiG-17 was more manoeuvrable and sustained lower losses. From 1970, Egypt deployed detachments of MiG-17s to Sudan to support government forces during the First Sudanese Civil War. The MiG-17 continued in use in the Yom Kippur War. MiG-17s were used during the Ofira Air Battle by Egypt. Egyptian and Syrian MiG-17s retired shortly after these wars.\nAfrica.\nAt least 24 of them served with the Nigerian Air Force and were flown by a mixed group of Nigerian and mercenary pilots from East Germany, Soviet Union, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia during the 1967\u201370 Nigerian Civil War.\nAsia.\nIndonesian Air Force received up to 65 MiG-17 in 1959, consisted of Chinese-built Shenyang Type 56 and Polish-built Lim-5 and Lim-5P. On 9 March 1960, an Indonesian Air Force pilot affiliated with the Permesta movement strafed several strategic locations in the capital Jakarta, including the presidential palace, using a MiG-17 with tail number \"F-1112\". During the Operation Trikora in 1961\u20131962, MiG-17s were deployed to the frontline airfields of Amahai, Morotai and Letfuan in eastern Indonesia to provide air cover against potential attack by the Dutch. The deterioration of relationships with Eastern Bloc countries following the 30 September Movement in 1965 and its subsequent anti-communist purge caused the Indonesian MiG-17 fleet to suffer maintenance problems due to lack of spare parts and support from foreign expert technicians. The MiG-17 along with most Eastern Bloc type aircraft still in Indonesian service were grounded in 1970. Two Lim-5 were sold to the United States in early 1970s and used by the USAF's 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron.\nFour were hurriedly supplied by the USSR to Sri Lanka during the 1971 insurgency and were used for bombing and ground attack in the brief insurgency.\nSoviet Union.\nIn 1958, a US Air Force Lockheed C-130 was shot down by four MiG-17 fighters when it flew into Soviet airspace near Yerevan, Armenia while on a Sun Valley Signal intelligence mission, with all 17 crew killed.\nUnited States.\nA number of U.S. federal agencies undertook a program at Groom Lake to evaluate the MiG-17 to help fight the Vietnam War, as the kill ratio against North Vietnamese MiG-17s and MiG-21s was only 2:1. The program was code-named HAVE DRILL (see also Have Doughnut), involving trials of two ex-Syrian MiG-17F Frescos, acquired and provided by Israel, over the skies of Groom Lake. These aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they may be identified in DOD standard flight logs.\nIn addition to tracking the dog fights staged between the various MiG models against virtually every fighter in U.S. service, and against SAC's B-52 Stratofortresses and B-58 Hustlers to test the ability of the bombers\u2019 countermeasures systems, they also performed radar cross-section and propulsion tests that contributed greatly to improvements in U.S. aerial performance in Vietnam.\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are 17 privately owned MiG-17s in the US.

The strait derives its name from the dangers attending its navigation or, according to an Arab legend, from the numbers who were drowned by an earthquake that separated the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa.\nHistory.\nPaleo-environmental and tectonic events in the Miocene epoch created the Danakil Isthmus, a land bridge forming a broad connection between Yemen and Ethiopia. During the last 100,000 years, eustatic sea level fluctuations have led to alternate opening and closing of the straits. According to the recent single origin hypothesis, the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were probably witness to the earliest migrations of modern humans. It is presumed that the oceans were then much lower and the straits were much shallower or dry, which allowed a series of emigrations along the southern coast of Asia.\nIn Arab tradition it is reported that in ancient times Asia and Africa were joined together, until\nthey were split at the Bab-el-Mandeb. Yaqut al-Hamawi associates the name Bab-el-Mandeb with the 6th century crossing of the Aksumites over the sea to Yemen. Two Sabaean inscriptions of the early 6th century mention \"silsilat al-Mandab\" in connection with the conflict between Dhu Nuwas and the Aksumites.\nThe British East India Company unilaterally seized the island of Perim in 1799 on behalf of its Indian empire. The government of Britain asserted its ownership in 1857 and erected a lighthouse there in 1861, using it to command the Red Sea and the trade routes through the Suez Canal. It was used as a coaling station to refuel steamships until 1935 when the reduced use of coal as fuel rendered the operation unprofitable.\nThe British presence continued until 1967 when the island became part of the People's Republic of South Yemen. Before the handover, the British government had put forward before the United Nations a proposal for the island to be internationalized as a way to ensure the continued security of passage and navigation in the Bab-el-Mandeb, but this was refused.\nIn 2008 a company owned by Tarek bin Laden unveiled plans to build a bridge named Bridge of the Horns across the strait, linking Yemen with Djibouti. Middle East Development LLC issued a notice to construct a bridge passing across the Red Sea that would be the longest suspended passing in the world. The project was assigned to engineering company COWI in collaboration with architect studio Dissing+Weitling, both from Denmark but the announced delay to Phase 1 in 2010 and the lack of any further updates since makes this a defunct project.\nSignificance in the maritime trade route.\nThe Bab-el-Mandeb acts as a strategic link between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Most exports of petroleum and natural gas from the Persian Gulf that transit the Suez Canal or the SUMED Pipeline pass through both the Bab el-Mandeb and the Strait of Hormuz. While the narrow width of the strait requires vessels to travel through the territorial sea of adjacent states, under the purview of Article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the legal concept of transit passage applies to Bab el-Mandeb, although Eritrea (unlike the rest of coastal countries) is not a party to the convention.\nChokepoints are narrow channels along widely used global sea routes that are critical to global energy security. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is wide at its narrowest point, limiting tanker traffic to two 2-mile-wide channels for inbound and outbound shipments.\nClosure of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait could keep tankers originating in the Persian Gulf from transiting the Suez Canal or reaching the SUMED Pipeline, forcing them to divert around the southern tip of Africa, which would increase transit time and shipping costs.\nIn 2006, an estimated of oil passed through the strait per day, out of a world total of about moved by tankers. This rose by 2014 to 5.1 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil, condensate and refined petroleum products headed toward Europe, the United States, and Asia, then an estimated 6.2 million b/d by 2018. Total petroleum flows through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait accounted for about 9% of total seaborne-traded petroleum (crude oil and refined petroleum products) in 2017. About 3.6 million b/d moved north toward Europe; another 2.6 million b/d flowed in the opposite direction mainly to Asian markets such as Singapore, China, and India.\nGeography.\nThe distance across is about from Ras Menheli in Yemen to Ras Siyyan in Djibouti. The island of Perim divides the strait into two channels, of which the eastern, known as the Bab Iskender (Alexander's Strait), is wide and has a depth of deep, while the western, or Dact-el-Mayun, has a width of and a depth of . Near the coast of Djibouti lies a group of smaller islands known as the \"Seven Brothers\". There is a surface current inwards in the eastern channel, but a strong undercurrent outwards in the western channel.\nPopulation centers.\nThe most significant towns and cities along both the Djiboutian and Yemeni sides of the Bab-el-Mandeb:\nSee also.\nStrait:\nRegion:\nRail (tunnel or bridge) transport:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62140", "revid": "1303492460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62140", "title": "Geography of Somalia", "text": " \nSomalia is a country located in the Horn of Africa which officially consists of the intra-46th meridian east territory, the seven federal member states, namely Galmudug, Hirshabelle, Jubaland, South West, Puntland, and the municipality of Benadir. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Somali Sea and Guardafui Channel to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. With a land area of 637,657 square kilometers, Somalia's terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Its coastline is more than 3,333 kilometers in length, the longest of mainland Africa. It has been described as being roughly shaped \"like a tilted number seven\".\nIn the far north, the rugged east\u2013west ranges of the Ogo Mountains lie at varying distances from the Gulf of Aden coast. Hot conditions prevail year-round, along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. Geology suggests the presence of valuable mineral deposits.\nSomalia is separated from Seychelles by the Somali Sea and is separated from Socotra by the Guardafui Channel.\nClimate.\nDue to Somalia's proximity to the equator, there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. However, there are some very unpredictable rainfalls that occur sometimes. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with monsoon (periodic seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation) winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from , except at higher elevations and along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In Mogadishu, for instance, average afternoon highs range from in April. Some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country; Berbera on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than from June through September. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from about . The greatest range in climate occurs in northern Somalia, where temperatures sometimes surpass in July on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during December in the highlands. In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in the mid-afternoon to 85 percent at night, changing somewhat according to the season.\nUnlike the climates of most other countries at this latitude, conditions in Somalia range from arid desert in the northeastern and central regions to semiarid steppe in the south and northwest. In the south, in the east Africa coastal forest, there are regions in which there is a tropical savanna climate. In the Cal Madow region of Somalia, there is cold steppe climate. In the northeast, annual rainfall is less than ; in the central plateaus, it is about . The northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation, however, receive considerably more rain, with an average of falling per year. Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically dry and hot. The Cal Madow and the Lag Badana national park are humid areas.\nMost of the country receives less than of rain annually, and a large area encompassing the northeast and much of northern Somalia receives as little as . Certain higher areas in the north, however, record more than a year, as do some coastal sites. The southwest receives . Generally, rainfall takes the form of showers or localized torrential rains and is extremely variable. Mean daily maximum temperatures throughout the country range from , except at higher elevations and along the Somali Sea coast. Mean daily minimum temperatures vary from to more than . Northern Somalia experiences the greatest temperature extremes, with readings ranging from below freezing in the highlands in December to more than in July in the coastal plain skirting the Gulf of Aden. The north's relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in midafternoon to 85 percent at night, varying somewhat with the season. During the colder months, December to February, visibility at higher elevations is often restricted by fog. Temperatures in the south are less extreme, ranging from about . The hottest months are February through April. Coastal readings are usually five to ten degrees cooler than those inland. The coastal zone's relative humidity usually remains about 70 percent even during the dry seasons.\nThere are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. From December to March is the \"Jilal\", the harshest dry season of the year. The main rainy season, referred to as the \"Gu\", lasts from April to June. This period is characterized by the southwest monsoons, which rejuvenate the pasture land, especially the central plateau, and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation. From July to September is the second dry season, the \"Xagaa\" (pronounced \"Hagaa\"). The \"Dayr\", which is the shortest rainy season, lasts from October to December. The \"tangambili\" periods that intervene between the two monsoons (October\u2013November and March\u2013May) are hot and humid.\nTerrain, vegetation and drainage.\nPhysio-graphically, Somalia is a land of limited contrast. In the north, a maritime semidesert plain parallels the Gulf of Aden coast, varying in width from roughly twelve kilometers in the west to as little as two kilometers in the east. Scrub-covered, this plain, known as the Guban (scrub land), is crossed by broad, shallow watercourses that are beds of dry sand except in the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the vegetation, which is a combination of low bushes and grass clumps, is quickly renewed, and for a time the guban provides some grazing for nomad livestock. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.\nInland from the gulf coast, the plain rises to the precipitous northward-facing cliffs of the dissected highlands. These form the rugged Karkaar mountain ranges that extend from the northwestern border with Ethiopia eastward to the tip of the Horn of Africa, where they end in sheer cliffs at Caseyr. The general elevation along the crest of these mountains averages about 1,800 meters above sea level south of the port town of Berbera, and eastward from that area it continues at 1,800 to 2,100 meters almost to Caseyr. The country's highest point, Shimber Berris, which rises to 2,460 meters, is located near the town of Erigavo.\nSouthward the mountains descend, often in scarped ledges, to an elevated plateau devoid of perennial rivers. This region of broken mountain terrain, shallow plateau valleys, and usually dry watercourses is known to the Somalis as the Ogo.\nIn the Ogo's especially arid eastern part, the plateau\u2014broken by several isolated mountain ranges\u2014gradually slopes toward the Somali Sea and in central Somalia constitutes the Mudug Plain. A major feature of this eastern section is the long and broad Nugaal Valley, with its extensive network of intermittent seasonal watercourses. The Nugaal river enters the Somali Sea at Eyl. The eastern area's population consists mainly of pastoral nomads eking a living in a zone of low and erratic rainfall.\nThe western part of the Ogo plateau region is crossed by numerous shallow valleys and dry watercourses. Annual rainfall is greater than in the east, and there are flat areas of arable land that provide a home for dryland cultivators. Most important, the western area has permanent wells to which the predominantly nomadic population returns during the dry seasons. The western plateau slopes gently southward and merges imperceptibly into an area known as the Haud, a broad, undulating terrain that constitutes some of the best grazing lands for Somali nomads, despite the lack of appreciable rainfall more than half the year. Enhancing the value of the Haud are the natural depressions that during periods of rain become temporary lakes and ponds.\nThe Haud zone continues for more than sixty kilometers into Ethiopia, and the vast Somali Plateau, which lies between the northern Somali mountains and the highlands of southeast Ethiopia, extends south and eastward through Ethiopia into central and southwest Somalia. The portion of the Haud lying within Ethiopia was the subject of an agreement made during the colonial era. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis, the British \"returned\" the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia, based on an 1897 treaty in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans. Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over. The stretch of land has since been a considerable source of regional strife.\nSouthwestern Somalia is dominated by the country's only two permanent rivers, the Jubba and the Shabeelle. With their sources in the Ethiopian highlands, these rivers flow in a generally southerly direction, cutting wide valleys in the Somali Plateau as it descends toward the sea; the plateau's elevation falls off rapidly in this area. The adjacent coastal zone, which includes the lower reaches of the rivers and extends from the Mudug Plain to the Kenyan border, averages 180 meters above sea level.\nThe Jubba River enters the Somali Sea at Kismaayo. Although the Shabeelle River at one time apparently also reached the sea near Merca, its course is thought to have changed in prehistoric times. The Shabeelle now turns southwestward near Balcad (about thirty kilometers north of Mogadishu) and parallels the coast for more than eighty-five kilometers. The river is perennial only to a point southwest of Mogadishu; thereafter it consists of swampy areas and dry reaches and is finally lost in the sand east of Jilib, not far from the Jubba River. During the flood seasons, the Shabeelle River may fill its bed to a point near Jilib and occasionally may even break through to the Jubba River farther south. Favorable rainfall and soil conditions make the entire riverine region a fertile agricultural area and the center of the country's largest sedentary population.\nIn most of northern, northeastern, and north-central Somalia, where rainfall is low, the vegetation consists of scattered low trees, including various acacias, and widely scattered patches of grass. This vegetation gives way to a combination of low bushes and grass clumps in the highly arid areas of the northeast and along the Gulf of Aden.\nAs elevations and rainfall increase in the maritime ranges of the north, the vegetation becomes denser. Aloes are common, and on the higher plateau areas of the Ogo are woodlands. At a few places above 1,500 meters, the remnants of juniper forests (protected by the state) and areas of Euphorbia candelabrum (a chandelier-type spiny plant) occur. In the more arid highlands of the northeast, \"Boswellia\" and \"Commiphora\" trees are sources, respectively, of the frankincense and myrrh for which Somalia has been known since ancient times.\nA broad plateau encompassing the northern city of Hargeysa, which receives comparatively heavy rainfall, is covered naturally by woodland (much of which has been degraded by overgrazing) and in places by extensive grasslands. Parts of this area have been under cultivation since the 1930s, producing sorghum and maize; in the 1990s it constituted the only significant region of sedentary cultivation outside southwestern Somalia.\nThe Haud south of Hargeysa is covered mostly by a semiarid woodland of scattered trees, mainly acacias, underlain by grasses that include species especially favored by livestock as forage. There vegetation forms spatially periodic patterns reminiscent of a tiger skin when viewed from above and therefore knowns as \"tiger bush\". As the Haud merges into the Mudug Plain in central Somalia, the aridity increases and the vegetation takes on a subdesert character. Farther southward the terrain gradually changes to semiarid woodlands and grasslands as the annual precipitation increases.\nThe region encompassing the Shabeelle and Jubba rivers is relatively well watered and constitutes the country's most arable zone. The lowland between the rivers supports rich pasturage. It features arid to subarid savanna, open woodland, and thickets that include frequently abundant underlying grasses. There are areas of grassland, and in the far southwest, near the Kenyan border, some dry evergreen forests are found.\nAlong the Somali Sea from Hobyo southwestward to near Mogadishu lies a stretch of dry coastal sand dunes, the Hobyo grasslands and shrublands ecoregion. This area is covered with scattered scrub and grass clumps where rainfall is sufficient although unpredictable. Much of this coast is thinly populated but overgrazing, particularly south of Mogadishu, has resulted in the destruction of the protective vegetation cover and the gradual movement of the once-stationary dunes inland. The original flora of this coast contains a number of endemic species and beginning in the early 1970s, efforts were made to stabilize these dunes by replanting. Endemic mammals are the silver dik-dik (\"Madoqua piacentinii\"), one of the world's smallest antelopes, and the Somali golden mole (\"Calcochloris tytonis\"). Other endemic species include two reptiles, a skink\" Haackgreerius miopus\" and a lizard \"Latastia cherchii\" and two birds, Ash's lark (\"Mirafra ashi\") and the Obbia lark (\"Spizocorys obbiensis\"). The long-term political strife in Somalia has meant the coast is poorly studied and the state of the habitat unknown.\nOther vegetation includes plants and grasses found in the swamps into which the Shabeelle River empties most of the year and in other large swamps in the course of the lower Jubba River. Swamps of East African mangroves are found at points along the coast, particularly from Kismaayo to near the Kenyan border. Uncontrolled exploitation appears to have caused some damage to forests in that area. Other mangroves are located near Mogadishu and at a number of places along the northeastern and northern coasts.\nData.\nLocation:\nHorn of Africa\nGeographic coordinates:\nContinent:\nAfrica\nArea:\n\"total:\"\n\"land:\"\n\"water:\"\nArea - comparative:\nslightly smaller than the United States state of Texas\nLand boundaries:\n\"total:\"\n\"border countries:\"\nDjibouti , Ethiopia , and Kenya for \nCoastline:\nMaritime claims:\n\"Exclusive Economic Zone:\"\n with \nClimate:\nprincipally desert; December to February - northeast monsoon, moderate temperatures in north and very hot in south; May to October - southwest monsoon, torrid in the north and hot in the south, irregular rainfall, hot and humid periods (tangambili) between monsoons\nTerrain:\nmostly flat to undulating plateau rising to hills in north\nElevation extremes:\n\"lowest point:\"\nIndian Ocean \n\"highest point:\"\nShimbiris \nNatural resources:\nuranium and largely unexploited reserves of iron ore, tin, gypsum, bauxite, copper, salt, natural gas\nLand use:\n\"arable land:\" 1.64%\n\"permanent crops:\" 0.04%\n\"other:\" 98.32% (2005)\nIrrigated land: (2003)\nNatural hazards:\nrecurring droughts; frequent dust storms over eastern plains in summer; floods during rainy season\nMan-made hazards:\ndesertification; deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; waste dumping; overfishing\nInternational environment agreements:\n\"party to:\" Biodiversity, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection\n\"signed, but not ratified:\"\nMarine Dumping, Nuclear Test Ban\nGeography - note:\nStrategic location on Horn of Africa along southern approaches to Bab el Mandeb and route through Red Sea and Suez Canal.

{"id": "62142", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62142", "title": "Horn of Africa", "text": "Peninsula and geopolitical region\nThe Horn of Africa (HoA), also known as the Somali Peninsula, is a large peninsula and geopolitical region in East Africa. Located on the easternmost part of the African mainland, it is the fourth largest peninsula in the world. It is composed of Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Although not common, broader definitions include parts or all of Kenya and Sudan. It has been described as a region of geopolitical and strategic importance, since it is situated along the southern boundary of the Red Sea; extending hundreds of kilometres into the Gulf of Aden, Guardafui Channel, and Indian Ocean, it also shares a maritime border with the Arabian Peninsula.\nNames.\nThe peninsula has been known by various names. Ancient Greeks and Romans referred to it as Regio Aromatica or Regio Cinnamonifora after the aromatic plants found there, or as Regio Incognita for its poor coverage by classical Mediterranean cartography. In ancient and medieval times, the Horn of Africa was referred to as the Bilad al Barbar (\"Land of the Berbers\"). It is also known as the Somali Peninsula, or in the Somali language as \"Geeska Afrika or\" \"Jasiiradda Soomaali\". In other local languages it is called \"Horn of Africa\" or the \"African Horn\": in Amharic \u12e8\u12a0\u134d\u122a\u12ab \u1240\u1295\u12f5 \"y\u00e4afrika q\u00e4nd,\" in Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642\u064a \"al-qarn al-'afr\u012bq\u012b\", in Oromo \"Gaanfaa Afrikaa\", and in Tigrinya \u1240\u122d\u1292 \u12a3\u134d\u122a\u1243 \"q'\u00e4rn\u012b af\u012br\u012bqa\".\nDescription.\nThe Horn of Africa Region consists of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somaliland and Somalia.\nGeographically, the protruding shape that resembles a \"horn\" consists of most of Somalia and the easternmost part of Ethiopia, but the geopolitical \"Horn of Africa region\" also encompasses the rest of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti. Some broader definitions may include Kenya and Sudan. The \"Greater Horn Region\" (GHR) might additionally include South Sudan and Uganda. The term \"Greater Horn of Africa\" is sometimes used to be inclusive of neighbouring southeast African countries to distinguish the broader geopolitical definition of the Horn of Africa from narrower peninsular definitions.\nThe Horn of Africa commonly is referred to simply as \"the Horn\", while inhabitants are sometimes colloquially termed Horn Africans or Horners. Regional studies on the Horn of Africa are carried out in the fields of Ethiopian studies and Somali studies.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nSome of the earliest \"Homo sapiens\" fossils, the Omo remains (from ca. 233,000 years ago) and the Herto skull (from ca. 160,000 ago) have been found in the region, both in Ethiopia.\nThe findings of the Earliest Stone Tipped Projectiles from the Ethiopian Rift dated to more than 279,000 years ago \"in combination with the existing archaeological, fossil and genetic evidence, isolate East Africa as a source of modern cultures and biology.\"\nAccording to the Southern Dispersal scenario, the Southern route of the Out of Africa migration occurred in the Horn of Africa through the Bab el Mandeb. Today at the Bab-el-Mandeb straits, the Red Sea is about wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts. Shell middens 125,000 years old have been found in Eritrea, indicating the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing.\nEthiopian and Eritrean agriculture established the earliest known use of the seed grass teff (\"Poa abyssinica\") between 4000 and 1000 BCE. Teff is used to make the flatbread injera/taita. Coffee also originated in Ethiopia and has since spread to become a worldwide beverage.\nHistorian Christopher Ehret, cited genetic evidence which had identified the Horn of Africa as a source of a genetic marker \"M35/215\" Y-chromosome lineage for a significant population component which moved north from that region into Egypt and the Levant. Ehret argued that this genetic distribution paralleled the spread of the Afrasian language family with the movement of people from the Horn of Africa into Egypt and added a new demic component to the existing population of Egypt 17,000 years ago.\nAncient history.\nThe area comprising Somaliland, Somalia, Djibouti, the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and Sudan is considered the most likely location of the land known to the ancient Egyptians as \"Punt\" (or \"Ta Netjeru\", meaning god's land), whose first mention dates to the 25th century BCE.\nD\u02bfmt was a kingdom located in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, which existed during the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. With its capital probably at Yeha, the kingdom developed irrigation schemes, used plows, grew millet, and made iron tools and weapons. After the fall of D\u02bfmt in the 5th century BCE, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms, until the rise of one of these kingdoms during the 1st century, the Aksumite Kingdom, which was able to reunite the area.\nThe Kingdom of Aksum (also known as the Aksumite Empire) was an ancient state located in the Eritrea and Ethiopian highlands, which thrived between the 1st and 7th centuries CE. A major player in the commerce between the Roman Empire and Ancient India, Aksum's rulers facilitated trade by minting their own currency. The state also established its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. Under Ezana (fl. 320\u2013360), the kingdom of Aksum became the first major empire to adopt Christianity, and was named by Mani as one of the four great powers of his time, along with Persia, Rome and China.\nSomalia was an important link in the Horn, connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of frankincense, myrrh and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the Ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Babylonians and Romans. The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as \"Regio Aromatica\". In the classical era, several flourishing Somali city-states such as Opone, Mosylon and Malao also competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the rich Indo-Greco-Roman trade.\nThe birth of Islam opposite the Horn's Red Sea coast meant that local merchants and sailors living on the Arabian Peninsula gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted Arab Muslim trading partners. With the migration of Muslim families from the Islamic world to the Horn in the early centuries of Islam, and the peaceful conversion of the local population by Muslim scholars in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic Mogadishu, Berbera, Zeila, Barawa and Merka, which were part of the \"Barbara civilization\". The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the \"City of Islam\" and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries.\nMiddle Ages and Early Modern era.\nDuring the Middle Ages, several powerful empires dominated the regional trade in the Horn, including the Adal Sultanate, the Ajuran Sultanate, the Ethiopian Empire, the Zagwe dynasty, and the Sultanate of the Geledi.\nThe Sultanate of Showa, established in 896, was one of the oldest local Islamic states. It was centered in the former Shewa province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the Sultanate of Ifat around 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital at Zeila in Somaliland and was the easternmost district of the former Shewa Sultanate.\nThe Adal Sultanate was a medieval multi-ethnic Muslim state centered in the Horn region. At its height, it controlled large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Many of the historic cities in the region, such as Amud, Maduna, Abasa, Berbera, Zeila and Harar, flourished during the kingdom's golden age. This period that left behind numerous courtyard houses, mosques, shrines and walled enclosures. Under the leadership of rulers such as Sabr ad-Din II, Mansur ad-Din, Jamal ad-Din II, Shams ad-Din, General Mahfuz and Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, Adalite armies continued the struggle against the Solomonic dynasty, a campaign historically known as the Conquest of Abyssinia or \"Futuh al Habash\".\nThrough a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the Ajuran Sultanate successfully resisted an Oromo invasion from the west and a Portuguese incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the Ajuran-Portuguese wars. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of Somali maritime enterprise were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive architectural legacy. Many of the hundreds of ruined castles and fortresses that dot the landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers, including a lot of the pillar tomb fields, necropolises and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.\nThe Zagwe dynasty ruled many parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea from approximately 1137 to 1270. The name of the dynasty comes from the Cushitic-speaking Agaw people of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 onwards for many centuries, the Solomonic dynasty ruled the Ethiopian Empire.\nIn 1270, the Amhara nobleman Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from the last Aksumite king and ultimately the Queen of Sheba, overthrew the Agaw Zagwe dynasty at the Battle of Ansata, ushering his reign as Emperor of Ethiopia. While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity, the empire managed to expand significantly during the crusades of Amda Seyon I (1314\u20131344) and his successors, becoming the dominant force in East Africa.\nIn the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times. A letter from King Henry IV of England to the Emperor of Abyssinia survives. In 1428, the Emperor Yeshaq sent two emissaries to Alfonso V of Aragon, who sent return emissaries who failed to complete the return trip.\nThe first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Emperor Lebna Dengel, who had just inherited the throne from his father. This proved to be an important development, for when Abyssinia was subjected to the attacks of the Adal Sultanate General and Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (called \"\"Gurey\" or \"Gra\u00f1\"\", both meaning \"the Left-handed\"), Portugal assisted the Ethiopian emperor by sending weapons and four hundred men, who helped his son Gelawdewos defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule. This Ethiopian\u2013Adal War was also one of the first proxy wars in the region as the Ottoman Empire, and Portugal took sides in the conflict.\nWhen Emperor Susenyos converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths. The Jesuit missionaries had offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians. On 25 June 1632, Susenyos's son, Emperor Fasilides, declared the state religion to again be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.\nDuring the end of 18th and the beginning of 19th century the Yejju dynasty (more specifically, the Warasek) ruled north Ethiopia changing the official language of Amhara people to Afaan Oromo, including inside the court of Gondar which was capital of the empire. Founded by Ali I of Yejju several successive descendants of him and Abba Seru Gwangul ruled with their army coming from mainly their clan the Yejju Oromo tribe as well as Wollo and Raya Oromo.\nThe Sultanate of the Geledi was a Somali kingdom administered by the Gobroon dynasty, which ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was established by the Ajuran soldier Ibrahim Adeer, who had defeated various vassals of the Ajuran Empire and established the \"House of Gobroon\". The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the Omani Empire to submit tribute.\nThe Isaaq Sultanate was a Somali kingdom that ruled parts of the Horn of Africa during the 18th and 19th centuries. It spanned the territories of the Isaaq clan, descendants of the Banu Hashim clan, in modern-day Somaliland and Ethiopia. The sultanate was governed by the Reer Guled branch of the Eidagale sub-clan established by the first sultan, Sultan Guled Abdi. The sultanate is the pre-colonial predecessor to the modern Somaliland.\nAccording to oral tradition, prior to the Guled dynasty the Isaaq clan-family were ruled by a dynasty of the Tolje'lo branch starting from, descendants of Ahmed nicknamed Tol Je'lo, the eldest son of Sheikh Ishaaq's Harari wife. There were eight Tolje'lo rulers in total, starting with Boqor Harun () who ruled the Isaaq Sultanate for centuries starting from the 13th century. The last Tolje'lo ruler Garad Dhuh Barar () was overthrown by a coalition of Isaaq clans. The once strong Tolje'lo clan were scattered and took refuge amongst the Habr Awal with whom they still mostly live.\nThe Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia) was another prominent Somali sultanate based in the Horn region. Ruled by King Osman Mahamuud during its golden age, it controlled much of northeastern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. It also entered into treaties with foreign powers and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front. Much of the Sultanate's former domain is today coextensive with the autonomous Puntland region in northern Somalia.\nThe Sultanate of Hobyo was a 19th-century Somali kingdom founded by Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid. Initially, Kenadid's goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to establish the kingdom of Hobyo, which would rule much of northern and central Somalia during the early modern period.\nModern history.\nIn the period following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, when European powers scrambled for territory in Africa and tried to establish coaling stations for their ships, Italy invaded and occupied Eritrea. On 1 January 1890, Eritrea officially became a colony of Italy. In 1896 further Italian incursion into the horn was decisively halted by Ethiopian forces. By 1936 however, Eritrea became a province of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. By 1941, Eritrea had about 760,000 inhabitants, including 70,000 Italians. The Commonwealth armed forces, along with the Ethiopian patriotic resistance, expelled those of Italy in 1941, and took over the area's administration. The British continued to administer the territory under a UN Mandate until 1951, when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia, per UN resolution 390 A (V) adopted December 1950.\nThe strategic importance of Eritrea, due to its Red Sea coastline and mineral resources, was the main cause for the federation with Ethiopia, which in turn led to Eritrea's annexation as Ethiopia's 14th province in 1962. This was the culmination of a gradual process of takeover by the Ethiopian authorities, a process which included a 1959 edict establishing the compulsory teaching of Amharic, the main language of Ethiopia, in all Eritrean schools. The lack of regard for the Eritrean population led to the formation of an independence movement in the early 1960s (1961), which erupted into a 30-year war against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991. Following a UN-supervised referendum in Eritrea (dubbed UNOVER) in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993. In 1998, a border dispute with Ethiopia led to the Eritrean-Ethiopian War.\nFrom 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura situated in modern-day Djibouti was called \"Obock\" and was ruled by Somali and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region. In 1894, L\u00e9once Lagarde established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region \"C\u00f4te fran\u00e7aise des Somalis\" (French Somaliland), a name which continued until 1967.\nIn 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a referendum was held in the territory to decide whether to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum favoured continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also reports of widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977. Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, became the nation's first president (1977\u20131999). In early 2011, the Djiboutian citizenry took part in a series of protests against the long-serving government, which were associated with the larger Arab Spring demonstrations. The unrest eventually subsided by April of the year, and Djibouti's ruling People's Rally for Progress party was re-elected to office.\nThe Dervish existed for 25 years, from 1895 until 1920. The Turks named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 as a direct consequence of Britain's new policy of aerial bombardment. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy faced similar opposition from Somali Sultans and armies, and did not acquire full control of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927. This occupation lasted until 1941, and was replaced by a British military administration. Former British Somaliland would remain, along with Italian Somaliland, a trusteeship of Italy, between 1950 and 1960. The Union of the two countries in 1960 formed the Somali Republic. A civilian government was formed, and on 20 July 1961, through a popular referendum, the constitution drafted in 1960 was ratified.\nDue to its longstanding ties with the Arab world, the Somali Republic was accepted in 1974 as a member of the Arab League. During the same year, the nation's former socialist administration also chaired the Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the African Union. In 1991, the Somali Civil War broke out, which saw the dissolving of the union and Somaliland regaining its independence, along with the collapse of the central government and the emergence of numerous autonomous polities, including the Puntland administration in the north. Somalia's inhabitants subsequently reverted to local forms of conflict resolution, either secular, Islamic or customary law, with a provision for appeal of all sentences. A Transitional Federal Government was subsequently created in 2004. The Federal Government of Somalia was established on 20 August 2012, concurrent with the end of the TFG's interim mandate. It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. The Federal Parliament of Somalia serves as the government's legislative branch.\nModern Ethiopia and its current borders are a result of significant territorial reduction in the north and expansion in the east and south toward its present borders, owing to several migrations, commercial integration, treaties as well as conquests, particularly by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena. From the central province of Shoa, Menelik set off to subjugate and incorporate 'the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire.' He did this with the help of Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia, began expanding his kingdom to the south and east, expanding into areas that had not been held since the invasion of Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, and other areas that had never been under his rule, resulting in the borders of Ethiopia of today. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889, in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control a small area of northern Tigray (part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with arms and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to further expand their territorial claims. Italy began a state funded program of resettlement for landless Italians in Eritrea, which increased tensions between the Eritrean peasants and the Italians. This conflict erupted in the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.\nThe early 20th century in Ethiopia was marked by the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, who came to power after Iyasu V was deposed. In 1935, Haile Selassie's troops fought and lost the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, after which Italy annexed Ethiopia to Italian East Africa. Haile Selassie subsequently appealed to the League of Nations, delivering an address that made him a worldwide figure and 1935's \"Time\" magazine Man of the Year. Following the entry of Italy into World War II, British Empire forces, together with patriot Ethiopian fighters, liberated Ethiopia during the East African Campaign in 1941.\nHaile Selassie's reign came to an end in 1974, when a Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist military junta, the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, deposed him, and established a one-party communist state, which was called the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the Somalia government of Siad Barre sought to incorporate the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. By September 1977, the Somali army controlled 90 percent of the Ogaden, but was later forced to withdraw after Ethiopia's Derg received assistance from the USSR, Cuba, South Yemen, East Germany and North Korea, including around 15,000 Cuban combat troops.\nIn 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and eventually managed to overthrow Mengistu's dictatorial regime in 1991. A transitional government, composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution, was then set up. The first free and democratic election took place later in 1995, when Ethiopia's longest-serving prime minister Meles Zenawi was elected to office. As with other nations in the Horn region, Ethiopia maintained its historically close relations with countries in the Middle East during this period of change. Zenawi died in 2012, but his Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) party remains the ruling political coalition in Ethiopia.\nGeography.\nGeology and climate.\nThe Horn of Africa is almost equidistant from the equator and the Tropic of Cancer. It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the Great Rift Valley, a fissure in the Earth's crust extending from Turkey to Mozambique and marking the separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\nGeologically, the Horn and Yemen once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the Gulf of Aden rifted and separated the Horn region from the Arabian Peninsula. The Somali Plate is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the triple junction in the Afar Depression, and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the Aden Ridge along the coast of Saudi Arabia. The eastern boundary is the Central Indian Ridge, the northern portion of which is also known as the Carlsberg Ridge. The southern boundary is the Southwest Indian Ridge.\nExtensive glaciers once covered the Simien and Bale Mountains but melted at the beginning of the Holocene. The mountains descend in a huge escarpment to the Red Sea and more steadily to the Indian Ocean. Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is and it is a territory of Yemen.\nThe lowlands of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical monsoons that give seasonal rains to the Sahel and the Sudan blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and northern part of Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\nIn the mountains of Ethiopia, many areas receive over per year, and even Asmara receives an average of . This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including Egypt. In the winter, the northeasterly trade winds do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as . On the eastern coast, a strong upwelling and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as .\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At Addis Ababa, which ranges from , maximum temperature is and minimum . The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (\"belg\") rains occur from February to April and the big (\"meher\") rains from mid-June to mid-September. The Danakil Desert stretches across 100,000\u00a0km2 of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45\u00a0\u00b0C and often surpassing 50\u00a0\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among these are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the Danakil Depression. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, Dabbahu, Afdera and Erta Ale.\nIn Somalia, there is not much seasonal variation in climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from , except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the Jubba and the Shabele, both of which begin in the Ethiopian Highlands.\nEcology.\nAbout 220 mammals are found in the Horn of Africa. Among threatened species of the region, there are several antelopes such as the beira, the dibatag, the silver dikdik and the Speke's gazelle. Other remarkable species include the Somali wild ass, the desert warthog, the hamadryas baboon, the Somali pygmy gerbil, the ammodile, and the Speke's pectinator. The Grevy's zebra is the unique wild equid of the region. There are predators such as spotted hyena, striped hyena and African leopard. The endangered painted hunting dog had populations in the Horn of Africa, but pressures from human exploitation of habitat along with warfare have reduced or extirpated this canid in this region.\nSome important bird species of the Horn are the black boubou, the golden-winged grosbeak, the Warsangli linnet, and the Djibouti spurfowl.\nThe Horn of Africa holds more endemic reptiles than any other region in Africa, with over 285 species total and about 90 species which are found exclusively in the region. Among endemic reptile genera, there are \"Haackgreerius\", \"Haemodracon\", \"Ditypophis\", \"Pachycalamus\" and \"Aeluroglena\". Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, amphibians are poorly represented in the region.\nThere are about 100 species of freshwater fish in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, three cavefishes, Somali blind barb, \"Phreatichthys andruzzii\" and \"Uegitglanis zammaranoi\" can be found.\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of vascular plants are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant families: the Barbeyaceae and the Dirachmaceae. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra, the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the yeheb nut, and the Somali cyclamen.\nDue to the Horn of Africa's semi-arid and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's pastoral groups have observed careful rangeland management practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37 and 62 percent of the cattle population. Initiatives by ECHO and USAID have succeeded in reclaiming hundreds of hectares of pastureland through rangeland management, leading to the establishment of the Dikale Rangeland in 2004.\nAs of 2023, the Horn of Africa is affected by a severe ongoing drought and famine that has been going on for six consecutive years, especially in Somalia and in the months from March to May during which 60 percent of the annual rainfall occurs. It is estimated that the lives of a number of people ranging from 22 to 58 million are at risk.\nDemographics, ethnicity and languages.\nBesides sharing similar geographic endowments, the countries of the Horn of Africa are, for the most part, linguistically and ethnically linked together, evincing a complex pattern of interrelationships among the various groups. The two main macro groups in the Horn are the Cushitic-speaking Cushitic peoples traditionally centered in the lowlands and the Ethiosemitic-speaking Habesha peoples who inhabit the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands.\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", there are 10 individual languages spoken in Djibouti (two native), 14 in Eritrea, 90 in Ethiopia, 15 in Somalia (Somali being the only native). Most people in the Horn speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic, Semitic, or Omotic branches. The Cushitic branch includes Oromo, spoken by the Oromo people in Ethiopia, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people in Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya; the Semitic branch (specifically the Ethiosemitic sub-branch) includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people of Ethiopia, and Tigrinya spoken by the Tigrayan people of Ethiopia and the Tigrinya people of Eritrea. Other Afroasiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Afar, Saho, Hadiyya, Sidamo and Agaw languages, the Semitic Tigre, Arabic, Gurage, Harari, Silt'e and Argobba tongues as well as Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic communities inhabiting Ethiopia's southern regions. Among these languages are Aari, Dizi, Gamo, Kafa, Hamer and Wolaytta.\nLanguages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan language family are also spoken in some areas by Nilotic ethnic minorities mostly in Ethiopia and Eritrea. These tongues include the Nilo-Saharan Me'en and Mursi languages used in southwestern Ethiopia, and Kunama and Nara idioms spoken in parts of southern Eritrea.\nLanguages belonging to the Niger-Congo language family are also spoken in some areas by Bantu ethnic minorities in Somalia. In the riverine and littoral areas of southern Somalia, Bajuni, Barawani, and Bantu groups also speak variants of the Niger-Congo Swahili and Mushunguli languages.\nThe Horn has produced numerous indigenous writing systems. Among these is Ge'ez script ( ') (also known as \"Ethiopic\"), which has been written in for at least 2000 years. It is an abugida script that was originally developed to write the Ge'ez language. In speech communities that use it, such as the Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called ' (), which means \"script\" or \"alphabet\".\nFor centuries, Somali sheikhs and Sultans used wadaad's writing (a version of the Arabic alphabet) to write. In the early 20th century, in response to a national campaign to settle on a writing script for the Somali language (which had long since lost its ancient script), Osman Yusuf Kenadid, a Somali poet and remote cousin of the Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo, devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called Osmanya (also known as \"far soomaali\"; Osmanya: \ud801\udc8d\ud801\udc96\ud801\udc87 \ud801\udc88\ud801\udc9d\ud801\udc91\ud801\udc9b\ud801\udc90\ud801\udc98) for representing the sounds of Somali. Though no longer the official writing script in Somalia, the Osmanya script is available in the Unicode range 10480-104AF [from U+10480 \u2013 U+104AF (66688\u201366735)].\nA number of ethnic minority groups in southern Ethiopia and Eritrea also adhere to various traditional faiths. Among these belief systems are the Nilo-Saharan Surma people's acknowledgment of the sky god \"Tumu\".\nEconomy.\nAccording to the IMF, in 2010 the Horn of Africa region had a total GDP (PPP) of $106.224 billion and nominal of $35.819 billion. Per capita, the GDP in 2010 was $1061 (PPP) and $358 (nominal).\nOver 95 percent of cross-border trade within the region is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to other countries in the Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure), with the towns of Burao and Yirowe in Somaliland being home to the largest livestock markets in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily from all over the Horn of Africa, with many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera. This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62143", "revid": "2003421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62143", "title": "Geography of Ethiopia", "text": " \nEthiopia is located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. Ethiopia has a high central plateau, the Abyssinian Highlands (or Ethiopian Highlands) that varies from above sea level, with some 25 mountains whose peaks rise over 4,000 meters (13,200\u00a0ft), the highest being Ras Dashen at 4,543 meters (14,538\u00a0ft).\nElevation is generally highest just before the point of descent to the Great Rift Valley, which splits the plateau diagonally. A number of rivers cross the plateau; notably the Blue Nile rising from Lake Tana. The plateau gradually slopes to the lowlands of the Sudan on the west and the Somali-inhabited plains to the east. Ethiopia's westernmost locality is Pibor River opposite the Sudanese village of Denjok. Its easternmost locality lies along the eastern border of Dollo Zone opposite Puntland and Galmudug states.\nPhysical features.\nGeography.\nBetween the valley of the Upper Nile and Ethiopia's border with Sudan and South Sudan is a region of elevated plateaus from which rise the various tablelands and mountains that constitute the Ethiopian Highlands. On nearly every side, the walls of the plateaus rise abruptly from the plains, constituting outer mountain chains. The highlands are thus a clearly marked geographic division. In Eritrea, the eastern wall of this plateau runs parallel to the Red Sea from Ras Kasar (18\u00b0 N) to Annesley Bay (also known as the Bay of Zula) (15\u00b0 N). It then turns due south into Ethiopia and follows closely the line of 40\u00b0 E for some .\nAbout 9\u00b0 N there is a break in the wall, through which the Awash River flows eastward. The main range at this point trends southwest, while south of the Awash Valley, which is some below the level of the mountains, another massif rises in a direct line south. This second range sends a chain (the Ahmar Mountains) eastward toward the Gulf of Aden.\nThe two chief eastern ranges maintain a parallel course south by west, with a broad upland valley in between \u2013 in which valley are a series of lakes \u2013 to about 3\u00b0 N, the outer (eastern) spurs of the plateau still keeping along the line of 40\u00b0 E. The southern escarpment of the plateau is highly irregular, but has a general direction northwest and southeast from 6\u00b0 N to 3\u00b0 N. It overlooks the depression in which is Lake Turkana and \u2013 east of that lake \u2013 the southern Debub Omo Zone (part of the larger Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region).\nThe western wall of the plateau from 6\u00b0 N to 11\u00b0 N is well marked and precipitous. North of 11\u00b0 N the hills turn more to the east and fall more gradually to the East Sudanian savanna plains at their base. On its northern face, the plateau falls in terraces to the level of the eastern Sudan.\nThe eastern escarpment is the best defined of these outer ranges. It has a mean height of , and in many places rises almost perpendicularly from the plain. Narrow and deep clefts, through which descend mountain torrents that lose themselves in the sandy soil of the Eritrean coast, afford means of reaching the plateau, or the easier route through the Awash Valley may be chosen. On surmounting this rocky barrier, the traveller finds that the encircling rampart rises little above the normal level of the plateau.\nThe physical aspect of the highlands is impressive. The northern portion lies mainly between 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 N. It consists of a huge mass of Archaean rocks with a mean height of above sea level, and is flooded in a deep central depression by the waters of Lake Tana. Above the plateau rise several irregular and generally ill-defined mountain ranges which attain altitudes of from to just under . Many of the mountains are of unusual shape.\nCharacteristic of the country are the enormous fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred thousands cubic metres of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as \"ambas\", with nearly perpendicular sides.\nThe highest peaks are found in the Semien and Bale ranges. The Semien Mountains lie northeast of Lake Tana and culminate in the snow-covered peak of Ras Dashen, which has an altitude of . A few kilometers east and north respectively of Ras Dashen are Mounts Biuat and Abba Yared, whose summits are less than below that of Ras Dashen.\nThe Bale Mountains are separated from the larger part of the Ethiopian highlands by the Great Rift Valley, one of the longest and most profound chasms in Ethiopia. The highest peaks of that range include Tullu Demtu, the second-highest mountain in Ethiopia (), Batu (), Chilalo () and Mount Kaka ().\nParallel with the eastern escarpment are the heights of Biala, , Mount Abuna Yosef, , and Kollo, , the last-named being southwest of Magdala. Between Lake Tana and the eastern hills are Mounts Guna, , and Uara Sahia, . In the Choqa Mountains of Misraq Gojjam, Mount Choqa (also known as Mount Birhan) attains a height of .\nBelow 10\u00b0 N, the southern portion of the highlands has more open tableland than the northern portion and fewer lofty peaks. Though there are a few heights between , the majority do not exceed , but the general character of the southern regions is the same as in the north: a much-broken hilly plateau.\nEast of the highlands towards the Red Sea there is a strip of lowland semi-desert, the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands.\nHydrology.\nMost of the Ethiopian uplands have a decided slope to the northwest, so that nearly all the large rivers flow in that direction to the Nile, comprising some 85% of its water. Such are the Tekez\u00e9 River in the north, the Abay in the center, and the Sobat in the south, and about four-fifths of the entire drainage is discharged through these three arteries. Another large river is the south-flowing Omo, with 14% of the entire drainage the largest river outside the above-mentioned three main arteries discharging to the west, and by far the main feeder of the endorheic Turkana Basin with Lake Turkana. The rest is carried off by the Awash, which runs out in the saline lacustrine district along the border with Djibouti; by the Shebelle River and the Jubba, which flow southeast through Somalia, though the Shebelle most often fails to reach the Indian Ocean.\nThe Tekez\u00e9 River, which is the true upper course of the Atbarah River, has its headwaters in the central tableland; and falls from about . in the tremendous crevasse through which it sweeps west, north, forming part of the border with Eritrea, and west again down to the western terraces, where it passes from Ethiopia to Sudan. During the rains the Tekez\u00e9 (i.e. the \"Terrible\") rises some above its normal level, and at this time forms an impassable barrier between the northern and central regions. In its lower course, the river is known by the Arabic name Setit.\nIn Sudan, the Setit is joined (at ) by the Atbarah, a river formed by several streams which rise in the mountains west and northwest of Lake Tana. The Gash or Mareb, which forms part of the border with Eritrea, is the most northerly of the highland rivers which flow toward the Nile valley. Its headwaters rise on the landward side of the eastern escarpment within 80\u00a0km of Annesley Bay on the Red Sea. It reaches the Sudanese plains near Kassala, beyond which place its waters are dissipated in the sandy soil. The Mareb is dry for a great part of the year, but like the Takazze is subject to sudden freshets during the rainy season. Only the left bank of the upper course of the river is in Ethiopian territory.\nThe Abay \u2013 that is, the upper course of the Blue Nile \u2013 has its source near Mount Denguiza in the Choqa mountains, around . It first flows for nearly due north to the south shore of Lake Tana. Tana, which stands below the normal level of the plateau, has somewhat the physical aspect of a flooded crater. It has an area of about , and a depth in some parts of . At the southeast corner the rim of the crater is, as it were, breached by a deep crevasse through which the Abay escapes, and here makes a great semicircular bend like that of the Tekez\u00e9, but in the reverse direction \u2013 east, south and north-west \u2013 down to the plains of Sennar, where it takes the name of Bahr-el-Azrak or Blue Nile.The Abay has many tributaries. Of these, the Bashilo rises near Magdala and drains eastern Amhara; the Jamma rises near Ankober and drains northern Shoa; the Muger rises near Addis Ababa and drains south-western Shoa; the Didessa, the largest of the Abay's affluents, rises in the Kaffa hills and has a generally south-to-north course; the Dabus runs near the western edge of the plateau escarpment. All these are perennial rivers. The right-hand tributaries, rising mostly on the western sides of the plateau, have steep slopes and are generally torrential in character. The Beles, however, is perennial, and the Rahad and Dinder are important rivers in flood-time.\nIn the mountains and plateaus of Gambela and Kaffa in southwestern Ethiopia rise the Baro, Gelo, Akobo and other chief affluents of the Sobat tributary of the Nile. The Akobo, in about , joins the Pibor, which in about unites with the Baro, the river below the confluence taking the name of Sobat. These rivers descend from the mountains in great falls, and like the other Ethiopian streams are unnavigable in their upper courses. The Baro on reaching the plain becomes, however, a navigable stream affording an open waterway to the Nile. The Baro, Pibor and Akobo form for the western and southwestern frontiers of Ethiopia.\nThe chief river of Ethiopia flowing east is the Awash River (or Awasi), which rises in the Shewan uplands and makes a semicircular bend first southeast and then northeast. It reaches the Afar Depression through a broad breach in the eastern escarpment of the plateau, beyond which it is joined on its left bank by its chief affluent, the Germama (Kasam), and then trends round in the direction of the Gulf of Tadjoura. Here the Awash is a copious stream nearly wide and deep, even in the dry season, and during the floods rising above low-water mark, thus inundating the plains for many kilometers along both its banks.\nAfter a winding course of about , the Awash River passes (in its lower reaches) through a series of badds (lagoons) to Lake Abbe (or Abhe Bid) on the border with Djibouti and some from the head of the Gulf of Tadjoura. In this lake the Awash river is lost. This remarkable phenomenon is explained by the position of Lake Abbe in the centre of a saline lacustrine depression several hundred meters below sea level. While most of the other lagoons are highly saline, with thick incrustations of salt round their margins, Lake Abbe remains fresh throughout the year, owing to the great body of water discharged into it by the Awash.\nAnother lacustrine region extends from the Shoan heights southwest to the Samburu (Lake Turkana) depression. In this chain of scenic upland lakes \u2013 some fresh, some brackish, some completely closed, others connected by short channels \u2013 the chief links in their order from north to south are: Zway, communicating southwards with Hara and Lamina, all in the Arsi Zone; then Abijatta with an outlet to a smaller turn to the Baroda and Gamo areas, skirted on the west sides by grassy slopes and wooded ranges from to nearly high; lastly, Lake Chew Bahir (formerly known as Lake Stephanie) which is completely closed and falling to a level of about above sea level.\nTo the same system belongs the neighbouring Lake Turkana, which is larger than all the rest put together. This lake receives at its northern end the waters of the Omo, which rises in the Shoan highlands and is a perennial river with many affluents. In its course of some it has a total fall of about , from at its source to c. at lake level, and is consequently a rapid stream, being broken by the Kokobi and other falls, and navigable only for a short distance above its mouth.\nThe chief rivers of Somalia, the Shebelle and the Jubba, rise on the southeastern slopes of the Ethiopian escarpment as the Shebelle, the Ganale Doria and the Dawa, and part of their course is through territory belonging to Ethiopia.\nThere are numerous hot springs in Ethiopia, such as Sodere.\nGeology.\nThe East African tableland is continued into Ethiopia. A pioneering study of the geology of Ethiopia was W. T. Blanford's work in 1870. More recent work has focused on the Afar Depression, due to its importance as one of two places on Earth where a mid-ocean ridge can be studied on land (the other is Iceland).\nThe following formations are represented:\n* Recent: Coral, alluvium, sand\n* Tertiary: Limestones of Harrar\n* Jurassic: Antalo Limestones\n* Triassic: Adigrat Sandstones\n* Archaean: Gneisses, schists, slaty rocks\n* Recent: Aden Volcanic Series\n* Tertiary, Cretaceous: Magdala group\n* Jurassic: Ashangi group\nArchaean.\u2013 The metamorphic rocks compose the main mass of the tableland, and are exposed in every deep valley in Tigre and along the valley of the Blue Nile. Mica-schists form the prevalent rocks. Hornblende schists also occur and a compact feldspathic rock in the Suris defile. The folia of the schists strike north and south.\nTriassic.\u2013 In the region of Adigrat the metamorphic rocks are invariably overlain by white and brown sandstones, unfossiliferous, and attaining a maximum thickness of 300\u00a0m. They are overlain by the fossiliferous limestones of the Antalo group. Around Chelga and Adigrat coal-bearing beds occur, which Blanford suggests may be of the same age as the coal-bearing strata of India. The Adigrat Sandstone possibly represents some portion of the Karoo System of South Africa.\nJurassic.\u2013 The fossiliferous Antalo Limestones are generally horizontal, but are in places much disturbed when interstratified with Mekelle Dolerite. The fossils are all characteristic Oolite forms and include species of Hemicidaris, Pholadomya, Ceromya, Trigonia and Alaria.\nIgneous Rocks.\u2013 Above a height of the country consists of bedded traps belonging to two distinct and unconformable groups. The lower (Ashangi group) consists of basalts and dolerites often amygdaloidal. Their relation to the Antalo limestones is uncertain, but Blanford considers them to be not later in age than the Oolite. The upper (Magdala group) contains much trachytic rock of considerable thickness, lying perfectly horizontally, and giving rise to a series of terraced ridges characteristic of central Ethiopia. They are interbedded with unfossiliferous sandstones and shales.\nOf more recent date (probably Tertiary) are some igneous rocks, rich in alkalis, occurring in certain localities in southern Ethiopia. Of still more recent date are the basalts and ashes west of Massawa and around Annesley Bay and known as the Aden Volcanic Series. With regard to the older igneous rocks, the enormous amount they have suffered from denudation is a prominent feature. They have been worn into deep and narrow ravines, sometimes to a depth of .\nClimate.\nThe climate of Ethiopia and its dependent territories varies greatly. It is temperate on the plateau and hot in the lowlands. The country lies wholly within the tropics, but its nearness to the equator is counterbalanced by the elevation of the land. At Addis Ababa, which ranges from , maximum temperature is and minimum . The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (\"belg\") rains occur from February to April and the large (\"meher\") rains from mid-June to mid-September. Over the greater part of Ethiopia as well as the Oromia highlands, the climate is very healthy and temperate. However, in the deep valleys of the Tekez\u00e9 and Abay, and generally in places below , the conditions are tropical and diseases such as malaria are prevalent. The Somali Region and the Danakil Depression in the Afar Region have a hot, sunny and dry climate producing fully desert or semi-desert conditions. The terrain in the lower basin of the Sobat is hot, swampy and malarious.\nIn the uplands, the air is cool and bracing in summer, and in winter very bleak. The mean range of temperature is between . On the higher mountains the climate is alpine in character. The atmosphere on the plateaus is exceedingly clear, so that objects are easily recognizable at great distances. In addition to the variation in climate dependent on elevation, the year may be divided into three seasons. Winter, or the cold season, lasts from October to February. It is followed by a dry hot period, which about the middle of June gives place to the rainy season. The rain is heaviest in the Tekez\u00e9 basin in July and August.\nIn the former provinces of Gojjam and Welega, heavy rains continue till the middle of September. October is occasionally a wet month. There are also spring and winter rains; indeed rain often falls in every month of the year. But the rainy season proper, caused by the southwest monsoon, lasts from June to mid-September, and commencing in the north moves southward. In the region of the headwaters of the Sobat the rains begin earlier and last longer. The rainfall varies from about a year in Tigray and Amhara to over in parts of Oromia.\nThe rainy season is of great importance not only to Ethiopia but to the countries of the Nile valley, as the prosperity of the eastern Sudan and Egypt is largely dependent upon the rainfall. A season of light rain may be sufficient for the needs of Ethiopia, but there is little surplus water to find its way to the Nile; and a shortness of rain means a low Nile, as practically all the flood water of that river is derived from the Ethiopian tributaries.\nFlora and fauna.\nFlora.\nAs in a day's journey the traveller may pass from tropical to almost Alpine conditions of climate, so great also is the range of the flora and fauna.\nIn the valleys and lowlands the vegetation is dense, but the general appearance of the plateaus is of a comparatively bare country with trees and bushes thinly scattered over it. The glens and ravines on the hillside are often thickly wooded, and offer a delightful contrast to the open downs.\nThese conditions are particularly characteristic of the northern regions; in the south the vegetation on the uplands is more luxuriant. Among the many varieties of trees and plants found are the date palm, mimosa, wild olive, giant sycamores, junipers and laurels, the myrrh and other gum trees (gnarled and stunted, these flourish most on the eastern foothills), a magnificent pine (the Natal yellow pine, which resists the attacks of the white ant), the fig, orange, lime, pomegranate, peach, apricot, banana, and other fruit trees; the grape vine (rare), blackberry, and raspberry; the cotton and indigo plants, and occasionally the sugar cane. There are in the south large forests of valuable timber trees; and the coffee plant is indigenous in the Kaffa country, whence it takes its name.\nMany kinds of grasses and flowers abound. Large areas are covered by the kosso, a hardy member of the rose family, which grows from high and has abundant pendent red blossoms. The flowers and the leaves of this plant are highly prized for medicinal purposes. The fruit of the hurarina, a tree found almost exclusively in Shoa, yields a black grain highly esteemed as a spice. On the tableland a great variety of cereals and vegetables are cultivated. A fibrous plant, known as the sansevieria, grows in a wild state in the semi-desert regions of the north and south-east.\nFauna.\nIn addition to the domestic animals enumerated below the fauna is very varied. Elephant can be found in certain low-lying districts, especially in the Sobat valley. The hippopotamus and crocodile inhabit the larger rivers flowing west, but are not found in the Hawash, in which, however, otters of large size are plentiful. Lions abound in the low countries. In central Ethiopia the lion is no longer found except occasionally in the river valleys.\nLeopards, both spotted and black, are numerous and often of great size; hyenas are found everywhere and are hardy and fierce; the lynx, African wolf, wild dog and jackal are also common. Boars and badgers are more rarely seen. The giraffe is found in the western districts, the zebra and wild ass frequent the lower plateaus and the rocky hills of the north. There are large herds of buffalo and antelope, and gazelles of many varieties and in great numbers are met with in most parts of the country.\nAmong the varieties are the greater and lesser kudu (both rather rare); the duiker, gemsbok, hartebeest, gerenuk (the most common\u2014it has long thin legs and a camel-like neck); klipspringer, found on the high plateaus as well as in the lower districts; and the dik-dik, the smallest of the antelopes, its weight rarely exceeding , common in the low countries and the foothills. The African civet is found in many parts of Ethiopia, but chiefly in the Galla regions. Squirrels and hares are numerous, as are several kinds of monkeys, notably the guereza, gelada, guenon and dog-faced baboon. They range from the tropical lowlands to heights of .\nNumerous eagles, vultures, hawks, bustards and other birds of prey live in Ethiopia, as well as partridges, guineafowl, sandgrouse, curlews, woodcock, snipe, pigeons, thrushes and swallows are very plentiful. A fine variety of ostrich is commonly found. Among the birds prized for their plumage are the marabou, crane, heron, blackbird, parrot and jays of extraordinary brilliance.\nAmong insects the most numerous and useful is the bee, honey everywhere constituting an important part of the food of the inhabitants. Of an opposite class is the locust. There are thousands of varieties of butterflies and other insects. Snakes are not numerous, but several species are venomous.\nNatural resources and land use.\nEthiopia has small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, and natural gas. It has extensive hydropower potential.\nOf the total land area, about 20 percent is under cultivation, although the amount of potentially arable land is larger. Only about 10 to 15 percent of the land area is presently covered by forest as a result of rapid deforestation during the last 30 years. Of the remainder, a large portion is used as pasturage. Some land is too rugged, dry, or infertile for agriculture or any other use.\nDisputed border.\nEritrea.\nThe border between Ethiopia and Eritrea was the subject of multiple conflicts between the countries for awhile. Between 1998 and 2000, the two countries fought a war over the issue, which involves quite small enclaves along the northern segment of their border, including the tiny village of Badme and the enclave of the Irob people. An international boundary commission delimited the border in 2002. Although both nations agreed to accept its decision, Ethiopia has refused to accept the commission's findings in full, much to the consternation of the Eritrean government. The conflicts continued sporadically for the next 16 years, ending with the 2018 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia summit. Ethiopia, going back on their previous policy of not giving up the disputed territories, decided to let go of them in order to end the conflict.\nSomalia.\nThe central section of Ethiopia's border with Somalia also has never been fully demarcated, and is only provisional. Prior to 1950, the border between Somalia and Ethiopia was characterized by the 1908 Convention Line or Feerfeer-Dharkayn Geenyo Line.\nQuestions remain about the precise location of small parcels along the border with Sudan as well.\n Eastern Africa, west of Somalia\n Africa\n* Total: 1,127,127 km\u00b2\n* Land: 1,119,683 km\u00b2\n* Water: 7,444\u00a0km\u00b2\n* Total: 59,251\u00a0km\n* Border countries: Djibouti 343\u00a0km, Eritrea 1,033\u00a0km, Kenya 867\u00a0km, Somalia 1,640\u00a0km, South Sudan 1,299\u00a0km and Sudan 744\u00a0km\n 0\u00a0km (landlocked):\n Tropical monsoon with wide topographic-induced variation\n High plateau with central mountain range divided by Great Rift Valley\n* Lowest point: Danakil, \u2212125 m\n* Highest point: Ras Dashen, 4,533 m\n Small reserves of gold, platinum, copper, potash, natural gas, hydropower\n* Arable land: 15.35%\n* Permanent crops: 1.14%\n* Other: 83.51% (2012 est.)\n 2,896\u00a0km\u00b2 (2003)\n 122\u00a0km3 (2011)\n* total: 5.56\u00a0km3/yr (13%/1%/86%)\n* per capita: 80.5 m3/yr (2005)\n Geologically active Great Rift Valley susceptible to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions; frequent droughts\n Deforestation; overgrazing; soil erosion; desertification; water shortages in some areas from water-intensive farming and poor management\n* Party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection\n* Signed, but not ratified: Environmental Modification, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban\n Landlocked \u2013 entire coastline along the Red Sea was lost with the de jure independence of Eritrea on 24 May 1993"}

She carried two 203\u00a0mm guns as well as anti-aircraft guns and (for most of her career) a floatplane. \"Surcouf\" served in the French Navy and, later, the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War.\n\"Surcouf\" disappeared during the night of 18/19 February 1942 in the Caribbean Sea, possibly after colliding with the US freighter \"Thompson Lykes\", although this has not been definitely established. She was named after the French privateer and shipowner Robert Surcouf. She was the largest submarine built until surpassed by the first Japanese I-400 class aircraft carrier submarine in 1944.\nDesign.\nThe Washington Naval Treaty had placed strict limits on naval construction by the major naval powers in regard to displacements and artillery calibers of battleships and cruisers. However, no agreements were reached in respect of light ships such as frigates, destroyers or submarines. In addition, to ensure the country's protection and that of the empire, France started the construction of an important submarine fleet (79 units in 1939). \"Surcouf\" was intended to be the first of a class of three submarine cruisers; however, she was the only one completed.\nThe missions revolved around:\nTechnics.\nShip dimensions.\nSurcouf had a length of 110 meters (361 feet), a beam of 9 meters (29 feet 6 inches), and a draught of 7.25 meters (23 feet 9 inches). Her overall height was 15 meters (49 feet). She displaced 3,304 tonnes when surfaced and 4,304 tonnes when submerged. The submarine was rated for a test depth of 80 meters (260 feet) and carried a complement of 118 officers and men.\nPropulsion.\nSurcouf was powered on the surface by two Sulzer diesel engines producing a total of 7,600 horsepower, driving two propeller shafts. When submerged, she switched to two electric motors delivering 3,400 horsepower. This allowed for a maximum surface speed of 18.5 knots (34.3 km/h) and a submerged speed of 8.5 knots (15.7 km/h). Her operational range was 10,000 nautical miles (19,000 km) at 10 knots, making her suitable for oceanic patrols.\nArmament.\n\"Surcouf\"'s main armament was a unique twin turret of 203 mm (8-inch) guns, the largest caliber ever mounted on a submarine. The guns had a range of up to 26,000 meters (16 miles) and could be loaded while surfaced. For close-in defense, she carried two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns and four 13.2 mm machine guns. Her torpedo armament included eight 550 mm tubes in the bow and four 400 mm tubes in the stern. Surcouf also carried a Besson MB.411 floatplane in a watertight hangar, launched by catapult for reconnaissance and gunfire spotting.\nEight 550\u00a0mm and four 400\u00a0mm reloads were carried. The 203\u00a0 Mod\u00e8le 1924 guns were in a pressure-tight turret forward of the conning tower. The guns had a 60-round magazine capacity and were controlled by a director with a rangefinder, mounted high enough to view an horizon, and able to fire within three minutes after surfacing. Using the boat's periscopes to direct the fire of the main guns, \"Surcouf\" could increase the visible range to ; originally an elevating platform was supposed to lift lookouts high, but this design was abandoned quickly due to the effect of roll. \nThe Besson observation plane could be used to direct fire out to the guns' maximum range. Anti-aircraft cannon and machine guns were mounted on the top of the hangar.\n\"Surcouf\" also carried a motorboat, and contained a cargo compartment with fittings to restrain 40 prisoners or lodge 40 passengers. The submarine's fuel tanks were very large; having enough fuel for a range and supplies for 90-day patrols. The first commanding officer was Frigate Captain (\"Capitaine de Fr\u00e9gate\", a rank equivalent to Commander) Raymond de Belot.\nThe boat encountered several technical challenges:\nTo replace the floatplane, whose functioning was initially constrained and limited in use, trials were conducted with an autogyro in 1938.\nAppearance.\nFrom the beginning of the boat's career until 1932, the boat was painted the same grey colour as surface warships, but thereafter in \"Prussian dark blue\", a colour which was retained until the end of 1940 when it was repainted with two tones of grey, serving as camouflage on the hull and conning tower.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nSoon after \"Surcouf\" was launched, the London Naval Treaty finally placed restrictions on submarine designs. Among other things, each signatory (France included) was permitted to possess no more than three large submarines, each not exceeding standard displacement, with guns not exceeding in caliber. \"Surcouf\", which would have exceeded these limits, was specially exempt from the rules at the insistence of Navy Minister Georges Leygues, but other 'big-gun' submarines of this boat's class could no longer be built.\nSecond World War.\nIn 1940, \"Surcouf\" was based in Cherbourg, but in May, when the Germans invaded, she was being refitted in Brest following a mission in the Antilles and Gulf of Guinea. Under command of Frigate Captain Martin, unable to dive and with only one engine functioning and a jammed rudder, she limped across the English Channel and sought refuge in Plymouth.\nOn 3 July, the British, concerned that the French Fleet would be taken over by the German \"Kriegsmarine\" at the French armistice, executed Operation Catapult. The Royal Navy blockaded the harbours where French warships were anchored, and delivered an ultimatum: rejoin the fight against Germany, be put out of reach of the Germans, or scuttle. Few accepted willingly; the North African fleet at Mers-el-Kebir and the ships based at Dakar (French West Africa) refused. The French battleships in North Africa were eventually attacked and all but one sunk at their moorings by the Mediterranean Fleet.\nFrench ships lying at ports in Britain and Canada were also boarded by armed marines, sailors and soldiers, but the only serious incident took place at Plymouth aboard \"Surcouf\" on 3 July, when two Royal Navy submarine officers, Commander Denis 'Lofty' Sprague, captain of , and Lieutenant Patrick Griffiths of , and French warrant officer mechanic Yves Daniel were fatally wounded, and a British seaman, Albert Webb, was shot dead by the submarine's doctor.\nFree French Naval Forces.\nBy August 1940, the British completed \"Surcouf\"'s refit and turned her over to the Free French Naval Forces (\"Forces Navales Fran\u00e7aises Libres\", FNFL) for convoy patrol. The only officer not repatriated from the original crew, Frigate Captain Georges Louis Blaison, became the new commanding officer. Because of Anglo-French tensions with regard to the submarine, accusations were made by each side that the other was spying for Vichy France; the British also claimed \"Surcouf\" was attacking British ships. Later, a British officer and two sailors were put aboard for \"liaison\" purposes. One real drawback was she required a crew of 110\u2013130 men, which represented three crews of more conventional submarines. This led to Royal Navy reluctance to recommission her.\n\"Surcouf\" then went to the Canadian base at Halifax, Nova Scotia and escorted trans-Atlantic convoys. In April 1941, she was damaged by a German plane at Devonport. On 28 July, \"Surcouf\" went to the United States Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine for a three-month refit. After leaving the shipyard, \"Surcouf\" went to New London, Connecticut, perhaps to receive additional training for her crew. \"Surcouf\" left New London on 27 November to return to Halifax.\nCapture of St. Pierre and Miquelon.\nIn December 1941, \"Surcouf\" carried the Free French Admiral \u00c9mile Muselier to Canada, putting into Quebec City. While the Admiral was in Ottawa, conferring with the Canadian government, \"Surcouf\"'s captain was approached by \"The New York Times\" reporter Ira Wolfert and questioned about the rumours the submarine would liberate Saint-Pierre and Miquelon for Free France. Wolfert accompanied the submarine to Halifax, where, on 20 December, they joined Free French \"Escorteurs\" corvettes \"Mimosa\", , and , and on 24 December, took control of the islands for Free France without resistance.\nUnited States Secretary of State Cordell Hull had just concluded an agreement with the Vichy government guaranteeing the neutrality of French possessions in the Western hemisphere, and he threatened to resign unless President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt demanded a restoration of the status quo. Roosevelt did so, but when Charles de Gaulle refused, Roosevelt dropped the matter. Ira Wolfert's stories \u2013 very favourable to the Free French (and bearing no sign of kidnapping or other duress) \u2013 helped swing American popular opinion away from the Vichy government. The Axis Powers' declaration of war on the United States in December 1941 negated the agreement, but the U.S. did not sever diplomatic ties with the Vichy Government until November 1942.\nLater operations.\nIn January 1942, the Free French leadership decided to send \"Surcouf\" to the Pacific theatre, after she had been re-supplied at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda. However, her movement south triggered rumours that \"Surcouf\" was going to liberate Martinique from the Vichy regime.\nIn fact, \"Surcouf\" was bound for Sydney, Australia, via Tahiti. She departed Halifax on 2 February for Bermuda, which she left on 12 February, bound for the Panama Canal.\nFate.\n\"Surcouf\" vanished on the night of 18/19 February 1942, about north of Crist\u00f3bal, Panama, while \"en route\" for Tahiti, \"via\" the Panama Canal. An American report concluded the disappearance was due to an accidental collision with the American freighter . Steaming alone from Guantanamo Bay on what was a very dark night, the freighter reported hitting and running down a partially submerged object which scraped along her side and keel. Her lookouts heard people in the water but, thinking she had hit a U-boat, the freighter did not stop although cries for help were heard in English. A signal was sent to Panama describing the incident.\nThe loss resulted in 130 deaths (including 4 Royal Navy personnel), under the command of Frigate Captain Georges Louis Nicolas Blaison. The loss of \"Surcouf\" was announced by the Free French Headquarters in London on 18 April 1942, and was reported in \"The New York Times\" the next day. It was not reported \"Surcouf\" was sunk as the result of a collision with the \"Thompson Lykes\" until January 1945. The investigation of the French commission concluded the disappearance was the consequence of misunderstanding. A Consolidated PBY, patrolling the same waters on the night of 18/19 February, could have attacked \"Surcouf\" believing her to be German or Japanese. \nInquiries into the incident were haphazard and late, while a later French inquiry supported the idea that the sinking had been due to \"friendly fire\"; this conclusion was supported by Rear Admiral Gabriel Auphan in his book \"The French Navy in World War II\". Charles de Gaulle stated in his memoirs that \"Surcouf\" \"had sunk with all hands\".\nLegacy.\nAs no one has officially dived or verified the wreck of \"Surcouf\", her location is unknown. If one assumes the \"Thompson Lykes\" incident was indeed the event of \"Surcouf's\" sinking, then the wreck would lie deep at .\nA monument commemorates the loss in the port of Cherbourg in Normandy, France. The loss is also commemorated by the Free French Memorial on Lyle Hill in Greenock, Scotland.\nAs there is no conclusive confirmation that \"Thompson Lykes\" collided with \"Surcouf\", and her wreck has yet to be discovered, there are alternative stories of her fate. James Rusbridger examined some of these theories in his book \"Who Sank Surcouf?\", finding them all easily dismissible except one: the records of the 6th Heavy Bomber Group operating out of Panama show them sinking a large submarine the morning of 19 February. Since no German submarine was lost in the area on that date, she could have been \"Surcouf\". He suggested the collision had damaged \"Surcouf\"'s radio and the stricken boat limped towards Panama hoping for the best.\nA conspiracy theory, based on no significant evidence, held that the \"Surcouf\", during her stationing at New London in late 1941, had been caught treacherously supplying a German U-boat in Long Island Sound, pursued by the American training subs \"Marlin\" and \"Mackerel\" out of New London, and sunk. The rumor circulated into the early 21st century, but is false since the \"Surcouf\"'s later movements south are well documented.\nIn popular media.\nThe \"Surcouf\" is the subject of an underwater search by the fictional organization \"NUMA\" and international terrorists in the Clive Cussler novel \"The Corsican Shadow\", published in 2023. The author Dirk Cussler, writes the \"Surcouf\"'s wreck was discovered \"...some eighty miles off the Panama coast.\" The sinking is even attributed to \"Surcouf\"'s radio antenna being damaged in the collision with the \"Thompson Lykes\", and then finished off by the reported attack of an A-17 bomber the next morning.Douglas Reeman wrote \"Strike from the Sea\", a novel published in 1978, about a French cruiser submarine named \"Soufriere\", modeled on the Surcouf.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Construction began at Lorient Naval Dockyard on 6 July 1992, launched 3 July 1993, and the ship was commissioned May 1996. Since entering service, \"Surcouf\" has taken part in numerous missions, notably in Operation Antilope (Gabon and Congo), Operation Trident (Kosovo) and Mission Khor Anga in the Djibouti zone.\nService history.\nOn 14 May 2001, \"Surcouf\" rendered assistance to the skipper of \"Biscuits La Trinitaine-Team Ethypharm\", who had to abandon his ship after her starboard hull was seriously damaged. The catamaran's crew of five were airlifted to safety by helicopter.\nOn 14 October 2004, \"Surcouf\" assisted \"Sara 2\", a Panamanian cargo ship which ran aground near Yemen. The 16-man crew was successfully airlifted by the Panther helicopter, and later transferred from the frigate to the Yemeni coast guard.\nBetween 17 and 21 May 2008, \"Surcouf \" participated in Exercise KhunjarHaad, a multi-national exercise held in the Gulf of Oman. Other participating warships included the American destroyer , the British frigate , the British fleet replenishment tanker and four other coalition ships conducted air defense; surface warfare operation; visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS); and joint gunnery exercises, which focused on joint interoperability training and proficiency.\nIn November 2012 \"Surcouf\" deployed to the Horn of Africa as part of the European Union's Naval Operation in the area. A British Lynx HMA.8 helicopter of 815 Squadron was on board for the whole four-month deployment, along with 12 personnel including 2 Royal Marine snipers. This was the first extended deployment of a Royal Navy helicopter on a French warship and was the result of a treaty between the United Kingdom and France to share military resources and conduct more joint operations. \nDuring a 2017\u201318 refit, the frigate was equipped with a Thales Bluewatcher sonar as part of a two-year trial that was subsequently extended through 2022. \"Surcouf\" was the first \"La Fayette\"-class ship to receive an active sonar capability.\nIn 2021, \"Surcouf\" deployed to the Pacific accompanying the French Navy helicopter assault ship .\nIn April 2022, \"Surcouf\", with a Panther helicopter embarked, again deployed to the Indian Ocean to relieve her sister ship . From 26 until 30 May 2022, \"Surcouf\" trained with the Kuwait Naval Force.\nIn October 2023 \"Surcouf\" was deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean during the Gaza war, joining the helicopter assault ship \"Tonnerre\" and the frigate which were also deployed to the region.\n\"Surcouf\" had been scheduled to undergo a modest structural and technical upgrade (with the elderly Crotale SAM to be removed from the vessel) and, given somewhat reduced general purpose capability, be re-assigned to offshore patrol duties prior to her planned withdrawal from service in 2027. While initially there was some uncertainty as to whether this change in role would take place, in 2024 Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, chief of the naval staff, told the National Assembly that \"Surcouf\" and her sister ship \"Gu\u00e9pratte\" would undertake the offshore patrol role in order to fill a gap created by the delayed arrival of the Patrouilleurs Hauturiers OPVs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce () to the thick pastry cream () used to fill \u00e9clairs. The most common custards are used in custard desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla; however, savory custards are also found, e.g., in quiche.\nPreparation.\nCustard is usually cooked in a double boiler (\"bain-marie\"), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation because a \"temperature\" increase of leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed ; it begins setting at . A bain marie water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. Adding a small amount of cornflour (U.S. \"corn starch\") to the egg-sugar mixture stabilises the resulting custard, allowing it to be cooked in a single pan as well as in a double-boiler. A \"sous-vide\" water bath may be used to precisely control temperature.\nVariations.\nWhile custard may refer to a wide variety of thickened dishes, technically (and in French cookery) the word \"custard\" (\"cr\u00e8me\" or more precisely \"cr\u00e8me moul\u00e9e\", ) refers only to an egg-thickened custard.\nWhen starch is added, the result is called 'pastry cream' (, ) or confectioners' custard, made with a combination of milk or cream, egg yolks, fine sugar, flour or some other starch, and usually a flavoring such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon. \"Cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re\" is a key ingredient in many French desserts, including \"mille-feuille\" (or Napoleons) and filled tarts. It is also used in Italian pastry and sometimes in Boston cream pie. The thickening of the custard is caused by the combination of egg and starch. Corn flour or flour thickens at and as such many recipes instruct the pastry cream to be boiled. In a traditional custard such as a \"cr\u00e8me anglaise\", where eggs are used alone as a thickener, boiling results in the over-cooking and subsequent curdling of the custard; however, in a pastry cream, starch prevents this. Once cooled, the amount of starch in pastry cream sets the cream and requires it to be beaten or whipped before use.\n When gelatin is added, it is known as \"cr\u00e8me anglaise coll\u00e9e\" (). When gelatin is added and whipped cream is folded in, and it sets in a mold, it is \"bavarois\". When starch is used alone as a thickener (without eggs), the result is a \"blancmange\".\nIn the United Kingdom, custard has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see custard powder.\nAfter the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites and gelatin, it is chiboust cream; mixed with whipped cream, it is \"cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re\", . Beating in softened butter produces German buttercream or cr\u00e8me mousseline.\nA quiche is a savoury custard tart. Some kinds of timbale or vegetable loaf are made of a custard base mixed with chopped savoury ingredients. \"Custard royale\" is a thick custard cut into decorative shapes and used to garnish soup, stew or broth. In German, it is known as \"Eierstich\" and is used as a garnish in German Wedding Soup (\"Hochzeitssuppe\"). \"Chawanmushi\" is a Japanese savoury custard, steamed and served in a small bowl or on a saucer. Chinese steamed egg is a similar but larger savoury egg dish. \"Bougatsa\" is a Greek breakfast pastry whose sweet version consists of semolina custard filling between layers of phyllo.\nCustard may also be used as a top layer in gratins, such as the South African bobotie and many Balkan versions of \"moussaka\".\nIn Peru, \"leche asada\" (\"baked milk\") is custard baked in individual molds. It is considered a restaurant dish.\nIn French cuisine.\nFrench cuisine has several named variations on custard:\nUses.\nRecipes involving sweet custard are listed in the , and include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nCustards baked in pastry (custard tarts) were very popular in the Middle Ages, and are the origin of the English word 'custard': the French term croustade originally referred to the crust of a tart, and is derived from the Italian word crostata, and ultimately the Latin .\nExamples include \"Crustardes of flessh\" and \"Crustade\", in the 14th century English collection \"The Forme of Cury\". These recipes include solid ingredients such as meat, fish, and fruit bound by the custard. Stirred custards cooked in pots are also found under the names \"Creme Boylede\" and \"Creme boiled\". Some custards especially in the Elizabethan era used marigold (\"calendula\") to give the custard color.\nIn modern times, the name 'custard' is sometimes applied to starch-thickened preparations like blancmange and Bird's Custard powder.\nChemistry.\nStirred custard is thickened by coagulation of egg protein, while the same gives baked custard its gel structure. The type of milk used also impacts the result. Most important to a successfully stirred custard is to avoid excessive heat that will cause over-coagulation and syneresis that will result in a curdled custard.\nEggs contain the proteins necessary for the gel structure to form, and emulsifiers to maintain the structure. Egg yolk also contains enzymes like amylase, which can break down added starch. This enzyme activity contributes to the overall thinning of custard in the mouth. Egg yolk lecithin also helps to maintain the milk-egg interface. The proteins in egg whites are set at .\nStarch is sometimes added to custard to prevent premature curdling. The starch acts as a heat buffer in the mixture: as they hydrate, they absorb heat and help maintain a constant rate of heat transfer. Starches also make for a smoother texture and thicker mouth feel.\nIf the mixture pH is 9 or higher, the gel is too hard; if it is below 5, the gel structure has difficulty forming because protonation prevents the formation of covalent bonds.\nPhysical-chemical properties.\nCooked (set) custard is a weak gel, viscous, and thixotropic; while it does become easier to stir the more it is manipulated, it does not, unlike many other thixotropic liquids, recover its lost viscosity over time. On the other hand, a suspension of uncooked imitation custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, allowing the demonstration of \"walking on custard\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is recognized for its saltiness and pronounced umami taste.\nSoy sauce was created in its current form about 2,200 years ago during the Western Han dynasty of ancient China. Since then, it has become an important ingredient in East and Southeast Asian cooking as well as a condiment worldwide.\nUse and storage.\nSoy sauce can be added directly to food, and is used as a dip or salt flavor in cooking. It is often eaten with rice, noodles, and sushi or sashimi, or can also be mixed with ground wasabi for dipping. Bottles of soy sauce for the salty seasoning of various foods are common on restaurant tables in many countries. Soy sauce can be stored at room temperature.\nHistory.\nAsia.\nChina.\nSoy sauce (, ) is considered almost as old as soy paste\u2014a type of fermented paste (, ) obtained from soybeans\u2014which had appeared during the Western Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) and was listed in the bamboo slips found in the archaeological site Mawangdui (). There are several precursors of soy sauce that are associated products with soy paste. The oldest is (), which appeared in AD 40 and was listed in (). Others are (), () and (), which were recorded in the () in AD 540. By the time of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), the term \"soy sauce\" () had become the accepted name for the liquid condiment, documented in two books: () and \"Pujiang Wushi Zhongkuilu\" () during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD).\nLike many salty condiments, soy sauce was originally a way to stretch salt, historically an expensive commodity. During the Zhou dynasty of ancient China, fermented fish with salt was used as a condiment in which soybeans were included during the fermentation process. By the time of the Han dynasty, this had been replaced with the recipe for soy paste and its by-product soy sauce, by using soybeans as the principal ingredient, with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce.\nThe 19th century Sinologist Samuel Wells Williams wrote that in China, the best soy sauce was \"made by boiling beans soft, adding an equal quantity of wheat or barley, and leaving the mass to ferment; a portion of salt and three times as much water are afterwards put in, and the whole compound left for two or three months when the liquid is pressed and strained\".\nJapan.\nA condiment that predated soy sauce in Japan was , a fish sauce. When practitioners of Buddhism came to Japan from China in the 7th century, they introduced vegetarianism and brought many soy-based products with them, such as soy sauce, which is known as in Japan. exportation began in 1647 by the Dutch East India Company.\nKorea.\nThe earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun in the era of the Three Kingdoms. Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No. 3 from the 4th century Goguryeo.\nIn \"Samguk sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is written that (soy sauce) and (soybean paste), along with (soybean block) and (salted seafood), were prepared for the wedding ceremony of the King Sinmun in February 683. , a section from (History of Goryeo), recorded that and were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as and contain the detailed procedures on how to brew good quality and . explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve and .\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, soy sauce was likely first recorded through the documentation of the traditional dish adobo in 1613 via the San Buenaventura paper. Food historian Raymond Sokolov noted that the ingredients used in the dish, including soy sauce, likely were present in the native cuisine even before the colonial-era record.\nEurope.\nRecords of the Dutch East India Company list soy sauce as a commodity in 1737, when seventy-five large barrels were shipped from Dejima, Japan, to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on the island of Java. Thirty-five barrels from that shipment were then shipped to the Netherlands. In the 18th century, diplomat and scholar Isaac Titsingh published accounts of brewing soy sauce. Although earlier descriptions of soy sauce had been disseminated in the West, his was among the earliest to focus specifically on the brewing of the Japanese version. By the mid-19th century, Japanese soy sauce gradually disappeared from the European market, and the condiment became synonymous with the Chinese product. Europeans were unable to make soy sauce because they did not have access to \"Aspergillus oryzae\", the fungus used in its brewing. Soy sauce made from ingredients such as portobello mushrooms were disseminated in European cookbooks during the late 18th century. A Swedish recipe for was published in the 1770 edition of Cajsa Warg's and was flavored with allspice and mace.\nUnited States.\nSoy sauce production in the United States began in the Territory of Hawaii in 1905 by Yamajo Soy Co, which by 1909 was renamed the Hawaiian Soy Company Ltd. La Choy started selling hydrolyzed vegetable protein\u2013based soy sauce in 1933.\nProduction.\nSoy sauce is made either by fermentation or by hydrolysis. Some commercial sauces have both fermented and chemical sauces.\nFlavor, color, and aroma developments during production are attributed to non-enzymatic Maillard browning.\nVariation is usually achieved as the result of different methods and durations of fermentation, different ratios of water, salt, and fermented soy, or through the addition of other ingredients.\nTraditional.\nTraditional soy sauces are made by mixing soybeans and grain with mold cultures such as \"Aspergillus oryzae\" and other related microorganisms and yeasts (the resulting mixture is called Koji in Japan; the term is used both for the mixture of soybeans, wheat, and mold as well as for the mold itself). Historically, the mixture was fermented naturally in large urns and under the sun, which was believed to contribute extra flavors. Today, the mixture is placed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled incubation chamber.\nTraditional soy sauces take months to make:\nHigh-salt liquid-state fermented soy sauce.\nHigh-salt liquid-state fermentation (HLF) of soybeans depends heavily on microbial activity, metabolism and enzymatic hydrolysis of macronutrients. Most traditional approaches fall into the scope of HLF.\nLow-salt solid-state fermented soy sauce.\nLSF, also referred as rapid fermenting, is a modern fermentation method invented in response to high market demand.\nLSF evolved from \"salt-free solid-state fermentation\", an even faster method working at even higher temperatures () and taking 72 hours to complete, introduced to China from the Soviet Union in 1958. The aging time turned out to be too short develop a proper flavor profile, with burnt acidic notes left in the sauce. LSF is a compromise between this method and the more traditional HLF: the product tastes passable with more microbes allowed to survive, but still lacks depth. Reducing the salt content accelerates brewing by lifting salt-induced enzyme inhibition.\nAcid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein.\nSome brands of soy sauce are made from acid-hydrolyzed soy protein instead of brewed with a traditional culture. This takes about three days. Although they have a different flavor, aroma, and texture when compared to brewed soy sauces, they can be produced more quickly and cheaply, and also have a longer shelf life and are usually made for these reasons. The clear plastic packets of dark sauce common with Chinese-style take-out food typically use a hydrolyzed vegetable protein formula. Some higher-priced hydrolyzed vegetable protein products with no added sugar or colorings are sold as low-sodium soy sauce alternatives called \"liquid aminos\" in health food stores, similar to the way salt substitutes are used. These products are, however, not necessarily low in sodium.\nChemical composition.\nThe chemical composition of soy sauce is affected by the proportions of raw materials, fermentation methodologies, fermenting molds and strains, and post-fermentation treatments. Although the formation mechanism of chemical composition in soy sauce is complex, it has been widely accepted that free amino acids, water-soluble peptides and Maillard reaction products in soy sauce are considered as essential chemical composition and to provide core sensory effects.\nThe primary fermentation of lactic-acid-fermenting halophiles lowers the pH of the moromi, and this directly results in the acidic pH range (4.4\u20135.4) of soy sauce products. The secondary fermentation conducted by heterofermentative microbes provides soy sauce with a wide range of flavor and odorant compounds by breaking down macronutrients. Soy proteins and grain proteins are hydrolyzed into short peptide chains and free amino acids, which adds umami to the product. Based on the result of free amino acid analysis, the most abundant amino acids in Chinese soy sauce product are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and leucine.\nStarch is hydrolyzed into simple sugars which contribute to the sweet flavor in soy sauce. Legume fats may also be decomposed into short chain fatty acids, and the interactions among lipids and other macronutrients also result in a richer flavor in the final product. Non-enzymatic browning also contributes significantly to the development of the properties of soy sauce. The hydrolysis of proteins and large carbohydrates also provides free amino acids and simple sugars as reagents for the Maillard reaction.\nSoy sauce may contain more than 1% alcohol and may run afoul of liquor control legislation.\nSensory profile.\nThe taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweetness, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids, mainly glutamine and aspartic acid. Sodium from the brine and disodium ribonucleotides from the soy also add to the umami. Other amino acids cause additional basic flavors, with sweet coming from Ala, Gly, Ser, and Thr; bitter coming from Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Val; and no taste from Cys, Lys, and Pro. The amino-acid nitrogen content, an indication of the free amino acid concentration, is used in China for grading soy sauce. The highest \"special grade\" is defined at \u2265\u00a00.8\u00a0g/100\u00a0mL.\nDespite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product \"per se\" does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes have been identified in Chinese soy sauces. An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a \"critical balance\" achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low.\nVariations by country.\nSoy sauce is widely used as an important flavoring and has been integrated into the traditional cuisines of many East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. Despite their rather similar appearance, soy sauces made in different cultures and regions are different in taste, consistency, fragrance and saltiness. Soy sauce retains its quality longer when kept away from direct sunlight.\nBurmese.\nBurmese soy sauce production is dated back to the Bagan Era in the 9th and 10th century. Scripts written in praise of \"pe ngan byar yay\" (, literally \"bean fish sauce\") were found. Thick soy sauce is called \"kya nyo\" (, from Chinese \"ji\u00e0ngy\u00f3u\").\nChinese.\nChinese soy sauces (; or alternatively, ; ) are primarily made from soybeans, with relatively low amounts of other grains. Chinese soy sauce produced by fermentation can be roughly split into two classes: brewed (direct fermented) or blended (with additives), occupying about 40% and 60% of market share respectively. Sauces can also be classed by fermentation technology (shown above) into Low-Salt Solid-State fermented soy sauce (LSF; ) and High-Salt Liquid-State fermented soy sauce (HLF; ), occupying about 90% and 10% of market share respectively.\nBrewed.\nSoy sauce can be brewed directly from a fermentation process using wheat, soybeans, salt, and water without additional additives.\nBlended.\nAdditives with sweet or umami tastes are sometimes added to a finished brewed soy sauce to modify its taste and texture.\nBesides the above traditional types, hydrolyzed vegetable protein and other flavor enhancers may be mixed with brewed soy sauce to produce cheaper substitutes. This type is known as \"blended soy sauce\" () in China until 2019, when a Chinese 2018 standard that removed this type from the definition of soy sauce went into effect.\nThe 2018 Chinese standard defines soy sauce as \"liquid condiments with special color, aroma and taste made from soybeans and/or defatted soybeans, wheat and/or wheat flour and/or wheat bran as main raw materials through microbial fermentation.\" It still allows food additives to be used \"following the definitions of GB 2760\", which does not restrict the use of MSG and disodium ribonucleotides. (Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is not listed as a food additive in GB 2760 and is therefore unacceptable in products labelled as \"soy sauce\".)\nFilipino.\nIn the Philippines, soy sauce is called toy\u00f2 in the native languages, derived from \"tau-yu\" in Philippine Hokkien. Philippine soy sauce is usually a combination of soybeans, wheat, salt, and caramel color. It is thinner in texture and has a saltier taste than its Southeast Asian counterparts. It is most similar to the Japanese \"koikuchi sh\u014dyu\" in terms of consistency and the use of wheat, though toy\u00f2 is slightly saltier and darker in color.\nToy\u00f2 is used as a marinade, an ingredient in cooked dishes, and most often as a table condiment, usually alongside other sauces such as fish sauce (\"pat\u00eds\") and sugar cane vinegar (\"suk\u00e0\"). It is often mixed and served with the juice of the calamansi (\u00d7 \"Citrofortunella microcarpa\"; also called calamondin, \"limonsito\"). The combination is known as \"toyomans\u00ee\", which can be comparable to the Japanese \"ponzu\" sauce (soy sauce with yuzu). \"Toy\u00f2\" is also a main ingredient in Philippine adobo, one of the more famous dishes of Filipino cuisine.\nHawaiian.\nSoy sauce is a ubiquitous condiment and ingredient in many dishes in Hawaiian cuisine, where it is commonly known by its Japanese name by locals. \"Aloha Shoyu\" is a soy sauce manufacturer in Hawaii that produces a popular soy sauce whose flavor is more delicate and somewhat sweeter compared to other more well-known soy sauces.\nIndonesian.\nIn Indonesia, soy sauce is known as \"kecap\" (old spelling: \"ketjap\"), which is a catch-all term for fermented sauces, and cognate to the English word \"ketchup\". The most popular type of soy sauce in Indonesian cuisine is \"kecap manis\" or sweet soy sauce. The term \"kecap\" is also used to describe other condiments and sauces of a similar appearance, such as \"kecap ikan\" (fish sauce) and \"kecap Inggris\" (worcestershire sauce; lit. \"English sauce\" or \"England sauce\"). Three common varieties of soy-based \"kecap\" exist in Indonesian cuisine, used either as ingredients or condiments:\nJapanese.\n is officially divided into five main types by the JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) depending on differences in their ingredients and method of production. These types are , , , , and .\nMost, but not all, Japanese soy sauces include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends to give them a slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic sherry-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural preservative. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, so some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as chicken stock.\nSome soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about 50% wheat.\nVarieties.\nNewer varieties of Japanese soy sauce include:\nAll of these varieties are sold in three different grades according to how they were made:\nAll the varieties and grades may be sold according to three official levels of quality:\nKorean.\nIn South Korea, soy sauces or \"ganjang\" (, \"seasoning sauce\") can be roughly split into two categories: \"hansik ganjang\" ('Korean-style soy sauce') and ('modernized soy sauce'). The term can also refer to non-soy-based salty condiments, such as fish sauce.\n\"Hansik ganjang\".\n (, 'Korean-style soy sauce') is made entirely of fermented soybean (meju) and brine. It is a byproduct of \"doenjang\" (fermented soybean paste) production, and has a unique fermented soybean flavour. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean ganjang varieties, \"hansik ganjang\" is used mainly in guk (soup) and namul (seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine. Common names for \"hansik ganjang\" include \"jaeraesik ganjang\" (, \"traditional soy sauce\"), \"Joseon-ganjang\" (, \"Joseon soy sauce\"), and \"guk-ganjang\" (, \"soup soy sauce\"). The homebrewed variety is also called \"jip-ganjang\" (, \"home soy sauce\").\nDepending on the length of aging, \"hansik ganjang\" can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark.\nThe Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies \"hansik-ganjang\" into two categories by their ingredients.\n\"Gaeryang ganjang\".\n\"Gaeryang-ganjang\" (, \"modernized soy sauce\"), referring to varieties of soy sauces not made of meju, is now the most widely used type of soy sauce in modern Korean cuisine. The word \"ganjang\" without modifiers in bokkeum (stir-fry), jorim (braised or simmered dishes), and jjim (steamed dishes) recipes usually mean \"gaeryang-ganjang\". Another common name of \"gaeryang-ganjang\" is \"jin-ganjang\" (, \"dark soy sauce\"), because \"gaeryang-ganjang\" varieties are usually darker in appearance compared to traditional \"hansik ganjang\". Having been introduced to Korea during the era of Japanese forced occupation, \"garyang ganjang\" is also called \"Wae-ganjang\" (, \"Wae soy sauce\").\nKorean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies \"gaeryang-ganjang\" into four categories by their method of production.\nMalaysian and Singaporean.\nMalays from Malaysia, using the Malay dialect similar to Indonesian, use the word \"kicap\" for soy sauce. \"Kicap\" is traditionally of two types: \"kicap lemak\" (lit \"fat/rich soy sauce\") and \"kicap cair\". \"Kicap lemak\" is similar to Indonesian \"kecap manis\" but with very much less sugar, while \"kicap cair\" is the Malaysian equivalent of \"kecap asin\".\nPeru.\nSoy sauce, known in Peru as \"sillao\" from the Cantonese name of the item, is an important ingredient in Chifa.\nSri Lankan.\nSoy sauce () is a popular food product used in Sri Lanka and is a major ingredient used in the nationally popular street food dish kottu. Soy sauce has largely been produced by the Sri Lankan Chinese community but its production has also spread to other communities in Sri Lanka. Soy sauce production in Sri Lanka is the same as the production of soy sauce in Indonesia. Fermentation occurs over a period of three months. The soy beans which are steeped in brine are then pressed to obtain a liquid sauce.\nTaiwanese.\nThe history of soy sauce making in Taiwan can be traced back to southeastern China, in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Taiwanese soy sauce is known for its black bean variant, known as black bean soy sauce (\u9ed1\u8c46\u852d\u6cb9), which producers claim to have stronger flavor and more nutrition. Most soy sauce makers in Taiwan make soy sauce from soybeans and wheat using machines, which is a technique introduced during Japanese rule. A smaller number of producers continue to handmake soy sauce in the traditional way.\nThai.\nIn Thailand, soy sauce is called \"sii-\u00edu\" (). \"Sii-\u00edu k\u01ceao\" (, 'white soy sauce') is used as regular soy sauce in Thai cuisine, while \"sii-\u00edu dam\" (, 'black soy sauce') is used primarily for colour. Another darker-coloured variety, \"sii-\u00edu w\u01cean\" (, 'sweet soy sauce') is used for dipping sauces. \"S\u0254\u0301\u0254t prung r\u00f3t\" (, 'seasoning sauce') is also commonly used in modern Thai cuisine.\nVietnamese.\nIn Vietnam, Chinese-style soy sauce is called \"x\u00ec d\u1ea7u\" (derived from the Cantonese name \u8c49\u6cb9) or \"n\u01b0\u1edbc t\u01b0\u01a1ng\". The term \"soy sauce\" could also imply other condiments and soy bean paste with thick consistency known as \"t\u01b0\u01a1ng\". Both are used mostly as a seasoning or dipping sauce for a number of dishes. Vietnamese cuisine itself favors fish sauce in cooking, but \"n\u01b0\u1edbc t\u01b0\u01a1ng\" has a clear presence in vegetarian cuisine and Buddhist cuisine.\nNutrition.\nA study by the National University of Singapore showed that Chinese dark soy sauce contains 10 times the antioxidants of red wine. Unpasteurized soy sauce is rich in lactic acid bacteria and of excellent anti-allergic potential.\nSoy sauce does not contain the level of isoflavones associated with other soy products, such as tofu or edamame. It can also be very salty, having a salt content between 14 and 18%. Low-sodium soy sauces are made, but it is difficult to make soy sauce without using some quantity of salt as an antimicrobial agent.\nA serving of of soy sauce contains, according to the USDA:\nCarcinogens.\nSoy sauce may contain ethyl carbamate, a Group 2A carcinogen.\nIn 2001, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency found in testing various soy sauces manufactured in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand (made from hydrolyzed soy protein, rather than being naturally fermented) that 22% of tested samples contained a chemical carcinogen named 3-MCPD (3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol) at levels considerably higher than those deemed safe by the EU. About two-thirds of these samples also contained a second carcinogenic chemical named 1,3-DCP (1,3-dichloropropane-2-ol) which experts advise should not be present at any levels in food. Both chemicals have the potential to cause cancer, and the Agency recommended that the affected products be withdrawn from shelves and avoided. The same carcinogens were found in soy sauces manufactured in Vietnam, causing a food scare in 2007.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Health Canada has concluded that there is no health risk to Canadians from use of available soy and oyster sauces. Because continuous lifetime exposure to high levels of 3-MCPD could pose a health risk, Health Canada has established 1.0 part per million (ppm) as a guideline for importers of these sauces, in order to reduce Canadians' long-term exposure to this chemical. This is considered to be a very safe level.\nAllergies.\nSoy sauce allergy not caused by soy or wheat allergy is rare. Most varieties of soy sauce contain wheat, to which some people have a medical intolerance. However, protein hydrolysis (fermentation or industrial) breaks down gluten, so some soy sauces may end up tolerable to gluten-intolerant individuals with no detectable gluten left. Japanese tamari soy sauce is traditionally wheat-free, and some tamari available commercially today is wheat- and gluten-free.\nAcid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein is non-allergenic due to the completeness of protein breakdown.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such specific flavors generally add sweetness or pungency, or sharp or piquant flavors. The seasonings and spices common in many different cuisine arise from global introductions of foreign trade. Condiments include those added to cooking to impart flavor, such as barbecue sauce and soy sauce; those added before serving, such as mayonnaise in a sandwich; and those added tableside to taste, such as ketchup with fast food. Condiments can also provide other health benefits to diets that lack micronutrients.\nDefinition.\nThe exact definition of a condiment varies. Some definitions encompass spices and herbs, including salt and pepper, using the term interchangeably with \"seasoning\". Others restrict the definition to include only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce.\nThe Culinary Institute of America defines condiments as an \"aromatic mixture\" that \"accompanies food\", giving the examples of chutney, pickles and some sauces.\nTypes.\nCondiments added during cooking to add flavor: includes barbecue sauce, compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, Marmite and sour cream.\nCondiments added prior to serving: for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise.\nA table condiment or table sauce is served separately from the food and added to taste by the diner. Many, such as mustard or ketchup, are available in single-serving packets, commonly when supplied with take-out or fast food meals. In traditional Asian restaurant settings, common condiments such as soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and shichimi are available.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"condiment\" comes from the Latin \"condimentum\", meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin \"condire\", meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". The term originally described pickled or preserved foods, but its meaning has changed over time.\nHistory.\nCondiments were known in historical Ancient Rome, India, Greece and China. There is a myth that before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable, but this claim is not supported by any evidence or historical record. The Romans made the condiments garum and liquamen, a similar and at times synonymous preparation, by crushing the innards of various fish and then fermenting them in salt, resulting in a liquid containing glutamic acid, suitable for enhancing the flavour of food. The popularity of these sauces led to a flourishing condiment industry. \"Apicius\", a cookbook based on fourth and fifth century cuisine, contains a section based solely on condiments.\nGlobal uses.\nWhen global trade was established, spices and seasoning were among the common commodities that were traded. Many of the popular spices from around the world were exchanged, giving rise to the usage of foreign seasonings in many cuisines. India, Asia, and China introduced basil, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, garlic, ginger, mace, mustard, nutmeg, onion, tamarind, and turmeric. The Mediterranean and Middle East countries introduced bay leaf, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, fenugreek, rosemary, sage, sesame, and thyme. North America and Latin American countries provided allspice, annatto, chile peppers, chocolate, and sassafras. All of these spices and seasonings are used in traditional recipes from their respective originating countries. The development of many different dishes and cuisine around the world are dependent on the introduction of these foreign spices and seasonings.\nMicronutrients.\nCondiments can provide healthy benefits. Micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent in Asia. To combat lack of nutrition certain condiments are added to food. Common condiments added to help with micronutrient deficiency are fish sauce, soy sauce, seasonings, and bouillon cubes. Studies taken in nine different Asian countries suggest that iodine and iron are common micronutrients deficient in many diets. By using iodized salt, the iodine intake can increase 9-80% of the nutrient reference value (NRV). The addition of bouillon cubes can increase iron intake 3\u201340% of the NRV.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These species are primarily herbaceous vines, but also include trees, shrubs and herbs. The tubers of several species are edible, the best known of which is the sweet potato. \nDescription.\nConvolvulaceae can be recognized by their funnel-shaped, radially symmetrical corolla; the floral formula for the family has five sepals, five fused petals, five epipetalous stamens (stamens fused to the petals), and a two-part syncarpous and superior gynoecium. The stems of these plants are usually winding, hence their Latin name (from \"convolvere\", \"to wind\"). The leaves are simple and alternate, without stipules. In parasitic Cuscuta (dodder) they are reduced to scales. The fruit can be a capsule, berry, or nut, all containing only two seeds per one locule (one ovule/ovary).\nThe leaves and starchy, tuberous roots of some species are used as foodstuffs (e.g. sweet potato and water spinach), and the seeds are exploited for their medicinal value as purgatives. Some species contain ergoline alkaloids that are likely responsible for the use of these species as ingredients in psychedelic drugs (e.g. ololiuhqui). The presence of ergolines in some species of this family is due to infection by fungi related to the ergot fungi of the genus \"Claviceps\". A recent study of Convolvulaceae species, \"Ipomoea asarifolia\", and its associated fungi showed the presence of a fungus, identified by DNA sequencing of 18s and ITS ribosomal DNA and phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae, was always associated with the presence of ergoline alkaloids in the plant. The identified fungus appears to be a seed-transmitted, obligate biotroph growing epiphytically on its host. This finding strongly suggests the unique presence of ergoline alkaloids in some species of the family Convolvulaceae is due to symbiosis with clavicipitaceous fungi. Moreover, another group of compounds, loline alkaloids, commonly produced by some members of the clavicipitaceous fungi (genus \"Neotyphodium\"), has been identified in a convolvulaceous species, but the origin of the loline alkaloids in this species is unknown.\nMembers of the family are well known as food plants (e.g. sweet potatoes and water spinach), as showy garden plants (e.g. morning glory) and as troublesome weeds (e.g. bindweed (mainly \"Convolvulus\" and \"Calystegia\") and dodder), while \"Humbertia madagascariensis\" is a medium-sized tree and \"Ipomoea carnea\" is an erect shrub.

The Bakweri provided materials to the coastal tribes, who acted as middlemen.\nGerman administration.\nGermany signed a protectorate agreement with the douala in today Cameroons in 1884. In 1891, the Gbea Bakweri clan rose up in support of their traditional justice system when the Germans forbade them to use a trial by ordeal involving poison to determine whether a recent Christian convert was in fact a witch. This revolt was squelched with the razing of Buea in December 1894 and the death of Chief Kuv'a Likenye.\nThe Germans initially ruled from Douala, which they called Kamerunstadt, but they moved their capital to the Bakweri settlement of Buea in 1901. The colonials' primary activity was the establishment of banana plantations in the fertile Mount Cameroon region. The Bakweri were impressed to work them, but their recalcitrance and small population led the colonials to encourage peoples from further inland, such as the Bamileke, to move to the coast. In addition, constant shipping traffic along the coast allowed individuals to move from one plantation or town to another in search of work.\nBritish administration.\nIn 1918, Germany lost World War I, and her colonies became mandates of the League of Nations. Great Britain took control of Bakweri lands. Great Britain integrated its portion of Cameroon with the neighbouring colony of Nigeria, setting the new province's capital at Buea. The British practised a policy of indirect rule, entrusting greater powers to Bakweri chiefs in Buea.\nThe new colonials maintained the German policies of ousting uncooperative rulers and of impressing workers for the plantations. Individuals could opt to pay a fine to avoid the labour, however, which led to a dearth of workers from the wealthier areas. The British thus renewed encouragement for people from the interior to move to the coast and work the plantations. Many Igbo from Nigeria entered the area, and the newcomers grew numerically and economically dominant over time. This led to ethnic tensions with the indigenes. Land expropriation was another problem, faced particularly in 1946.\nA Bakwerian, Dr. E. M. L. Endeley was the first Prime Minister of the British Southern Cameroons from 1954 to 1959. He led other Southern Cameroonian parliamentarians to secede from the Nigerian Eastern House of Assembly in 1954.\nGeography.\nThe Bakweri are primarily concentrated in Cameroon's Southwest Province. They live in over 100 villages east and southeast of Mount Cameroon with Buea their main population centre. Bakweri settlements largely lie in the mountain's foothills and continue up its slopes as high as 4,000 metres. They have further villages along the Mungo River and the creeks that feed into it. The town of Limbe is a mixture of Bakweri, Duala, and other ethnic groups.\nThere is an ongoing dispute between the Bakweri Land Claims Committee (BLCC) and the government of Cameroon regarding the disposition of Bakweri Lands formerly used by the Germans as plantations and now managed by the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC).\nCulture.\nThe Bakweri today are divided into the urban and rural. Those who live in the cities such as Limbe and Buea earn a living at a number of skilled and unskilled professions. The rural Bakweri, in contrast, work as farmers, making use of Mount Cameroon's fertile volcanic soils to cultivate cocoyams, maize, manioc, oil palms, and plantains.\nTraditional Bakweri society was divided into three strata. At the top were the native Bakweri, with full rights of land ownership. The next tier consisted either non-Bakweri or the descendants of slaves. Finally, the slaves made up the bottom rung. Chiefs and headmen sat at the pinnacle of this hierarchy in the past, though today such figures have very little power in their own right. Councils of elders and secret societies allow communities to decide important issues.\nLanguage.\nThe Bakweri speak Mokpwe, a tongue that is closely related to Bakole and Wumboko. Mokpwe is part of the family of Duala languages in the Bantu group of the Niger\u2013Congo language family. Neighbouring peoples often utilise Mokpwe as a trade language, due largely to the spread of the tongue by early missionaries. This is particularly true among the Isubu, many of whom are bilingual in Duala or Mokpwe. In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak Cameroonian Pidgin English or standard English. A growing number of the Bakweri today grow up with Pidgin as a more widely spoken language. The Bakweri also used a drum language to convey news from clan to clan, and they also utilized a horn language peculiar to them.\nMarriage and kinship patterns.\nBakweri inheritance is patrilineal; upon the father's death, his property is inherited by his eldest son. The Bakweri have traditionally practised polygamy, although with Christianisation, this custom has become extremely rare. In the traditional Bakweri society, women are chosen as future spouses when they are still children, and in some cases, even before they were born. The father or relative of the woman have been paid a dowry, thus the woman is considered as a property to the husband and his family. Upon the husband's death, the eldest surviving brother inherits the wife. A husband's prosperity was also intricately linked to the influence of his wife or wives. The wives tended his pigs, goats, cattle, arable land, so no one could trespass or exceed them, etc.\nReligion.\nThe Bakweri have been largely Christianised since the 1970s Evangelical denominations dominate, particularly the Baptist church.\nNevertheless, remnants of a pre-Christian ancestor worship persist. might be expected for coastal peoples, the sea also plays an important role in this faith. Traditional festivals held each year serve as the most visible expression of these traditional beliefs in modern times.\nArts.\nThe Bakweri still practice arts and crafts handed down for generations. The Bakweri are known to be skilled weavers of hats and shirts, for example. They also construct armoires, chairs, and tables.\nThe greatest venue for Bakweri music and dance are the two major festivals that take place each year in December. The Ngondo is a traditional festival of the Duala, although today all of Cameroon's coastal Sawa peoples are invited to participate. It originated as a means of training Duala children the skills of warfare. Now, however, the main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, beauty pageants, canoe races, and traditional wrestling.\nThe Mpo'o brings together the Bakoko, Bakweri, and Limba at Ed\u00e9a. The festival commemorates the ancestors and allows the participants to consider the problems facing the groups and humanity as a whole.\nInstitutions.\nAssemblies, secret societies, and other groups play an important role in keeping the Bakweri unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to common problems. Secret societies include the Liengu, Maal\u00e9 (Elephant dance), Mbwaya, and Nganya.\nClassification.\nThe Bakweri are Bantu in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon."}

{"id": "62166", "revid": "205202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62166", "title": "Rotifer", "text": "Phylum of pseudocoelomate invertebrates\nThe rotifers (, from Latin 'wheel' and 'bearing'), sometimes called wheel animals or wheel animalcules, make up a phylum (Rotifera ) of microscopic and near-microscopic pseudocoelomate animals.\nThey were first described by Rev. John Harris in 1696, and other forms were described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1703. Most rotifers are around long (although their size can range from to over ), and are common in freshwater environments throughout the world with a few saltwater species.\nSome rotifers are free swimming and truly planktonic, others move by inchworming along a substrate, and some are sessile, living inside tubes or gelatinous holdfasts that are attached to a substrate. About 25 species are colonial (e.g., \"Sinantherina semibullata\"), either sessile or planktonic. Rotifers are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton, being a major foodsource and with many species also contributing to the decomposition of soil organic matter. Genetic evidence indicates that the parasitic acanthocephalans are a highly specialised group of rotifers.\nMost species of the rotifers are cosmopolitan, but there are also some endemic species, like \"Cephalodella vittata\" to Lake Baikal. Recent barcoding evidence, however, suggests that some 'cosmopolitan' species, such as \"Brachionus plicatilis\", \"B. calyciflorus\", \"Lecane bulla\", among others, are actually species complexes. In some recent treatments, rotifers are placed with acanthocephalans in a larger clade called Syndermata.\nIn June 2021, biologists reported the restoration of bdelloid rotifers after being frozen for 24,000 years in the Siberian permafrost. The earliest record of the rotifer clade is of an acanthocephalan from the Middle Jurassic of China. Earlier purported fossils of rotifers have been suggested in Devonian and Permian fossil beds.\nTaxonomy and naming.\nJohn Harris first described the rotifers (in particular a bdelloid rotifer) in 1696 as \"an animal like a large maggot which could contract itself into a spherical figure and then stretch itself out again; the end of its tail appeared with a forceps like that of an earwig\". In 1702, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek gave a detailed description of \"Rotifer vulgaris\" and subsequently described \"Melicerta ringens\" and other species. He was also the first to publish observations of the revivification of certain species after drying. Other forms were described by other observers, but it was not until the publication of Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's in 1838 that the rotifers were recognized as being multicellular animals.\nIn the landmark monograph on \"The Rotifera\" (1886-9) by C.T. Hudson, assisted by P.H. Gosse, 400 British and foreign species were included; by 1912, the total reached 607 species. About 2,200 species of rotifers have now been described. Their taxonomy is currently in a state of flux. One treatment places them in the phylum Rotifera, with three classes: Seisonidea, Bdelloidea and Monogononta. The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1,500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. There are only two known genera with four species of Seisonidea.\nThe Acanthocephala, previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been demonstrated to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to other members of the phylum has not yet been resolved. One possibility is that the Acanthocephala are closer to the Bdelloidea and Monogononta than to the Seisonidea; the corresponding names and relationships are shown in the cladogram below.\nThe Rotifera, strictly speaking, are confined to the Bdelloidea and the Monogononta. Rotifera, Acanthocephala and Seisonida make up a clade called Syndermata. The findings of a fossil called \"Juracanthocephalus\" shares features with both Seisonidea and Acanthocephala, suggesting that they are sister groups.\nGiribet &amp; Edgecombe (2020) and Brusca \"et al\". (2023) accept the following classification:\nEtymology.\nThe word \"rotifer\" is derived from a Neo-Latin word meaning 'wheel-bearer' due to the corona around the mouth that in concerted sequential motion resembles a wheel (although the organ does not actually rotate).\nAnatomy.\nRotifers have bilateral symmetry and a variety of different shapes. The body of a rotifer is divided into a head, trunk, and foot, and is typically somewhat cylindrical. The trunk contains visceral organs, and often, sensory antennae. There is a well-developed cuticle, found everywhere except in the corona, which is secreted by a fibrous layer in the syncytial epidermis. This fibrous layer may be thick and rigid, giving the animal a box-like shape, or flexible, giving the animal a worm-like shape; such rotifers are respectively called \"loricate\" and \"illoricate\". Loricate fibrous layers are often composed of multiple plates or rings, and may bear spines, ridges, or other ornamentation. Certain species have superficial rings in the body wall imitating segments. Also, sub-epidermal muscles, which may be circular, longitudinal, or traversing the pseudocoel to the visceral organs. This large fluid-filled pseudocoel contains certain muscles and mesenchymal ameboid cells. Their cuticle is nonchitinous and is formed from sclerotized proteins.\nThe two most distinctive features of rotifers (in females of all species) are the presence of \"corona\" on the head, a structure ciliated in all genera except \"Cupelopagis,\" and the presence of mastax. In the more primitive species, the corona forms a simple ring of cilia around the mouth from which an additional band of cilia stretches over the back of the head. In the great majority of rotifers, however, this has evolved into a more complex structure.\nModifications to the basic plan of the corona include alteration of the cilia into bristles or large tufts, and either expansion or loss of the ciliated band around the head. In genera such as \"Collotheca\", the corona is modified to form a funnel surrounding the mouth. In many species, such as those in the genus \"Testudinella\", the cilia around the mouth have disappeared, leaving just two small circular bands on the head. In the bdelloids, this plan is further modified, with the upper band splitting into two rotating wheels, raised up on a pedestal projecting from the upper surface of the head.\nThe trunk forms the major part of the body, and encloses most of the internal organs. The foot projects from the rear of the trunk, and is usually much narrower, giving the appearance of a tail. The cuticle over the foot often forms rings, making it appear segmented, although the internal structure is uniform. Many rotifers can retract the foot partially or wholly into the trunk. The foot ends in from one to four toes, which, in sessile and crawling species, contain adhesive glands to attach the animal to the substratum. In many free-swimming species, the foot as a whole is reduced in size, and may even be absent. Rotifers move by swimming with the coronal cilia and/or foot-assisted leech-like creeping.\nNervous system.\nRotifers have a small bilobed cerebral ganglion, effectively its brain, located just above the mastax, from which a number of paired nerves extend throughout the body, namely, sense organs, mastax, muscles, and viscera. The number of nerves varies among species, although the nervous system usually has a simple layout.\nThe nervous system comprises about 25% of the roughly 1,000 cells in a rotifer.\nRotifers typically possess one or two pairs of short dorsal antennae, and with usually paired eyespots (and possibly up to five eyes). The eyes are simple in structure, sometimes with just a single photoreceptor cell. In addition, the bristles of the corona are sensitive to touch, and there are also a pair of tiny sensory pits lined by cilia in the head region, as well as bristles and papillae.\nRetrocerebral organ.\nDespite over 100 years of research, rotifer anatomy still has many poorly understood components. One of the more mysterious organs in rotifers is the \"retrocerebral organ\" (RCO), which still remains very enigmatic in its morphology, function, development, and evolution. Lying close to the brain, this organ usually consists of one or more glands and a sac or reservoir. The sac drains into a duct before opening through pores on the uppermost part of the head. Current data shows a wide diversity in structure and potential function. In some species it is reduced or may even be absent completely. Benthic species have larger RCO's than planktonic species. Despite this diversity, positional correspondence of RCOs strongly suggests homology.\nA 2023 study using transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy has illuminated the fine structure of this organ further. The study, the first of its kind, investigated the RCO in one species, \"Trichocerca similis\". It was determined to be a syncytial organ, composed of a posterior glandular region, an expansive reservoir, and an anterior duct. The glandular portion has an active cytoplasm with paired nuclei, abundant rough ER, ribosomes, Golgi, and mitochondria. Secretion granules accumulate at the anterior end of the gland where they undergo homotypic fusion to create larger granules with numerous \"mesh-like\" contents. These contents gradually fuse into tubular secretions that accumulate in the reservoir, awaiting secretion. Cross-striated longitudinal muscles form a partial sleeve around the reservoir and may function to squeeze the secretions through the gland's duct that often penetrates through the cerebral ganglion.\nRetrocerebral organ secretions.\nMuch like the organ itself, the precise function and biochemical makeup of the secretions is still unknown. The small size of rotifers and small volume of the secretions makes isolation immensely difficult. The secretions have some similarities to the hydrogel secretions that form gelatinous housings in some rotifer species.\nUltrastructure analysis of \"T.\u2009similis\" secretions showed them to be a series of tube-like secretions with a highly filamentous framework. This is highly suggestive of a glycosaminoglycan structure- proteins with negatively charged polysaccharide chains forming proteoglycan molecules. These molecules are standard in vertebrate and invertebrate gelatins such as mucus.\nDespite recent advancements in understanding RCO organ and secretion ultrastructure, the exact function of the organ is still ultimately unclear. The leading hypotheses are that the RCO secretes a mucus-like substance that aids in benthic locomotion, adhesion, and/or reproduction (i.e., attachment of eggs to a substrate), although more research is needed to explore function and evaluate the homology between species.\nDigestive system.\nThe coronal cilia create a current that sweeps food into the mouth. The mouth opens into a characteristic chewing pharynx (called the \"mastax\"), sometimes via a ciliated tube, and sometimes directly. The pharynx has a powerful muscular wall and contains tiny, calcified, jaw-like structures called \"trophi\", which are the only fossilizable parts of a rotifer. The shape of the trophi varies between different species, depending partly on the nature of their diet. In suspension feeders, the trophi are covered in grinding ridges, while in more actively carnivorous species, they may be shaped like forceps to help bite into prey, pierce it inside the pharynx, and retain only the edible portions to be consumed. The diet of carnivorous species comprises mainly protozoa and small metazoans. In rotifer species that trap their prey, there is a funnel shaped structure around the mouth, and lobes turn inward to contain the prey and draw it to the mouth and pharynx. In some ectoparasitic rotifers, the mastax is adapted to grip onto the host, although, in others, the foot performs this function instead.\nBehind the mastax lies an oesophagus, which opens into a stomach where most of the digestion and absorption occurs. The stomach opens into a short intestine that terminates in a cloaca on the posterior dorsal surface of the animal. Up to seven salivary glands are present in some species, emptying to the mouth in front of the oesophagus, while the stomach is associated with two gastric glands that produce digestive enzymes. Digestion is extracellular and the stomach absorbs the nutrients.\nA pair of protonephridia open into a bladder that drains into the cloaca. These organs expel water from the body, helping to maintain osmotic balance.\nBiology.\nThe coronal cilia pull the animal, when unattached, through the water.\nLike many other microscopic animals, adult rotifers frequently exhibit eutely\u2014they have a fixed number of cells within a species, usually on the order of 1,000.\nBdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more divergent copies of each gene, suggesting a long-term asexual evolutionary history. For example, four copies of hsp82 are found. Each is different and found on a different chromosome excluding the possibility of homozygous sexual reproduction.\nFeeding.\nRotifers eat particulate organic detritus, dead bacteria, algae, and protozoans. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. Like crustaceans, rotifers contribute to nutrient recycling. For this reason, they are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter. Rotifers affect the species composition of algae in ecosystems through their choice in grazing. Rotifers may compete with cladocera and copepods for planktonic food sources.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nRotifers are dioecious and reproduce sexually or parthenogenetically. They are sexually dimorphic, with the females always being larger than the males. In some species, this is relatively mild, but in others the female may be up to ten times the size of the male. In parthenogenetic species, males may be present only at certain times of the year (Monogononta), or absent altogether (Bdelloidea).\nThe female reproductive system consists of one or two ovaries, each with a \"vitellarium\" gland that supplies the eggs with yolk. Together, each ovary and vitellarium form a single syncitial structure in the anterior part of the animal, opening through an oviduct into the cloaca.. Unlike ectolecithal groups like Platyhelminthes, yolk is supplied to the ovum not by sep\u0430rate yolk cells but by flow-through cytoplasmic bridges. Males do not usually have a functional digestive system, and are therefore short-lived, often being sexually fertile at birth. They have a single testicle and sperm duct, associated with a pair of glandular structures referred to as \"prostates\" (unrelated to the vertebrate prostate). The sperm duct opens into a gonopore at the posterior end of the animal, which is usually modified to form a penis. The gonopore is homologous to the cloaca of females, but in most species has no connection to the vestigial digestive system, which lacks an anus.\nIn the genus Asplanchna also the females lacks an anus, but have kept the cloacal opening for excretion and the release of eggs.\nThe phylum Rotifera encloses three classes that reproduce by three different mechanisms: Seisonidea only reproduce sexually; Bdelloidea reproduce exclusively by asexual parthenogenesis; Monogononta reproduce alternating these two mechanisms (\"cyclical parthenogenesis\" or \"heterogony\"). Parthenogenesis (amictic phase) dominates the monogonont life cycle, promoting fast population growth and colonization. In this phase males are absent and amictic females produce diploid eggs by mitosis which develop parthenogenetically into females that are clones of their mothers. Some amictic females can generate mictic females that will produce haploid eggs by meiosis. Mixis (meiosis) is induced by different types of stimulus depending on species. Haploid eggs develop into haploid dwarf males if they are not fertilized and into diploid \"resting eggs\" (or \"diapausing eggs\") if they are fertilized by males. Such eggs are often dispersed by winds or birds.\nFertilization is internal. The male either inserts his penis into the female's cloaca or uses it to penetrate her skin, injecting the sperm into the body cavity. The egg secretes a shell, and is attached either to the substratum, nearby plants, or the female's own body. A few species, such as members of the \"Rotaria\", are ovoviviparous, retaining the eggs inside their body until they hatch. The zygote undergoes modified spiral cleavage.\nMost species hatch as miniature versions of the adult. Sessile species, however, are born as free-swimming larvae, which closely resemble the adults of related free-swimming species. Females grow rapidly, reaching their adult size within a few days, while males typically do not grow in size at all.\nThe life span of monogonont females varies from two days to about three weeks.\nLoss of sexual reproduction system.\n'Ancient asexuals': Bdelloid rotifers are assumed to have reproduced without sex for many millions of years. Males are absent within the species, and females reproduce only by parthenogenesis.\nHowever, a new study provided evidence for interindividual genetic exchange and recombination in \"Adineta vaga\", a species previously thought to be anciently asexual.\nRecent transitions: Loss of sexual reproduction can be inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion in the monogonont rotifer \"Brachionus calyciflorus\": This species can normally switch between sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis), but occasionally gives rise to purely asexual lineages (obligate parthenogens). These lineages are unable to reproduce sexually due to being homozygous for a recessive allele.\nResting eggs.\nResting eggs enclose an embryo encysted in a three-layered shell that protects it from external stressors. They are able to remain dormant for several decades and can resist adverse periods (e.g., pond desiccation or presence of antagonists). When favourable conditions return and after an obligatory period of diapause which varies among species, resting eggs hatch releasing diploid amictic females that enter into the asexual phase of the life cycle.\nAnhydrobiosis.\nBdelloid rotifer females cannot produce resting eggs, but many can survive prolonged periods of adverse conditions after desiccation. This facility is termed anhydrobiosis, and organisms with these capabilities are termed anhydrobionts. Under drought conditions, bdelloid rotifers contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water; when rehydrated they resume activity within a few hours. Bdelloids can survive the dry state for long periods, with the longest well-documented dormancy being nine years. Rotifers can also undergo other forms of cryptobiosis, notably cryobiosis which results from decreased temperatures. In 2021, researchers collected samples from remote Arctic locations containing rotifers which when thawed revealed living specimens around 24,000 years old. While in other anhydrobionts, such as the brine shrimp, this desiccation tolerance is thought to be linked to the production of trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide (sugar), bdelloids apparently cannot synthesise trehalose. In bdelloids, a major cause of the resistance to desiccation, as well as resistance to ionizing radiation, is a highly efficient mechanism for repairing the DNA double-strand breaks induced by these agents. This repair mechanism likely involves mitotic recombination between homologous DNA regions.\nPredators.\nRotifers fall prey to many animals, such as copepods, fish (e.g. herring, salmon), bryozoa, comb jellies, jellyfish, starfish, and tardigrades.\nGenome size.\nThe genome size of a bdelloid rotifer, \"Adineta vaga\", was reported to be around 244\u2009Mb. The genomes of Monogononts seem to be significantly smaller than those of Bdelloids. In Monogononta the nuclear DNA content (2C) in eight different species of four different genera ranged almost fourfold, from 0.12 to 0.46 pg. Haploid \"1C\" genome sizes in \"Brachionus\" species range at least from 0.056 to 0.416 pg.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The usual ingredients are a thin layer of ladyfingers or sponge cake soaked in sherry or another fortified wine, a fruit element (fresh or jelly), custard and whipped cream layered in that ascending order in a glass dish. The contents of a trifle are highly variable and many varieties exist, some forgoing fruit entirely and instead using other ingredients, such as chocolate, coffee or vanilla. The fruit and sponge layers may be suspended in fruit-flavoured jelly, and these ingredients are usually arranged to produce three or four layers. The assembled dessert can be topped with whipped cream or, more traditionally, syllabub.\nThe name \"trifle\" was used for a dessert like a fruit fool in the sixteenth century; by the eighteenth century, Hannah Glasse records a recognisably modern trifle, with the inclusion of a gelatin jelly.\nHistory.\nTrifle appeared in cookery books in the sixteenth century. The earliest use of the name \"trifle\" was in a recipe for a thick cream flavoured with sugar, ginger and rosewater, in Thomas Dawson's 1585 book of English cookery \"The Good Huswifes Jewell\". This flavoured thick cream was cooked 'gently like a custard, and was grand enough to be presented in a silver bowl. These earlier trifles, it is claimed, 'derived from the flavoured almond milk of medieval times'. Early trifles were, according to food historian Annie Gray, 'more like fools (pur\u00e9ed fruit mixed with sweetened cream)'. Trifle evolved from these fools, and originally the two names were used interchangeably.\nIt was not until the 1750s that trifles took the form that many know of today. Two recipes for what now is considered a trifle first appeared in the mid-18th century in England. Both recipes described biscuits soaked in wine layered with custard and covered in a whipped syllabub froth. One was in the 4th edition of Hannah Glasse's \"The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy\" (1751) and the other was by an unknown author entitled \"The Whole Duty of a Woman\" (1751).\nJelly is first recorded as part of a trifle recipe in Hannah Glasse's 'A grand trifle' in her book The Compleat Confectioner (1760). Her recipe instructs the reader to use calves' feet to make a rich calves-foot jelly, and to half fill the dish with this jelly. Biscuits and macaroons are broken into pieces and stuck into the jelly before it sets, 'thick sweet cream' is poured over the jelly and biscuits and the whole is decorated with pieces of calves-foot jelly, raspberry jam and currant jelly cut into pieces, and more macaroons finish the dish.\nThe Dean's Cream from Cambridge, England was made about the same time as Hannah Glasse's version and was composed of sponge cakes, spread with jam, macaroons and ratafias soaked in sherry, and covered with syllabub. Trifle-like desserts of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include King's Pudding, Easter Pudding, Victoria Pudding or Colchester pudding.\nIn 1855 Eliza Acton described The Duke's Custard, a mixture of sugared, brandied Morella cherries, covered in custard, edged with Naples biscuits (sponge fingers) or macaroons, which was then finished with solid whipped cream coloured pink with cochineal and 'highly flavoured' with brandy.\nThe English cookery writer Jane Grigson has a trifle in her book on English Food (first published in 1974) and she describes her version, which includes macaroons, Frontignan wine, brandy, eggs, raspberry jam and everlasting syllabub, as \"a pudding worth eating, not the mean travesty made with yellow, packaged sponge cakes, poor sherry and powdered custard\".\nThe late 19th century was, according to the food historian Annie Gray, \"a sort of heyday\" for trifles and by the early 1900s there were, in print, says Gray, \"a bewildering number of recipes\". There were thirteen in \"The Encyclopaedia of Practical Cookery: A Complete Dictionary of All Pertaining to the Art of Cookery and Table Service\"&lt;ref name=\"TFG/cdacts\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (8 volumes, 1891), from Theodore Francis Garrett, alone. That book is unusual, suggests Gray, in including two savoury versions, one with veal and one with lobster.\nIn 2022, a trifle was selected to be the Platinum Pudding, to help celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A lemon Swiss roll and amaretti trifle, created by Jemma Melvin from Southport, Merseyside, in the United Kingdom won a competition run by Fortnum &amp; Mason \"to create a pudding fit for the Queen\".\nCoronation Trifle was created by Adam Handling for the Coronation of King Charles III in 2023. It is made with parkin, ginger custard and strawberry jelly.\nVariations.\nTrifles may contain different sorts of alcohol such as port, punsch, raisin wine or cura\u00e7ao.\nSimilar desserts.\nThe Scots have a similar dish to the trifle, tipsy laird, made with Drambuie or whisky.\nIn Italy, a dessert similar to and probably based on trifle is known as \"zuppa inglese\", literally \"English soup\". Tiramis\u00f9 is prepared similarly to trifle, but it does not include fruits and the original recipe calls for the savoiardi (ladyfingers) to be dipped in coffee rather than spirits.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His novels and essays criticized the social and sexual norms he perceived as driving American life. Vidal was heavily involved in politics, and unsuccessfully sought office twice as a Democratic Party candidate, first in 1960 to the United States House of Representatives (for New York), and later in 1982 to the United States Senate (for California).\nA grandson of U.S. Senator Thomas Gore, Vidal was born into an upper-class political family. As a political commentator and essayist, Vidal's primary focus was the history and society of the United States, especially how a militaristic foreign policy reduced the country to a decadent empire. His political and cultural essays were published in \"The Nation\", the \"New Statesman\", the \"New York Review of Books\", and \"Esquire\" magazines. As a public intellectual, Vidal's topical debates on sex, politics, and religion with other intellectuals and writers occasionally turned into quarrels with the likes of William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Mailer.\nAs a novelist, Vidal explored the nature of corruption in public and private life. His style of narration evoked the time and place of his stories and delineated his characters' psychology. His third novel, \"The City and the Pillar\" (1948), about a dispassionately presented male homosexual relationship, offended conservative book reviewers' literary, political, and moral sensibilities.\nIn the historical novel genre, Vidal recreated the imperial world of Julian the Apostate (r. AD\u00a0361\u2013363) in \"Julian\" (1964). Julian was the Roman emperor who attempted to reestablish Roman polytheism to counter Christianity. In social satire, \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1968) explores the mutability of gender roles and sexual orientation as social constructs established by social mores. In \"Burr\" (1973) and \"Lincoln\" (1984), both part of his \"Narratives of Empire\" series of novels, each protagonist is presented as \"A Man of the People\" and as \"A Man\" in a narrative exploration of how the public and private facets of personality affect national politics in the United States.\nEarly life.\nVidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895\u20131969) and Nina S. Gore (1903\u20131978). Vidal was born there because his father, a U.S. Army officer, was then serving as the first aeronautics instructor at the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, \"who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther\". In his memoir \"Palimpsest\" (1995), Vidal wrote, \"My birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening in 1939; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.\"\nVidal was baptized in January 1939, when he was 13 years old, by the headmaster of St. Albans School, where Vidal attended preparatory school. The baptismal ceremony was effected so he \"could be confirmed [into the Episcopal faith]\" at the Washington Cathedral, in February 1939, as \"Eugene Luther Gore Vidal\". He later said that, although the surname \"Gore\" was added to his names at the time of the baptism, \"I wasn't named for him [maternal grandfather Thomas Pryor Gore], although he had a great influence on my life.\" In 1941, Vidal dropped his two first names, because he \"wanted a sharp, distinctive name, appropriate for an aspiring author, or a national political leader ... I wasn't going to write as 'Gene' since there was already one. I didn't want to use the 'Jr.'\"\nHis father, Eugene Luther Vidal Sr., was director (1933\u20131937) of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Air Commerce during the Roosevelt Administration and the great love of the aviator Amelia Earhart. At the U.S. Military Academy, Vidal Sr. had been a quarterback, coach, and captain of the football team and an all-American basketball player. He competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics and the 1924 Summer Olympics (seventh in the decathlon, and coach of the U.S. pentathlon). In the 1920s and the 1930s, Vidal Sr. was a founder or executive of three airline companies: the Ludington Line (later Eastern Airlines), Transcontinental Air Transport (later Trans World Airlines), and Northeast Airlines.\nGore's great-grandfather Eugen Fidel Vidal was born in Feldkirch, Austria, of Romansh background, and came to the U.S. with Gore's Swiss great-grandmother, Emma Hartmann.\nVidal's mother, Nina Gore, was a socialite who made her Broadway theater debut as an extra actress in \"Sign of the Leopard\", in 1928. In 1922, Nina married Eugene Luther Vidal Sr. They divorced in 1935. Nina Gore Vidal married two more times, to Hugh D. Auchincloss and to Robert Olds. She also had \"a long off-and-on affair\" with the actor Clark Gable. As Nina Gore Auchincloss, Vidal's mother was an alternate delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention.\nThe subsequent marriages of his mother and father yielded four half-siblings for Gore Vidal\u2014Vance Vidal, Valerie Vidal, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss\u2014one stepbrother, Hugh D. \"Yusha\" Auchincloss III from his mother's marriage to Hugh D. Auchincloss, and four stepbrothers, including Robin Olds, from her marriage to Robert Olds, a major general in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), who died in 1943, 10 months after marrying Nina. Through Auchincloss, Vidal also was the stepbrother once removed of Jacqueline Kennedy. Vidal's nephews include Burr Steers, a writer and film director, and Hugh Auchincloss Steers (1963\u20131995), a figurative painter.\nRaised in Washington, D.C., Vidal attended the Sidwell Friends School and St. Albans School. His maternal grandfather, Senator Thomas Pryor Gore, was blind, and Vidal read aloud to him and was his Senate page and seeing-eye guide. In 1939, during his summer holiday, Vidal went with some colleagues and a professor from St. Albans School on his first European trip, to Italy and France. He visited Rome, the city that came to be \"at the center of Gore's literary imagination\", and Paris. When the Second World War began in early September, the group was forced to return home early. On his way back, he and his colleagues stopped in Great Britain, where they met the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, Joe Kennedy (the father of President John F. Kennedy). In 1940, Vidal attended the Los Alamos Ranch School. He later transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he contributed to the Exonian, the school newspaper.\nRather than attend university, Vidal enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 17 and was assigned to work as an office clerk in the USAAF. Later, Vidal passed the examinations necessary to become a maritime warrant officer (junior grade) in the Transportation Corps and served as first mate of the \"F.S. 35th\", a US Army Freight and Supply (FS) ship berthed at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. After three years' service, Vidal suffered hypothermia, developed rheumatoid arthritis, and was reassigned to duty as a mess officer.\nLiterary career.\nThe cultural critic Harold Bloom wrote that Vidal believed his sexuality had denied him full recognition from the U.S. literary community. Bloom contended that Vidal's limited recognition was more because his \"best fictions\" were historical novels, a subgenre \"no longer available for canonization\".\nFiction.\nVidal's literary career began with the success of the military novel \"Williwaw\", a men-at-war story derived from his Alaskan Harbor Detachment duty during World War II. His third novel, \"The City and the Pillar\" (1948), caused a moralistic furor over his dispassionate presentation of a young protagonist coming to terms with his homosexuality. The novel was dedicated to \"J. T.\"; decades later, Vidal confirmed that the initials were those of his boyhood friend and St. Albans classmate James Trimble III, who was killed in the Battle of Iwo Jima on March 1, 1945, and was the only person Vidal ever loved. Critics railed against Vidal's presentation of homosexuality in the novel, as it was viewed generally at the time as unnatural and immoral. Vidal said that \"New York Times\" critic Orville Prescott was so offended by the book that he refused to review or to permit other critics to review any book by Vidal. Vidal said that, upon the book's publication, an editor at E. P. Dutton told him, \"You will never be forgiven for this book. Twenty years from now, you will still be attacked for it.\" Today, Vidal is often seen as an early champion of sexual liberation.\nUnder the pseudonym \"Edgar Box\", Vidal wrote the mystery novels \"Death in the Fifth Position\" (1952), \"Death before Bedtime\" (1953), and \"Death Likes it Hot\" (1954), featuring Peter Cutler Sargeant II, a publicist turned private eye. His satirical novel \"Messiah\", detailing the rise of a new nontheistic religion that comes to largely replace the Abrahamic faiths, was also published in 1954. The Edgar Box genre novels sold well and earned the blacklisted Vidal a secret living. That success led Vidal to write in other genres, including the stage play \"The Best Man: A Play about Politics\" (1960) and the television play \"Visit to a Small Planet\" (1957). Two early teleplays were \"A Sense of Justice\" (1955) and \"Honor\". He also wrote the pulp novel \"Thieves Fall Out\" under the pseudonym Cameron Kay but refused to have it reprinted under his real name.\nIn the 1960s, Vidal published \"Julian\" (1964), about the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate (r. A.D. 361\u2013363), who sought to reinstate polytheistic paganism when he saw Christianity as a threat to the cultural integrity of the Roman Empire; \"Washington, D.C.\" (1967), about political life during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency (1933\u20131945); and \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1968), a satire of the American movie business by way of a school of dramatic arts owned by a transsexual woman, the eponymous anti-heroine.\nAfter publishing the plays \"Weekend\" (1968) and \"An Evening With Richard Nixon\" (1972) and the novel \"Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir\" (1970), Vidal concentrated on essays and developed two types of fiction. The first is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics. \"The New York Times\", quoting critic Harold Bloom about those historical novels, said that \"Vidal's imagination of American politics is so powerful as to compel awe.\" The historical novels formed the seven-book series Narratives of Empire: (i) \"Burr\" (1973), (ii) \"Lincoln\" (1984), (iii) \"1876\" (1976), (iv) \"Empire\" (1987), (v) \"Hollywood\" (1990), (vi) \"Washington, D.C.\" (1967), and (vii) \"The Golden Age\" (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the Axial Age (800\u2013200 B.C.), in the novel \"Creation\" (1981). It was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; Vidal restored the chapters and republished \"Creation\" in 2002.\nThe second type of fiction is the topical satire, such as \"Myron\" (1974), the sequel to \"Myra Breckinridge\"; \"Kalki\" (1978), about the end of the world and the consequent ennui; \"Duluth\" (1983), an alternate universe story; \"Live from Golgotha\" (1992), about the adventures of Timothy, Bishop of Macedonia, in the early days of Christianity; and \"The Smithsonian Institution\" (1998), a time-travel story.\nNonfiction.\nIn the U.S., Vidal is often considered an essayist rather than a novelist. Even the occasionally hostile literary critic, such as Martin Amis, wrote, \"Essays are what he is good at ... [Vidal] is learned, funny, and exceptionally clear-sighted. Even his blind spots are illuminating.\" He often wrote literary critical essays on contemporary literature. In a 1976 overview of postmodern fiction published in The New York Review of Books, Vidal criticized what he called the \"University Novel\", contrasting novels written to be read with those \"written to be taught.\" He partly blamed the rise of the \"University Novel\"\u2014represented by the likes of Thomas Pynchon, William H. Gass, and others\u2014on the French critic Roland Barthes. As the literary scholar Ben Libman has argued, Vidal associated Barthes with the Nouveau roman in France and, in the U.S., with Susan Sontag, to whose literary sensibilities he was opposed.\nFor six decades, Vidal applied himself to sociopolitical, sexual, historical, and literary subjects. In the essay anthology \"Armageddon\" (1987) he explored the intricacies of power (political and cultural) in the contemporary United States. His criticism of the incumbent president, Ronald Reagan, as a \"triumph of the embalmer's art\" communicated that Reagan's provincial worldview, and his administration's, was out of date and inadequate to the geopolitical realities of the late 20th century. In 1993, Vidal won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for the anthology \"United States: Essays 1952\u201392\" (1993).\nIn 2000, Vidal published the collection of essays \"The Last Empire\", then such self-described \"pamphlets\" as \"Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace\", \"Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta\" and \"Imperial America\", critiques of American expansionism, the military\u2013industrial complex, the national security state and the George W. Bush administration. Vidal also wrote a historical essay about the Founding Fathers, \"Inventing a Nation\". In 1995, he published a memoir, \"Palimpsest\", and in 2006 its follow-up volume, \"Point to Point Navigation\". Earlier that year, Vidal had published \"Clouds and Eclipses: The Collected Short Stories\".\nIn 2009, Vidal won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation, which called him a \"prominent social critic on politics, history, literature and culture\".The same year, the Man of Letters Gore Vidal was named honorary president of the American Humanist Association.\nHollywood.\nIn 1956, MGM hired Vidal as a screenwriter with a four-year employment contract. In 1958, the director William Wyler required a script doctor to rewrite the screenplay for \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), originally written by Karl Tunberg. As one of several script doctors assigned to the project, Vidal rewrote significant portions of the script to resolve ambiguities of character motivation, specifically to clarify the enmity between the Jewish protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, and the Roman antagonist, Messala, who had been close boyhood friends. In exchange for rewriting \"Ben-Hur\", Vidal, on location in Italy, negotiated the early termination (at the two-year mark) of his MGM contract.\nIn the 1995 documentary film \"The Celluloid Closet\", Vidal explained that Messala's failed attempt at resuming their homosexual, boyhood relationship motivated the ostensibly political enmity between Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd). Vidal said that Boyd was aware of the scene's homosexual subtext and that the director, the producer, and the screenwriter agreed to keep Heston ignorant of it, lest he refuse to play the scene. In turn, on learning of that explanation, Heston said that Vidal had contributed little to \"Ben-Hur\". Despite Vidal's resolution of the character's motivations, the Screen Writers Guild assigned formal screenwriter credit to Karl Tunberg, in accordance with the WGA screenwriting credit system, which favored the \"original author\" of a screenplay rather than the writer of the filmed screenplay.\nTwo plays, \"The Best Man: A Play about Politics\" (1960, made into a film in 1964) and \"Visit to a Small Planet\" (1955), were theater and movie successes. Vidal occasionally returned to the movie business, and wrote historically accurate teleplays and screenplays about subjects important to him, such as \"Billy the Kid\" (1989), about William H. Bonney, a gunman in the New Mexico territory Lincoln County War and later an outlaw in the U.S. Western frontier, and 1979's \"Caligula\" (based upon the life of the Roman Emperor Caligula), from which Vidal had his screenwriter credit removed because the producer, Bob Guccione, the director, Tinto Brass, and the leading actor, Malcolm McDowell, added sex and violence to the script to increase its commercial appeal.\nIn the 1960s, Vidal migrated to Italy, where he befriended the film director Federico Fellini, for whom he appeared in a cameo role in the film \"Roma\" (1972). He also appeared in the American television series \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" and in the films \"Bob Roberts\" (1992), a serio-comedy about a reactionary populist politician who manipulates youth culture to win votes; \"With Honors\" (1994), an Ivy league comedy-drama; \"Gattaca\" (1997), a science-fiction drama about genetic engineering; and \"Igby Goes Down\" (2002), a coming-of-age serio-comedy directed by his nephew Burr Steers.\nPolitics.\nPolitical campaigns.\nVidal began to drift toward the political left after he received his first paycheck and realized how much money the government took in tax. He reasoned that if the government was taking so much money, it should at least provide first-rate healthcare and education.\nAs a public intellectual, Vidal was identified with the liberal politicians and the progressive social causes of the old Democratic Party.\nIn 1960, Vidal was the Democratic nominee for Congress in the 29th Congressional District of New York, a usually Republican district that included most of the Catskills and the western bank of the Hudson River, including Newburgh. He lost to the Republican nominee, J. Ernest Wharton, 57% to 43%. Campaigning under the slogan \"You'll get more with Gore\", Vidal received the most votes any Democratic candidate had received in the district in 50 years and outpolled John F. Kennedy (who lost the district with 38% of the vote). Among his supporters were Eleanor Roosevelt, Paul Newman, and Joanne Woodward, friends who spoke on his behalf.\nIn 1982, he campaigned against Jerry Brown, the incumbent governor of California, in the Democratic primary election for U.S. Senate. He placed second in the primary with 15% of the vote to Brown's 51%. Vidal accurately predicted that the Republican nominee, Pete Wilson, would win the election. His foray into senatorial politics is the subject of Gary Conklin's 1983 documentary film \"\".\nIn a 2001 article, \"The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh\", Gore undertook to discover why domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. He concluded that McVeigh (a politically disillusioned U.S. Army veteran of the First Iraq War) had destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building as an act of revenge for the FBI's Waco massacre (1993) at the Branch Davidian Compound in Texas, believing that the U.S. government had mistreated Americans in the same manner that he believed the U.S. Army had mistreated the Iraqis. In the article, Vidal calls McVeigh an \"unlikely sole mover\" and theorizes that foreign/domestic conspiracies could have been involved.\nVidal strongly opposed military intervention in the world. In \"Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta\" (2002), he wrote that President Franklin D. Roosevelt provoked Imperial Japan to attack the U.S. to justify its entry into World War II. He contended that Roosevelt had advance knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the documentary \"Why We Fight\" (2005), Vidal said that, during the war's final months, the Japanese had tried to surrender: \"They were trying to surrender all that summer, but Truman wouldn't listen, because Truman wanted to drop the bombs ... To show off. To frighten Stalin. To change the balance of power in the world. To declare war on communism. Perhaps we were starting a pre-emptive world war\".\nCriticism of George W. Bush.\nVidal criticized what he saw as political harm to the nation and the voiding of citizen's rights through the passage of the USA Patriot Act (2001) during the George W. Bush administration. He called Bush \"the stupidest man in the United States\" and said his foreign policy was explicitly expansionist. He contended that the Bush administration and its oil-business sponsors aimed to control the petroleum of Central Asia after having gained hegemony over the petroleum of the Persian Gulf in 1991.\nVidal became a member of the board of advisors of The World Can't Wait, a political organization that publicly repudiated the Bush administration's foreign-policy program and advocated Bush's impeachment for war crimes, such as the Second Iraq War and torturing prisoners of war (soldiers, guerrillas, civilians) in violation of international law.\nIn 2007, while discussing 9/11 conspiracy theories that might explain the \"who?\" and the \"why?\" of the September 11 attacks, Vidal said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst. Everything the Bushites touch is screwed up. They could never have pulled off 9/11, even if they wanted to. Even if they longed to. They could step aside, though, or just go out to lunch while these terrible things were happening to the nation. I believe that of them.\nPolitical philosophy.\nIn the \"American Conservative\" article \"My Pen Pal Gore Vidal\" (2012), Bill Kauffman wrote that Vidal's favorite American politician, during his lifetime, was Huey Long, the populist governor and senator from Louisiana, who also had perceived the essential, one-party nature of U.S. politics and who was assassinated by a lone gunman, Carl Weiss.\nDespite that, Vidal said, \"I think of myself as a conservative\" with a proprietary attitude toward the United States. \"My family helped start [this country] ... and we've been in political life ... since the 1690s, and I have a very possessive sense about this country\". Based upon that background of populism, from 1970 to 1972 Vidal was a chairman of the People's Party of the United States. In 1971, he endorsed the consumer-rights advocate Ralph Nader for U.S. president in the 1972 election. In 2007, he endorsed Democrat Dennis Kucinich for president (in 2008), because Kucinich was \"the most eloquent of the lot\" of presidential candidates from either party and \"very much a favorite out there, in the amber fields of grain\".\nIn a 2009 interview with \"The Times\" of London, Vidal said there soon would be a dictatorship in the United States. The newspaper emphasized that Vidal, described as \"the Grand Old Man of American \"belles-lettres\"\", claimed that America was rotting away and to not expect Barack Obama to save the country and the nation from imperial decay. In this interview, Vidal also updated his views of his life, the U.S., and other political subjects. Vidal had earlier described what he saw as the political and cultural rot in the U.S. in his essay \"The State of the Union\" (1975):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is only one party in the United States, the Property Party ... and it has two right wings: Republican and Democrat. Republicans are a bit stupider, more rigid, more doctrinaire in their \"laissez-faire\" capitalism than the Democrats, who are cuter, prettier, a bit more corrupt\u2014until recently ... and more willing than the Republicans to make small adjustments when the poor, the black, the anti-imperialists get out of hand. But, essentially, there is no difference between the two parties.\nFeuds.\nThe Capote\u2013Vidal feud.\nIn 1975, Vidal sued Truman Capote for slander over the accusation that he had once been thrown out of the White House for being drunk, putting his arm around First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and insulting her mother. Capote said of Vidal at the time: \"I'm always sad about Gore\u2014very sad that he has to breathe every day.\" Mutual friend George Plimpton observed: \"There's no venom like Capote's when he's on the prowl\u2014and Gore's too, I don't know what division the feud should be in.\" The suit was settled in Vidal's favor when Lee Radziwill refused to testify on Capote's behalf, telling columnist Liz Smith, \"Oh, Liz, what do we care; they're just a couple of fags! They're disgusting.\"\nThe Buckley\u2013Vidal feud.\nIn 1968, the ABC television network hired the liberal Vidal and the conservative William F. Buckley Jr. as political analysts of the presidential-nomination conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties. After days of bickering, their debates devolved into vitriolic \"ad\u00a0hominem\" attacks. During a moment of crosstalk while discussing the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests, the pair argued about freedom of speech\u2014specifically, the legality of protesters' displaying a Viet Cong flag in America\u2014Vidal snapped at Buckley, \"shut up a minute\". Moments later, the following exchange transpired: BUCKLEY: Some people were pro-Nazi, and the answer is that they were well treated by people who ostracized them. And I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers.\nVIDAL: As far as I'm concerned, the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself. Failing that, I would only say that we can't have\u2014\nBUCKLEY: Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face and you'll stay plastered. ABC's Howard K. Smith intervened, and the debate resumed without violence. Later, Buckley said he regretted calling Vidal a \"queer\" but still expressed some distaste for Vidal when he said that he was an \"evangelist for bisexuality\".\nIn August 1969, in \"Esquire\" magazine, Buckley continued his cultural feud with Vidal in the essay \"On Experiencing Gore Vidal\", in which he portrayed Vidal as an apologist for homosexuality; Buckley said, \"The man who, in his essays, proclaims the normalcy of his affliction [i.e., homosexuality], and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher.\" The essay is collected in \"The Governor Listeth: A Book of Inspired Political Revelations\" (1970), an anthology of Buckley's writings.\nVidal riposted in \"Esquire\" with the September 1969 essay \"A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr.\" and said that Buckley was \"anti-black\", \"anti-semitic\" and a \"warmonger\". Buckley sued Vidal for libel.\nThe feud continued in \"Esquire\", where Vidal implied that in 1944, Buckley and unnamed siblings had vandalized a Protestant church in Sharon, Connecticut (the Buckley family hometown), after a pastor's wife had sold a house to a Jewish family. Additionally, Vidal later claimed to know that Buckley was \"rather infatuated\" with him. Buckley again sued Vidal and \"Esquire\" for libel and Vidal filed a counterclaim for libel against Buckley, citing Buckley's characterization of \"Myra Breckinridge\" (1968) as a pornographic novel. The court dismissed Vidal's counterclaim. Buckley accepted a settlement of $115,000 to pay his attorney's fee and an editorial apology from \"Esquire\", in which the publisher and the editors said they were \"utterly convinced\" of the falsity of Vidal's assertions. In a letter to \"Newsweek\" magazine, the publisher of \"Esquire\" wrote, \"the settlement of Buckley's suit against us\" was not \"a 'disavowal' of Vidal's article. On the contrary, it clearly states that we published that article because we believed that Vidal had a right to assert his opinions, even though we did not share them.\"\nIn \"Gore Vidal: A Biography\" (1999), Fred Kaplan wrote, \"The court had 'not' sustained Buckley's case against \"Esquire\"\u00a0... [that] the court had 'not' ruled that Vidal's article was 'defamatory'. It had ruled that the case would have to go to trial \"in order to determine, as a matter of fact, whether or not it was defamatory\". The cash value of the settlement with \"Esquire\" represented 'only' Buckley's legal expenses.\"\nIn 2003, Buckley resumed his complaint of having been libeled by Vidal, this time with the publication of the anthology \"Esquire's Big Book of Great Writing\" (2003), which included Vidal's essay \"A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr.\" Buckley again sued for libel and \"Esquire\" again settled Buckley's claim with $55,000\u201365,000 for his attorney's fees and $10,000 for personal damages.\nIn the obituary \"RIP WFB \u2013 in Hell\" (March 20, 2008), Vidal remembered Buckley, who had died on February 27, 2008. In the interview \"Literary Lion: Questions for Gore Vidal\" (June 15, 2008), \"New York Times\" reporter Deborah Solomon asked Vidal: \"How did you feel when you heard that Buckley died this year?\" Vidal responded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I thought hell is bound to be a livelier place, as he joins, forever, those whom he served in life, applauding their prejudices and fanning their hatred.\nThe Mailer\u2013Vidal feud.\nOn December 15, 1971, during the recording of \"The Dick Cavett Show\", with Janet Flanner, Norman Mailer allegedly head-butted Vidal backstage. When a reporter asked Vidal why Mailer had knocked heads with him, Vidal said, \"Once again, words failed Norman Mailer.\" During the recording of the show, Vidal and Mailer insulted each other over what Vidal had written about him, prompting Mailer to say, \"I've had to smell your works from time to time.\" Apparently, Mailer's umbrage resulted from Vidal's reference to Mailer having stabbed his wife of the time.\nViews.\nPolanski rape case.\nIn \"The Atlantic\" magazine interview \"A Conversation with Gore Vidal\" (October 2009), by John Meroney, Vidal spoke about topical and cultural matters of U.S. society. Asked his opinion about the arrest of the film director Roman Polanski in response to an extradition request by U.S. authorities for having fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid jail for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, Vidal said: \"I really don't give a fuck. Look, am I going to sit and weep every time a young hooker feels as though she's been taken advantage of?\"\nAsked to elaborate, Vidal explained the cultural temper of the U.S. and of the Hollywood movie business in the 1970s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe [news] media can't get anything straight. Plus, there's usually an anti-Semitic and anti-fag thing going on with the press\u2014lots of crazy things. The idea that this girl was in her communion dress, a little angel, all in white, being raped by this awful Jew \"Polacko\"\u2014that's what people were calling him\u2014well, the story is totally different now from what it was then ... Anti-Semitism got poor Polanski. He was also a foreigner. He did not subscribe to American values, in the least. To [his persecutors], that seemed vicious and unnatural.\nAsked to explain the term \"American values\", Vidal replied: \"Lying and cheating. There's nothing better.\"\nIn response to Vidal's opinion about the Polanski case, a spokeswoman for the organization Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, Barbara Dorris, said, \"People should express their outrage by refusing to buy any of his books\", called Vidal a \"mean-spirited buffoon\", and said that, although \"a boycott wouldn't hurt Vidal financially\", it would \"cause anyone else with such callous views to keep his mouth shut, and [so] avoid rubbing salt into the already deep wounds\" of sexual abuse survivors.\nScientology.\nIn 1997, Vidal was one of 34 public intellectuals and celebrities who joined a publicity campaign waged by Scientologists against the German government, signing an open letter addressed to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published in the \"International Herald Tribune\", alleging that Scientologists in Germany were treated \"in the same way that the Nazi regime persecuted the Jews\". Scientologists are free to operate in Germany, but the Church of Scientology is recognized not as a religious body but as a business with political goals and thus monitored by the German domestic intelligence service. Despite signing the letter, Vidal was critical of Scientology as a religion.\nSexuality.\nIn 1967, Vidal appeared in the CBS documentary \"\", in which he expressed his views on homosexuality in the arts. He described his style as \"knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\"\nBut Vidal often repudiated the label \"gay\", maintaining that it referred to sexual acts, not innate sexuality. During the 1980s and 1990s, he did not take a public stance on the HIV/AIDS crisis. According to his friend Jay Parini, \"Gore didn't think of himself as a gay guy. It makes him self-hating. How could he despise gays as much as he did? In my company he always used the term 'fags'. He was uncomfortable with being gay. Then again, he was wildly courageous.\" Biographer Fred Kaplan concluded: \"He was not interested in making a difference for gay people, or being an advocate for gay rights. There was no such thing as 'straight' or 'gay' for him, just the body and sex.\"\nIn the September 1969 edition of \"Esquire\", Vidal wrote about innate bisexuality:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are all bisexual to begin with. That is a fact of our condition. And we are all responsive to sexual stimuli from our own as well as from the opposite sex. Certain societies at certain times, usually in the interest of maintaining the baby supply, have discouraged homosexuality. Other societies, particularly militaristic ones, have exalted it. But regardless of tribal taboos, homosexuality is a constant fact of the human condition and it is not a sickness, not a sin, not a crime\u00a0... despite the best efforts of our puritan tribe to make it all three. Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word \"natural\", not normal.\nPersonal life.\nIn the multi-volume memoir \"The Diary of Ana\u00efs Nin\" (1931\u201374), Ana\u00efs Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied it in his memoir \"Palimpsest\" (1995). In her 2013 article \"Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Ana\u00efs Nin\", Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin that contradicts his denial. Krizan said she found the letter while researching \"Mirages\", the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Vidal cruised the streets and bars of New York City and other locales and wrote in his memoir that by age 25 he had had more than a thousand sexual encounters. He also said that he had an intermittent romance with actress Diana Lynn and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. He was briefly engaged to Joanne Woodward before she married Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles.\nVidal enjoyed telling his sexual exploits to friends. He claimed to have slept with Fred Astaire when he first moved to Hollywood and also with Dennis Hopper.\nIn 1950, Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his romantic partner for the next 53 years, until Austen's death. He said the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other: \"It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.\" In \"\" (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself \"gay\" because he was not an adjective, adding, \"to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim\u00a0... I've said\u2014a thousand times?\u2014in print and on TV that everyone is bisexual.\"\nVidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail, he sold his Italian villa \"La Rondinaia\" (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to live in their 1929 villa in Outpost Estates, Los Angeles. Austen died in November 2003, and in February 2005 his remains were reburied at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen.\nDeath.\nIn 2010, Vidal began to suffer from Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome. On July 31, 2012, he died of pneumonia at his home in the Hollywood Hills, aged 86. A memorial service was held for him at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre in New York City on August 23, 2012. He was buried next to Howard Austen in Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C. Vidal said he chose his gravesite because it is between the graves of two people who were important in his life: Henry Adams, the historian and writer, whose work Vidal admired; and his boyhood friend Jimmie Trimble, who was killed in World War II, a tragedy that haunted Vidal for the rest of his life. Upon his death, Vidal bequeathed the entirety of his estate, valued at $37\u00a0million, to Harvard University.\nLegacy.\nPostmortem opinions and assessments of Vidal as a writer vary. The \"New York Times\" called him \"an Augustan figure who believed himself to be the last of a breed, and he was probably right. Few American writers have been more versatile, or gotten more mileage from their talent.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" said he was a literary juggernaut whose novels and essays were considered \"among the most elegant in the English language\". The \"Washington Post\" described him as a \"major writer of the modern era\u00a0... [an] astonishingly versatile man of letters\".\n\"The Guardian\" wrote, \"Vidal's critics disparaged his tendency to formulate an aphorism, rather than to argue, finding in his work an underlying note of contempt for those who did not agree with him. His fans, on the other hand, delighted in his unflagging wit and elegant style.\" The \"Daily Telegraph\" called Vidal \"an icy iconoclast\" who \"delighted in chronicling what he perceived as the disintegration of civilisation around him\". The BBC News said he was \"one of the finest post-war American writers\u00a0... an indefatigable critic of the whole American system\u00a0... Gore Vidal saw himself as the last of the breed of literary figures who became celebrities in their own right. Never a stranger to chat shows, his wry and witty opinions were sought after as much as his writing.\" In \"The Culture of the United States Laments the Death of Gore Vidal\", the Spanish online magazine \"Ideal\" wrote that Vidal's death was a loss to the \"culture of the United States\" and called him a \"great American novelist and essayist\". In \"The Writer Gore Vidal is Dead in Los Angeles\", the online edition of the Italian newspaper \"Corriere della Sera\" called Vidal \"the \"enfant terrible\" of American culture\" and \"one of the giants of American literature\". In \"Gore Vidal: The Killjoy of America\", the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" said that the public intellectual Vidal was \"the killjoy of America\" but that he also was an \"outstanding polemicist\" who used words \"like high-precision weapons\".\nOn August 23, 2012, in the program \"A Memorial for Gore Vidal in Manhattan\", Vidal's life and works were celebrated at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, with a revival of \"The Best Man: A Play About Politics\" (1960). The writer and comedian Dick Cavett hosted the celebration, which featured personal reminiscences about and performances of excerpts of Vidal's work by friends and colleagues, such as Elizabeth Ashley, Candice Bergen, Hillary Clinton, Alan Cumming, James Earl Jones, Elaine May, Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, Cybill Shepherd, and Liz Smith.\nIn the 1960s, Vidal selected the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison to archive his papers, given his early focus on film. In 2002, he transferred his papers to Houghton Library at Harvard University, where they remain.\nIn popular culture.\nThe character Brinker Hadley in John Knowles's 1959 novel \"A Separate Peace\" is based on Vidal. Knowles and Vidal attended Philips Exeter Academy together, Vidal two years ahead of Knowles. Vidal acknowledged the connection and professed admiration for the novel in his memoir.\nIn the 1960s, the weekly American sketch comedy television program \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" featured a running-joke sketch about Vidal; the telephone operator Ernestine (Lily Tomlin) would call him, saying: \"Mr. Veedle, this is the phone company calling! (snort! snort!).\" The sketch, titled \"Mr. Veedle\", also appeared in Tomlin's comedy record album \"This Is a Recording\" (1972).\nVidal provided his own voice for the animated-cartoon version of himself in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Moe'N'a Lisa\". He also voiced his animated-cartoon version in \"Family Guy\". He was interviewed in the \"Da Ali\u00a0G Show\"; Ali G mistakes him for Vidal Sassoon, a famous hairdresser.\nThe Buckley-Vidal debates, their aftermath and cultural significance, were the focus of the 2015 documentary film \"Best of Enemies\", as well as the 2021 play by James Graham inspired by the film.\nIn season eight, episode eight of \"The Office,\" \"Gettysburg\", Oscar Martinez calls Dwight Schrute \"Gore Vidal\" when Dwight tries to explain his version of history naming the \"Battle of Schrute Farms\" as the northernmost battle in the Civil War. Dwight responds to Oscar that he doesn't \"know who that is\".\nA Netflix biopic, \"Gore\", was filmed in 2017. It was directed and co-written by Michael Hoffman and based on Jay Parini's book \"Empire of Self, A Life of Gore Vidal\". The film, which starred Kevin Spacey in the title role, was canceled and remains unreleased due to sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey.\nSelected list of works.\nThe \"Narratives of Empire\" series (chronological order rather than release order):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Crinoids that remain attached to the sea floor by a stalk in their adult form are commonly called sea lilies, while the unstalked forms, called feather stars or comatulids, are members of the largest crinoid order, Comatulida. Crinoids are echinoderms in the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes the starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins and sea cucumbers. They live in both shallow water and in depths of over .\nAdult crinoids are characterised by having the mouth located on the upper surface. This is surrounded by feeding arms, and is linked to a U-shaped gut, with the anus being located on the oral disc near the mouth. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognised, in most crinoids the five arms are subdivided into ten or more. These have feathery pinnules and are spread wide to gather planktonic particles from the water. At some stage in their lives, most crinoids have a short stem used to attach themselves to the substrate, but many live attached only as juveniles and become free-swimming as adults.\nThere are only about 700 living species of crinoid, but the class was much more abundant and diverse in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating to the mid-Paleozoic era to Jurassic period are almost entirely made up of disarticulated crinoid fragments.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Crinoidea\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \"\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\" (\"kr\u00ednon\"), \"a lily\", with the suffix \"\u2013oid\" meaning \"like\".\nMorphology.\nThe basic body form of a crinoid is a stem (not present in adult feather stars) and a crown consisting of a cup-like central body known as the theca, and a set of five rays or arms, usually branched and feathery. The mouth and anus are both located on the upper side of the theca, making the dorsal (upper) surface the oral surface, unlike in the other echinoderm groups such as the sea urchins, starfish and brittle stars where the mouth is on the underside. The numerous calcareous plates make up the bulk of the crinoid, with only a small percentage of soft tissue. These ossicles fossilize well and there are beds of limestone dating from the Lower Carboniferous around Clitheroe, England, formed almost exclusively from a diverse fauna of crinoid fossils.\nThe stem of sea lilies is composed of a column of highly porous ossicles which are connected by ligamentary tissue. It attaches to the substrate with a flattened holdfast or with whorls of jointed, root-like structures known as cirri. Further cirri may occur higher up the stem. In crinoids that attach to hard surfaces, the cirri may be robust and curved, resembling birds' feet, but when crinoids live on soft sediment, the cirri may be slender and rod-like. Juvenile feather stars have a stem, but this is later lost, with many species retaining a few cirri at the base of the crown. The majority of living crinoids are free-swimming and have only a vestigial stalk. In those deep-sea species that still retain a stalk, it may reach up to in length (although usually much smaller), and fossil species are known with stems.\nThe theca is pentamerous (has five-part symmetry) and is homologous with the body or disc of other echinoderms. The base of the theca is formed from a cup-shaped set of ossicles (bony plates), the calyx, while the upper surface is formed by the weakly-calcified tegmen, a membranous disc. The tegmen is divided into five \"ambulacral areas\", including a deep groove from which the tube feet project, and five \"interambulacral areas\" between them. The mouth is near the centre or on the margin of the tegmen, and ambulacral grooves lead from the base of the arms to the mouth. The anus is also located on the tegmen, often on a small elevated cone, in an interambulacral area. The theca is relatively small and contains the crinoid's digestive organs.\nThe arms are supported by a series of articulating ossicles similar to those in the stalk. Primitively, crinoids had only five arms, but in most modern forms these are divided into two at ossicle II, giving ten arms in total. In most living species, especially the free-swimming feather stars, the arms branch several more times, producing up to two hundred branches in total. Being jointed, the arms can curl up. They are lined, on either side alternately, by smaller jointed appendages known as \"pinnules\" which give them their feather-like appearance. Both arms and pinnules have tube feet along the margins of the ambulacral grooves. The tube feet come in groups of three of different size; they have no suction pads and are used to hold and manipulate food particles. The grooves are equipped with cilia which facilitate feeding by moving the organic particles along the arm and into the mouth.\nFeeding.\nCrinoids are passive suspension feeders, filtering plankton and small particles of detritus from the sea water flowing past them with their feather-like arms. The arms are raised to form a fan-shape which is held perpendicular to the current. Mobile crinoids move to perch on rocks, coral heads or other eminences to maximise their feeding opportunities. The food particles are caught by the primary (longest) tube feet, which are fully extended and held erect from the pinnules, forming a food-trapping mesh, while the secondary and tertiary tube feet are involved in manipulating anything encountered.\nThe tube feet are covered with sticky mucus that traps any particles which come in contact. Once they have caught a particle of food, the tube feet flick it into the ambulacral groove, where the cilia propel the mucus and food particles towards the mouth. Lappets at the side of the groove help keep the mucus stream in place. The total length of the food-trapping surface may be very large; the 56 arms of a Japanese sea lily with arms, have a total length of including the pinnules. Generally speaking, crinoids living in environments with relatively little plankton have longer and more highly branched arms than those living in food-rich environments.\nThe mouth descends into a short oesophagus. There is no true stomach, so the oesophagus connects directly to the intestine, which runs in a single loop right around the inside of the calyx. The intestine often includes numerous diverticulae, some of which may be long or branched. The end of the intestine opens into a short muscular rectum. This ascends towards the anus, which projects from a small conical protuberance at the edge of the tegmen. Faecal matter is formed into large, mucous-cemented pellets which fall onto the tegmen and thence the substrate.\nPredation.\nSpecimens of the sea urchin \"Calocidaris micans\" found in the vicinity of the crinoid \"Endoxocrinus parrae\", have been shown to contain large quantities of stem portions in their guts. These consist of articulated ossicles with soft tissue, whereas the local sediment contained only disarticulated ossicles without soft tissue. This makes it highly likely that these sea urchins are predators of the crinoids, and that the crinoids flee, offering part of their stem in the process.\nVarious crinoid fossils hint at possible prehistoric predators. Coprolites of both fish and cephalopods have been found containing ossicles of various crinoids, such as the pelagic crinoid \"Saccocoma\", from the Jurassic lagerstatten Solnhofen, while damaged crinoid stems with bite marks matching the toothplates of coccosteid placoderms have been found in Late Devonian Poland. The calyxes of several Devonian to Carboniferous-aged crinoids have the shells of a snail, \"Platyceras\", intimately associated with them. Some have the snail situated over the anus, suggesting that \"Platyceras\" was a coprophagous commensal, while others have the animal directly situated over a borehole, suggesting a more pernicious relationship.\nWater vascular system.\nLike other echinoderms, crinoids possess a water vascular system that maintains hydraulic pressure in the tube feet. This is not connected to external sea water via a madreporite, as in other echinoderms, but only connected through a large number of pores to the coelom (body cavity). The main fluid reservoir is the muscular-walled ring canal which is connected to the coelom by stone canals lined with calcareous material. The coelom is divided into a number of interconnecting spaces by mesenteries. It surrounds the viscera in the disc and has branches within the stalk and arms, with smaller branches extending into the pinnules. It is the contraction of the ring canal that extends the tube feet. Three narrow branches of the coelom enter each arm, two on the oral side and one aborally, and pinnules. The action of cilia cause there to be a slow flow of fluid (1mm per second) in these canals, outward in the oral branches and inward in the aboral ones, and this is the main means of transport of nutrients and waste products. There is no heart and separate circulatory system but at the base of the disc there is a large blood vessel known as the axial organ, containing some slender blind-ended tubes of unknown function, which extends into the stalk.\nThese various fluid-filled spaces, in addition to transporting nutrients around the body, also function as both a respiratory and an excretory system. Oxygen is absorbed primarily through the tube feet, which are the most thin-walled parts of the body, with further gas exchange taking place over the large surface area of the arms. There are no specialised organs for excretion while waste is collected by phagocytic coelomocytes.\nNervous system.\nThe crinoid nervous system is divided into three parts, with numerous connections between them. The oral or uppermost portion is the only one homologous with the nervous systems of other echinoderms. It consists of a central nerve ring surrounding the mouth, and radial nerves branching into the arms and is sensory in function. Below this lies an intermediate nerve ring, giving off radial nerves supplying the arms and pinnules. These nerves are motor in nature, and control the musculature of the tube feet. The third portion of the nervous system lies aborally, and is responsible for the flexing and movement actions of the arms, pinnules and cirri. This is centred on a mass of neural tissue near the base of the calyx, and provides a single nerve to each arm and a number of nerves to the stalk.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nCrinoids are dioecious, with individuals being either male or female. In most species, the gonads are located in the pinnules but in a few, they are located in the arms. Not all the pinnules are reproductive, just those closest to the crown. The gametes are produced in genital canals enclosed in genital coeloms. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the sperm and eggs into the surrounding sea water. In certain genera, such as \"Antedon\", the fertilised eggs are cemented to the arms with secretions from epidermal glands; in others, especially cold water species from Antarctica, the eggs are brooded in specialised sacs on the arms or pinnules.\nThe fertilised eggs hatch to release free-swimming vitellaria larvae. The bilaterally symmetrical larva is barrel-shaped with rings of cilia running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs at the upper pole. While both feeding (planktotrophic) and non-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae exist among the four other extant echinoderm classes, all present day crinoids appear to be descendants from a surviving clade that went through a bottleneck after the Permian extinction, at that time losing the feeding larval stage. The larva's free-swimming period lasts for only a few days before it settles on the bottom and attaches itself to the underlying surface using an adhesive gland on its underside. The larva then undergoes an extended period of metamorphoses into a stalked juvenile, becoming radially symmetric in the process. Even the free-swimming feather stars go through this stage, with the adult eventually breaking away from the stalk.\nRegeneration.\nCrinoids are not capable of clonal reproduction as are some starfish and brittle stars, but are capable of regenerating lost body parts. Arms torn off by predators or damaged by adverse environmental conditions can regrow, and even the visceral mass can regenerate over the course of a few weeks. The stalk's uppermost segment and the basal plates have the capacity to regenerate the entire crown. Nutrients and other components from the stalk, especially the upper 5 cm, are used in crown regeneration.\nCrinoids have been able to regenerate parts since Paleozoic times. These regenerative abilities may be vital in surviving attacks by predatory fish.\nLocomotion.\nMost modern crinoids, i.e., the feather stars, are free-moving and lack a stem as adults. Examples of fossil crinoids that have been interpreted as free-swimming include \"Marsupites\", \"Saccocoma\" and \"Uintacrinus\". In general, crinoids move to new locations by crawling, using the feather-like arms to heft the body. Such a movement may be induced in relation to a change in current direction, the need to climb to an elevated perch to feed, or because of an agonistic behaviour by an encountered individual. Crinoids can also swim. They do this by co-ordinated, repeated sequential movements of the arms in three groups. At first the direction of travel is upwards but soon becomes horizontal, travelling at about per second with the oral surface in front. Swimming usually takes place as short bursts of activity lasting up to half a minute, and in the comatulid \"Florometra serratissima\" at least, only takes place after mechanical stimulation or as an escape response evoked by a predator.\nIn 2005, a stalked crinoid, \"Neocrinus decorus\", was recorded pulling itself along the sea floor off the Grand Bahama Island. While it has been known that stalked crinoids could move, before this recording the fastest motion known for a stalked crinoid was per hour. The 2005 recording showed one of these moving across the seabed at the much faster rate of per second, or per hour.\nEvolution.\nOrigins.\nIf one ignores the enigmatic \"Echmatocrinus\" of the Burgess Shale, the earliest known unequivocal crinoid groups date back to the Ordovician, 480 million years ago. There are two competing hypotheses pertaining to the origin of the group: the traditional viewpoint holds that crinoids evolved from within the blastozoans (the eocrinoids and their derived descendants, the blastoids and the cystoids), whereas the most popular alternative suggests that the crinoids split early from among the edrioasteroids. The debate is difficult to settle, in part because all three candidate ancestors share many characteristics, including radial symmetry, calcareous plates, and stalked or direct attachment to the substrate.\nDiversity.\nEchinoderms with mineralized skeletons entered the fossil record in the early Cambrian (540 mya), and during the next 100 million years, the crinoids and blastoids (also stalked filter-feeders) were dominant. At that time, the Echinodermata included twenty taxa of class rank, only five of which survived the mass extinction events that followed. The long and varied geological history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms had adapted to filter-feeding.\nThe crinoids underwent two major episodes of abrupt adaptive radiation. The first occurred during the Ordovician (485 to 444 mya) and was followed, much later in the Paleozoic, by a selective mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, during which all blastoids and most crinoids became extinct. After the end-Permian extinction, crinoids never regained the morphological diversity and dominant position they had enjoyed in the Paleozoic, instead adopting a different suite of ecological strategies from those that had proven so successful previously.\nThe second radiation occurred during the early Triassic (around 230 mya), and resulted in forms with flexible arms becoming widespread. Motility\u2014primarily a response to predation pressure\u2014also became much more common than sessility. This radiation occurred somewhat earlier than the Mesozoic marine revolution, possibly because it was mainly driven by increases in benthic predation, particularly from echinoids. As predation by sea urchins intensified around 225 million years ago, stalked crinoids gradually retreated to deeper waters, while motile forms retained stalks only during their early life stages.\nFossils.\nSome fossil crinoids, such as \"Pentacrinites\", seem to have lived attached to floating driftwood and complete colonies are often found. Sometimes this driftwood would become waterlogged and sink to the bottom, taking the attached crinoids with it. The stem of \"Pentacrinites\" can be several metres long. Modern relatives of \"Pentacrinites\" live in gentle currents attached to rocks by the end of their stem.\nIn 2012, three geologists reported they had isolated complex organic molecules from 340-million-year-old (Mississippian) fossils of multiple species of crinoids. Identified as \"resembl[ing ...] aromatic or polyaromatic quinones\", these are the oldest molecules to be definitively associated with particular individual fossils, as they are believed to have been sealed inside ossicle pores by precipitated calcite during the fossilization process.\nCrinoid fossils, and in particular disarticulated crinoid columnals, can be so abundant that they at times serve as the primary supporting clasts in sedimentary rocks. Rocks of this nature are called encrinites.\nTaxonomy.\nCrinoidea has been accepted as a distinct clade of echinoderms since the definition of the group by Miller in 1821. It includes many extinct orders as well as four closely related living orders (Comatulida, Cyrtocrinida, Hyocrinida, and Isocrinida), which are part of the subgroup Articulata. Living articulates comprise around 540 species.\nPhylogeny.\nThe phylogeny, geologic history, and classification of the Crinoidea was discussed by Wright et al. (2017). These authors presented new phylogeny-based and rank-based classifications based on results of recent phylogenetic analyses. Their rank-based classification of crinoid higher taxa (down to Order), not fully resolved and with numerous groups \"incertae sedis\" (of uncertain placement), is illustrated in the cladogram.\nIn culture.\nFossilised crinoid columnal segments extracted from limestone quarried on Lindisfarne, or found washed up along the foreshore, were threaded into necklaces or rosaries, and became known as St. Cuthbert's beads in the Middle Ages. Similarly, in the Midwestern United States, fossilized segments of the columns of crinoids are sometimes known as Indian beads. A species of crinoid, \"Eperisocrinus missouriensis\", is the state fossil of Missouri. The aliens in the movie franchise \"Alien\" were inspired by crinoids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These filter-feeding organisms are known chiefly from fossils found from the Middle Cambrian (Miaolingian, Wuliuan) through the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian). A possible early graptolite, \"Chaunograptus\", is known from the Middle Cambrian. Recent analyses have favored the idea that the living pterobranch \"Rhabdopleura\" represents an extant graptolite which diverged from the rest of the group in the Cambrian.\nFossil graptolites and \"Rhabdopleura\" share a colony structure of interconnected zooids housed in organic tubes (theca) which have a basic structure of stacked half-rings (fuselli). Most extinct graptolites belong to two major orders: the bush-like sessile Dendroidea and the planktonic, free-floating Graptoloidea. These orders most likely evolved from encrusting pterobranchs similar to \"Rhabdopleura\". Due to their widespread abundance, planktonic lifestyle, and well-traced evolutionary trends, graptoloids in particular are useful index fossils for the Ordovician and Silurian periods.\nThe name graptolite comes from the Greek \"graptos\" meaning \"written\", and \"lithos\" meaning \"rock\", as many graptolite fossils resemble hieroglyphs written on the rock. Linnaeus originally regarded them as 'pictures resembling fossils' rather than true fossils, though later workers supposed them to be related to the hydrozoans; now they are widely recognized as hemichordates.\nHistory.\nThe name \"graptolite\" originates from the genus \"Graptolithus\" (\"writing on the rocks\"), which was used by Linnaeus in 1735 for inorganic mineralizations and incrustations which resembled actual fossils. In 1768, in the 12th volume of \"Systema Naturae\", he included \"G. sagittarius\" and \"G. scalaris\", respectively a possible plant fossil and a possible graptolite. In his 1751 \"Sk\u00e5nska Resa\", he included a figure of a \"fossil or graptolite of a strange kind\" currently thought to be a type of \"Climacograptus\" (a genus of biserial graptolites).\nGraptolite fossils were later referred to a variety of groups, including other branching colonial animals such as bryozoans (\"moss animals\") and hydrozoans. The term Graptolithina was established by Bronn in 1849, who considered them to represent orthoconic cephalopods. By the mid-20th century, graptolites were recognized as a unique group closely related to living pterobranchs in the genera \"Rhabdopleura\" and \"Cephalodiscus\", which had been described in the late 19th century. \"Graptolithus\", as a genus, was officially abandoned in 1954 by the ICZN.\nMorphology.\nColony structure.\nEach graptolite colony originates from an initial individual, called the sicular zooid, from which the subsequent zooids will develop. They are all interconnected by stolons, a true colonial system shared by \"Rhabdopleura\" but not \"Cephalodiscus\". These zooids are housed within an organic structure comprising a series of tubes secreted by the glands on the cephalic shield. The colony structure has been known from several different names, including coenecium (for living pterobranchs), rhabdosome (for fossil graptolites), and most commonly tubarium (for both). The individual tubes, each occupied by a single zooid, are known as theca. The composition of the tubarium is not clearly known, but different authors suggest it is made out of collagen or chitin. In some colonies, there are two sizes of theca, the larger autotheca and smaller bitheca, and it has been suggested that this difference is due to sexual dimorphism of zooids within a colony.\nEarly in the development of a colony, the tubarium splits into a variable number of branches (known as stipes) and different arrangements of the theca, features which are important in the identification of graptolite fossils. Colonies can be classified by their total number of theca rows (biserial colonies have two rows, uniserial have one) and the number of initial stipes per colony (multiramous colonies have many stipes, pauciramous colonies have two or one). Each thecal tube is mostly made up by two series of stacked semicircular half-rings, known as fuselli (sing: fusellum). The fuselli resemble growth lines when preserved in fossils, and the two stacks meet along a suture with a zig-zag pattern. Fuselli are the major reinforcing component of a tubarium, though they are assisted by one or more additional layers of looser tissue, the cortex.\nThe earliest graptolites appeared in the fossil record during the Cambrian, and were generally sessile animals, with a colony attached to the sea floor. Several early-diverging families were encrusting organisms, with the colony developing horizontally along a substrate. Extant \"Rhabdopleura\" fall into this category, with an overall encrusting colony form combined with erect, vertical theca. Most of the erect, dendritic or bushy/fan-shaped graptolites are classified as dendroids (order Dendroidea). Their colonies were attached to a hard substrate by their own weight via an attachment disc. Graptolites with relatively few branches were derived from the dendroid graptolites at the beginning of the Ordovician period. This latter major group, the graptoloids (order Graptoloidea) were pelagic and planktonic, drifting freely through the water column. They were a successful and prolific group, being the most important and widespread macroplanktonic animals until they died out in the early part of the Devonian period. The dendroid graptolites survived until the Carboniferous period.\nZooids.\nA mature zooid has three important regions, the preoral disc or cephalic shield, the collar and the trunk. In the collar, the mouth and anus (U-shaped digestive system) and arms are found; Graptholitina has a single pair of arms with several paired tentacles. As a nervous system, graptolites have a simple layer of fibers between the epidermis and the basal lamina, also have a \"collar ganglion\" that gives rise to several nerve branches, similar to the neural tube of chordates. Proper fossils of the soft parts of graptolites have yet to be found, and it is not known if they had pharyngeal gill slits or not, but based on extant \"Rhabdopleura\", it is likely that the grapotlite zooids had the same morphology.\nTaxonomy.\nSince the 1970s, as a result of advances in electron microscopy, graptolites have generally been thought to be most closely allied to the pterobranchs, a rare group of modern marine animals belonging to the phylum Hemichordata. Comparisons are drawn with the modern hemichordates \"Cephalodiscus\" and \"Rhabdopleura\". According to recent phylogenetic studies, rhabdopleurids are placed within the Graptolithina. Nonetheless, they are considered an \"incertae sedis\" family.\nOn the other hand, Cephalodiscida is considered to be a sister subclass of Graptolithina. One of the main differences between these two groups is that Cephalodiscida species are not colonial organisms. In Cephalodiscida organisms, there is no common canal connecting all zooids. Cephalodiscida zooids have several arms, while Graptolithina zooids have only one pair of arms. Other differences include the type of early development, the gonads, the presence or absence of gill slits, and the size of the zooids. In the fossil record, where mostly tubaria (tubes) are preserved, it is complicated to distinguish between groups.\nGraptolithina includes several minor families as well as two main extinct orders, Dendroidea (benthic graptolites) and Graptoloidea (planktic graptolites). The latter is the most diverse, including 5 suborders, where the most assorted is Axonophora (biserial graptolites, etc.). This group includes Diplograptids and Neograptids, groups that had great development during the Ordovician. Old taxonomic classifications consider the orders Dendroidea, Tuboidea, Camaroidea, Crustoidea, Stolonoidea, Graptoloidea, and Dithecoidea but new classifications embedded them into Graptoloidea at different taxonomic levels.\nTaxonomy of Graptolithina by Maletz (2014):\nSubclass Graptolithina \nEcology.\nGraptolites were a major component of the early Paleozoic ecosystems, especially for the zooplankton because the most abundant and diverse species were planktonic. Graptolites were most likely suspension feeders and strained the water for food such as plankton.\nInferring by analogy with modern pterobranchs, they were able to migrate vertically through the water column for feeding efficiency and to avoid predators. With ecological models and studies of the facies, it was observed that, at least for Ordovician species, some groups of species are largely confined to the epipelagic and mesopelagic zone, from inshore to open ocean. Living rhabdopleura have been found in deep waters in several regions of Europe and America but the distribution might be biased by sampling efforts; colonies are usually found as epibionts of shells.\nTheir locomotion was relative to the water mass in which they lived but the exact mechanisms (such as turbulence, buoyancy, active swimming, and so forth) are not clear yet. One proposal, put forward by Melchin and DeMont (1995), suggested that graptolite movement was analogous to modern free-swimming animals with heavy housing structures. In particular, they compared graptolites to \"sea butterflies\" (Thecostomata), small swimming pteropod snails. Under this suggestion, graptolites moved through rowing or swimming via an undulatory movement of paired muscular appendages developed from the cephalic shield or feeding tentacles. In some species, the thecal aperture was probably so restricted that the appendages hypothesis is not feasible. On the other hand, buoyancy is not supported by any extra thecal tissue or gas build-up control mechanism, and active swimming requires a lot of energetic waste, which would rather be used for the tubarium construction.\nThere are still many questions regarding graptolite locomotion but all these mechanisms are possible alternatives depending on the species and its habitat. For benthic species, that lived attached to the sediment or any other organism, this was not a problem; the zooids were able to move but restricted within the tubarium. Although this zooid movement is possible in both planktic and benthic species, it is limited by the stolon but is particularly useful for feeding. Using their arms and tentacles, which are close to the mouth, they filter the water to catch any particles of food.\nLife cycle.\nThe study of the developmental biology of Graptholitina has been possible by the discovery of the species \"R. compacta\" and \"R. normani\" in shallow waters; it is assumed that graptolite fossils had a similar development as their extant representatives. The life cycle comprises two events, the ontogeny and the astogeny, where the main difference is whether the development is happening in the individual organism or in the modular growth of the colony.\nThe life cycle begins with a planktonic planula-like larva produced by sexual reproduction, which later becomes the \"sicular zooid\" who starts a colony. In \"Rhabdopleura\", the colonies bear male and female zooids but fertilized eggs are incubated in the female tubarium, and stay there until they become larvae able to swim (after 4\u20137 days) to settle away to start a new colony. Each larva surrounds itself in a protective cocoon where the metamorphosis to the zooid takes place (7\u201310 days) and attaches with the posterior part of the body, where the stalk will eventually develop.\nThe development is indirect and lecithotrophic, and the larvae are ciliated and pigmented, with a deep depression on the ventral side. Astogeny happens when the colony grows through asexual reproduction from the tip of a permanent terminal zooid, behind which the new zooids are budded from the stalk, a type of budding called monopodial. It is possible that in graptolite fossils the terminal zooid was not permanent because the new zooids formed from the tip of latest one, in other words, sympodial budding. These new organisms break a hole in the tubarium wall and start secreting their own tube.\nGraptolites in evolutionary development.\nIn recent years, living graptolites have been used as a hemichordate model for Evo-Devo studies, as have their sister group, the acorn worms. For example, graptolites are used to study asymmetry in hemichordates, especially because their gonads tend to be located randomly on one side. In \"Rhabdopleura normani\", the testicle is located asymmetrically, and possibly other structures such as the oral lamella and the gonopore. The significance of these discoveries is to understand the early vertebrate left-right asymmetry due to chordates being a sister group of hemichordates, and therefore, the asymmetry might be a feature that developed early in deuterostomes. Since the location of the structures is not strictly established, also in some enteropneusts, it is likely that asymmetrical states in hemichordates are not under a strong developmental or evolutionary constraint. The origin of this asymmetry, at least for the gonads, is possibly influenced by the direction of the basal coiling in the tubarium, by some intrinsic biological mechanisms in pterobranchs, or solely by environmental factors.\n\"Hedgehog\" (hh), a highly conserved gene implicated in neural developmental patterning, was analyzed in Hemichordates, taking \"Rhabdopleura\" as a pterobranch representative. It was found that hedgehog gene in pterobranchs is expressed in a different pattern compared to other hemichordates as the enteropneust \"Saccoglossus kowalevskii\". An important conserved glycine\u2013cysteine\u2013phenylalanine (GCF) motif at the site of autocatalytic cleavage in hh genes, is altered in \"R. compacta\" by an insertion of the amino acid threonine (T) in the N-terminal, and in \"S. kowalesvskii\" there is a replacement of serine (S) for glycine (G). This mutation decreases the efficiency of the autoproteolytic cleavage and therefore, the signalling function of the protein. It is not clear how this unique mechanism occurred in evolution and the effects it has in the group, but, if it has persisted over millions of years, it implies a functional and genetic advantage.\nGeological relevance.\nPreservation.\nGraptolites are common fossils and have a worldwide distribution. They are most commonly found in shales and mudrocks where sea-bed fossils are rare, this type of rock having formed from sediment deposited in relatively deep water that had poor bottom circulation, was deficient in oxygen, and had no scavengers. The dead planktic graptolites, having sunk to the sea floor, would eventually become entombed in the sediment and were thus well preserved.\nThese colonial animals are also found in limestones and cherts, but generally these rocks were deposited in conditions which were more favorable for bottom-dwelling life, including scavengers, and undoubtedly most graptolite remains deposited here were generally eaten by other animals.\nFossils are often found flattened along the bedding plane of the rocks in which they occur, though may be found in three dimensions when they are infilled by iron pyrite or some other minerals. They vary in shape, but are most commonly dendritic or branching (such as \"Dictyonema\"), sawblade-like, or \"tuning fork\"-shaped (such as \"Didymograptus murchisoni\"). Their remains may be mistaken for fossil plants by the casual observer, as it has been the case for the first graptolite descriptions.\nGraptolites are normally preserved as a black carbon film on the rock's surface or as light grey clay films in tectonically distorted rocks. The fossil can also appear stretched or distorted. This is due to the strata that the graptolite is within, being folded and compacted. They may be sometimes difficult to see, but by slanting the specimen to the light they reveal themselves as a shiny marking. Pyritized graptolite fossils are also found.\nA well-known locality for graptolite fossils in Britain is Abereiddy Bay, Dyfed, Wales, where they occur in rocks from the Ordovician Period. Sites in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, the Lake District and Welsh Borders also yield rich and well-preserved graptolite faunas. A famous graptolite location in Scotland is Dob's Linn with species from the boundary Ordovician-Silurian. Since the group had a wide distribution, fossils are also abundant in several parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and China, among others.\nStratigraphy.\nGraptolite fossils have predictable preservation, widespread distribution, and gradual change over a geologic time scale. This allows them to be used to date strata of rocks throughout the world. They are important index fossils for dating Palaeozoic rocks as they evolved rapidly with time and formed many different distinctive species. Geologists can divide the rocks of the Ordovician and Silurian periods into graptolite biozones; these are generally less than one million years in duration. A worldwide ice age at the end of the Ordovician eliminated most graptolites except the neograptines. Diversification from the neograptines that survived the Ordovician glaciation began around 2 million years later.\nThe Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) influenced changes in the morphology of the colonies and thecae, giving rise to new groups like the planktic Graptoloidea. Later, some of the greatest extinctions that affected the group were the Hirnantian in the Ordovician and the Lundgreni in the Silurian, where graptolite populations were dramatically reduced (see also Lilliput effect).\nGraptolite diversity was greatly reduced during the Sedgwickii Event in the Aeronian. This event has been attested in locations such as today's Canada, Libya as well as in La Chilca Formation of Argentina (then part of Gondwana).\nResearchers.\nThe following is a selection of graptolite and pterobranch researchers:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film was produced by Paramount Pictures, featuring an all-star cast. It is all live action, except for the Walrus and The Carpenter sequence, which was animated by Harman-Ising Studio. The film was seen by Walt Disney, and inspired him to create his company's 1951 animated adaptation.\nStars include W. C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, Edna May Oliver as the Red Queen, Cary Grant as the Mock Turtle, Gary Cooper as The White Knight, Edward Everett Horton as The Hatter, Charles Ruggles as The March Hare, Richard Arlen as the Cheshire Cat, Baby LeRoy as The Joker, and Charlotte Henry in her first leading role as Alice.\nThis adaptation was directed by Norman Z. McLeod from a screenplay by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and William Cameron Menzies, based on Lewis Carroll's books \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1865) and \"Alice Through the Looking-Glass\" (1871). It also drew heavily from Eva Le Gallienne and Florida Friebus's then-recent stage adaptation.\nWhen Paramount previewed the film in 1933, the original running time was 90 minutes. By the time it was shown to the press, it was truncated to 77 minutes. Many reviews, including the savage one in \"Variety\", made a point of how long it seemed at an hour-and-a-quarter. Though being released at this shorter time, it is often mistakenly reported that Universal Pictures edited it when it bought the television rights in the late 1950s. Universal released the film on DVD on March 2, 2010, as the first home video release.\nIt is the only major live-action Hollywood theatrical production to adapt the original \"Alice\" stories. The next major live-action Hollywood production to do so is a two-part adaptation for television in 1985, and the second major live-action Hollywood production for movie theaters to use the title \"Alice in Wonderland\" was made by Tim Burton for Disney in 2010 as a sequel to the original story.\nPlot.\nAlice and Dinah live peacefully in their home, until chasing a White Rabbit into a hole.

{"id": "62182", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62182", "title": "Jean-Paul Marat", "text": "French political theorist (1743\u20131793)\nJean-Paul Marat (, , ; born Jean-Paul Mara; 24 May 1743\u00a0\u2013 13 July 1793) was a French political theorist, physician, and scientist. A journalist and politician during the French Revolution, he was a vigorous defender of the \"sans-culottes\", a radical voice, and published his views in pamphlets, placards and newspapers. His periodical \"L'Ami du peuple\" (\"The Friend of the People\") made him an unofficial link with the radical Jacobin group that came to power after June 1793.\nHis journalism was known for its fierce tone and uncompromising stance toward the new leaders and institutions of the revolution. Responsibility for the September massacres has been attributed to him, given his position of renown at the time, and a paper trail of decisions leading up to the massacres. Others posit that the collective mentality which made them possible resulted from circumstances and not from the will of any particular individual. Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer, while taking a medicinal bath for his debilitating skin condition. Corday was executed four days later for his assassination, on 17 July 1793.\nIn death, Marat became an icon to the Montagnards faction of the Jacobins as well as the greater sans-culotte population, and a revolutionary martyr; according to contemporary accounts, some even mourned him with a kind of prayer: \"O heart of Jesus! O sacred heart of Marat.\" The most famous painter in Paris, Jacques-Louis David, immortalized Marat in his iconic painting \"The Death of Marat\". David and Marat were part of the Paris Commune leadership anchored in the Cordeliers section, from where the Revolution is said to have started in 1789 because those who stormed the Bastille lived there. Both David and Marat were on the Commune's Committee of General Security during the beginnings of what would become known as the Reign of Terror.\nEarly life.\nFamily.\n Jean-Paul Marat was born in Boudry, in the Prussian Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel (now a canton of Switzerland), on 24 May 1743. He was the first of five children born to Jean Mara (born Juan Salvador Mara; 1704\u20131783), a Sardinian from Cagliari, and Louise Cabrol (1724\u20131782), from Geneva. His father studied in Spain and Sardinia before becoming a Mercedarian friar in 1720, at age 16, but at some point left the order and converted to Calvinism, and in 1740 immigrated to the Protestant Republic of Geneva. His mother, who had Huguenot background from both sides of her family, was the daughter of French \"perruquier\" Louis Cabrol, originally from Castres, Languedoc, and Genevan citizen after 1723, and his wife Pauline-Catherine Molinier. Jean Mara and Louise Cabrol married on 19 March 1741 at the parish church of Le Petit-Saconnex, a district of Geneva. One of Marat's brothers, David Mara (born in 1756), was a professor at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in the Russian Empire, where he had Alexander Pushkin as his student.\nMarat's family lived in moderate circumstances, as his father was well educated but unable to secure a stable profession. Marat credits his father for instilling in him a love of learning. He explains he felt \"exceptionally fortunate to have had the advantage of receiving a very careful education in my paternal home.\" From his mother, he claims to have been taught a strong sense of morality and social conscience. Marat left home at the age of 16, desiring to seek an education in France. He was aware of the limited opportunities for those seen as outsiders as his highly educated father had been turned down for several college (secondary) teaching posts. In 1754 his family settled in Neuch\u00e2tel, capital of the Principality, where Marat's father began working as a tutor.\nEducation.\nMarat received his early education in the city of Neuch\u00e2tel and there was a student of Jean-\u00c9lie Bertrand, who later founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 typographique de Neuch\u00e2tel. At 17 years of age he applied for the expedition of Jean-Baptiste Chappe d'Auteroche to Tobolsk to measure the transit of Venus, but was turned down. His first patronage was fulfilled with the wealthy Nairac family in Bordeaux, where he stayed for two years. He then moved to Paris and studied medicine without gaining any formal qualifications. After moving to France, Jean-Paul Mara francized his surname as \"Marat\".\nHe worked, informally, as a doctor after moving to London in 1765 due to a fear of being \"drawn into dissipation\". While there he befriended the Royal Academician artist Angelica Kauffman. His social circle included Italian artists and architects who met in coffee houses around Soho. Highly ambitious, but without patronage or qualifications, he set about inserting himself into the intellectual scene.\nPolitical, philosophical, and medical writing.\nAround 1770, Marat moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. His first political work, \"Chains of Slavery\" (1774), inspired by the extra-parliamentary activities of the disenfranchised MP and later Mayor of London John Wilkes, was most probably compiled in the central library there. By Marat's own account, while composing it he lived on black coffee for three months and slept two hours a night, and after finishing it he slept soundly for 13 days in a row. He gave it the subtitle, \"A work in which the clandestine and villainous attempts of Princes to ruin Liberty are pointed out, and the dreadful scenes of Despotism disclosed.\" In the work, Marat criticized aspects of England's constitution that he believed to be corrupt or despotic. He condemned the King's power to influence Parliament through bribery and attacked limitations on voting rights. \"Chains of Slavery's\" political ideology takes clear inspiration from Jean-Jacques Rousseau by attributing the nation's sovereignty to the common people rather than a monarch. He also suggests that the people express sovereignty through representatives who cannot enact legislation without the approval of the people they represent. This work earned him honorary membership of the patriotic societies of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Carlisle and Newcastle. The Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society Library possesses a copy, and Tyne and Wear Archives Service holds three presented to the various Newcastle guilds.\nMarat published \"A Philosophical Essay on Man,\" in 1773 and \"Chains of Slavery,\" in 1774. Voltaire's sharp critique of \"De l'Homme\" (an augmented translation, published 1775\u201376), partly in defence of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Helv\u00e9tius, reinforced Marat's growing sense of a widening gulf between the \"philosophes\", grouped around Voltaire on one hand, and their opponents, loosely grouped around Rousseau on the other.\nAfter a published essay on curing a friend of gleets (gonorrhoea) he secured medical \"referees\" for an MD from the University of St Andrews in June 1775.\nHe published \"Enquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of a Singular Disease of the Eyes\" on his return to London. In 1776, Marat moved to Paris after stopping in Geneva to visit his family.\nIn Paris, his growing reputation as a highly effective doctor along with the patronage of the Marquis de l'Aubespine (the husband of one of his patients) secured his appointment as physician to the bodyguard of the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's youngest brother. He began this position in June 1777. The position paid 2,000 livres a year plus allowances.\nScientific writing.\nMarat set up a laboratory in the Marquise de l'Aubespine's house with funds obtained by serving as court doctor among the aristocracy. His method was to describe in detail the meticulous series of experiments he had undertaken on a problem, seeking to explore and then exclude all possible conclusions but the one he reached.\nHe published works on fire and heat, electricity, and light. He published a summary of his scientific views and discoveries in \"D\u00e9couvertes de M. Marat sur le feu, l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et la lumi\u00e8re\" (English: \"Mr Marat's Discoveries on Fire, Electricity and Light\") in 1779. He published three more detailed and extensive works that expanded on each of his areas of research.\n\"Recherches Physiques sur le Feu\".\nThe first of Marat's large-scale publications detailing his experiments and drawing conclusions from them was \"Recherches Physiques sur le Feu\" (English: \"Research into the Physics of Fire\"), which was published in 1780 with the approval of the official censors.\nThis publication describes 166 experiments conducted to demonstrate that fire was not, as was widely held, a material element but an \"igneous fluid.\" He asked the Academy of Sciences to appraise his work, and it appointed a commission to do so, which reported in April 1779. The report avoided endorsing Marat's conclusions but praised his \"new, precise and well-executed experiments, appropriately and ingeniously designed\". Marat then published his work, with the claim that the Academy approved of its contents. Since the Academy had endorsed his methods but said nothing about his conclusions, this claim drew the ire of Antoine Lavoisier, who demanded that the Academy repudiate it. When the Academy did so, this marked the beginning of worsening relations between Marat and many of its leading members. A number of them, including Lavoisier himself, as well as Condorcet and Laplace, took a strong dislike to Marat. However, Lamarck and Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de wrote positively about Marat's experiments and conclusions.\n\"D\u00e9couvertes sur la Lumi\u00e8re\".\nIn Marat's time, Newton's views on light and colour were regarded almost universally as definitive, yet Marat's explicit purpose in his second major work \"D\u00e9couvertes sur la Lumi\u00e8re\" (\"Discoveries on Light\") was to demonstrate that in certain key areas, Newton was wrong.\nThe focus of Marat's work was the study of how light bends around objects, and his main argument was that while Newton held that white light was broken down into colours by refraction, the colours were actually caused by diffraction. When a beam of sunlight shone through an aperture, passed through a prism and projected colour onto a wall, the splitting of the light into colours took place not in the prism, as Newton maintained, but at the edges of the aperture itself. Marat sought to demonstrate that there are only three primary colours, rather than seven as Newton had argued.\nOnce again, Marat requested the Academy of Sciences review his work, and it set up a commission to do so. Over a period of seven months, from June 1779 to January 1780, Marat performed his experiments in the presence of the commissioners so that they could appraise his methods and conclusions. The drafting of their final report was assigned to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy. The report was finally produced after many delays in May 1780, and consisted of just three short paragraphs. Significantly, the report concluded that \"\"these experiments are so very numerous...[but]...they do not appear to us to prove what the author believes they establish\".\" The Academy declined to endorse Marat's work. When it was published, \"D\u00e9couvertes sur la lumi\u00e8re\" did not carry the royal approbation. According to the title page, it was printed in London, so that either, Marat could not get the official censor to approve it, or, he did not want to spend the time and effort to do so.\n\"Recherches Physiques sur L'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9\".\nMarat's third major work, \"Recherches Physiques sur l'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9\" (English: \"Research on the Physics of Electricity\"), outlined 214 experiments. One of his major areas of interest was in electrical attraction and repulsion. Repulsion, he held, was not a basic force of nature. He addressed a number of other areas of enquiry in his work, concluding with a section on lightning rods which argued that those with pointed ends were more effective than those with blunt ends, and denouncing the idea of \"earthquake rods\" advocated by Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare. This book was published with the censor's stamp of approval, but Marat did not seek the endorsement of the Academy of Sciences.\nIn April 1783, he resigned his court appointment and devoted his energies full-time to scientific research. Apart from his major works, during this period Marat published shorter essays on the medical use of electricity (\"M\u00e9moire sur l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale\" (1783)) and on optics (\"Notions \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires d'optique\" (1784)). He published a well-received translation of Newton's \"Opticks\" (1787), which was still in print until recently, and later a collection of essays on his experimental findings, including a study on the effect of light on soap bubbles in his \"M\u00e9moires acad\u00e9miques, ou nouvelles d\u00e9couvertes sur la lumi\u00e8re\" (\"Academic memoirs, or new discoveries on light\", 1788). Benjamin Franklin visited him on several occasions and Goethe described his rejection by the Academy as a glaring example of scientific despotism.\nOther pre-Revolutionary writing.\nIn 1780, Marat published his \"favourite work,\" a \"Plan de l\u00e9gislation criminelle.\" It was a polemic for penal reform which had been entered into a competition announced by the Berne Economic Society in February 1777 and backed by Frederick the Great and Voltaire. Marat was inspired by Rousseau and Cesare Beccaria's \"Il libro dei delitti e delle pene\".\nMarat's entry contained many radical ideas, including the argument that society should provide fundamental natural needs, such as food and shelter, if it expected all its citizens to follow its civil laws, that the king was no more than the \"first magistrate\" of his people, that there should be a common death penalty regardless of class, and that each town should have a dedicated \"\"avocat\" \"des\" pauvres\" and set up independent criminal tribunals with twelve-man juries to ensure a fair trial.\nIn the early French Revolution.\nEstates General and Fall of the Bastille.\nIn 1788, the Assembly of Notables advised Louis XVI to assemble the Estates-General for the first time in 175 years. According to Marat, in the latter half of 1788 he had been deathly ill. Upon hearing of the King's decision to call together the Estates General, however, he explains that the \"news had a powerful effect on me; my illness suddenly broke and my spirits revived\". He strongly desired to contribute his ideas to the coming events and subsequently abandoned his career as a scientist and doctor, taking up his pen on behalf of the Third Estate.\nMarat anonymously published his first contribution to the revolution in February 1789, titled \"Offrande \u00e0 la Patrie\" (\"Offering to the Nation\"), which touched on some of the same points as the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s' famous \"Qu'est-ce que le Tiers \u00c9tat?\" (\"What is the Third Estate?\"). Marat claimed that this work caused a sensation throughout France, though he likely exaggerated its effect as the pamphlet mostly echoed ideas similar to many other pamphlets and cahiers circulating at the time. This was followed by a \"Suppl\u00e9ment de l'Offrande\" in March, where he was less optimistic, expressing displeasure with the King's \"Lettres Royales\" of 24 January. In August 1789, he published \"La Constitution, ou Projet de d\u00e9claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen\", intended to influence the drafting of France's new constitution, then being debated in the National Assembly. In this work, he builds his theories upon ideas taken from Montesquieu and Rousseau, claiming that the sovereignty of the nation rests with the people and emphasizing the need for a separation of powers. He argues for a constitutional monarchy, believing that a republic is ineffective in large nations. Marat's work elicited no response from the National Assembly.\nOn 14 July, three days after Louis XVI dismissed Jacques Necker as his financial advisor, enraged Parisians attacked the Hotel des Invalides and the Bastille, marking the first insurrection of the French Revolution. Marat was not directly involved in the Fall of the Bastille but sought to glorify his role that day by claiming that he had intercepted a group of German soldiers on Pont Neuf. He claims that these soldiers were seeking to crush the revolution in its infancy, and that he had successfully convinced a crowd to force the soldiers to surrender their weapons. Whether or not this event actually occurred is questionable as there are no other known accounts that confirm Marat's story.\n\"L'Ami du peuple\".\nOn 12 September 1789, Marat began his own newspaper, entitled \"Publiciste parisien\", before changing its name four days later to \"L'Ami du peuple\" (\"The People's friend\"). From this position, he often attacked the most influential and powerful groups in Paris as conspirators against the Revolution, including the Commune, the Constituent Assembly, the ministers, and the Ch\u00e2telet. In January 1790, he moved to the radical Cordeliers section, then under the leadership of the lawyer Danton, was nearly arrested for his attacks against Jacques Necker, Louis XVI's popular Finance Minister, and was forced to flee to London. In May, he returned to Paris to continue publication of \"L'Ami du peuple\" and briefly ran a second newspaper in June 1790 called \"Le\" \"Junius\" \"fran\u00e7ais\" named after the notorious English polemicist Junius. Marat faced the problem of counterfeiters distributing falsified versions of \"L'Ami du peuple\". This led him to call for police intervention, which resulted in the suppression of the fraudulent issues, leaving Marat the continuing sole author of \"L'Ami du peuple\".\nDuring this period, Marat made regular attacks on the more conservative revolutionary leaders. In a pamphlet from 26 July 1790, entitled \"C'en est fait de nous\" (\"We're done for!\"), he warned against counter-revolutionaries, advising, \"five or six hundred heads cut off would have assured your repose, freedom and happiness.\"\nBetween 1789 and 1792, Marat was often forced into hiding, sometimes in the Paris sewers, where he almost certainly aggravated his debilitating chronic skin disease (possibly dermatitis herpetiformis). In January 1792, he married the 26-year-old Simonne \u00c9vrard in a common-law ceremony on his return from exile in London, having previously expressed his love for her. She was the sister-in-law of his typographer, Jean-Antoine Corne, and had lent him money and sheltered him on several occasions.\nMarat only emerged publicly on the 10 August insurrection, when the Tuileries Palace was invaded and the royal family forced to shelter within the Legislative Assembly. The spark for this uprising was the Brunswick Manifesto, which called for the crushing of the Revolution and helped to inflame popular outrage in Paris.\nCommittee on Surveillance.\nAs the Paris Commune of Marat's allies achieved more influence, it formed a Committee on Surveillance which included Marat, Jacque-Nicolas Billaud-Varennes, Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois, Georges Danton, Jean-Lambert Tallien, \u00c9tienne-Jean Panis and Jacques-Louis David. Marat was said by Stanley Loomis to have claimed the position of its head. Ernest Belfort Bax disputed this claim, saying that on appearing once again in the upper daylight of Paris, Marat was almost immediately invited to assist the new governing body with his advice, and had a special tribune assigned to him. Marat was thus assiduous in his attendance at the Commune, although never formally a member. The Commune and the Sections of Paris, between them, had established a \"Comit\u00e9 de Surveillance\", with power to add to its numbers. Into this committee Marat was, according to Bax, co-opted. They quickly decided to round up those they believed were \"suspect\"; the Committee voted to do so and four thousand were sent into the prisons by late August 1792. Actually the Committee, of which Marat was one of the most influential members, took the step of withdrawing from the prisons those of whose guilt, in its opinion, there was any reasonable doubt. Marat and the rest saw what was coming; the last straw to break the patience of Paris was the acquittal on Friday 31 August of Montmarin, the late Governor of Fontainebleau. Montmarin was notoriously and openly a courtier, who wished to see the allies in Paris, and his royal master reinstated, and who was proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, to have been actively engaged in plotting to this end; yet, on being brought to trial, he was acquitted, and, as if to lend emphasis to the acquittal, the judge himself, descending from the bench, gave him his arm as he walked out of court. An unsuccessful attempt was even made to deprive the Commune of its powers. Forty-eight hours later, the notorious September massacres began.\nThose arrangements would include a collection of mercenaries grouped as \"Marsellais\" though they were \"foreign vagabonds, dregs of all nations, Genosee, Corsicans and Greeks led by a Pole named Lazowski.\" Added to these were convicted murderers and those imprisoned for other violent crimes, released in time to join the \"Marsellais\" at the center of the bloodlettings. At times those enacting violence were joined by mobs of locals, some of who had armed themselves in preparation for a defense of the city National Guardsmen and some \"f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s\". In some cases makeshift \"courts\" were set-up, prisoners were pronounced \"free\" or \"guilty\" then all were led to a central courtyard where they were bludgeoned, hacked, speared, and decapitated. In other prisons, small bands of mercenaries entered cells which had held murderers days before, who turned their craft on the innocents brought in by the Committee, some as young as 10.\nOn 3 September, the second day of the massacres, the Committee of Surveillance of the Commune published a circular that called on provincial Patriots to defend Paris and asked that, before leaving their homes, they eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Authored by Marat as head of the Committee, signed by him and circulated to the provinces, it hailed the rounding up and killing of political enemies going on in Paris as a model for the provinces. While Georges Lefebvre maintained collective mentality was sufficient explanation for the mass killing, Stanley Loomis says this \"is their excuse or justification\".\nThe Girondins then made a number of copies of this circular, but there is no evidence that it had any effect. Marat himself did not participate in the violence of the massacres, but rather the Sections of Paris had begun to act of themselves. Marat and his Committee of Supervision at most took the control of the movement which had already begun spontaneously. Whether Marat played a part in the cause of the massacres is still continually debated. It can be said that there was a continuous goading on of the tribunals to definite and decided action. In No. 679 of \"L'Ami du Peuple\" we have the following advice: Guard the King from view, put a price on the heads of the fugitive Capets, arm all the citizens, form a camp near Paris, press forward the sale of the goods of the \u2018emigrants,\u2019 and recompense the unfortunates who have taken part in the conquest of the Tuileries, invite the troops of the line to name their officers, guard the provisions, do not miss a word of this last advice, press the judgment of the traitors imprisoned in the Abbaye; ... if the sword of justice do at last but strike conspirators and prevaricators, we shall no longer hear popular executions spoken of, cruel resource which the law of necessity can alone commend to a people reduced to despair, but which the voluntary sleep of the laws always justifies. Danton at the same moment was urging from the tribune the necessity of the prompt appointment of a court to try traitors, as the only alternative to the popular justice of the streets. Maximilien Robespierre, Danton and Marat all stressed the necessity of a tribunal that would judge these crimes. Robespierre intervened on 15 August, as a delegate of the Commune, and proclaimed: \"Since 10 August, the just vengeance of the people has not yet been satisfied.\" According to Bax, the September massacres were the result of the efforts of the Moderate party to screen men who were openly plotting the overthrow of the Revolution. The Moderatist and Girondist Assembly hesitated at making a few examples of even the most notorious of these plotters. The crisis in the war, long foreseen by Marat and others, was now becoming more acute every day. On 6 September, Mlle de Mareuil, daughter of a member of the Commune's general council, wrote to her brother: I have to make the following remark: since the journ\u00e9e of 10 August, there have only been three people guillotined, and this has revolted the people. Finally people gathered from all sides... Oh my dear friend, we are all in a state of dreadful consternation.There is an exculpatory article in No.12 of Marat's \"Journal de la R\u00e9publique\", occasioned by the virulent attacks of the Girondins in the Convention on the Commune, the Committee of Supervision, and above all on Marat himself, with reference to the massacres:The disastrous events of the 2nd and 3rd of September, which perfidious and venal persons attribute to the Municipality, has been solely promoted by the denial of justice on the part of the Criminal tribunal which whitewashed the conspirator Montmarin, by the protection thus proclaimed to all others conspirators, and by the indignation of the people, fearing to find itself the slave of all the traitors who have for so long abused its misfortunes and its disasters. They call those brigands who massacred the traitors and scoundrels confined in the prisons. If that were so, P\u00e9tion would be criminal for having peaceably left brigands to perpetrate their crimes during two consecutive days in all the prisons of Paris. His culpable inaction would be the most serious crime, and he would merit the loss of his head for not having mobilised his whole armed force to oppose them. He will doubtless tell you, in order to exculpate himself, that the armed force would not have obeyed him, and that all Paris was involved, which is indeed a fact. Let us agree, then, that it is an imposture to make brigands responsible for an operation unhappily only too necessary. It is then because the conspirators have escaped the sword of justice that they have fallen under the axe of the people. Is it necessary to say more to refute the dishonest insinuation, which would make the Committee of Supervision of the Commune responsible for these popular executions? But its justification does not end there. We shall see what the principal members of this Committee have done to prevent any innocent person, any debtor, any one culpable of a trivial offence, being involved in the dangers which threatened great criminals. I was at the Committee of Supervision, when the announcement was made that the people had just seized from the hands of the Guard, and put to death, several refractory priests, accused of plotting, destined by the Committee for La Force, and that the people threatened to enter the prisons. At this news, Panis and myself exclaimed together, as if by inspiration, \"Save the small delinquents, the poor debtors, those accused of trivial assaults!\" The Committee immediately ordered the different jailers to separate these from the serious malefactors and the counter-revolutionary traitors, lest the people should be exposed to the risk of sacrificing some innocent persons. The separation was already made when the prisons were forced, but the precaution was unnecessary, owing to the care taken by the judges appointed by the people, who exercised the functions of tribunes during the expedition, to inquire into each case and to release all those whom the Committee of Supervision had separated. This is a discrimination the despot would certainly not have exercised had he triumphed on the 10th of August. Such are the facts which oppose themselves to the calumny that has distorted the narrative of the events of the 2nd and 3rd of September.The September massacres were not the work of one party, much less of one man, but an ebullition of popular fury, acquiesced in as a necessity by all parties and by all the leading men of the Revolution. This perspective of affairs is summed up in the passages of Mr. Bowen-Graves quoted by Ernest Belfort Bax:Marat's part in these last terrible events has been constantly and grossly misrepresented. He had long foreseen and foretold what would happen if foreign invasion found Paris in a state of chaos. The predicted crisis had now arrived. On the east the Germans are at the Thermopylae of France. A step more, the Revolution sinks beneath them. On the west the standard of the Vendean insurrection is already raised. Between the two lies Paris, in hardly dormant civil war. Royalty is overthrown, but royalism is rampant. The Swiss guards, the rank and file have fallen, sacrificed to their fidelity to a master who had deserted and forgotten them; but officers, courtiers, \"chevaliers de poignard\", are lively as ever, intriguing, plotting, vapouring in street and caf\u00e9, openly rejoicing in the triumph which German armies will give them measuring, compasses in hand, the distance between Verdun and Paris. The newly-formed tribunal is inefficient, acquitting men, notorious for their part in the intrigues, which were the cause of all the evil. Lafayette, with his army, is believed to be marching on Paris to restore the powers of the monarchy. Republicans knew well enough what such restoration would mean. The horrors of Montauban, Arles, and Avignon are written in history, to show how well-founded were their fears. And in the midst of all this came the tidings that the one strong place between Paris and the enemy is besieged; that its resistance is a question hardly even of days. Then, while the tocsin was clanging, and the alarm cannon roaring, and the Girondin minister could find nothing better to suggest, with his unseasonable classicism, than carrying into the South the statue of liberty, Paris answered with one instinct to Danton's thundering defiance, and perpetrated that tremendous act of self-defence at which we shudder to this day. The reaction hid its head and cowered; and within the month the ragged volunteers of the Republic were hurling back from the passes of the Argonne the finest soldiery which Europe could produce.On 2 September, news arrived in Paris that the army of the Duke of Braunschweig had invaded France and the fortress of Verdun had quickly fallen, and that the Prussians were rapidly advancing towards the capital. This information ignited anger and fear among the population. Parisians knew that an illumination had been staged at the Abbay prison on the day of the capture of Longwy, where behind bars the prisoners insulted passers-by and assured them that the Prussians would occupy Paris and destroy it. That the Parisians' hatred of the Royalists was founded can be deduced from an article published in a Girondist newspaper on 2 September stating that the Royalists decided to burn the city on all sides after the Prussian army entered Paris, starved the city population and punished the revolutionaries. And the Manifesto of the Duke of Braunschweig (25 July 1792), written in large part by Louis XVI's cousin Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9, leader of a large contingent of immigrants in the Allied army, threatened the French people with instant punishment if the people resists the imperial and Prussian armies and the re-establishment of the power of the monarchy. The days of September in Paris were seen by some as the act of self-defense of a people who knew how brutal the counter-revolutionaries were, a people who feared a coup in Paris while fighting on the front lines. After the capture of Verdun, the Prussian army was only a hundred miles from Paris. Many Europeans had no doubt about the victory of the Duke of Braunschweig. A fall of Paris was not expected later than 10 September.\nIn the \"Cr\u00e9ole patriote\" for 2 September, the account began by evoking 10 August: 'The people, justly indignant at the crimes committed during the journ\u00e9e of 10 August, made for the prisons. They still feared plots and traitors... The news that Verdun had been taken... provoked their resentment and vengeance.\u2019\nIt was enough for the Legislative Assembly, at the vigorous request of the Commune, to issue a statement to the French people on 4 September in which it promised \"that it would fight with all its powers against the king and the royal government\" so that the slaughter would end the same day and Parisians would go to the front. The Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792) was the first victory over their enemy since the beginning of the war. Johann Wolfgang van Goethe, an admirer of the scientific work of Dr. Marat, said, \"At that place, on that day, a new era in world history began. It is the first victory of the people over the kings.\" No one was prosecuted for the killings.\nNational Convention.\nMarat was elected to the National Convention in September 1792 as one of 26 Paris deputies, although he belonged to no party. When France was declared a republic on 22 September, Marat renamed his \"L'Ami du peuple\" as \"Le Journal de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise\" (\"Journal of the French Republic\").\nHis stance during the trial of the deposed king Louis XVI was unique. He declared it unfair to accuse Louis of anything before his acceptance of the French Constitution of 1791, and although implacably, he said, believing that the monarch's death would be good for the people, defended Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, the King's counsel, as a \"sage et respectable vieillard\" (\"wise and respected old man\").\nOn 21 January 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined, which caused political turmoil. From January to May, Marat fought bitterly against the Girondins, whom he believed to be covert enemies of republicanism. Marat's hatred and suspicion of the Girondins became increasingly heated which led him to call for the use of violent tactics against them. He cried that France needed a chief, \"a military Tribune\". The Girondins fought back and demanded that Marat be tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal. After trying to avoid arrest for several days, Marat was finally imprisoned. On 24 April, he was brought before the Tribunal on the charges that he had printed in his paper statements calling for widespread murder as well as the suspension of the Convention. Marat decisively defended his actions, stating that he had no evil intentions directed against the Convention. Marat was acquitted of all charges to the celebration of his supporters.\nAssassination.\nThe fall of the Girondins on 2 June, helped by the actions of Fran\u00e7ois Hanriot, the new leader of the National Guard, was one of Marat's last achievements. Forced to retire from the Convention due to his worsening skin disease, he continued to work from home, where he soaked in a medicinal bath. Now that the Montagnards no longer needed his support in the struggle against the Girondins, Robespierre and other leading Montagnards began to separate themselves from him, while the Convention largely ignored his letters.\nMarat was in his bathtub on 13 July when a young woman from Caen, Charlotte Corday, appeared at his flat, claiming to have vital information on the activities of the escaped Girondins who had fled to Normandy. Despite his wife Simone's protests, Marat asked for her to enter and gave her an audience by his bath, over which a board had been laid to serve as a writing desk. Their interview lasted around fifteen minutes. He asked her what was happening in Caen and she explained, reciting a list of the offending deputies. After he had finished writing out the list, Corday claimed that he told her, \"Their heads will fall within a fortnight,\" a statement she later changed at her trial to, \"Soon I shall have them all guillotined in Paris.\" This was unlikely since Marat did not have the power to have anyone guillotined. At that moment, Corday rose from her chair, drawing out from her corset a kitchen knife, which she had bought earlier that day, and brought it down into Marat's chest, where it pierced just under his right clavicle, opening the brachiocephalic artery, close to the heart. The massive bleeding was fatal within seconds. Slumping backwards, Marat cried out his last words to Simone, \"Aidez-moi, ma ch\u00e8re amie!\" (\"Help me, my beloved!\") and died.\nCorday was a Girondin sympathizer who came from an impoverished royalist family; her brothers were \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had left to join the exiled royal princes. From her own account, and those of witnesses, it is clear that Girondin speeches had inspired her to a hatred of the Montagnards and their excesses, symbolised most powerfully in the character of Marat. The \"Book of Days\" claims the motive was to \"avenge the fate of her friend, Barbaroux\". Marat's assassination contributed to the mounting suspicion which fed the Terror during which thousands of the Jacobins' adversaries \u2013 both royalists and Girondins \u2013 were executed on charges of treason. Charlotte Corday was guillotined on 17 July 1793 for the murder. During her four-day trial, she testified that she had carried out the assassination alone, saying \"I killed one man to save 100,000.\"\nMemory in the Revolution.\nMarat's assassination led to his apotheosis. The painter Jacques-Louis David, a member of one of the two \"Great Committees\" (the Committee of General Security), was asked to organise a grand funeral. David was also asked to paint Marat's death, and took up the task of immortalising him in the painting \"The Death of Marat\". The extreme decomposition of Marat's body made any realistic depiction impossible, and David's work beautified the skin that was discoloured and scabbed from his chronic skin disease in an attempt to create antique virtue. The resulting painting is thus not an accurate representation of Marat's death. As a result of this work, David was later criticised as glorifying the Jacobin's death.\nThe entire National Convention attended Marat's funeral, and he was buried under a weeping willow in the garden of the former \"Club des Cordeliers\" (former \"Couvent des Cordeliers\"). After Marat's death, he was viewed by many as a martyr for the revolution, and was immortalized in various ways to preserve the values he stood for. His heart was embalmed separately and placed in an urn in an altar erected to his memory at the \"Cordeliers\" to inspire speeches that were similar in style to Marat's journalism. On his tomb, the inscription on a plaque read, \"Unit\u00e9, Indivisibilit\u00e9 de la R\u00e9publique, Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9 ou la mort.\" His remains were transferred to the Panth\u00e9on on 21 September 1794 and his near messianic role in the Revolution was confirmed with the elegy: \"Like Jesus, Marat loved ardently the people, and only them. Like Jesus, Marat hated kings, nobles, priests, rogues and, like Jesus, he never stopped fighting against these plagues of the people.\" The eulogy was given by the Marquis de Sade, delegate of the Section Piques and an ally of Marat's faction in the National Convention.\nOn 19 November, the port city of Le Havre-de-Gr\u00e2ce changed its name to Le Havre-de-Marat and then Le Havre-Marat. When the Jacobins started their dechristianisation campaign to set up the \"Cult of Reason\" of H\u00e9bert and Chaumette and later the \"Cult of the Supreme Being\" of the Committee of Public Safety, Marat was made a quasi-saint, and his bust often replaced crucifixes in the former churches of Paris.\nAfter the Thermidorian Reaction, Marat's reputation decreased. On 13 January 1795, Le Havre-Marat became simply Le Havre, the name it bears today. In February, his coffin was removed from the Panth\u00e9on and his busts and sculptures were destroyed. The 4 February 1795 (16 Pluvi\u00f4se) issue of Le Moniteur Universel reported how, two days earlier, \"his busts had been knocked off their pedestals in several theatres and that some children had carried one of these busts about the streets, insulting it [before] dumping it in the rue Montmartre sewer to shouts of 'Marat, voil\u00e0 ton Panth\u00e9on !' [Marat, here is your Panth\u00e9on] His final resting place is the cemetery of the church of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont.\nA bronze sculpture of Marat was removed from Parc des Buttes Chaumont and was melted down during the Nazi occupation of Paris. Another was created in 2013 for the Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise.\nHe continued to be held in high regard in the Soviet Union. Marat became a common name, and Marat Fjord in Severnaya Zemlya was named after him. Russian battleship \"Petropavlovsk\" () was renamed \"Marat\" in 1921. A street in the centre of Sevastopol was named after Marat () on 3 January 1921, shortly after the Bolsheviks took over the city.\nSkin disease.\nDescribed during his time as a man \"short in stature, deformed in person, and hideous in face,\" Marat has long been noted for physical irregularities. The nature of Marat's debilitating skin disease, in particular, has been an object of ongoing medical interest. In the 19th century Thomas Carlyle alleged that the cause was syphilis, though this is very unlikely as syphilitic rashes are generally neither itchy nor as long-lasting as Marat's skin condition was. Josef E. Jelinek noted that his skin disease was intensely itchy, blistering, began in the perianal region, and was associated with weight loss leading to emaciation. He was sick with it for the three years prior to his assassination, and spent most of this time in his bathtub. There were various minerals and medicines that were present in his bath while he soaked to help ease the pain caused by the disease. A bandana wrapped around his head was soaked in vinegar to reduce the severity of his discomfort. Jelinek's diagnosis is dermatitis herpetiformis.\nTub.\nAfter his death, Marat's wife may have sold his bathtub to her journalist neighbour, as it was included in an inventory of his possessions. The royalist de Saint-Hilaire bought the tub, taking it to Sarzeau, Morbihan in Brittany. His daughter, Capriole de Saint-Hilaire, inherited it when he died in 1805 and she passed it on to the Sarzeau cur\u00e9 when she died in 1862. A journalist for \"Le Figaro\" tracked down the tub in 1885. The cur\u00e9 then discovered that selling the tub could earn money for the parish, yet the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet turned it down because of its lack of provenance as well as its high price. The cur\u00e9 approached Madame Tussaud's waxworks, who agreed to purchase Marat's bathtub for 100,000 francs, but the cur\u00e9's acceptance was lost in the mail. After rejecting other offers, including one from Phineas Barnum, the cur\u00e9 sold the tub for 5,000 francs to the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin, where it remains today. The tub was in the shape of an old-fashioned high-buttoned shoe and had a copper lining.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62187", "revid": "84755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62187", "title": "Bilateria", "text": "Animals with embryonic bilateral symmetry\nBilateria () is a large clade of animals characterised by bilateral symmetry during embryonic development. This means their body plans are laid around a longitudinal axis with a front (or \"head\") and a rear (or \"tail\") end, as well as a left\u2013right\u2013symmetrical belly (ventral) and back (dorsal) surface. Nearly all bilaterians maintain a bilaterally symmetrical body as adults; the most notable exception is the echinoderms, which have pentaradial symmetry as adults, but bilateral symmetry as embryos. With few exceptions, bilaterian embryos are triploblastic, having three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, and have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus. Some bilaterians lack body cavities, while others have a primary body cavity derived from the blastocoel, or a secondary cavity, the coelom. Cephalization is a characteristic feature among most bilaterians, where the sense organs and central nerve ganglia become concentrated at the front end of the animal.\nBilaterians constitute one of the five main lineages of animals, the other four being Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (jellyfish, hydrozoans, sea anemones and corals), Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Placozoa. They rapidly diversified in the late Ediacaran and the Cambrian, and are now by far the most successful animal lineage, with over 98% of known animal species. Bilaterians are traditionally classified as either deuterostomes or protostomes, based on whether the blastopore becomes the anus or mouth. The phylum Xenacoelomorpha, once thought to be flatworms, was erected in 2011, and has provided an extra challenge to bilaterian taxonomy, as they likely do not belong to either group. \nBody plan.\nAnimals with a bilaterally symmetric body plan that mainly move in one direction have a head end (anterior) and a tail (posterior) end as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side. Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Most bilaterians (nephrozoans) have a gut that extends through the body from mouth to anus (sometimes called a \"through gut\"), and sometimes a wormlike body plan with a hydrostatic skeleton. Xenacoelomorphs, on the other hand, have a bag gut with one opening. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells.\nSome bilaterians have only weakly condensed nerve nets (similar to those in cnidarians), while others have either a ventral nerve cord, a dorsal nerve cord, or both (e.g. in Hemichordate).\nEvolution.\nCommon ancestor.\nThe hypothetical most recent common ancestor of all Bilateria is termed the 'urbilaterian'. The nature of this first bilaterian is a matter of debate. One side suggests that acoelomates gave rise to the other groups (planuloid\u2013aceloid hypothesis by Ludwig von Graff, Elie Metchnikoff, Libbie Hyman, or Luitfried von Salvini-Plawen). This means that the urbilaterian had a solid body, and all body cavities therefore secondarily arose later in different groups. The other side poses that the urbilaterian had a coelom, meaning that the main acoelomate phyla (flatworms and gastrotrichs) have secondarily lost their body cavities. \nThis is the Archicoelomata hypothesis first proposed by A. T. Masterman in 1899. Variations of the Archicoelomata hypothesis are the Gastraea by Ernst Haeckel in 1872 or Adam Sedgwick, and more recently the Bilaterogastrea by G\u00f6sta J\u00e4gersten, and the Trochaea by Claus Nielsen.\nOne proposal, by Johanna Taylor Cannon and colleagues, is that the original bilaterian was a bottom dwelling worm with a single body opening, similar to \"Xenoturbella\". An alternative proposal, by Jaume Bagu\u00f1\u00e0 and colleagues, is that it may have resembled the planula larvae of some cnidarians, which unlike the radially-symmetric adults have some bilateral symmetry. However, Lewis I. Held presents evidence that it was segmented, as the mechanism for creating segments is shared between vertebrates (deuterostomes) and arthropods (protostomes).\nBilaterians, presumably including the urbilaterian, share many more Hox genes controlling the development of their more complex bodies, including of their heads, than do the Cnidaria and the Acoelomorpha.\nFossil record.\nThe first evidence of Bilateria in the fossil record comes from trace fossils in Ediacaran sediments, and the first \"bona fide\" bilaterian fossil is \"Kimberella\", dating to https://\u00a0million years ago. Earlier fossils are controversial; the fossil \"Vernanimalcula\" may be the earliest known bilaterian, but may also represent an infilled bubble. Fossil embryos are known from around the time of \"Vernanimalcula\" (https://\u00a0million years ago), but none of these have bilaterian affinities. Burrows believed to have been created by bilaterian life forms have been found in the Tacuar\u00ed Formation of Uruguay, and were believed to be at least 585 million years old. However, more recent evidence shows these fossils are actually late Paleozoic, not Ediacaran.\nPhylogeny.\nThe Bilateria are now by far the most successful animal lineage, with over 98% of known animal species. The group has traditionally been divided into two main lineages or superphyla. The deuterostomes traditionally include the echinoderms, hemichordates, chordates, and the extinct Vetulicolia. The protostomes include most of the rest, such as arthropods, annelids, molluscs, and flatworms. There are several differences, most notably in how the embryo develops. In particular, the first opening of the embryo becomes the mouth in protostomes, and the anus in deuterostomes. Many taxonomists now recognise at least two more superphyla among the protostomes, Ecdysozoa and Spiralia. The arrow worms (Chaetognatha) have proven difficult to classify. Studies published in 2004 and 2017 place them in the Gnathifera.\nThe traditional division of Bilateria into Deuterostomia and Protostomia was challenged when new morphological and molecular evidence supported a sister relationship between the acoelomate taxa, Acoela and Nemertodermatida (together called Acoelomorpha), and the remaining bilaterians. The latter clade was called Nephrozoa by Jondelius et al. (2002) and Eubilateria by Bagu\u00f1a and Riutort (2004). The acoelomorph taxa had previously been considered flatworms with secondarily lost characteristics, but the new relationship suggested that the simple acoelomate worm form was the original bilaterian body plan and that the coelom, the digestive tract, excretory organs, and nerve cords developed in the Nephrozoa. Subsequently, the acoelomorphs were placed in phylum Xenacoelomorpha, together with the xenoturbellids, and the sister relationship between Xenacoelomorpha and Nephrozoa supported in phylogenomic analyses.\nA cladogram for Bilateria under the Nephrozoa hypothesis from a 2014 review by Casey Dunn and colleagues, is shown below. The cladogram indicates approximately when some clades radiated into newer clades, in millions of years ago (Mya). \nA different hypothesis is that Ambulacraria is sister to Xenacoelomorpha, together forming Xenambulacraria. Xenambulacraria may be sister to Chordata or to Centroneuralia (corresponding to Nephrozoa without Ambulacraria, or, as shown here, to Chordata + Protostomia). A 2019 study by Herv\u00e9 Philippe and colleagues presents the tree, cautioning that \"the support values are very low, meaning there is no solid evidence to refute the traditional protostome and deuterostome dichotomy\". As of 2024, the issue of which hypothesis is correct remains unresolved.\nCladogram showing Xenambulacraria hypothesis with a paraphyletic Deuterostomia:\nCladogram showing hypothesis of Xenambulacraria within a monophyletic Deuterostomia:\nTaxonomic history.\nThe Bilateria were named by the Austrian embryologist Berthold Hatschek in 1888. In his classification, the group included the Zygoneura, Ambulacraria, and Chordonii (the Chordata). In 1910, the Austrian zoologist Karl Grobben renamed the Zygoneura to Protostomia, and created the Deuterostomia to encompass the Ambulacraria and Chordonii.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The terrorist movement was particularly active in the final phase of the Algerian War and wanted to prevent Algeria's independence from French colonial rule by all means. The OAS carried out bombings, assassinations, and acts of torture that resulted in over 2,000 deaths. Its motto was \"\" (\"Algeria is French and so will remain\").\nThe OAS was formed from existing networks, calling themselves \"counter-terrorists\", \"self-defence groups\", or \"resistance\", which had carried out attacks on the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and their perceived supporters since early in the war. It was officially formed in Francoist Spain, in Madrid in January 1961, as a response by some French politicians and French military officers to the 8 January 1961 referendum on self-determination concerning Algeria, which had been organised by President de Gaulle.\nBy acts of bombings and targeted assassinations in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, which are estimated to have resulted in 2,000 deaths between April 1961 and April 1962, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. This campaign culminated in a wave of attacks that followed the March 1962 \u00c9vian Accords, which granted independence to Algeria and marked the beginning of the exodus of the \"pieds-noirs\" (ethnic Europeans born in Algeria), and in Jean Bastien-Thiry's 1962 assassination attempt against president de Gaulle in the Paris suburb of Le Petit-Clamart. The existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who supported the FLN was a notable target of their actions.\nThe OAS still has admirers in French nationalist movements. In July 2006, some OAS sympathisers attempted to relight the flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate the Oran massacre on 5 July 1962.\nHistory.\nThe OAS was created in response to the January 1961 referendum on self-determination for Algeria. It was founded in Spain, in January 1961, by former officers, Pierre Lagaillarde (who led the 1960 Siege of Algiers), General Raoul Salan (who took part in the 1961 Algiers putsch or \"Generals' Uprising\") and Jean-Jacques Susini, along with other members of the French Army, including Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac, and former members of the French Foreign Legion from the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954). \"OAS-M\u00e9tro\", the branch in metropolitan France, was led by captain Pierre Sergent. These officers united earlier anti-FLN networks such as the \"Organisation de R\u00e9sistance de L'Alg\u00e9rie Fran\u00e7aise\". While the movement had a broadly anticommunist and authoritarian base, in common with the political outlook of many colonists, it also included many ex-communists and a number of members who saw its struggle in terms of defending fraternal bonds between Algerians and the colonists against the FLN. In France the OAS mainly recruited amongst overtly fascist political groups. In Algeria its makeup was more politically diverse, and included a group of Algerian Jews, led by Jean Ghenassia. Some Algerian OAS members conceived of the conflict in terms of the French Resistance, and in contrast to later Gaullist depictions of the movement, it included a number of former Resistance members in addition to Vichy collaborators.\nResistance against Algerian independence commenced in January 1960, with further violence breaking out in 1961 during the General's Uprising. Daniele Ganser of the ETH Parallel History Project claims that Gladio stay-behind networks, directed by NATO, were involved, but no definitive proof has been found. Both of these insurrections were swiftly suppressed and many of the leaders who had created the OAS were imprisoned.\nBy acts of sabotage and assassination in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. The first victim was Pierre Popie, attorney and president of the People's Republican Movement (\"Mouvement R\u00e9publicain Populaire\", MRP), who stated on TV, \"French Algeria is dead\" (\"L\u2019Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise est morte\"). Roger Gavoury, head of the French police in Algiers, was assassinated at the direction of Roger Degueldre, leader of the OAS Commando Delta, with the actual killing done by Claude Piegts and Albert Dovecar on 31 May 1961. The OAS became notorious for \"stroungas\", attacks using plastic explosives.\nIn October 1961 Pierre Lagaillarde, who had escaped to Francoist Spain following the 1960 barricades week, was arrested in Madrid, along with the Italian activist Guido Giannettini. Franco then exiled him to the Canary Islands.\nThe Delta commandos engaged in indiscriminate killing sprees, on 17 March 1962; against cleaning-ladies on 5 May; on 15 March 1962 against six inspectors of the National Education Ministry, who directed the \"Educative Social Centres\" (\"Centres sociaux \u00e9ducatifs\"), including Mouloud Feraoun, an Algerian writer, etc. It is estimated that the assassinations carried out by the OAS between April 1961 and April 1962 left 2,000 people dead and twice as many wounded.\nThe OAS attempted several times to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle. The most prominent attempt was a 22 August 1962 ambush at Petit-Clamart, a Paris suburb, planned by a military engineer who was not an OAS member, Jean Bastien-Thiry. Bastien-Thiry was executed in March 1963 after de Gaulle refused to grant him amnesty. A fictionalised version of this attack was recreated in the 1971 book by Frederick Forsyth, \"The Day of the Jackal\", and in the 1973 film of the same name.\nThe OAS use of extreme violence created strong opposition from some \"pieds-noirs\" and in mainland France. As a result, the OAS eventually found itself in violent clandestine conflict with not only the FLN but also French secret services and with a Gaullist paramilitary, the \"Mouvement pour la Communaut\u00e9\" (the MPC). Originally a political movement in Algiers, the MPC eventually became a paramilitary force in response to OAS violence. The group obtained valuable information which was routinely passed on to the French secret services, but was eventually destroyed by OAS assassinations.\nMarch 1962 Evian agreements and the struggle of the OAS.\nThe main hope of the OAS was to prove that the FLN was secretly restarting military action after a ceasefire was agreed in the Evian agreements of 19 March 1962 and the referendum of June 1962, so during these three months, the OAS unleashed a new terrorist campaign to force the FLN to abandon the ceasefire. Over 100 bombs a day were detonated by the OAS in March in pursuit of this goal. OAS operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. Dozens of Arab residents were killed at Place du Gouvernement when 24 mortar rounds were fired from the European stronghold of Bab el-Oued. On 21 March, the OAS issued a flyer where they proclaimed that the French military had become an \"occupation force.\" It organized car bombings: 25 killed in Oran on 28 February 1962 and 62 killed in Algiers on 2 May, among others. On 22 March, they took control of Bab el-Oued and attacked French soldiers, killing six of them. The French military then surrounded them and stormed the neighbourhood. The battle killed 15 French soldiers and 20 OAS members, and injured 150 more. On 26 March, the leaders of the OAS proclaimed a general strike in Algiers and called for the European settlers to come to Bab el-Oued in order to break the blockade by military forces loyal to de Gaulle and the Republic. A detachment of \"tirailleurs\" (Muslim troops in the French Army) fired on the demonstrators, killing 54, injuring 140, and traumatising the settlers' population in what is known as the \"gunfight of the Rue d'Isly\". In coincidence with the uprising of Bab-el Oued, 200 OAS \"maquis\" marched from Algiers to Ouarsenis, a mountainous region between Oran and Algiers. They tried to overrun two French military outposts and gain support for local Muslim tribes loyal to France, but instead they were harassed and eventually defeated by Legion units led by Colonel Albert Brothier after several days of fighting. Some clashes between the French army and the OAS involving grenades and mortar fire took place at Oran as late as 10 April. At least one Lieutenant and one Second-Lieutenant were killed by the OAS during the fighting.\nIn April\u00a01962, the OAS leader, Raoul Salan was captured. Despite the OAS bombing campaign, the FLN remained resolute in its agreement to the ceasefire; further, on 17\u00a0June 1962, the OAS also began a ceasefire. The Algerian authority officially guaranteed the security of the remaining Europeans, but in early July\u00a01962 the Oran Massacre occurred; hundreds of armed people came down to European areas of the city, attacking European civilians. The violence lasted several hours, including lynching and acts of torture in public places in all areas of Oran by civilians supported by the ALN\u2014the armed wing of the FLN, at the time evolving into the Algerian Army.\nBy 1963, the main OAS operatives were either dead, in exile, or in prison. Claude Piegts and Albert Dovecar were executed by firing squad on 7\u00a0June 1962, and Roger Degueldre on 6\u00a0July 1962. Jean Bastien-Thiry, who had attempted the Petit-Clamart assassination on de Gaulle, but was not formally a member of the OAS, was also executed, on 11\u00a0March 1963. With the arrest of Gilles Buscia in 1965, the organisation effectively ceased to exist. The jailed OAS members were amnestied by De Gaulle under a July\u00a01968 act. Putschist generals still alive in November 1982 were reintegrated into the Army by another amnesty law: Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, and six other generals benefited from this law.\nLegacy.\nWithin France, the anti-Arab Charles Martel Group, active in the 1970s and 1980s, was formed by OAS veterans. One of the perpetrators of the 1970 Besan\u00e7on courthouse attack was a former OAS member. In November 2016, an extreme right-wing terrorist cell calling itself the \"Organisation d\u2019arm\u00e9es sociales\" (OAS) emerged in France. The acronym was a nod to the original Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te. Inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, the group planned attacks on kebab shops, mosques, drug dealers and politicians, but was dismantled by French authorities in before it was able to accomplish any attacks.\nMany OAS members later took part in various anti-communist struggles around the world. Following the disbandment of the organisation, and the execution of several of its members, the OAS chaplain, Georges Grasset, organised the flight of OAS members, from a route going from Paris to Francoist Spain and finally to Argentina. Grasset arrived in 1962 in Buenos Aires to take charge of the Argentine branch of the Cit\u00e9 Catholique, an integral Catholic group formed by Jean Ousset, the personal secretary of Charles Maurras, as an offshoot of the monarchist \"Action Fran\u00e7aise\". This anti-communist religious organisation was formed of many Algerian war veterans and individuals close to the OAS. Charles Lacheroy and Colonel Trinquier, who theorised the systemic use of torture in counter-insurgency doctrine in \"Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency\" (1961), were members, along with Colonel Jean Gardes, who had first theorised counter-insurgency tactics during the Indochina War (1947\u20131954). Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963, a year after the end of the Algerian War. There, he delivered counterinsurgency courses at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA), which became infamous during the \"Dirty War\" in the 1970s for being used as an internment and torture center. Soon after Gardes met Federico Lucas Roussillon, an Argentine naval lieutenant commander, the cadets at the ESMA were shown the film \"The Battle of Algiers\" (1966) by Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, during which the fictional Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu and his paratroops make systematic use of torture, the block warden system, and death flights.\nThe Argentine admiral Luis Mar\u00eda Mend\u00eda testified in January 2007 that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the \"disappearance\" of the two French nuns, L\u00e9onie Duquet and Alice Domon. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction, but did admit being a former OAS member who escaped to Argentina after the Evian agreements.\nThe memory and mythologization of the OAS remain influential on the European far right to this day, contributing to the shaping of a radical form of Westernism, conceived as the right to the global supremacy of the Western white man over other peoples. During its activity, the OAS brought about an ideological shift within the French far right, transitioning from an extreme nationalism to a form of Westernism that identified the United States as the principal defender of the West against communism, decolonization, and Arab nationalisms. This perspective continues to influence the European far right to this day \nCultural references to the OAS.\nThe OAS is referenced in Ian Fleming's 1963 novel \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". James Bond's future father-in-law Marc-Ange, the head of a Corsican crime faction known as Union Corse, refers to the OAS in chapter 24, due to the OAS having a French military helicopter in their possession. Because of the OAS indebtedness to Marc-Ange and the Union Corse, the helicopter is loaned to the MI-6 \u2013 Marc-Ange/Union Corse coalition endeavoring to thwart Ernst Stavro Blofeld's plot to unleash biological warfare in the UK's agricultural industry.\nThe OAS featured prominently in Jack Higgins' 1964 novel \"Wrath of the Lion\", in which the organization fictionally manages to suborn the crew of a French Navy submarine and use it for missions of revenge.\nAlain Cavalier's 1964 film \"L'Insoumis\" stars Alain Delon as a deserter from the French Foreign Legion who joins the OAS on a kidnapping mission. Cavalier had already addressed the issue in the 1962 film \"Le Combat dans l'\u00eele\", starring Romy Schneider and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Despite not being named its acronym, the movie is set in the context of the campaign of bombings and assassinations by the OAS.\nThe OAS features prominently in the 1971 novel \"The Day of the Jackal\" by Frederick Forsyth, and its film adaptation. The story deals primarily with a fictional assassination plot against Charles de Gaulle, where the organisation hires a British contract killer (the Jackal) to kill de Gaulle. Bastien-Thiry and the Petit-Clamart plot figure prominently in the early sections of the story. \nThe OAS is referenced in the Oliver Stone film \"JFK\", as suspected conspirator Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is alleged to have business connections with them.\nOrganisation.\nChain of command.\nThe secret army was a three-part organisation, each segment having its own action commando squads.\nCommander Pierre Guillaume\naide\ncivilian\nreplacing Gen.

{"id": "62198", "revid": "49180676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62198", "title": "Livermorium", "text": "element with atomic number 116 (Lv)\nLivermorium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It is an extremely radioactive element that has only been created in a laboratory setting and has not been observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, to discover livermorium during experiments conducted between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California, where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Six isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers of 288\u2013293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 80\u00a0milliseconds. A seventh possible isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.\nIn the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, but it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, though it should also show several major differences from them.\nHistory.\nUnsuccessful synthesis attempts.\nThe first search for element 116, using the reaction between 248Cm and 48Ca, was performed in 1977 by Ken Hulet and his team at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). They were unable to detect any atoms of livermorium. Yuri Oganessian and his team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) subsequently attempted the reaction in 1978 and met failure. In 1985, in a joint experiment between Berkeley and Peter Armbruster's team at GSI, the result was again negative, with a calculated cross section limit of 10\u2013100\u00a0pb. Work on reactions with 48Ca, which had proved very useful in the synthesis of nobelium from the natPb+48Ca reaction, nevertheless continued at Dubna, with a superheavy element separator being developed in 1989, a search for target materials and starting of collaborations with LLNL being started in 1990, production of more intense 48Ca beams being started in 1996, and preparations for long-term experiments with 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity being performed in the early 1990s. This work led directly to the production of new isotopes of elements 112 to 118 in the reactions of 48Ca with actinide targets and the discovery of the 5 heaviest elements on the periodic table: flerovium, moscovium, livermorium, tennessine, and oganesson.\nIn 1995, an international team led by Sigurd Hofmann at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany attempted to synthesise element 116 in a radiative capture reaction (in which the compound nucleus de-excites through pure gamma emission without evaporating neutrons) between a lead-208 target and selenium-82 projectiles. No atoms of element 116 were identified.\nUnconfirmed discovery claims.\nIn late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smola\u0144czuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including elements 118 and 116. His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.\nIn 1999, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements 118 and 116, in a paper published in \"Physical Review Letters\", and very soon after the results were reported in \"Science\". The researchers reported to have performed the reaction\nKr + Pb \u2192 Og + \u2192 Lv + \u03b1\nThe following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab itself was unable to duplicate them as well. In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov. The isotope 289Lv was finally discovered in 2024 at the JINR.\nDiscovery.\nLivermorium was first synthesized on July 19, 2000, when scientists at Dubna (JINR) bombarded a curium-248 target with accelerated calcium-48 ions. A single atom was detected, decaying by alpha emission with decay energy 10.54\u00a0MeV to an isotope of flerovium. The results were published in December 2000.\nCm + Ca \u2192 Lv* \u2192 Lv + 3 n \u2192 Fl + \u03b1\nThe daughter flerovium isotope had properties matching those of a flerovium isotope first synthesized in June 1999, which was originally assigned to 288Fl, implying an assignment of the parent livermorium isotope to 292Lv. Later work in December 2002 indicated that the synthesized flerovium isotope was actually 289Fl, and hence the assignment of the synthesized livermorium atom was correspondingly altered to 293Lv.\nRoad to confirmation.\nTwo further atoms were reported by the institute during their second experiment during April\u2013May 2001. In the same experiment they also detected a decay chain which corresponded to the first observed decay of flerovium in December 1998, which had been assigned to 289Fl. No flerovium isotope with the same properties as the one found in December 1998 has ever been observed again, even in repeats of the same reaction. Later it was found that 289Fl has different decay properties and that the first observed flerovium atom may have been its nuclear isomer 289mFl. The observation of 289mFl in this series of experiments may indicate the formation of a parent isomer of livermorium, namely 293mLv, or a rare and previously unobserved decay branch of the already-discovered state 293Lv to 289mFl. Neither possibility is certain, and research is required to positively assign this activity. Another possibility suggested is the assignment of the original December 1998 atom to 290Fl, as the low beam energy used in that original experiment makes the 2n channel plausible; its parent could then conceivably be 294Lv, but this assignment would still need confirmation in the 248Cm(48Ca,2n)294Lv reaction.\nThe team repeated the experiment in April\u2013May 2005 and detected 8 atoms of livermorium. The measured decay data confirmed the assignment of the first-discovered isotope as 293Lv. In this run, the team also observed the isotope 292Lv for the first time. In further experiments from 2004 to 2006, the team replaced the curium-248 target with the lighter curium isotope curium-245. Here evidence was found for the two isotopes 290Lv and 291Lv.\nIn May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party reported on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn. This implied the \"de facto\" discovery of the isotope 291Lv, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000\u20132006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004\u20132006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.\nThe synthesis of livermorium has been separately confirmed at the GSI (2012) and RIKEN (2014 and 2016). In the 2012 GSI experiment, one chain tentatively assigned to 293Lv was shown to be inconsistent with previous data; it is believed that this chain may instead originate from an isomeric state, 293mLv. In the 2016 RIKEN experiment, one atom that may be assigned to 294Lv was seemingly detected, alpha decaying to 290Fl and 286Cn, which underwent spontaneous fission; however, the first alpha from the livermorium nuclide produced was missed, and the assignment to 294Lv is still uncertain though plausible.\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, livermorium is sometimes called \"eka-polonium\". In 1979 IUPAC recommended that the placeholder systematic element name \"ununhexium\" (\"Uuh\") be used until the discovery of the element was confirmed and a name was decided. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it \"element 116\", with the symbol of \"E116\", \"(116)\", or even simply \"116\".\nAccording to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverer or discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name. The discovery of livermorium was recognized by the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC on 1 June 2011, along with that of flerovium. According to the vice-director of JINR, the Dubna team originally wanted to name element 116 \"moscovium\", after the Moscow Oblast in which Dubna is located, but it was later decided to use this name for element 115 instead. The name \"livermorium\" and the symbol \"Lv\" were adopted on May 23, 2012. The name recognises the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, within the city of Livermore, California, US, which collaborated with JINR on the discovery. The city in turn is named after the American rancher Robert Livermore, a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth. The naming ceremony for flerovium and livermorium was held in Moscow on October 24, 2012.\nOther routes of synthesis.\nThe synthesis of livermorium in fusion reactions using projectiles heavier than 48Ca has been explored in preparation for synthesis attempts of the yet-undiscovered element 120, as such reactions would necessarily utilize heavier projectiles. In 2023, the reaction between 238U and 54Cr was studied at the JINR's Superheavy Element Factory in Dubna; one atom of the new isotope 288Lv was reported. More detailed analysis of this reaction was published in 2025, by which time another atom had been reported. Similarly, in 2024, a team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reported the synthesis of two atoms of 290Lv in the reaction between 244Pu and 50Ti. This result was described as \"truly groundbreaking\" by RIKEN director Hiromitsu Haba, whose team plans to search for element 119. The team at JINR studied the reaction between 242Pu and 50Ti in 2024 as a follow-up to the 238U+54Cr, obtaining additional decay data for 288Lv and its decay products (two new chains) and discovering the new isotope 289Lv (three chains).\nPredicted properties.\nOther than nuclear properties, no properties of livermorium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly. Properties of livermorium remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nNuclear stability and isotopes.\nLivermorium is expected to be near an island of stability centered on copernicium (element 112) and flerovium (element 114). Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay. While the known isotopes of livermorium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability, they can be seen to approach the island, as the heavier isotopes are generally the longer-lived ones.\nSuperheavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion. These fusion reactions can be divided into \"hot\" and \"cold\" fusion, depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced. In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets (actinides), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40\u201350\u00a0MeV) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons. In cold fusion reactions (which use heavier projectiles, typically from the fourth period, and lighter targets, usually lead and bismuth), the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10\u201320\u00a0MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state, they require emission of only one or two neutrons. Hot fusion reactions tend to produce more neutron-rich products because the actinides have the highest neutron-to-proton ratios of any elements that can presently be made in macroscopic quantities.\nImportant information could be gained regarding the properties of superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons more or less than the known ones \u2013 286Lv, 287Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium that can be used to make a target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion. The same neutron-deficient isotopes are also reachable in reactions with projectiles heavier than 48Ca, which will be necessary to reach elements beyond atomic number 118 (or possibly 119); this is how 288Lv and 289Lv were discovered.\nThe synthesis of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1\u00a0picobarn, though it is not yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. Alternatively, 294Lv could be produced via charged-particle evaporation in the 251Cf(48Ca,pn) reaction. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, it is predicted that 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200\u00a0years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.\nOther possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently it has been shown that the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258\u2013260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10\u221212 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.\nPhysical and atomic.\nIn the periodic table, livermorium is a member of group 16, the chalcogens. It appears below oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. Every previous chalcogen has six electrons in its valence shell, forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np4. In livermorium's case, the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p4; therefore, livermorium will have some similarities to its lighter congeners. Differences are likely to arise; a large contributing effect is the spin\u2013orbit (SO) interaction\u2014the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to livermorium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect \"tearing\" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number \"l\" from 1 to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20442 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively: the 7p1/2 subshell acts as a second inert pair, though not as inert as the 7s electrons, while the 7p3/2 subshell can easily participate in chemistry. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s7p7p.\nInert pair effects in livermorium should be even stronger than in polonium and hence the +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this is reflected in the expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be attainable. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than polonium (\u03b1-Lv: 12.9\u00a0g/cm3; \u03b1-Po: 9.2\u00a0g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an \u03b1 and a \u03b2 allotrope. The electron of a hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.\nChemical.\nLivermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 in the periodic table, below polonium. While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements, its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium. The group oxidation state of +6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which cannot expand its octet and is one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements. Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum +2 state, exhibited in the fluoride OF2. The +4 state is known for sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur(IV) and selenium(IV) through being the most stable state for tellurium(IV) to being oxidizing in polonium(IV). This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects, especially the inert pair effect. The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be +2, with a rather unstable +4 state. The +2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium, and the +4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands, such as in livermorium(IV) fluoride (LvF4). The +6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons, making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons. The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a \u22122 state as oxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride, and polonide; due to the destabilization of livermorium's 7p3/2 subshell, the \u22122 state should be very unstable for livermorium, whose chemistry should be essentially purely cationic, though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should make Lv2\u2212 slightly less unstable than expected.\nLivermorium hydride (LvH2) would be the heaviest chalcogen hydride and the heaviest homologue of water (the lighter ones are H2S, H2Se, H2Te, and PoH2). Polane (polonium hydride) is a more covalent compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between metal and metalloid and has some nonmetallic properties: it is intermediate between a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride (HCl) and a metal hydride like stannane (SnH4). Livermorane should continue this trend: it should be a hydride rather than a livermoride, but still a covalent molecular compound. Spin-orbit interactions are expected to make the Lv\u2013H bond longer than expected from periodic trends alone, and make the H\u2013Lv\u2013H bond angle larger than expected: this is theorized to be because the unoccupied 8s orbitals are relatively low in energy and can hybridize with the valence 7p orbitals of livermorium. This phenomenon, dubbed \"supervalent hybridization\", has some analogues in non-relativistic regions in the periodic table; for example, molecular calcium difluoride has 4s and 3d involvement from the calcium atom. The heavier livermorium dihalides are predicted to be linear, but the lighter ones are predicted to be bent.\nExperimental chemistry.\nUnambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of livermorium has not yet been established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. The targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850\u00a0\u00b0C through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium, though the short half-lives of all presently known livermorium isotopes means that the element is still inaccessible to experimental chemistry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table.\nOganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element, a member of group 18, and the last member of period 7. Its only known isotope, oganesson-294, is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 0.7 ms and, as of 2025,[ [update]] only five atoms have been successfully produced. This has so far prevented any experimental studies of its chemistry. Because of relativistic effects, theoretical studies predict that it would be a solid at room temperature, and significantly reactive, unlike the other members of group 18 (the noble gases).\nHistory.\nEarly speculation.\nThe possibility of a seventh noble gas, after helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, was considered almost as soon as the noble gas group was discovered. Danish chemist Hans Peter J\u00f8rgen Julius Thomsen predicted in April 1895, the year after the discovery of argon, that there was a whole series of chemically inert gases similar to argon that would bridge the halogen and alkali metal groups: he expected that the seventh of this series would end a 32-element period which contained thorium and uranium and have an atomic weight of 292, close to the 294 now known for the first and only confirmed isotope of oganesson. Danish physicist Niels Bohr noted in 1922 that this seventh noble gas should have atomic number 118 and predicted its electronic structure as 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 8, matching modern predictions. Following this, German chemist Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. It was 107 years from Thomsen's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesized, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon. In a 1975 article, American chemist Kenneth Pitzer suggested that element 118 should be a gas or volatile liquid due to relativistic effects.\nUnconfirmed discovery claims.\nIn late 1998, Polish physicist Robert Smola\u0144czuk published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson. His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make element 118 by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions, and that the fusion probability (cross section) of that reaction would be close to the lead\u2013chromium reaction that had produced element 106, seaborgium. This contradicted predictions that the cross sections for reactions with lead or bismuth targets would go down exponentially as the atomic number of the resulting elements increased.\nIn 1999, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements 118 and 116, in a paper published in \"Physical Review Letters\", and very soon after the results were reported in \"Science\". The researchers reported that they had performed the reaction\n[&lt;noinclude /&gt;[lead-208|Pb]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[krypton-86|Kr]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] \u2192 Og + .\nIn 2001, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab could not duplicate them either. In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author Victor Ninov. Newer experimental results and theoretical predictions have confirmed the exponential decrease in cross sections with lead and bismuth targets as the atomic number of the resulting nuclide increases.\nDiscovery reports.\nThe first genuine decay of atoms of oganesson was observed in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Yuri Oganessian, a Russian nuclear physicist of Armenian ethnicity, the team included American scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The discovery was not announced immediately, because the decay energy of 294Og matched that of 212mPo, a common impurity produced in fusion reactions aimed at producing superheavy elements, and thus announcement was delayed until after a 2005 confirmatory experiment aimed at producing more oganesson atoms. The 2005 experiment used a different beam energy (251\u00a0MeV instead of 245\u00a0MeV) and target thickness (0.34\u00a0mg/cm2 instead of 0.23\u00a0mg/cm2). On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected a total of three (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.\n[&lt;noinclude /&gt;[californium-249|Cf]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[calcium-48|Ca]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] \u2192 [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[oganesson-294|Og]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + 3 .\nIn 2011, IUPAC evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna\u2013Livermore collaboration and concluded: \"The three events reported for the \"Z\" = 118 isotope have very good internal\nredundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery\".\nBecause of the very small fusion reaction probability (the fusion cross section is or ) the experiment took four months and involved a beam dose of calcium ions that had to be shot at the californium target to produce the first recorded event believed to be the synthesis of oganesson. Nevertheless, researchers were highly confident that the results were not a false positive, since the chance that the detections were random events was estimated to be less than one part in .\nIn the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of oganesson was observed. A fourth decay by direct spontaneous fission was also proposed. A half-life of 0.89\u00a0ms was calculated: 294Og decays into 290Lv by alpha decay. Since there were only three nuclei, the half-life derived from observed lifetimes has a large uncertainty: .\nOg \u2192 Lv + [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;]\nThe identification of the 294Og nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus 290Lv directly by means of a bombardment of 245Cm with 48Ca ions,\nCm + Ca \u2192 Lv + 3 ,\nand checking that the 290Lv decay matched the decay chain of the 294Og nuclei. The daughter nucleus 290Lv is very unstable, decaying with a lifetime of 14 milliseconds into 286Fl, which may experience either spontaneous fission or alpha decay into 282Cn, which will undergo spontaneous fission.\nConfirmation.\nIn December 2015, the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned the priority of the discovery to the Dubna\u2013Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of the properties of the granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.\nFrom 1 October 2015 to 6 April 2016, the Dubna team performed a similar experiment with 48Ca projectiles aimed at a mixed-isotope californium target containing 249Cf, 250Cf, and 251Cf, with the aim of producing the heavier oganesson isotopes 295Og and 296Og. Two beam energies at 252\u00a0MeV and 258\u00a0MeV were used. Only one atom was seen at the lower beam energy, whose decay chain fitted the previously known one of 294Og (terminating with spontaneous fission of 286Fl), and none were seen at the higher beam energy. The experiment was then halted, as the glue from the sector frames covered the target and blocked evaporation residues from escaping to the detectors. The production of 293Og and its daughter 289Lv, as well as the even heavier isotope 297Og, is also possible using this reaction. The isotopes 295Og and 296Og may also be produced in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti projectiles. These heavier and likely more stable isotopes may be useful in probing the chemistry of oganesson. A search in 2017 at RIKEN using this reaction was unsuccessful.\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, oganesson is sometimes known as \"eka-radon\" (until the 1960s as \"eka-emanation\", emanation being the old name for radon). In 1979, IUPAC assigned the systematic placeholder name \"ununoctium\" to the undiscovered element, with the corresponding symbol of \"Uuo\", and recommended that it be used until after confirmed discovery of the element. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it \"element 118\", with the symbol of \"E118\", \"(118)\", or simply \"118\".\nBefore the retraction in 2001, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element \"ghiorsium\" (\"Gh\"), after Albert Ghiorso (a leading member of the research team).\nThe Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. According to IUPAC recommendations, the discoverers of a new element have the right to suggest a name. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: \"flyorium\", in honor of Georgy Flyorov, the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and \"moskovium\", in recognition of the Moscow Oblast where Dubna is located. He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flyorov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result. These names were later suggested for element 114 (flerovium) and element 116 (moscovium). Flerovium became the name of element 114; the final name proposed for element 116 was instead \"livermorium\", with \"moscovium\" later being proposed and accepted for element 115 instead.\nTraditionally, the names of all noble gases end in \"-on\", with the exception of helium, which was not known to be a noble gas when discovered. The IUPAC guidelines valid at the moment of the discovery approval however required \"all\" new elements be named with the ending \"-ium\", even if they turned out to be halogens (traditionally ending in \"-ine\") or noble gases (traditionally ending in \"-on\"). While the provisional name ununoctium followed this convention, a new IUPAC recommendation published in 2016 recommended using the \"-on\" ending for new group 18 elements, regardless of whether they turn out to have the chemical properties of a noble gas.\nThe scientists involved in the discovery of element 118, as well as those of 117 and 115, held a conference call on 23 March 2016 to decide their names. Element 118 was the last to be decided upon; after Oganessian was asked to leave the call, the remaining scientists unanimously decided to have the element \"oganesson\" after him. Oganessian was a pioneer in superheavy element research for sixty years reaching back to the field's foundation: his team and his proposed techniques had led directly to the synthesis of elements 107 through 118. Mark Stoyer, a nuclear chemist at the LLNL, later recalled, \"We had intended to propose that name from Livermore, and things kind of got proposed at the same time from multiple places. I don't know if we can claim that we actually proposed the name, but we had intended it.\"\nIn internal discussions, IUPAC asked the JINR if they wanted the element to be spelled \"oganeson\" to match the Russian spelling more closely. Oganessian and the JINR refused this offer, citing the Soviet-era practice of transliterating names into the Latin alphabet under the rules of the French language (\"Oganessian\" is such a transliteration) and arguing that \"oganesson\" would be easier to link to the person.\nIn June 2016, IUPAC announced that the discoverers planned to give the element the name \"oganesson\" (symbol: \"Og\"). The name became official on 28 November 2016. In 2017, Oganessian commented on the naming:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yuri Oganessian\nThe naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\nIn a 2019 interview, when asked what it was like to see his name in the periodic table next to Einstein, Mendeleev, the Curies, and Rutherford, Oganessian responded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not like much! You see, not like much. It is customary in science to name something new after its discoverer. It's just that there are few elements, and this happens rarely. But look at how many equations and theorems in mathematics are named after somebody. And in medicine? Alzheimer, Parkinson. There's nothing special about it.\nCharacteristics.\nOther than nuclear properties, no properties of oganesson or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly. Thus only predictions are available.\nNuclear stability and isotopes.\nThe stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium, element 96, whose most stable isotope, 247Cm, has a half-life four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All nuclides with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives shorter than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than 104 protons should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an island of stability in which nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the superheavy elements (including oganesson) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Oganesson is radioactive, decaying via alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with a half-life that appears to be less than a millisecond. Nonetheless, this is still longer than some predicted values.\nCalculations using a quantum-tunneling model predict the existence of several heavier isotopes of oganesson with alpha-decay half-lives close to 1\u00a0ms.\nTheoretical calculations done on the synthetic pathways for, and the half-life of, other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than the synthesized isotope 294Og, most likely 293Og, 295Og, 296Og, 297Og, 298Og, 300Og and 302Og (the last reaching the \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a0184 shell closure). Of these, 297Og might provide the best chances for obtaining longer-lived nuclei, and thus might become the focus of future work with this element. Some isotopes with many more neutrons, such as some located around 313Og, could also provide longer-lived nuclei. The isotopes from 291Og to 295Og might be produced as daughters of element 120 isotopes that can be reached in the reactions 249\u2013251Cf+50Ti, 245Cm+48Ca, and 248Cm+48Ca.\nIn a quantum-tunneling model, the alpha decay half-life of 294Og was predicted to be with the experimental Q-value published in 2004. Calculation with theoretical Q-values from the macroscopic-microscopic model of Muntian\u2013Hofman\u2013Patyk\u2013Sobiczewski gives somewhat lower but comparable results.\nCalculated atomic and physical properties.\nOganesson is a member of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.\nConsequently, some expect oganesson to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, radon.\nFollowing the periodic trend, oganesson would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury, respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin\u2013orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy, or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level, whereas copernicium and flerovium are predicted to have no electron affinity. Nevertheless, quantum electrodynamic corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the anion Og\u2212 by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in superheavy elements. 2022 calculations expect the electron affinity of oganesson to be 0.080(6)\u00a0eV.\nMonte Carlo simulations of oganesson's molecular dynamics predict it has a melting point of and a boiling point of due to relativistic effects (if these effects are ignored, oganesson would melt at \u2248). Thus oganesson would probably be a solid rather than a gas under standard conditions, though still with a rather low melting point.\nOganesson is expected to have an extremely broad polarizability, almost double that of radon. Because of its tremendous polarizability, oganesson is expected to have an anomalously low first ionization energy of about 860\u00a0kJ/mol, similar to that of cadmium and less than those of iridium, platinum, and gold. This is significantly smaller than the values predicted for darmstadtium, roentgenium, and copernicium, although it is greater than that predicted for flerovium. Its second ionization energy should be around 1560\u00a0kJ/mol. Even the shell structure in the nucleus and electron cloud of oganesson is strongly impacted by relativistic effects: the valence and core electron subshells in oganesson are expected to be \"smeared out\" in a homogeneous Fermi gas of electrons, unlike those of the \"less relativistic\" radon and xenon (although there is some incipient delocalisation in radon), due to the very strong spin\u2013orbit splitting of the 7p orbital in oganesson. A similar effect for nucleons, particularly neutrons, is incipient in the closed-neutron-shell nucleus 302Og and is strongly in force at the hypothetical superheavy closed-shell nucleus 472164, with 164 protons and 308 neutrons. Studies have also predicted that due to increasing electrostatic forces, oganesson may have a semibubble structure in proton density, having few protons at the center of its nucleus. Moreover, spin\u2013orbit effects may cause bulk oganesson to be a semiconductor, with a band gap of \u00a0eV predicted. All the lighter noble gases are insulators instead: for example, the band gap of bulk radon is expected to be \u00a0eV.\nPredicted compounds.\nThe only confirmed isotope of oganesson, 294Og, has much too short a half-life to be chemically investigated experimentally. Therefore, no compounds of oganesson have been synthesized yet. Nevertheless, calculations on theoretical compounds have been performed since 1964. It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, it will be difficult to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for the noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.\nCalculations on the diatomic molecule Og2 showed a bonding interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for Hg2, and a dissociation energy of 6\u00a0kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of Rn2. Most strikingly, it was calculated to have a bond length shorter than in Rn2 by 0.16 \u00c5, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction. On the other hand, the compound OgH+ exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words proton affinity of oganesson) that is smaller than that of RnH+.\nThe bonding between oganesson and hydrogen in OgH is predicted to be very weak and can be regarded as a pure van der Waals interaction rather than a true chemical bond. On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, oganesson seems to form more stable compounds than for example copernicium or flerovium. The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the fluorides OgF2 and OgF4. The +6 state would be less stable due to the strong binding of the 7p1/2 subshell. This is a result of the same spin\u2013orbit interactions that make oganesson unusually reactive. For example, it was shown that the reaction of oganesson with F2 to form the compound OgF2 would release an energy of 106\u00a0kcal/mol of which about 46\u00a0kcal/mol come from these interactions. For comparison, the spin\u2013orbit interaction for the similar molecule RnF2 is about 10\u00a0kcal/mol out of a formation energy of 49\u00a0kcal/mol. The same interaction stabilizes the tetrahedral Td configuration for OgF4, as distinct from the square planar D4h one of XeF4, which RnF4 is also expected to have; this is because OgF4 is expected to have two inert electron pairs (7s and 7p1/2). As such, OgF6 is expected to be unbound, continuing an expected trend in the destabilisation of the +6 oxidation state (RnF6 is likewise expected to be much less stable than XeF6). The Og\u2013F bond will most probably be ionic rather than covalent, rendering the oganesson fluorides non-volatile. OgF2 is predicted to be partially ionic due to oganesson's high electropositivity. Oganesson is predicted to be sufficiently electropositive to form an Og\u2013Cl bond with chlorine.\nA compound of oganesson and tennessine, OgTs4, has been predicted to be potentially stable chemically.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Allen at the United States Navy's Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, some time around October 28, 1943. Allen described an experiment where the U.S. Navy attempted to make a destroyer escort, , disappear and the bizarre results that followed.\nThe story surfaced in late 1955 when Allen sent a book full of hand-written annotations referring to the experiment to a U.S. Navy research organization and, a little later, a series of letters making further claims to a UFO author. Allen's account of the event is widely understood to be a hoax. \nSeveral different\u2014and sometimes contradictory\u2014versions of the alleged experiment have circulated over the years in paranormal literature and popular movies. The U.S. Navy maintains that no such experiment was ever conducted, that the details of the story contradict well-established facts about USS \"Eldridge\", and that the physics the experiment is claimed to be based on are non-existent.\nOrigins of the story.\nThe story of a \"Philadelphia Experiment\" originated in late 1955 when Carl M. Allen sent an anonymous package marked \"Happy Easter\" containing a copy of Morris K. Jessup's book \"The Case for the UFO: Unidentified Flying Objects\" to the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The book was filled with handwritten notes in its margins, written with three different shades of blue ink, appearing to detail a debate among three individuals, only one of whom is given a name: \"Jemi\". They commented on Jessup's ideas about the propulsion for flying saucers, discussed alien races, and expressed concern that Jessup was too close to discovering their technology.\nThe commenters referred to each other as \"Gypsies\", and discussed two different types of \"people\" living in outer space. Their text contained non-standard use of capitalization and punctuation, and detailed a lengthy discussion of the merits of various elements of Jessup's assumptions in the book. There were oblique references to the Philadelphia Experiment (one commenter reassures his fellow annotators who have highlighted a certain theory which Jessup advanced).\nShortly thereafter, in January 1956, Allen began sending a series of letters to Jessup, using his given name as well as \"Carlos Miguel Allende\". The first known letter warned Jessup not to investigate the levitation of unidentified flying objects. Allen put forward a story of dangerous science based on alleged unpublished theories by Albert Einstein. He further claimed a scientist named Franklin Reno put these theories into practice at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1943.\nAllen claimed to have witnessed this experiment while serving aboard the . In Allen's account, a destroyer escort was successfully made invisible, but the ship inexplicably teleported to Norfolk, Virginia, for several minutes, and then reappeared in the Philadelphia yard. The ship's crew was supposed to have suffered various side effects, including insanity, intangibility, and being \"frozen\" in place. When Jessup wrote back requesting more information to corroborate his story, Allen said his memory would have to be recovered and referred Jessup to what seems to be a non-existent Philadelphia newspaper article that Allen claimed covered the incident.\nIn 1957, Jessup was invited to the Office of Naval Research where he was shown the annotated copy of his book. Jessup noticed the handwriting of the annotations resembled the letters he received from Allen. (Twelve years later, Allen would say that he authored all of the annotations in order \"to scare the hell out of Jessup\".)\nTwo officers at ONR, Captain Sidney Sherby and Commander George W. Hoover, took a personal interest in the matter. Hoover later explained that his duties as Special Projects Officer required him to investigate many publications and that he ultimately found nothing of substance to the alleged invisibility experiment. Hoover discussed the annotations with Austin N. Stanton, president of Varo Manufacturing Corporation of Garland, Texas, during meetings about Varo's contract work for ONR.\nStanton became so interested that Varo's office began producing mimeographed copies of Jessup's book with the annotations and Allen's letters, first a dozen and eventually 127 copies. These copies came to be known as the \"Varo edition\". Besides noting handwriting of the individual named \"Jemi\" (addressed as such by the others and using blue-violet ink), the anonymous introduction to the Varo edition concludes that there were two other individuals making annotations, \"Mr. A\" (identified as Allen by Jessup, in blue ink), \"Mr. B\" (in blue-green ink).\nJessup tried to publish more books on the subject of UFOs, but was unsuccessful. He lost his publisher and experienced a succession of downturns in his personal life, and died by suicide in Florida on April 30, 1959.\nThe various book writers who tried to get more information from Carl Allen found his responses elusive, or couldn't find him at all. One reporter from Allen's hometown of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, interviewed his family and was handed a pile of documents and books, all scribbled with Allen's annotations. They described Allen as a \"fantastic mind\", but also a drifter and a \"master leg-puller\".\nRepetitions.\nIn 1965 Vincent Gaddis published a book of Forteana, titled \"Invisible Horizons: True Mysteries of the Sea.\" In it he recounted the story of the experiment from the Varo annotations.\nGeorge E. Simpson and Neal R. Burger published a 1978 novel titled \"Thin Air.\" In this book, set in the present day, a Naval Investigative Service officer investigates several threads linking wartime invisibility experiments to a conspiracy involving matter transmission technology.\nLarge-scale popularization of the story came about in 1979 when the author Charles Berlitz, who had written a best selling book on the Bermuda Triangle, and his co-author, ufologist William L. Moore, published \"The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility,\" which purported to be a factual account. The book expanded on stories of bizarre happenings, lost unified field theories by Albert Einstein, and government coverups, all based on the Allende/Allen letters to Jessup.\nMoore and Berlitz devoted one of the last chapters in \"The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility\" to \"The Force Fields of Townsend Brown\", namely the experimenter and then-U.S. Navy technician Thomas Townsend Brown. Paul LaViolette's 2008 book \"Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion\" also recounts some mysterious involvement of Townsend Brown.\nThe story was adapted into a 1984 time travel film called \"The Philadelphia Experiment\", directed by Stewart Raffill. Though only loosely based on the prior accounts of the \"Experiment\", it served to dramatize the core elements of the original story. In 1989, Alfred Bielek claimed to have been aboard USS \"Eldridge\" during the Experiment. Addressing the MUFON Conference in 1990, Bielek asserted that Raffill's film was largely consistent with the events he claimed to have witnessed in 1943. Bielek would later add details to his claims on radio talk shows, conferences, and the Internet.\n\"Note: Several different, and sometimes contradictory, versions of the alleged experiment have circulated over the years. The following synopsis recounts key story points common to most accounts.\"\nGeneral synopsis.\nThe experiment was allegedly based on an aspect of some unified field theory, a term coined by Albert Einstein to describe a class of potential theories; such theories would aim to describe\u00a0\u2014 mathematically and physically\u00a0\u2014 the interrelated nature of the forces of electromagnetism and gravity.\nAccording to some accounts, unspecified \"researchers\" thought that a theory of this type would enable using large electrical generators to bend light around an object via refraction, so that the object became completely invisible. The Navy regarded this as of military value and it sponsored the experiment.\nAnother unattributed version of the story proposes that researchers were preparing magnetic and gravitational measurements of the seafloor to detect anomalies, supposedly based on Einstein's attempts to understand gravity. In this version, there were also related secret experiments in Nazi Germany to find anti-gravity, allegedly led by SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Hans Kammler.\nThere are no reliable or attributed accounts, but in most accounts of the supposed experiment, USS \"Eldridge\" was fitted with the required equipment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Testing began in the summer of 1943, and it was supposedly successful to a limited extent. One test resulted in \"Eldridge\" being rendered nearly invisible with some witnesses reporting a \"greenish fog\" appearing in its place. Crew members complained of severe nausea afterwards.\nAllegedly, when the ship reappeared some sailors were embedded in the metal structures of the ship, including one sailor who ended up on a deck level below where he began and had his hand embedded in the steel hull of the ship as well as some sailors who went \"completely bananas\". There is also a claim the experiment was altered after that point at the request of the Navy, limiting it to creating a stealth technology that would render USS \"Eldridge\" invisible to radar. None of these allegations have been independently substantiated.\nOther versions of the story give the date of the experiment as October 28, 1943. In this version, \"Eldridge\" not only became invisible, but disappeared from the area and teleported to Norfolk, Virginia, over away. It is claimed that \"Eldridge\" sat for some time in view of men aboard the ship , whereupon \"Eldridge\" vanished and then reappeared in Philadelphia at the site it had originally occupied.\nMany versions of the tale include descriptions of serious side effects for the crew. Some crew members were said to have been physically fused to bulkheads while others suffered from mental disorders, some re-materialized inside out, and still others vanished. It is also claimed that the ship's crew may have been subjected to brainwashing to maintain the secrecy of the experiment.\nEvidence and research.\nThe historian Mike Dash notes that many authors who publicized the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" story after that of Jessup appeared to have conducted little or no research of their own. Through the late 1970s, for example, Allende/Allen was often described as mysterious and difficult to locate, but Goerman determined Allende/Allen's identity after only a few telephone calls.\nOthers speculate that much of the key literature emphasizes dramatic embellishment rather than pertinent research. Berlitz's and Moore's account of the story (\"The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility\") claimed to include factual information, such as transcripts of an interview with a scientist involved in the experiment, but their work has also been criticized for plagiarizing key story elements from the novel \"Thin Air\" which was published a year earlier.\nMisunderstanding of documented naval experiments.\nPersonnel at the Fourth Naval District have suggested that the alleged event was a misunderstanding of routine research during World War II at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. One theory is that \"the foundation for the apocryphal stories arose from degaussing experiments which have the effect of making a ship undetectable or 'invisible' to magnetic mines.\" Another possible origin of the stories about levitation, teleportation, and effects on human crew might be attributed to experiments with the generating plant of the destroyer , wherein a higher-frequency generator produced corona discharges, although none of the crew reported suffering effects from the experiment.\nObservers have argued that it is inappropriate to grant credence to an unusual story promoted by one individual in the absence of corroborating evidence. Robert Goerman wrote in \"Fate\" magazine in 1980, that \"Carlos Allende\"/\"Carl Allen\", who is said to have corresponded with Jessup, was Carl Meredith Allen of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, who had an established history of psychiatric illness and who may have fabricated the primary history of the experiment as a result of his mental illness. Goerman later realized that Allen was a family friend and \"a creative and imaginative loner\u00a0... sending bizarre writings and claims\".\nTimeline inconsistencies.\nUSS \"Eldridge\" was not commissioned until August 27, 1943, and it remained in port in New York City until September 1943. The October experiment allegedly took place while the ship was on its first shakedown cruise in the Bahamas, which conspiracy theorists try to explain away by claiming that the ship's logs might have been falsified or else still be classified. Conspiracy theorists also attempt to explain away the inconsistency by claiming that was actually used rather than USS \"Eldridge\" as USS \"Hammann\" arrived in the shipyard on October 20, 1943, ignoring the \"eyewitness statements\" from Carl M. Allen which launched the hoax in the first place.\nThe Office of Naval Research (ONR) stated in September 1996, \"ONR has never conducted investigations on radar invisibility, either in 1943 or at any other time.\" Pointing out that the ONR was not established until 1946, it denounces the accounts of \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" as complete \"science fiction\".\nA reunion of Navy veterans who had served aboard USS \"Eldridge\" told a Philadelphia newspaper in April 1999 that their ship had never made port in Philadelphia. Further evidence discounting the Philadelphia Experiment timeline comes from USS \"Eldridge\u2019s\" complete World War II action report, including the remarks section of the 1943 deck log, available on microfilm.\nAlternative explanations.\nResearcher Jacques Vall\u00e9e describes a procedure on board , which was docked alongside the \"Eldridge\" in 1943. The operation involved the generation of a powerful electromagnetic field on board the ship in order to deperm or degauss it, with the goal of rendering the ship undetectable or \"invisible\" to magnetically fused undersea mines and torpedoes. This system was invented by a Canadian, Charles F. Goodeve, when he held the rank of commander in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, and the Royal Navy and other navies used it widely during World War II.\nBritish ships of the era often included such degaussing systems built into the upper decks (the conduits are still visible on the deck of in London, for example). Degaussing is still used today. However, it has no effect on visible light or radar. Vall\u00e9e speculates that accounts of USS \"Engstrom's\" degaussing might have been garbled and confabulated in subsequent retellings, and that these accounts may have influenced the story of \"The Philadelphia Experiment\".\nVall\u00e9e cites a veteran who served on board USS \"Engstrom\" and who suggests it might have traveled from Philadelphia to Norfolk and back again in a single day at a time when merchant ships could not, by use of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal and Chesapeake Bay, which at the time was open only to naval vessels. Use of that channel was kept quiet: German submarines had ravaged shipping along the East Coast during Operation Drumbeat, and thus military ships unable to protect themselves were secretly moved via canals to avoid the threat.\nThe same veteran claims to be the man that Allende witnessed \"disappearing\" at a bar. He claims that when a fight broke out, friendly barmaids whisked him out of the bar before the police arrived, because he was under age for drinking. They then covered for him by claiming that he had disappeared.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He previously served as the 24th vice president under President H\u00e9ctor Trujillo from 1957 to 1960.\nHis enigmatic, secretive personality was inherited from the Trujillo era, as well as his desire to perpetuate himself in power through dubious elections and state terrorism, and he was considered to be a \"caudillo\". His regime of terror claimed 11,000 victims who were either tortured or forcibly disappeared and killed. Nevertheless, Balaguer was also considered to be instrumental in the liberalization of the Dominican government, and his time as leader of the Dominican Republic saw major changes such as legalized political activities, surprise army promotions and demotions, promoting health and education improvements and instituting modest land reforms.\nEarly life and introduction to politics.\nBalaguer was born on 1 September 1906 in Navarrete, later named Villa Bison\u00f3 in the Santiago Province in the northwestern corner of the Dominican Republic. His father was Joaqu\u00edn Jes\u00fas Balaguer Lespier, a Spaniard native of Catalan and French ancestry born in Puerto Rico, and his mother was Carmen Celia Ricardo Heureaux, daughter of Manuel de Jesus Ricardo and Rosa Amelia Heureaux (of French descent), who was also a half-cousin of President Ulises Heureaux. Balaguer was the only son in a family of several daughters.\nFrom a very early age, Balaguer felt an attraction to literature, composing verses that were published in local magazines even when he was very young. He was taught by Santiago-born educator and feminist writer Rosa Smester Marrero; in his memoirs, Balaguer recalled Smester's great influence on his intellectual formation.\nAfter graduating from school, Balaguer earned a law degree from the University of Santo Domingo (UASD) and studied for a brief period at the University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne. As a youth, Balaguer wrote of the awe with which he was struck by his father's fellow countryman, the Harvard graduate and political leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu. Despite the profound differences regarding their ethical and world visions, Albizu's fiery and charismatic rhetoric captured Balaguer's imagination and his recollection of this occasion was a harbinger of his passion for politics and intellectual debate.\nBalaguer's political career began in 1930 (before Rafael Trujillo took control of the government) when he was appointed Attorney in the Court of Properties. In later years, he served as Secretary of the Dominican Legation in Madrid (1932\u20131935), Undersecretary of the Presidency (1936), Undersecretary of Foreign Relations (1937), Extraordinary Ambassador to Colombia and Ecuador (1940\u20131943 and 1943\u20131947), Ambassador to Mexico (1947\u20131949), Secretary of Education (1949\u20131955), and Secretary of State of Foreign Relations (1953\u20131956).\nVice presidency and first presidency (1957\u20131962).\nWhen Trujillo arranged to have his brother H\u00e9ctor re-elected to the presidency in 1957, he chose Balaguer as vice president. Three years later, when pressure from the Organization of American States (OAS) convinced Rafael that it was inappropriate to have a member of his family as president, Trujillo forced his brother to resign, and Balaguer succeeded to the post.\nThe situation was dramatically altered, however, when Trujillo was assassinated in May 1961. Balaguer initially remained president, with the real power held by Trujillo's son, Ramfis. They initially took steps to liberalize the regime, granting some civil liberties and easing Trujillo's tight censorship of the press. \nMeanwhile, he revoked the nonaggression pact made with Cuba in January 1961. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a populace who had no memory of the instability and poverty that preceded Trujillo, and wanted more freedom and a more equitable distribution of wealth. At the same time, Ramfis' reforms went too far for the hard-line \"trujillistas\" led by his own uncles, H\u00e9ctor and Jos\u00e9 Arismendi Trujillo. As the OAS continued economic sanctions imposed for Trujillo's attempted murder of Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, Ramfis warned that the country could descend into civil war between left and right.\nAlthough official and unofficial repression of the opposition parties (the Dominican Revolutionary Party and National Civic Union, as well as the communist Dominican Popular Movement) continued, Balaguer publicly condemned this repression and in September he pledged to form a coalition government. Hector and Jose Trujillo left the country in October but the opposition parties demanded Ramfis withdraw from the government as well. At the end of October, Ramfis announced that he would resign if the OAS agreed to lift the economic sanctions. The OAS agreed on November 14 but Ramfis' uncles returned to the country the following day, hoping to lead a military coup. Ramfis resigned and went into exile on November 17 and rumours circulated that Air Force general Fernando Arturo S\u00e1nchez Otero would support pro-Castro revolutionaries. The United States now sent a small fleet of ships and 1,800 marines to patrol Dominican waters. The US consul informed Balaguer that these forces stood ready to intervene at his request, and would be supported by forces from Venezuela and Colombia. Air Force general Pedro Rafael Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Echavarr\u00eda announced his support for Balaguer and bombed pro-Trujillo forces. The Trujillo brothers again fled the country on November 20 and Echavarr\u00eda became Secretary of Armed Forces.\nThe Union Civica Nacional (UCN) called a national strike and demanded the formation of a provisional government under their leader, Viriato Fiallo, with elections to be delayed until 1964. The military were vehemently against the UCN taking power and Echaverr\u00eda proposed a continuation of the Balaguer regime until the elections. The American consul mediated between the two sides and in January 1962 final agreement led to the creation of a seven-member Council of State, led by Balaguer but including members of the UCN, to replace both the Dominican Congress and the President and his cabinet until the election. The OAS finally lifted sanctions against the country upon the formation of the council. However, popular unrest against Balaguer continued and many saw Echaverr\u00eda as positioning himself to seize power. Military forces opened fire on demonstrators on 14 January which led to rioting the following day. On 16 January, Balaguer resigned and Echaverr\u00eda staged a military coup d'\u00e9tat and arrested the other members of the council. With the US supporting the UCN and a new national strike beginning immediately, Echaverr\u00eda was arrested by other officers two days later. The Council of State was restored under the leadership of Rafael Bonnelly and Balaguer went into exile in New York and Puerto Rico.\nJuan Bosch was elected president in 1962 in the country's first free election. He only held office for seven months, from February 1963 to September 1963, when he was overthrown in a military coup. The country then began a tumultuous period which by 24 April 1965 saw the start of the Dominican Civil War. Military officers had revolted against the provisional Junta to restore Bosch, whereupon U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, under the pretext of eliminating Communist influence in the Caribbean, sent 42,000 U.S. troops to defeat the revolt in Operation Power Pack, on 28 April. The provisional government, headed by H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda-Godoy, announced general elections for 1966. Balaguer seized his chance once he had the backing of the United States government, and returned to the Dominican Republic with the purpose of destroying the popular groups that had participated in the rebellions of 1965. He formed the Reformist Party and entered the presidential race against Bosch, campaigning as a moderate conservative advocating gradual and orderly reforms. He quickly gained the support of the establishment and easily defeated Bosch, who ran a somewhat muted campaign out of fear of military retribution.\n\"The Twelve Years\" (1966\u20131978).\nAfter taking office on 1 July, Balaguer found a nation severely beaten by decades of turbulence, with few short times of peace, and virtually ignorant of democracy and human rights. He sought to pacify the enmities surviving from the Trujillo regime and from the 1965 civil war, but political murders continued to be frequent during his administration. He succeeded in partially rehabilitating the public finances, which were in a chaotic state, and pushed through a modest program of economic development. He was easily reelected in 1970 against fragmented opposition and won again in 1974 after changing the voting rules in a way that led the opposition to boycott the race.\nDuring his years as president (known popularly in Dominican politics as simply \"the twelve years\"), Balaguer ordered the construction of schools, hospitals, dams, roads, and many important buildings. He also presided over steady economic growth, funded public housing, opened public schools, and expanded education during his term. Additionally, over 300 politicians became millionaires during his presidency. However, his administration soon developed a distinct authoritarian cast, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. Political opponents were jailed and sometimes killed (by one estimate, 3,000 people with center-left leanings were murdered), and opposition newspapers were occasionally seized. Despite his authoritarian methods, Balaguer had far less power than Trujillo, and his rule was considerably milder.\nDefeat and return to power.\nIn 1978, Balaguer sought another term. Inflation was on the rise, and the great majority of the people had gotten little benefit from the economic boom of the past decade. Balaguer faced Antonio Guzm\u00e1n, a wealthy rancher running under the banner of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. When election returns showed an unmistakable trend in Guzm\u00e1n's favor, the military stopped the count. However, amid vigorous protests at home and strong pressure abroad, the count resumed. Guzm\u00e1n won, marking the first defeat of Balaguer's political career. When he left office that year, it marked the first time in the Dominican Republic's history that an incumbent president peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.\nIn the 1982 elections, the PRD's Salvador Jorge Blanco defeated Balaguer, who had merged his party with the Social Christian Revolutionary Party to form the Social Christian Reformist Party two years earlier.\nBalaguer ran again in the 1986 elections, and took advantage of a split in the PRD and an unpopular austerity program to win the presidency again after an eight-year absence. By that time, he was 80 years old and almost completely blind after living with glaucoma for many years.\nThird presidency (1986\u20131996).\nBalaguer's third presidency was considerably more liberal than the \"Twelve Years\" had been. He was more tolerant of opposition parties and human rights.\nHe undertook massive infrastructure projects, such as the construction of highways, bridges, schools, housing projects and hospitals. Following the style of Trujillo, these highly visible projects were much publicized over government-controlled media and through grandiose public ceremonies designed to enhance Balaguer's popularity. The projects were also used as a means to reward his political supporters with lucrative public works contracts. The economy also improved considerably.\nBalaguer was narrowly reelected in the elections of 1990, defeating his old foe Juan Bosch by only 22,000 votes out of 1.9 million votes cast amid charges of fraud.\nFor the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing in the Americas and the visit of Pope John Paul II, Balaguer spent millions on a restoration of parts of historic, colonial Santo Domingo, and on sprucing up the parts of the city to be transversed by the pope, including the construction of a grand new avenue lined with modern housing blocks.\nMore controversial was that Balaguer spent two hundred million US dollars on the construction of a massive ten-story Columbus Lighthouse. Completed in 1992, the Columbus Lighthouse was designed to beam the image of a Christian cross into the night sky and to be visible for tens of miles. Since completion, the Columbus Lighthouse, which supposedly houses Columbus's remains, has been a minor tourist attraction. Its light has almost never been used due to extremely high energy costs and frequent blackouts in the country. In the 1994 elections, Balaguer decided to run again for the presidency, even though he was almost 90 years old and completely blind. This time, his most prominent opponent was Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez of the PRD.\nThe campaign was one of the nastiest in Dominican history. Balaguer frequently played up Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez' Haitian ancestry to his advantage. Balaguer claimed that Pe\u00f1a would try to merge the country with Haiti if elected. When the returns were announced, Balaguer was announced as the winner by only 30,000 votes. However, many PRD supporters showed up to vote only to discover their names had vanished from the rolls. Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez declared fraud and called a general strike. Demonstrations took place in support of the strike.\nAn investigation later revealed that the electoral board did not know the total number of registered voters, and the voting lists distributed at polling stations did not match those given to the parties. The investigation also revealed that about 200,000 people had been removed from the polls. Amid such questions about the poll's legitimacy, Balaguer agreed to hold new elections in 1996\u2014in which he would not be a candidate. It would be the first presidential election since 1966 in which Balaguer's name did not appear on the ballot.\nIn the 1996 elections, Balaguer's vice president, Jacinto Peynado, finished well short of making it to the runoff. Balaguer then threw his support to the Dominican Liberation Party's Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez in an unusual coalition with Bosch, his political foe of over 30 years.\nDeath and legacy.\nIn 2000, Balaguer sought the presidency yet again. Although by this time he could not walk without assistance, he nonetheless plunged into the campaign, well aware that his large reservoir of supporters could mean the difference in the election. He won around 23% of the votes in the election, with PLD candidate Danilo Medina just barely nosing him out for a spot in the runoff with PRD candidate Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda, who came just a few thousand votes short of outright victory. Balaguer stated that he himself personally accepted Mej\u00eda's election, but hinted that his supporters would split their votes between Mej\u00eda and Medina in the runoff. Medina would have needed nearly all of Balaguer's supporters to cross over to him in order to have any realistic chance of overcoming a 25-point deficit in the first round. When it was apparent Medina would not get nearly enough support from Balaguer's voters to have a chance at victory, he pulled out of the runoff, handing the presidency to Mej\u00eda.\nHe died of heart failure on July 14, 2002 at Santo Domingo's Abreu Clinic at the age of 95.\nHe was a polarizing figure who could incite as much hate as love from the population. Despite his image as a standard Latin American caudillo, Balaguer at the same time developed a legacy as a great reformer. His land reform policies were praised for successfully distributing land to peasants and earned him support from the country's rural population.\nRonald Reagan said \"[...] Balaguer has been a driving force throughout his country's democratic development. In 1966 he led democracy's return to the Dominican Republic after years of political uncertainty and turmoil. Indeed, he is, in many ways, the father of Dominican democracy.\" Jimmy Carter said \"President Balaguer has set an example for all leaders in this nation in changing his own country and his own people away from a former totalitarian government to one of increasingly pure democracy.\"\nA metro station in Santo Domingo is named after him.\nHe is one of the central characters in Mario Vargas Llosa's novel \"The Feast of the Goat\".\nBibliography.\nBalaguer was a prolific author, who wrote many books for contemporary Dominican literature. His most famous work was his only narrative novel, called \"\"Los Carpinteros\".\" The most controversial of his works is perhaps \"Memorias de un Cortesano en la Era de Trujillo\", in which Balaguer, shielded by his political power admitted knowing the truth about the death of the revolutionary journalist Orlando Mart\u00ednez. Balaguer left a blank page in the middle of the book to be filled in at the time of his death.\nBalaguer explored several branches of literature. As a thorough researcher, he published many biographical books still used as reference, along with compilations and analysis of Dominican folk poets. As a poet, he was mostly of Post-Romantic influence, and his style remained strictly unchanged along his long career. Other themes, despite the sorrow expressed, are mostly noble: and idyllic view of nature, nostalgia, and memoirs of the past.\nHis total list of literary works is as follows:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62207", "revid": "17328627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62207", "title": "Martha's Vineyard", "text": "Island south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, U.S.\nMartha's Vineyard, often simply called the Vineyard, is an island in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, lying just south of Cape Cod. It is known for being a popular, affluent summer colony, and includes the smaller peninsula Chappaquiddick Island. It is the 58th largest island in the U.S., with a land area of about , and the third-largest on the East Coast, after Long Island and Mount Desert Island. Martha's Vineyard constitutes the bulk of Dukes County, Massachusetts, which also includes the Elizabeth Islands and the island of Nomans Land.\nThe island's year-round population has considerably increased since the 1960s. In the 2023 Martha's Vineyard Commission report, the year-round population was 20,530, an increase from 16,460 in 2010. The summer population swells to more than 200,000 people. About 56 percent of the Vineyard's 14,621 homes are seasonally occupied. \nA study by the Martha's Vineyard Commission in 2006 found that the cost of living on the island is 60 percent higher than the national average, and housing prices are 96 percent higher. A study of housing needs by the Commission found that the average weekly wage on Martha's Vineyard was \"71 percent of the state average, the median home price was 54 percent above the state's and the median rent exceeded the state's by 17 percent,\" all leading to a stark example of severe income inequalities between year-round residents and their seasonal counterparts.\nThough many have suggested that the island was renamed after English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold's daughter Martha, it is more likely that both the island and his daughter were namesakes of his wealthy mother-in-law, Martha (Judde) Golding, who partly funded his expedition in 1602\u00a0\u2013 the first recorded European expedition to Cape Cod. A smaller island to the south was first to be named \"Martha's Vineyard\" but this later became associated with this island. It is the eighth-oldest surviving English place-name in the United States. The island was subsequently known as \"Martin's Vineyard\" (possibly after a captain in the exploratory party, John Martin); many people and maps up to the 18th century called it by this name.\nWhen the United States Board on Geographic Names worked to standardize placename spellings in the late 19th century, apostrophes were dropped. Thus for a time Martha's Vineyard was officially named \"Marthas Vineyard\", but the Board reversed its decision in the early 20th century, making Martha's Vineyard one of the five placenames in the United States that takes a possessive apostrophe.\nAccording to historian Henry Franklin Norton, the island was known by Native Americans as Noepe or Capawock. It is referred to in the 1691 Massachusetts Charter (which transferred the island from the Province of New York during the breakup of the Dominion of New England) as Cappawock.\nHistory.\nPre-European settlement.\nThe island was originally inhabited by Wampanoag people, when Martha's Vineyard was known in the Massachusett language as \"Noepe\", or \"land amid the streams\". In 1642, the Wampanoag numbered somewhere around 3,000 on the island. By 1764, that number had dropped to 313.\nColonial era.\n European settlement began with the purchase of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands by Thomas Mayhew of Watertown, Massachusetts, from two New England settlers. He had friendly relations with the Wampanoags on the island, in part because he was careful to honor their land rights. His son, also named Thomas Mayhew, established the first settlement on the island in 1642 at Great Harbor (later Edgartown, Massachusetts).\nThe younger Mayhew began a relationship with Hiacoomes, a Native American neighbor, which eventually led to Hiacoomes' family converting to Christianity. During King Philip's War later in the century, the Martha's Vineyard band did not join their tribal relatives in the uprising and remained armed, a testimony to the good relations cultivated by the Mayhews as the leaders of the colony.\nIn 1657, the younger Thomas Mayhew was drowned when a ship he was travelling in was lost at sea on a voyage to England. Mayhew's grandsons Matthew Mayhew (1648\u2013), John Mayhew (1652\u2013), and other members of his family assisted him in running his business and government. In 1665, Mayhew's lands were included in a grant to the Duke of York. In 1671, a settlement was arranged which allowed Mayhew to continue in his position while placing his territory under the jurisdiction of the Province of New York. \nAttempted annexation by Rhode Island (1684).\nIn 1682, Matthew Mayhew succeeded his grandfather as Governor and Chief Magistrate, and occasionally preached to the Native Americans. He was also appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas for Dukes county in 1697, and remained on the bench until 1700. He was judge of probate from 1696 to 1710. In 1683, Dukes County, New York was incorporated, including Martha's Vineyard. In 1691, at the collapse of rule by Sir Edmund Andros and the reorganization of Massachusetts as a royal colony, Dukes County was transferred to the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and split into the county of Dukes County, Massachusetts and Nantucket County, Massachusetts.Following the revocation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony Charter in 1684, William Coddington Jr., who was governor of Rhode Island at the time, attempted to seize Martha's Vineyard through a group of militia as \"reparations for former damages of past leaders made by the settlers,\" most likely referring to the Puritan actions on Rhode Island leaders Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, as well as annex threats made by Massachusetts. It is possible that Coddington only wanted to annex Martha's Vineyard due to its proximity to Rhode Island and the fact that it would have taken more labor for colonists in Massachusetts to reach Martha's Vineyard before Rhode Island could obtain full control of the island. The plan flopped: on the week that was taken to go to the island, Rhode Island militiamen were deployed in a group of three boats and \"upon seeing men on Martha's Vineyard, the men immediately fled the vicinity of the island and returned home after The Governor dispatched them from their duties and made the plan defunct\". There is still wide debate as to who told leaders from Massachusetts about the plan. One story has prevailed, that a traveler going to and from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for business purposes heard the claim and reported it back to officials in Massachusetts. Massachusetts, specifically Martha's Vineyard, was not intimidated by this attempt and thought Rhode Island to be weaker because of their immediate retreat.\nAs for the history following the attempted annexation, Native American literacy in the schools founded by Thomas Mayhew Jr. and taught by Peter Folger (the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin) was such that the first Native American graduates of Harvard were from Martha's Vineyard, including the son of Hiacoomes, Joel Hiacoomes. \"The ship Joel Hiacoomes was sailing on, as he was returning to Boston from a trip home shortly before the graduation ceremonies, was found wrecked on the shores of Nantucket Island. Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk, the son of a sachem of Homes Hole, did graduate from Harvard in the class of 1665.\" Cheeshahteaumauk's Latin address to the corporation (New England Corporation), which begins \"Honoratissimi benefactores\" (most honored benefactors), has been preserved. In addition to speaking Wampanoag and English, they studied Hebrew, classical Greek, and Latin. All of the early Native American graduates died shortly after completing their course of study. Many native preachers on the island, however, also preached in the Christian churches from time to time.\nMayhew's successor as leader of the community was the Hon. Leavitt Thaxter, who married Martha Mayhew, a descendant of Thomas Mayhew, and was an Edgartown educator described by Indian Commissioner John Milton Earle as \"a long and steadfast friend to the Indians.\" After living in Northampton, Thaxter, a lawyer, returned home to Edgartown, where he took over the school founded by his father, Rev. Joseph Thaxter, and served in the State House and the Senate, was a member of the Massachusetts Governor's Council, and later served as U. S. Customs Collector for Martha's Vineyard. Having rechristened his father's Edgartown school Thaxter Academy, on February 15, 1845, Thaxter was granted the sum of $50 per year for \"the support of William Johnson, an Indian of the Chappequiddic tribe.\" By this time, Leavitt Thaxter had taken on the role, described in an act passed by the General Court of Massachusetts, as \"guardian of the Indians and people of color resident at Chappequiddic and Indiantown in the County of Dukes County.\" Thaxter Academy, founded by Leavitt Thaxter as first principal in 1825, became known for educating both white and Native American youth.\n19th century.\nLike the nearby island of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard was brought to prominence in the 19th century by the whaling industry, during which ships were sent around the world to hunt whales for their oil and blubber. The discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania gave rise to a cheaper source of oil for lamps and led to an almost complete collapse of the industry by 1870. After the Old Colony railroad came to mainland Woods Hole in 1872, summer residences began to develop on the island, such as the community of Harthaven established by William H. Hart, and later, the community of Ocean Heights, developed near Sengekontacket Pond in Edgartown by the prominent island businessman, Robert Marsden Laidlaw. Although the island struggled financially through the Great Depression, its reputation as a resort for tourists and the wealthy continued to grow. There is still a substantial Wampanoag population on the Vineyard, mainly located in the town of Aquinnah. Aquinnah means \"land under the hill\" in the Wampanoag language.\nThe island was the last refuge of the heath hen, an extinct subspecies of the greater prairie chicken, which was a once common game bird throughout the Northeastern United States. Despite 19th century efforts to protect the hen, by 1927, the population of birds had dropped to 13. The last known heath hen, named \"Booming Ben\", perished on Martha's Vineyard in 1932.\nModern era.\nMartha's Vineyard was used by the Army, Navy and Air Force from 1941 through 1945 for training missions that ranged from landings on beaches to climbing cliffs and bombing practice.\nThe linguist William Labov wrote his master's thesis on changes in the Martha's Vineyard dialect of English. The 1963 study is widely recognized as a seminal work in the foundation of sociolinguistics.\nThe island received international notoriety after the \"Chappaquiddick incident\" of July 18, 1969, in which Mary Jo Kopechne was killed in a car driven off the Dike Bridge by U.S. Senator Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy. The bridge crossed Poucha Pond on Chappaquiddick Island (a smaller island formerly connected to the Vineyard and part of Edgartown). The bridge was intended for people on foot and bicycles, as well as the occasional emergency vehicle when conditions warranted. Currently, 4\u00d74 vehicles with passes are allowed to cross the reconstructed bridge.\nOn November 23, 1970, in the Atlantic Ocean just west of Aquinnah, Simas Kudirka, a Soviet seaman of Lithuanian nationality, attempted to defect to the United States by leaping onto a United States Coast Guard cutter from a Soviet fishing trawler and asking for asylum. The Coast Guard allowed a detachment of four seamen from the Soviet ship to board the cutter and \"drag the kicking, screaming Kudirka back to their vessel.\" He was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in the Soviet Union.\nIn 1974, Steven Spielberg filmed the movie \"Jaws\" on Martha's Vineyard, most notably in the fishing village of Menemsha and the town of Chilmark. Spielberg selected island natives Christopher Rebello as Chief Brody's oldest son, Michael Brody; Jay Mello as the younger son, Sean Brody; and Lee Fierro as Mrs. Kintner. Scores of other island natives appeared in the film as extras. Later, scenes from \"Jaws 2\" and \"\" were filmed on the island, as well. In June 2005 the island celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"Jaws\" with a weekend-long Jawsfest.\nIn 1977, distressed over losing their guaranteed seat in the Massachusetts General Court, inhabitants of Martha's Vineyard considered the possibility of secession from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, either to become part of another state (having received offers from both Vermont and Hawaii), reincorporating as a separate U.S. territory, or as the nation's 51st state. The separatist flag, consisting of a white seagull over an orange disk on a sky-blue background, is still seen on the island today. Although the idea of separation from Massachusetts eventually proved impracticable, it did receive attention in the local, regional, and even national media.\nOn March 5, 1982, John Belushi died of a drug overdose in Los Angeles, California, and was buried four days later in Abel's Hill Cemetery in Chilmark. Belushi often visited the Vineyard and his family felt it fitting to bury him there. On his gravestone is the quote: \"Though I may be gone, Rock 'N' Roll lives on.\" Because of the many visitors to his grave and the threat of vandalism, his body was moved somewhere near the grave site. His grave remains a popular site for visitors to Chilmark and they often leave tokens in memory of the late comedian.\nSince the 1990s, Bill Clinton has spent regular vacation time on the island during and after his presidency, along with his wife, Hillary Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea. Clinton was not the first president to visit the islands; Ulysses S. Grant visited the vacation residence of his friend, Bishop Gilbert Haven on August 24, 1874. As a coincidental footnote in history, Bishop Haven's gingerbread cottage was located in Oak Bluffs at 10 Clinton Avenue. The avenue was named in 1851 and was designated as the main promenade of the Martha's Vineyard Campmeeting Association campgrounds. In December 2019, President Barack Obama completed the purchase of a homestead on the Edgartown Great Pond.\nOn July 16, 1999, a small plane crashed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, claiming the lives of pilot John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her sister Lauren Bessette. Kennedy's mother, former U.S. first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, maintained a home in Aquinnah (formerly \"Gay Head\") until her death in 1994.\nIn the summer of 2000, an outbreak of tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, resulted in one death and piqued the interest of the CDC, which wanted to test the island as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized \"Francisella tularensis\". Over the following summers, Martha's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing. The research could prove valuable in preventing bioterrorism. In the television show \"The X-Files\", Fox Mulder's parents live on the island, and it was also the setting for Robert Harris' 2007 novel \"The Ghost\".\nIn September 2022, Florida governor Ron DeSantis flew two planeloads of Venezuelan migrants to Martha's Vineyard in an effort to draw attention to what Republican governors consider \"the Biden administration's failed border policies\". Some observers criticized DeSantis because the migrants were flown there unannounced. For nearly two days, island residents provided clothing, food, toys, toiletries, and temporary shelter, before removing the migrants from the island.\nAfrican American history on Martha's Vineyard.\nPeople were bought, sold, and probated as property on Martha's Vineyard. In 1700, Reverend Samuel Sewall, a seasonal resident of Martha's Vineyard, was one of the first to publicly oppose slavery in the New England Colonies. In 1646, magistrates in Massachusetts ruled that two Africans who had been enslaved and imported be returned to their native country. In 1652, Rhode Island passed a law abolishing slavery and ordering that Africans be freed after a term of 10 years, just like indentured servants. In addition to that, \"at no time during its history did people of color lose the right to use the courts to challenge their status. Nor did they lose the right to inherit property in certain circumstances.\"\nOn October 15, 2020, Edgartown Harbor was officially recognized as an Underground Railroad Site by the National Park Service. This recognition was given after a submission from a nonprofit corporation, the African American Heritage Trail of Martha's Vineyard. The corporation was founded in 1998 by Martha's Vineyard NAACP vice president Carrie Camillo Tankard and teacher Elaine Cawley Weintraub. Their mission is to \"continue to research and publish previously undocumented history and to involve the Island community in the identification and celebration of the contributions made by people of color to the island of Martha's Vineyard.\" The trail consists of 31 sites all marked by a descriptive plaque.\nHereditary deafness and sign language.\nMartha's Vineyard became known as an \"everyone signs\" community after three centuries of an unusually high level of hereditary deafness caused Martha's Vineyard to be labeled a \"deaf utopia\". The island's deaf heritage cannot be traced to one common ancestor and is thought to have originated in the Weald, a region that overlaps the borders of the English counties of Kent and Sussex, prior to immigration. Researcher Nora Groce estimates that by the late 19th century, one in 155 people on the Vineyard was born deaf (0.7 percent) \u2014 about 37 times the estimate for the nation at large (1 in 5,728, or 0.02 percent) \u2014 because of a \"recessive pattern\" of genetic deafness, circulated through endogamous marriage patterns.\nDeaf Vineyarders generally earned an average or above-average income (proved by tax records) and they participated in church affairs with passion. The deafness on the island affected both females and males in approximately the same percentage. In the late 19th century, the mixed marriages between deaf and hearing spouses comprised 65 percent of all deaf marriages on the island, as compared to the rate of 20 percent deaf-hearing marriage in the mainland. The sign language used by Vineyarders is called Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), and it is different from American Sign Language (ASL). However, the geographical, time, and population proximities state that MVSL and ASL are impossible to develop in complete isolation from each other. MVSL was commonly used by hearing residents as well as deaf ones until the middle of the 20th century. No language barrier created a smooth communication environment for all the residents of the island.\nIn the 20th century, tourism became a mainstay in the island economy, and new tourism-related jobs appeared. However, jobs in tourism were not as deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been. Consequently, as intermarriage and further migration joined the people of Martha's Vineyard to the mainland, the island community more and more resembled the oral community there. The last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952, but a few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, the climate of the island borders between a humid continental climate (\"Dfa\"/\"Dfb\"), a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"), and an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"), the latter a climate type rarely found on the east coast of North America. Martha's Vineyard's climate is highly influenced by the surrounding Atlantic Ocean, which moderates temperatures throughout the year, although this moderation is nowhere near as strong as on opposite sides of the Atlantic (Porto, Portugal) or the Pacific coast of the United States (Crescent City) at similar latitudes.\nAs a result, winter temperatures tend to be a few degrees warmer while summer temperatures tend to be cooler than inland locations. Winters are cool to cold with a January average of just slightly below . Owing to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, temperatures below are rare, occurring at one day per year, with most days during the winter months rising above freezing. The average annual snowfall is . Summers are warm and mild with temperatures rarely exceeding , with only one or two days reaching or exceeding it. During the summer months, the island's warmest months (July and August) average around \nSpring and fall are transition seasons with spring being cooler than fall. The highest daily maximum temperature was on August 27, 1948, and the highest daily minimum temperature was on September 4, 2010. The lowest daily maximum temperature was on December 26, 1980, and the lowest daily minimum temperature was on February 2 and 3, 1961. Martha's Vineyard receives of precipitation per year, which is evenly distributed throughout the year. The hardiness zone is 7a in the central and most of the western areas of the main island and 7b on the east end including Chappaquiddick and the southwest end.\nTowns.\nMartha's Vineyard is divided into six towns. Each town is governed by a Board of Selectmen elected by town voters in each of the towns, along with annual and periodic town meetings. Each town is also a member of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, which regulates island-wide building, environmental, and aesthetic concerns.\nSome government programs on the island\u2014such as the public school system, emergency management, and waste management\u2014have been regionalized. There is a growing push for further regionalization areas of law enforcement, water treatment, and possible government regionalization.\nEach town also follows certain regulations from Dukes County. The towns are:\nThe three \"Down-Island\" towns of Edgartown, Tisbury, and Oak Bluffs are \"wet\" towns\u2014serving alcohol. West Tisbury and Aquinnah are \"soggy\" towns that serve only beer and wine, and Chilmark is a \"dry\" town.\nTransportation.\nWater.\nMartha's Vineyard is accessible via ferry. The Steamship Authority operates year-round ferry service from Woods Hole, Massachusetts. This is the only ferry that can transport vehicles to and from the island. Seasonal ferry services depart from Falmouth, Hyannis, and New Bedford in Massachusetts, North Kingstown in Rhode Island, and limited service from New York City to New Jersey.\nAir.\nMartha's Vineyard Airport (MVY) is the main airport on the island. Cape Air provides year-round service to and from Boston and New York City. Seasonal destinations include Hyannis, New Bedford, Nantucket, White Plains, New York, Washington-Reagan, New York-LaGuardia, Philadelphia and Charlotte. JetBlue, Delta, American Airlines, and Elite Airways operate seasonal flights from New York City and Boston.\nMass transit.\nThe Martha's Vineyard Transit Authority (VTA) provides year-round bus service throughout Martha's Vineyard.\nHistoric.\nIn the era before modern highways and jet planes, travelers took New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad trains from New York City or Boston to Woods Hole or Hyannis, at which point they would embark on ferries to the island.\nEducation.\nMartha's Vineyard is served by Martha's Vineyard Public Schools:\nThe six towns of Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Tisbury, West Tisbury, Chilmark, and Aquinnah are each served by local K\u20138 or K\u20135 schools (Aquinnah and Chilmark are split between Chilmark for elementary and West Tisbury for middle school), and all feed into the regional high school. Additionally, the K\u201312 public charter school in West Tisbury is open to students from any town on the island.\nTourism and culture.\nDuring the whaling era, wealthy Boston sea captains and merchant traders often created estates on Martha's Vineyard with their trading profits. Today, the Vineyard has become one of the Northeastern United States' most prominent summering havens, having attracted numerous celebrity regulars.\nThe island now has a year-round population of about 20,530 people in six towns; in summer, the population increases to 200,000 residents, with more than 25,000 additional short-term visitors coming and going on the ferries during the summer season. The most crowded weekend is July 4, followed by the late-August weekend of the Agricultural Fair. In general, the summer season runs from June through Labor Day weekend, coinciding with the months most American children are not in school.\nIn 1985, the two islands of Martha's Vineyard and Chappaquiddick Island were included in a new American Viticultural Area designation for wine appellation of origin specification: Martha's Vineyard AVA. Wines produced from grapes grown on the two islands can be sold with labels that carry the Martha's Vineyard AVA designation. Martha's Vineyard was the home to the winemaker Chicama Vineyards in West Tisbury, though it closed after 37 years on August 10, 2008.\nOther popular attractions include the annual Grand Illumination in Oak Bluffs;\nthe Martha's Vineyard Film Center, an arthouse cinema which is run by the non-profit Martha's Vineyard Film Society, and which screens independent and world cinema all year long; the historic Capawock and Strand theatres, also run by the Martha's Vineyard Film Society, \nthe Martha's Vineyard Film Festival, which runs a winter film festival in March, a Summer Film Series and Cinema Circus every Wednesday in July and August, the Martha's Vineyard African-American Film Festival, which showcases the works of independent and established African-American filmmakers in August, and\nMartha's Vineyard International Film Festival in September;\nthe Farm Institute at Katama Farm in Edgartown;\nand the Flying Horses Carousel in Oak Bluffs, the oldest operating platform carousel in the United States.\nAcross the Edgartown Vineyard Haven Road from the Martha's Vineyard Regional High School in the town of Oak Bluffs, the Martha's Vineyard Skatepark is a concrete skatepark open to the public, offering a range of ramps and obstacles.\nIsland life and residents.\nIts relatively small year-round population has led to a very activist citizenry who are highly involved in the island's day-to-day activities. Tourism, overdevelopment, politics, and environmentalism are of keen interest to the community. Keeping the balance between the much needed tourist economy and the ecology and wildlife of the island is of paramount importance to residents. In contrast to the seasonal influx of wealthy visitors, Dukes County remains one of the poorest in the state. Residents have established resources to balance the contradictions and stresses that can arise in these circumstances, notably the Martha's Vineyard Commission and Martha's Vineyard Community Services, founded by the late Dr. Milton Mazer, author of \"People and Predicaments: Of Life and Distress on Martha's Vineyard\".\nThe majority of the Vineyard's residents during the summer are well-established seasonal vacationers. While many of these come from all over the United States and abroad, the island tends to be a destination for especially those whose primary residence lies within close proximity in the Northeastern U.S. Many communities around the island tend to have deep family roots on the island that have matured over the years to create hamlets of good friends and neighbors. Nevertheless, many visitors are summer renters and weekenders, for whom the island is simply a \"home away from home\".\nMartha's Vineyard has also been or is home to a number of artists and musicians, including Albert Alcalay, Evan Dando, Tim \"Johnny Vegas\" Burton of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Livingston Taylor, Kate Taylor, Alex Taylor, Tom Rush, Rick Marotta, Geoff Muldaur, Maria Muldaur, Willy Mason, Unbusted and Mike Nichols. Historian and author David McCullough was also an island resident, as was author Susan Branch and the young-adult books authors Judy Blume and Norman Bridwell, and crime/political intrigue novelists Richard North Patterson and Linda Fairstein. Late authors Shel Silverstein and William Styron also lived on the Vineyard, as did writer, journalist and teacher John Hersey, poet and novelist Dorothy West and artist Thomas Hart Benton. Various writers have been inspired by the island\u2014including the mystery writer Philip R. Craig who set several novels on the island. On a related note, Martha's Vineyard Poet Laureate, Lee H. McCormack, has written many poems about the island. The Academy Award-winning Patricia Neal owned a home on South Water St in Edgartown, and James Cagney, Lillian Hellman (who is buried in Abel's Hill Cemetery near the site of Belushi's grave), and Katharine Cornell all found the Vineyard an exciting, rewarding place to live. In addition, the famous \"Life\" magazine photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt was a fifty-year summer resident of the Vineyard until his death in 1995. Since 2006 the Australian-born author Geraldine Brooks, writer of the Pulitzer Prize winning novel \"March\", has lived there with her husband, Tony Horwitz, himself a Pulitzer Prize winner and successful novelist, and their two sons.\nBrooks wrote a book of historical fiction \"Caleb's Crossing\" in which Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck is the title character and depicts early colonial settlement of Martha's Vineyard.\nOther well-known celebrities who live on or have regularly visited the island: Harlem Renaissance artist Lois Mailou Jones; former president Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; former U.S. President Barack Obama; comedian and talk show host David Letterman; Bill Murray; Tony Shalhoub; Quincy Jones; Ted Danson and wife Mary Steenburgen; Larry David; the Farrelly brothers; Meg Ryan; and Chelsea Handler. Mike Wallace of \"60 Minutes\" was a summer resident of Martha's Vineyard. Late anchorman Walter Cronkite was a prominent summer resident as well. Other regularly appearing celebrities include film writer/director Spike Lee, attorney Alan Dershowitz, comedians Dan Aykroyd and James Belushi, politico Vernon Jordan, television news reporter Diane Sawyer, fashion designer Kenneth Cole, former Ambassador and President of the Metropolitan Museum of Art William H. Luers, and Charlayne Hunter-Gault. Despite popular perceptions of the Vineyard as \"Hollywood East\", the island is very low-key and quiet; celebrities go to the Vineyard to enjoy the atmosphere, and not to be seen. Locals tend to be protective of celebrity privacy, though recent coverage of celebrity sightings (most notably in the two local newspapers on the Island) has begun to erode that respect for privacy through more frequent reporting on celebrity sightings and famous visitors. In August 2014, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton planned to have overlapping visits to the island, where the presence of security details that create traffic challenges is becoming an annual affair.\nMany of the country's most affluent African-American families have enjoyed a century-old tradition of summering on the island. Concentrated primarily in and around the town of Oak Bluffs, and the East Chop area, these families have historically represented the black elite from Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City. Today, affluent families from around the country have taken to the Vineyard, and the community is known as a popular summer destination for judges, physicians, business executives, surgeons, attorneys, writers, politicians, and professors. The historic presence of African-American residents in Oak Bluffs resulted in its Town Beach being pejoratively called \"The Inkwell\", a nickname which was reappropriated as an emblem of pride. \"The Inkwell\" (1994), directed by Matty Rich, dealt with this close-knit Vineyard community. The Run&amp;Shoot Filmworks Martha's Vineyard African-American Film Festival, held every second week in August, highlights the works of independent and established filmmakers from across the globe. This annual event draws attendees from all across the world.\nSince the 19th century, the island has had a sizable community of Portuguese-Americans, concentrated primarily in the three down-Island towns of Oak Bluffs, Tisbury, and Edgartown; they have traditionally worked alongside other island residents in whaling and fishing. It also has a large community of Brazilian immigrants who work mainly in the maintenance of the island's vacation facilities.\nThe island's permanent residents were profiled in a London \"Telegraph\" article showing \"the dark side of Martha's Vineyard\". In the same month an article titled \"Edgartown's Darker Side\" appeared in the \"Boston Globe\" detailing the extremely poor working conditions suffered by Irish and Serbian students in a newly built private members club in Edgartown. Concerns over munitions that may be buried on Martha's Vineyard, most from World War II, have led to an 8.1 million dollar project to remove and rebuild part of a privately owned barrier beach off the Tisbury Great Pond.\nThe year-round working population of Martha's Vineyard earns 30 percent less on average than other residents of the state while keeping up with a cost of living that is 60 percent higher than average. Many people are moving to more affordable areas. Schools have seen a successive drop in enrollment over the past few years. Typically home to artists, musicians, and other creative types, the Island has many residents who manage by working several jobs in the summer and taking some time off in the winter. The lack of affordable housing on the island has forced many families to move off-island.\nMany high-profile residents, movie stars, politicians, writers, and artists contribute to fundraisers and benefits that raise awareness of the fragile ecosystem of the Vineyard and support community organizations and services. The largest of these is the annual Possible Dreams Auction.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nOver-the-air.\nTelevision broadcasts are available using varied methods from nearby broadcast markets. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a founder and president of the David Horowitz Freedom Center (DHFC); editor of the Center's website \"FrontPage Magazine\"; and director of Discover the Networks, a website that tracks individuals and groups on the political left. Horowitz also founded the organization Students for Academic Freedom.\nHorowitz wrote several books with author Peter Collier, including four on prominent 20th-century American families. He and Collier collaborated on books about cultural criticism. Horowitz worked as a columnist for \"Salon\".\nFrom 1956 to 1975, Horowitz was an outspoken adherent of the New Left. He later rejected progressive ideas and became a defender of neoconservatism. Horowitz recounted his ideological journey in a series of retrospective books, culminating with his 1996 memoir \"Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey\".\nEarly life and education.\nBorn on January 10, 1939 in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, a borough of New York City, Horowitz was the son of Jewish high school teachers Phil and Blanche Horowitz. His father taught English and his mother taught stenography. His mother's family emigrated from Imperial Russia in the mid-19th century, and his father's family left Russia in 1905 during a time of anti-Jewish pogroms. Horowitz's paternal grandfather lived in Mozir, a city in modern Belarus, prior to leaving for the U.S. In 1940, the family moved to the Long Island City section of Queens.\nDuring years of labor organizing and the Great Depression, Phil and Blanche Horowitz were long-standing members of the Communist Party of the United States of America and strong supporters of Joseph Stalin. They left the party after Nikita Khrushchev published his report in 1956 about Stalin's crimes and his terrorism against the Soviet population.\nHorowitz received a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University in 1959, majoring in English, and a master's degree in English literature at University of California, Berkeley in 1961.\nCareer.\nNew Left.\nAfter completing his graduate degree, Horowitz lived in London during the mid-1960s and worked for the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation. He identified as a Marxist intellectual.\nIn 1966, Ralph Schoenman persuaded Bertrand Russell to convene his war crimes tribunal to judge United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Horowitz would write three decades later that he had political reservations about the tribunal and did not take part. He described the tribunal's judges as formidable, world-famous and radical. They included Isaac Deutscher, Jean-Paul Sartre, Stokely Carmichael, Simone de Beauvoir, Vladimir Dedijer and James Baldwin. In January 1966, Horowitz, along with members of the Trotskyist International Marxist Group, formed the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign. The Vietnam Solidarity Campaign organized a series of protests in London against British support for the Vietnam War.\nWhile in London, Horowitz became a close friend of Deutscher, and wrote a biography of him. Horowitz wrote \"The Free World Colossus: A Critique of American Foreign Policy in the Cold War\". In January 1968, Horowitz returned to the United States, where he became co-editor of the New Left magazine \"Ramparts\", settling in northern California.\nDuring the early 1970s, Horowitz developed a close friendship with Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party. Horowitz later portrayed Newton as equal parts gangster, terrorist, intellectual and media celebrity. As part of their work together, Horowitz helped raise money for, and assisted the Panthers with, the running of a school for poor children in Oakland. He recommended that Newton hire Betty Van Patter as bookkeeper; she was then working for \"Ramparts\". In December 1974, Van Patter's battered, decomposed body was found on a beach in San Francisco Bay; she had been murdered. It is widely believed that the Panthers were responsible for her murder, a belief also held by Horowitz.\nIn 1976, Horowitz was a \"founding sponsor\" of James Weinstein's magazine \"In These Times\".\nRightward evolution.\nFollowing this period, Horowitz rejected Marx and socialism, but kept quiet about his changing politics for nearly a decade.\nIn early 1985, Horowitz and Collier, who also became a political conservative, wrote an article for \"The Washington Post Magazine\" titled \"Lefties for Reagan\", later retitled as \"Goodbye to All That\". The article explained their change of views and recent decision to vote for a second term for Republican President Ronald Reagan. In 1986, Horowitz published \"Why I Am No Longer a Leftist\" in \"The Village Voice\".\nIn 1987, Horowitz co-hosted a \"Second Thoughts Conference\" in Washington, D.C., described by Sidney Blumenthal in \"The Washington Post\" as his \"coming out\" as a conservative.\nIn May 1989, Horowitz, Ronald Radosh, and Collier attended a conference in Krak\u00f3w calling for the end of Communism. After marching with Polish dissidents in an anti-regime protest, Horowitz spoke about his changing thoughts and why he believed that socialism could not create their future. He said his dream was for the people of Poland to be free.\nIn 1992, Horowitz and Collier founded \"Heterodoxy,\" a monthly magazine focused on exposing what it described as excessive political correctness on United States college and university campuses. It was \"meant to have the feel of a samizdat publication inside the gulag of the PC [politically correct] university\". The tabloid was directed at university students, whom Horowitz viewed as indoctrinated by the entrenched Left. In \"Radical Son\", he wrote that universities were no longer effective in presenting both sides of political arguments. He stated that left-wing professors had created an atmosphere of political \"terror\" on campuses.\nIn 2005, Horowitz launched Discover the Networks.\nHorowitz appeared in \"Occupy Unmasked\", a 2012 documentary portraying the Occupy Wall Street movement as a sinister organization formed to violently destroy the American government.\nAcademic Bill of Rights.\nIn the early 21st century, Horowitz concentrated on issues of academic freedom, attempting to protect conservative viewpoints. He, Eli Lehrer and Andrew Jones published a pamphlet, \"Political Bias in the Administrations and Faculties of 32 Elite Colleges and Universities\" (2004), in which they find the ratio of Democrats to Republicans at 32 schools to be more than 10 to 1. Horowitz's book, \"\" (2006), criticized individual professors for, as he alleges, engaging in indoctrination rather than a disinterested pursuit of knowledge.\nHorowitz published an Academic Bill of Rights (ABR), which he proposes to eliminate political bias in university hiring and grading. He says conservatives, and particularly Republican Party members, are systematically excluded from faculties, citing statistical studies on faculty party affiliation. In 2004 the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution on a 41\u20135 vote to adopt a version of the ABR for state educational institutions. In Pennsylvania, the House of Representatives created a special legislative committee to investigate issues of academic freedom, including whether students who hold unpopular views need more protection.\nDavid Horowitz Freedom Center.\nIn 1998 Horowitz and Peter Collier founded the \"David Horowitz Freedom Center.\" \"Politico\" states that Horowitz's activities and DHFC are funded in part by Aubrey and Joyce Chernick and The Bradley Foundation. Politico stated that during 2008\u20132010, \"the lion's share of the $920,000 it [DHFC] provided over the past three years to Jihad Watch came from [Joyce] Chernick\". Between July 2000 and February 2006 the freedom center provided a total of $43,000 in funding for 25 trips taken by Republican senators and representatives including Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell, Bob Barr, Fred Thompson and others. In 2015, Horowitz made $583,000 (~$ in 2024) from the organization.\nHorowitz was the editor of the Center's website \"FrontPage Magazine\". It has been described by scholars and writers as right-wing, far-right, Islamophobic, and anti-Islam.\nPolitical positions.\nHorowitz was a former Marxist, but was later described as being conservative.\nHorowitz wrote against United States intervention in the Kosovo War, arguing that it was unnecessary and harmful to United States interests, but supported the interventionist foreign policy associated with the Bush Doctrine, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He also wrote critically of libertarian anti-war views.\nHorowitz opposed Barack Obama, illegal immigration, gun control, and Islam. He endorsed Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\nHorowitz described himself as \"a defender of gays and 'alternative lifestyles', a moderate on abortion, and a civil rights activist\".\nRace.\nDuring his time in the New Left, Horowitz supported the civil rights movement. In the 1970s, he came to believe that the Black Panthers were involved in the death of his friend Betty Van Patter, souring the relationship between Horowitz and the Black Panthers.\nIn a 2001 column in \"Salon\" he described his opposition to reparations for slavery, calling it racism against blacks, as it defined them only in terms of their descent from slaves. He argued that applying labels like \"descendants of slaves\" to blacks was damaging and would serve to segregate them from mainstream society. In the same year during Black History Month, Horowitz attempted to purchase advertising space in several American university student publications to express his opposition to reparations. Many student papers refused to sell him ad space; at some schools, papers that carried his ads were stolen or destroyed. Joan Walsh said the furor had given Horowitz an overwhelming amount of free publicity.\nIn 2018, Horowitz attracted many critical comments by attacking the Equal Justice Initiative's new National Memorial for Peace and Justice, calling it \"a real racist project\" showing \"anti-white racism\". \"Lynchings were bad but they weren't mainly about whites yanking blacks off the streets and stringing them up\". \"A third of the victims of lynchings were white. How many of them do you think this memorial features [\"sic\"].\"\nCriticism of Islam and Arab cultures.\nHorowitz was critical of Palestinians, claiming that their goal is to wipe out Jews from the Middle East. \u201cNo people have shown themselves as so morally sick as the Palestinians,\u201d he said at Brooklyn College in 2011.\nHorowitz published a 2007 piece in the Columbia University student newspaper, saying that, according to public opinion polls, \"150 million out of 750 million Muslims support a holy war against Christians, Jews, and other Muslims.\" Speaking at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in February 2010, Horowitz compared Islamists to Nazis, saying: \"Islamists are worse than the Nazis, because even the Nazis did not tell the world that they want to exterminate the Jews.\"\nHorowitz created a campaign for what he called \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week\" in parody of multicultural awareness activities. He helped arrange for leading critics of radical Islam to speak at more than a hundred college campuses in October 2007. As a speaker, he was repeatedly met with intense hostility.\nIn 2008, while speaking at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), Horowitz criticized Arab culture, saying that it was rife with antisemitism. He referred to the Palestinian keffiyeh, a traditional Arab head covering that became associated with PLO leader Yasser Arafat, as a \u201csymbol of terrorism\u201d. In response, UCSB professor Walid Afifi said that Horowitz was \"preaching hate\" and smearing Arab culture.\nHorowitz used university student publications and lectures at universities as venues for publishing controversial advertisements or lecturing on issues related to Islamic student and other organizations. In April 2008, DHFC advertised in the \"Daily Nexus,\" the UCSB school newspaper, saying that the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) had links with the Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda, and Hamas. The next month, Horowitz, speaking at UCSB, said that MSA supports \"a second Holocaust of the Jews\". The MSA responded that they were a peaceful organization and not a political group. The MSA's faculty adviser said the group had \"been involved in interfaith activities with Jewish student groups, and they've been involved in charity work for national disaster relief.\" Horowitz ran the ad in \"The GW Hatchet\", the student newspaper of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Jake Sherman, the \"Hatchet\"'s editor-in-chief, said claims the MSA was radical were \"ludicrous\".\nHe became an early user of the question \"Do you condemn Hamas?\" which he directed to a Muslim student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) on May 11, 2010. The student was a member of UCSD's Muslim Student Association, then holding Justice in Palestine Week, which students said Horowitz had referred to as \"Hitler Youth Week\". In 2017, Horowitz's Freedom Center targeted pro-Palestinian professors and students.\nIn a 2011 review of anti-Islamic activists in the US, the Southern Poverty Law Center identified Horowitz as one of ten people in the United States' \"Anti-Muslim Inner Circle\". He was also described as \"the godfather of the anti-Muslim movement\", and as \"possibly the number one counter-jihad personality\", financing many other groups through his organization.\nIn 2017 Horowitz's center put up posters on university campuses naming students and professors who support Palestinian rights, with the names taken from the anonymous doxxing group Canary Mission.\nResponses to Horowitz's views.\nSome Horowitz accounts of U.S. colleges and universities as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed. For example, Horowitz alleged that a University of Northern Colorado student received a failing grade on a final exam for refusing to write an essay arguing that George W. Bush is a war criminal. A spokeswoman for the university said that the test question was not as described by Horowitz and that there were nonpolitical reasons for the grade, which was not an F. Horowitz identified the professor as Robert Dunkley, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Northern Colorado. Dunkley said Horowitz made him an example of \"liberal bias\" in academia and yet, \"Dunkley said that he comes from a Republican family, is a registered Republican and considers himself politically independent, taking pride in never having voted a straight party ticket\".\nIn another instance, Horowitz said a Pennsylvania State University biology professor showed his students the film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" just before the 2004 election in an attempt to influence their votes. Pressed by \"Inside Higher Ed\", Horowitz said that the claim was hearsay from a \"legislative staffer\" and that he had no proof it happened.\nHorowitz's books, particularly \",\" were criticized by scholars such as Todd Gitlin. The group \"Free Exchange on Campus\" issued a 50-page report in May 2006 in which they take issue with many of the books' assertions: they identify specific factual errors, unsubstantiated assertions and quotations that appear to be either in error or taken out of context.\nChip Berlet, writing for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), accused Horowitz's Center for the Study of Popular Culture of being one of 17 \"right-wing foundations and think tanks support[ing] efforts to make bigoted and discredited ideas respectable.\" Berlet accused Horowitz of blaming slavery on \"black Africans ... abetted by dark-skinned Arabs\" and of \"attack[ing] minority 'demands for special treatment' as 'only necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others\".\nPersonal life.\nHorowitz was married four times. He married Elissa Krauthamer, in a Yonkers, New York, synagogue on June 14, 1959. They had four children together: Jonathan Daniel, Ben, Sarah Rose (deceased) and Anne. Sarah died in March 2008 at age 44 from Turner syndrome-related heart complications. She had been a teacher, writer and human rights activist. She is the subject of Horowitz's 2009 book, \"A Cracking of the Heart.\"\nHorowitz's son, Ben, is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder, along with Marc Andreessen, of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\nHorowitz's second marriage in 1984, to Sam Moorman, ended in divorce within less than a year. On June 24, 1990, Horowitz married Shay Marlowe in an Orthodox Jewish ceremony. They divorced.\nHorowitz's fourth and final marriage was to April Mullvain. The couple met in the mid-1990s, and married two years later. He and April lived in horse country northwest of Los Angeles, where she rescues abused horses and provides equine educational programs.\nHorowitz, in 2015, described himself as an agnostic.\nHorowitz died from cancer at his home in Parker, Colorado, on April 29, 2025, at the age of 86.\n Originally published in \"Ramparts\" as \"Billion Dollar Brains\" (May 1969) and \"Sinews of Empire\" (August 1969).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He dominated the Greek art film industry from 1975 on, and Angelopoulos was one of the most influential and widely respected filmmakers in the world. He started making films in 1967. In the 1970s he made a series of political films about modern Greece.\nAngelopoulos' films, described by Martin Scorsese as that of \"a masterful filmmaker\", are characterized by the slightest movement, slightest change in distance, long takes, and complex, carefully composed scenes. His cinematic method is often described as \"sweeping\" and \"hypnotic.\" Angelopoulos has said that in his shots, \u201ctime becomes space and space becomes time.\u201d The pauses between action or music are important to creating the total effect.\nIn 1998 his film \"Eternity and a Day\" went on to win the Palme d'Or at the 51st edition of the Cannes Film Festival, and his films have been shown at many of the world's esteemed film festivals.\nBiography.\nTheodoros Angelopoulos was born in Athens on 27 April 1935. His father Spyros hailed from the town of Ampeliona, Messenia in the Peloponnese. During the Greek Civil War, his father was taken hostage and returned when Angelopoulos was 9 years old; according to the director, the absence of his father and looking for him among the dead bodies (during the \"Dekemvriana\" in Athens) had a great impact on his cinematography. He studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, but after his military service went to Paris to attend the Sorbonne. He soon dropped out to study film at the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes cin\u00e9matographiques (IDHEC) before returning to Greece. There, he worked as a journalist and film critic. Angelopoulos began making films after the 1967 coup that began the Regime of the Colonels. He made his first short film in 1968 and in the 1970s he began making a series of political feature films about modern Greece: \"Days of '36\" (\"Meres Tou 36\", 1972), \"The Travelling Players\" (\"O Thiassos\", 1975) and \"The Hunters\" (\"I Kynighoi\", 1977). In 1978, he was a member of the jury at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheo Angelopoulos is a masterful filmmaker. He really understands how to control the frame. There are sequences in his work\u2014the wedding scene in \"The Suspended Step of the Stork\"; the rape scene in \"Landscape in the Mist\"; or any given scene in \"The Traveling Players\"\u2014where the slightest movement, the slightest change in distance, sends reverberations through the film and through the viewer. The total effect is hypnotic, sweeping, and profoundly emotional. His sense of control is almost otherworldly.\n \u2014Martin Scorsese\nHe quickly established a characteristic style, marked by slow, episodic and ambiguous narrative structures as well as long takes (\"The Travelling Players\", for example, consists of only 80 shots in about four hours of film). These takes often include meticulously choreographed and complicated scenes involving many actors.\nHis regular collaborators include the cinematographer Giorgos Arvanitis, the screenwriter Tonino Guerra and the composer Eleni Karaindrou. One of the recurring themes of his work is immigration, the flight from homeland and the return, as well as the history of 20th century Greece. Angelopoulos was considered by British film critics Derek Malcolm and David Thomson as one of the world's greatest directors. Famous film directors including Werner Herzog Emir Kusturica, Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Wim Wenders, Du\u0161an Makavejev, William Friedkin, Manoel de Oliveira, Michelangelo Antonioni among others, were also admirers of his works.\nWhile critics have speculated on how he developed his style, Angelopoulos made clear in one interview that \"The only specific influences I acknowledge are Orson Welles for his use of plan-sequence and deep focus, and Mizoguchi, for his use of time and off-camera space.\" He had also cited Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 work \"Stalker\" as an influence.\nAngelopoulos was awarded honorary doctorates by the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Belgium in 1995, by Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00e9fense, France, by the University of Essex, UK in July 2001, by the University of Western Macedonia, Greece in December 2008, and by the University of the Aegean, Greece in December 2009.\nDeath.\nAngelopoulos died late on Tuesday, 24 January 2012, several hours after being involved in a crash while shooting his latest film, \"The Other Sea\" in Athens. On that evening, the filmmaker had been with his crew in the area of Drapetsona, near Piraeus when he was hit by a motorcycle, which unconfirmed reports suggested was ridden by an off-duty police officer. The crash occurred when Angelopoulos, 76, attempted to cross a busy road. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated in an intensive care unit but succumbed to his serious injuries several hours later. His funeral was a public expense, on 27 January at the First Cemetery of Athens.\nAwards.\nAngelopoulos won numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or at the 51st edition of the Cannes Film Festival in 1998 for \"Eternity and a Day\" (\"Mia aioniotita kai mia mera\"). His films have been shown at the most important film festivals around the world.\nLifetime achievement awards.\nTheodoros Angelopoulos was also the recipient of many awards for his long standing career.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography and sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established in 1931 by the University of California (UC), the laboratory is sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and administered by the UC system. Ernest Lawrence, who won the Nobel prize for inventing the cyclotron, founded the lab and served as its director until his death in 1958. Located in the Berkeley Hills, the lab overlooks the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.\nScientific research.\nThe mission of Berkeley Lab is to bring science solutions to the world. The research at Berkeley Lab has four main themes: discovery science, energy, earth systems, and the future of science. The Laboratory's 22 scientific divisions are organized within six areas of research: Computing Sciences, Physical Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Biosciences, Energy Sciences, and Energy Technologies. Lab founder Ernest Lawrence believed that scientific research is best done through teams of individuals with different fields of expertise, working together, and his laboratory still considers that a guiding principle today.\nResearch impact.\nBerkeley Lab scientists have won fifteen Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry, and each one has a street named after them on the Lab campus. 23 Berkeley Lab employees were contributors to reports by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize. Fifteen Lab scientists have also won the National Medal of Science, and two have won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. 82 Berkeley Lab researchers have been elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Engineering.\nIn 2022, Berkeley Lab had the greatest research publication impact of any single government laboratory in the world in physical sciences and chemistry, as measured by Nature Index. The only institutions with higher ranking were national government research agencies for China, France, and Italy which are network of research laboratories or smaller research units. Using the same metric, the Lab is the second-ranking laboratory in the area of earth and environmental sciences.\nScientific user facilities.\nMuch of Berkeley Lab's research impact is built on the capabilities of its unique research facilities.\nThe laboratory manages five national scientific user facilities, which are part of the network of 28 such facilities operated by the DOE Office of Science. These facilities and the expertise of the scientists and engineers who operate them are made available to 14,000 researchers from universities, industry, and government laboratories.\nBerkeley Lab operates five major National User Facilities for the DOE Office of Science:\nTeam science.\nMuch of the research at Berkeley Lab is done by researchers from several disciplines and multiple institutions working together as a large team focused on shared scientific goals. Berkeley is either the lead partner or one of the leads in several research institutes and hubs, including the following:\nCyclotron Road.\nCyclotron Road is a fellowship program for technology innovators, supporting entrepreneurial scientists as they advance their own technology projects. The core support for the program comes from the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, through the Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program. Berkeley Lab manages the program in close partnership with \"Activate\", a nonprofit organization established to scale the Cyclotron Road fellowship model to a greater number of innovators around the U.S. and the world. Cyclotron Road fellows receive two years of stipend, over $100,000 of research support, intensive mentorship and a startup curriculum, and access to the expertise and facilities of Berkeley Lab. Since members of the first cohort completed their fellowships in 2017, the 84 start-up companies founded by Cyclotron Road Fellows have raised over $2.5 billion in follow-on funding.\nNotable scientists.\nNobel laureates.\nSixteen Berkeley Lab scientists have received the Nobel Prize in physics or chemistry.\nNational Medals.\nFifteen Berkeley Lab scientists have received the National Medal of Science and two have been awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.\nThe National Medal of Technology and Innovation was awarded to Arthur Rosenfeld in 2011, to Ashok Gadgil in 2023, and to Jennifer Doudna in 2025.\nHistory.\nFrom 1931 to 1945: cyclotrons and team science.\nThe laboratory was founded on August 26, 1931, by Ernest Lawrence, as the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, associated with the Physics Department. It centered physics research around his new instrument, the cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939. Throughout the 1930s, Lawrence pushed to create larger and larger machines for physics research, courting private philanthropists for funding. He was the first to develop a large team to build big projects to make discoveries in basic research. Eventually these machines grew too large to be held on the university grounds, and in 1940 the lab moved to its current site atop the hill above campus. Part of the team put together during this period includes two other young scientists who went on to direct large laboratories: J. Robert Oppenheimer, who directed Los Alamos Laboratory, and Robert Wilson, who directed Fermilab.\nLeslie Groves visited Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory in late 1942 as he was organizing the Manhattan Project, meeting J. Robert Oppenheimer for the first time. Oppenheimer was tasked with organizing the nuclear bomb development effort and founded today's Los Alamos National Laboratory to help keep the work secret. At the RadLab, Lawrence and his colleagues developed the technique of electromagnetic enrichment of uranium using their experience with cyclotrons. The calutrons (named after the university) became the basic unit of the massive Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Lawrence's lab helped contribute to what have been judged to be the three most valuable technology developments of the war (the atomic bomb, proximity fuze, and radar). The cyclotron, whose construction was stalled during the war, was finished in November 1946. The Manhattan Project shut down two months later.\nFrom 1946 to 1972: discovering the antiproton and new elements.\nAfter the war, the Radiation Laboratory became one of the first laboratories to be incorporated into the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) (now Department of Energy, DOE). In 1952, the Laboratory established a branch in Livermore focused on nuclear security work, which developed into Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some classified research continued at Berkeley Lab until the 1970s, when it became a laboratory dedicated only to unclassified scientific research. Much of the Laboratory's scientific leadership during this period were also faculty members in the Physics and Chemistry Departments at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe scientists and engineers at Berkeley Lab continued to build ambitious large projects to accelerate the advance of science. Lawrence's original cyclotron design did not work for particles near the speed of light, so a new approach was needed. Edwin McMillan co-invented the synchrotron with Vladimir Veksler to address the problem. McMillan built an electron synchrotron capable of accelerating electrons to 300 million electron volts (300 MeV), which was operated from 1948 to 1960.\nThe Berkeley accelerator team built the Bevatron, a proton synchrotron capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 6.5 gigaelectronvolts (GeV), an energy chosen to be just above the threshold for producing antiprotons. In 1955, during the Bevatron's first full year of operation, Physicists Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain won the competition to observe the antiprotons for the first time. They won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1959 for this discovery. The Bevatron remained the highest energy accelerator until the CERN Proton Synchrotron started accelerating protons to 25 GeV in 1959.\nLuis Alvarez led the design and construction of several liquid hydrogen bubble chambers, which were used to discover a large number of new elementary particles using Bevatron beams. His group also developed measuring systems to record the millions of photographs of particle tracks in the bubble chamber and computer systems to analyze the data. Alvarez won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1968 for the discovery of many elementary particles using this technique.\nThe Alvarez Physics Memos are a set of informal working papers of the large group of physicists, engineers, computer programmers, and technicians led by Luis W. Alvarez from the early 1950s until his death in 1988. Over 1700 memos are available on-line, hosted by the Laboratory.\nBerkeley Lab is credited with the discovery of 16 elements on the periodic table, more than any other institution, over the period 1940 to 1974. The American Chemical Society has established a National Historical Chemical Landmark at the Lab to memorialize this accomplishment. Glenn Seaborg was personally involved in discovering nine of these new elements, and he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1951 with McMillan.\nFounding Laboratory Director Lawrence died in 1958 at the age of 57. McMillan became the second Director, serving in that role until 1972.\nFrom 1973 to 1989: new capabilities in energy and environmental research.\nThe University of California appointed Andrew Sessler as the Laboratory Director in 1973, during the 1973 oil crisis. He established the Energy and Environment Division at the Lab, expanding for the first time into applied research that addressed the energy and environmental challenges the country faced. Sessler also joined with other Berkeley physicists to form an organization called Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov, Sharansky (SOS), which led an international protest movement calling attention to the plight of three Soviet scientists who were being persecuted by the U.S.S.R. government.\nArthur Rosenfeld led the campaign to build up applied energy research at Berkeley Lab. He became widely known as the father of energy efficiency and the person who convinced the nation to adopt energy standards for appliances and buildings. Inspired by the 1973 oil crisis, he started up large team efforts that developed several technologies that radically improved energy efficiency. These included compact fluorescent lamps, low-energy refrigerators, and windows that trap heat. He developed the first energy-efficiency standards for buildings and appliances in California, which helped the state to sustain constant electricity use per capita from 1973 to 2006, while it rose by 50% in the rest of the country. This phenomenon is called the Rosenfeld Effect.\nBy 1980, George Smoot had built up a strong experimental group in Berkeley, building instruments to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in order to study the early universe. He became the principal investigator for the Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) instrument that was launched in 1989 as part of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. The full sky maps taken by the DMR made it possible for COBE scientists to discover the anisotropy of the CMB, and Smoot shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2006 with John Mather.\nFrom 1990 to 2004: new facilities for chemistry and materials, nanotechnology, scientific computing, and genomics.\nCharles V. Shank left Bell Labs to become Director of Berkeley Lab in 1989, a position he held for 15 years. During his tenure, four of the five national scientific user facilities started operations at Berkeley, and the fifth started construction.\nOn October 5, 1993, the new Advanced Light Source produced its first beams of x-ray light. David Shirley had proposed in the early 1990s building this new synchrotron source specializing in imaging materials using extreme ultraviolet to soft x-rays. In fall 2001, a major upgrade added \"superbends\" to produce harder x-rays for beamlines devoted to protein crystallography.\nIn 1996, both the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) were moved from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to their new home at Berkeley Lab. To reestablish NERSC at Berkeley required moving a Cray C90, a first-generation vector processor supercomputer of 1991 vintage, and installing a new Cray T3E, the second-generation (1995) model. The NERSC computing capacity was 350 GFlop/s, representing 1/200,000 of the Perlmutter's speed in 2022. Horst D. Simon was brought to Berkeley as the first Director of NERSC, and he soon became one of the co-editors who managed the Top500 list of supercomputers, a position he has held ever since.\nThe Joint Genome Institute (JGI) was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences that had developed at the DOE genome centers at Berkeley Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The JGI was originally established to work on the Human Genome Project (HGP), and generated the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19. In 2004, the JGI established itself as a national user facility managed by Berkeley Lab, focusing on the broad genomic needs of biology and biotechnology, especially those related to the environment and carbon management.\nLaboratory Director Shank brought Daniel Chemla from Bell Labs to Berkeley Lab in 1991 to lead the newly formed Division of Materials Science and Engineering. In 1998 Chemla was appointed director of the Advanced Light Source to build it into a world-class scientific user facility.\nIn 2001, Chemla proposed the establishment of the Molecular Foundry, to make cutting-edge instruments and expertise for nanotechnology accessible to a broad research community. Paul Alivisatos as founding director, and the founding directors of the facilities were Carolyn Bertozzi, Jean Frechet, Steven Gwon Sheng Louie, Jeffrey Bokor, and Miquel Salmeron. The Molecular Foundry building was dedicated in 2006, with Bertozzi as Foundry Director and Steven Chu as Laboratory Director.\nIn the 1990s, Saul Perlmutter led the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP), which used a certain type of supernovas as standard candles to study the expansion of the universe. The SCP team co-discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe, leading to the concept of dark energy, an unknown form of energy that drives this acceleration. Perlmutter shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for this discovery.\nFrom 2005 to 2015: advancing the national needs for energy.\nOn August 1, 2004, Nobel-winning physicist Steven Chu was named the sixth Director of Berkeley Lab. The DOE was preparing to compete the management and operations (M&amp;O) contract for Berkeley Lab for the first time, and Chu's first task was to lead the University of California's team that successfully bid for that contract. The initial term of the contract was from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2010, with possible phased extensions for superior management performance up to a total contract term of 20 years.\nIn 2007, Berkeley Lab launched the Joint BioEnergy Institute, one of three Bioenergy Research Centers to receive funding from the Genomic Science Program of DOE's Office for Biological and Environmental Research (BER). JBEI's Chief Executive Officer is Jay Keasling, who was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for developing synthetic biology tools needed to engineer the antimalarial drug artemisinin. The DOE Office of Science named Keasling a Distinguished Scientist Fellow in 2021 for advancing the DOE's strategy in biotechnology.\nOn December 15, 2008, newly elected President Barack Obama nominated Steven Chu to be the Secretary of Energy. The University of California chose the Lab's Deputy Director, Paul Alivisatos, as the new director. Alivisatos is a materials chemist who won the National Medal of Science for his pioneering work in developing nanomaterials. He continued the Lab's focus on meeting the nation's energy needs.\nThe DOE established the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) as an Energy Innovation Hub in 2010,\nwith California Institute of Technology as the lead institution and Berkeley Lab as the lead partner. The Lab built a new facility to house the JCAP laboratories and collaborative research space, and it was dedicated as Chu Hall in 2015. After JCAP operated for ten years, in 2020 the Berkeley team became a major partner in a new Energy Innovation Hub, the Liquid Sunlight Alliance (LiSA), with the vision of establishing the science needed to generate liquid fuels economically from sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.\nThe Lab also is a major partner on a second Energy Innovation Hub, the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) which was started in 2013,\nwith Argonne National Laboratory as the lead institution. The Lab built a new facility, the General Purpose Laboratory, to house energy storage laboratories and associated research space, which Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz inaugurated in 2014. The mission of JCESR is to deliver transformational new concepts and materials that will enable a diversity of high performance next-generation batteries for transportation and the grid.\nOn November 12, 2015, Laboratory Director Paul Alivisatos and Deputy Director Horst Simon were joined by University of California President Janet Napolitano, UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, and the head of DOE's ASCR program Barb Helland to dedicate a Shyh Wang Hall, a facility designed to host the NERSC supercomputers and staff, the ESnet staff, and the research divisions in the Computing Sciences area. The building was designed with a novel seismic floor for the 20,000 square foot machine room in addition to features that take advantage of the coastal climate to provide energy-efficient air conditioning for the computing systems.\nFrom 2016 to the present: building new scientific facilities and accelerating research with AI.\nIn 2015 Paul Alivisatos announced that he was stepping down from his role as Laboratory Director. He took two leadership positions at the University of California, Berkeley, before becoming President of the University of Chicago in 2021. The University of California selected Michael Witherell, formerly the Director of Fermilab and Vice Chancellor for Research at the University of California, Santa Barbara as the eighth director of Berkeley Lab starting on March 1, 2016. In 2016, the Laboratory entered a period of intensive modernization: an unprecedented number of major projects to upgrade existing scientific facilities and to build new ones.\nBerkeley Lab physicists led the construction of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which is designed to create three-dimensional maps of the distribution of matter covering an unprecedented volume of the universe with unparalleled detail. The new instrument was installed on the retrofitted Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in 2019. The five-year mission started in 2021, and the map assembled with data taken in the first seven months already included more galaxies than any previous survey. When the DESI survey's results from the first three years of observation are combined with other cosmological measurements, there is evidence that the acceleration of the universe's expansion caused by dark energy has changed with time.\nOn September 27, 2016, The DOE gave approval of the mission need for ALS-U, a major project to upgrade the Advanced Light Source that includes constructing a new storage ring and an accumulator ring. The horizontal size of the electron beam in ALS will shrink from 100 micrometers to a few micrometers, which will improve the ability to image novel materials needed for next-generation batteries and electronics.\nHow the Lab's name evolved.\nShortly after the death of Lawrence in August 1958, the UC Radiation Laboratory (UCRL), including both the Berkeley and Livermore sites, was renamed Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. The Berkeley location became Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1971, although many continued to call it the RadLab. Gradually, another shortened form came into common usage, LBL. Its formal name was amended to Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1995, when \"National\" was added to the names of all DOE labs. \"Ernest Orlando\" was later dropped to shorten the name. Today, the lab is commonly referred to as Berkeley Lab.\nLaboratory directors.\nSince its founding in 1931, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been led by 8 directors.\nOperations and governance.\nThe University of California operates Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under a contract with the Department of Energy. The site consists of 76 buildings (owned by the U.S. Department of Energy) located on owned by the university in the Berkeley Hills. Altogether, the Lab has 3,663 UC employees, of whom about 800 are students or postdocs, and each year it hosts more than 3,000 participating guest scientists. There are approximately two dozen DOE employees stationed at the laboratory to provide federal oversight of Berkeley Lab's work for the DOE. The laboratory director, Michael Witherell, is appointed by the university regents and reports to the university president. In December 2024, the Department of Energy extended the University of California's contract to manage the Laboratory through June 1, 2030.\nAlthough Berkeley Lab is governed by UC independently of the Berkeley campus, the two entities are closely interconnected; more than 200 Berkeley Lab researchers hold joint appointments as UC Berkeley faculty.\nThe laboratory budget was $1.495 billion in fiscal year 2023, while the total obligations were $1.395 billion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town administers one village, Steierdorf (German: \"Steierdorf\", Hungarian: \"St\u00e1jerlak\").\nGeology.\nAnina represents one of the most important localities in the Southern Carpathians for Jurassic fossils, both plants and animals, as the geological heritage here is particularly diverse and well preserved (Popa, 2001, 2005). Anina is a fossil-Lagerstatte for Early Jurassic biota, the Hettangian-Sinemurian terrestrial Steierdorf Formation recording an extremely rich floral association, vertebrate and invertebrate tracks, traces and burrows. This paleontological heritage was uncovered also by significant mining works, such as underground mines and open cast mines, such works permitting the three-dimensional studies of the continental deposits, a unique opportunity in Europe and in the world, until the unfortunate closing of the last major mine in 2006. Still, the sterile dumps of the former mines and the former open cast mines of Ponor and Colonia Ceh\u0103 very are rich in plant material, and they represent the subject of local conservation, as preserved sites or Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). \nThe Early Jurassic (Hettangian - Sinemurian) flora is represented by Bryophytes (Hepaticae), Pteridophytes (Filicopsida, Sphenopsida, Lycopsida) and Gymnosperms (Pteridospermopsida, Ginkgopsida, Cycadopsida, Coniferopsida), with numerous coal generators (Givulescu, 1998, Popa and Van Konijnenburg - Van Cittert, 2005). Very rare vertebrate tunnels were recently described (Popa and Kedzior, 2006), such burrows being formerly reported only from three occurrences in the world (South Africa, Arizona and Argentina), tetrapod tracks such as \"Batrachopus\" cf. \"deweyi\" (Popa, 2000), and sauropod tracks of \"Parabrontopodus\" sp. type (Pienkowski et al., 2009).\nThe Middle Jurassic marine formations are also extremely rich in marine invertebrates and drifted floral remains, while the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous units display basinal and carbonate platform features (Bucur, 1997).\nHuman geography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2002, the oldest modern human remains in Europe were discovered in a cave near Anina. Nicknamed \"Ion din Anina\" (John of Anina), the remains (the lower jaw) are some 40,000 years old.\nThe coal mining industrial heritage is significant, with Austrian industrial architecture and pits still preserved, such as the Northern Pit (Anina Pit I), Pit II, Pit IV (next to the Terezia Valley). Coal mining activities began in 1792, after the first coal outcrop was discovered by Matthew Hammer.\nThe Anina-Oravi\u021ba railway built in 1863 is still in use today for touristic purposes. It is one of the most beautiful railways in Europe due to very picturesque landscapes, viaducts and long tunnels. The railway preserves many aspects of the original design and, as such, it does not comply with many UIC standards and it needs special, more powerful locomotives and shorter rail coaches to operate.\nClimate.\nAnina has a humid continental climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(the) \u201cRed Steel\u201d; formerly \"Ferdinand\"; ; ) is a town in northeastern Cara\u0219-Severin County, Romania, in the Bistra Valley. It is situated on the national road 68, between Caransebe\u0219 (21\u00a0km away) and Ha\u021beg. The town administers two villages, Cire\u0219a (\"Bisztracseres\") and Mal (\"M\u00e1l\"). It is situated in the historical region of Banat.\nGeography.\nO\u021belu Ro\u0219u is located at an altitude of approximately in the Bistra River valley, which lies between the Poiana Rusc\u0103 Mountains to the north and the \u021aarcu Mountains to the south. To the south of O\u021belu Ro\u0219u is a large piedmont of the \u021aarcu Mountains, locally named Gai. To the north the town makes direct contact with the foothills of the Poiana Rusc\u0103 Mountains. Dominant heights are the hill of Ferdinand (overlooking the foundry) and the hill of Chiciura.\nO\u021belu Ro\u0219u is subjected to west European climatic influences because of its altitude and location. The altitude and the neighbouring forests and mountains ensure a mild climate. In the winter, snow may persist as much as two or three months, however the temperatures do not drop too low. In the spring months, especially May, floods are possible due to the melting of the snow in the high areas of the \u021aarcu Mountains and abundant rains. The most recent flood took place in the year 2000, destroying several bridges across the river Bistra.\nHistory.\nThe first signs of human habitation date from the Paleolithic, in form of primitive tools. Sporadic remnants from the Neolithic age have been found in the neighbouring areas.\nDuring the wars between Romans and Dacians, the Bistra Valley was the route used by the emperor Trajan in penetrating into the heartland of Dacia. A Roman castrum can be found near the cemetery of Z\u0103voi (ancient Agnaviae), a settlement close to O\u021belu Ro\u0219u.\nIn the fifteenth century, during medieval times, O\u021belu Ro\u0219u was mentioned under the name of \"Bistra\", and later with the Hungarian name of N\u00e1ndorhegy. After the expulsion of Turks from Banat by the Habsburgs, the area was colonised by Germans and the place named Ferdinandsberg after emperor Ferdinand. Also, Italians were brought in to work in metalworking industry. Within the Kingdom of Hungary, the town was part of Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County from 1881 to 1918. In the aftermath of World War I and the ensuing Hungarian\u2013Romanian War, the Romanian Army entered the town. Following the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, the northeastern part of the Banat became part of the Kingdom of Romania, and the name of N\u00e1ndorhegy was replaced with Ferdinand. During the interwar period, the town fell within Plasa Caransebe\u0219 of Severin County.\nAfter 1947, the name Ferdinand did not please the Communist government, who changed it to \"O\u021belu Ro\u0219u\" (\"[The] Red Steel\") in order to underline the importance of the town's metalworking industry.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe population was 8,497 in 2021, down from 9,260 in 2011 and 13,128 in 2002. Causes of this demographic regress are among others the problems of the metalworking industry and the high unemployment, making many young people leave the town and move into regional centres such as Timi\u0219oara and other areas of Romania.\n92.98% of inhabitants are Romanians, 2.09% Germans, 3.23% Hungarians, and 0.86% Roma. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, most of the town's Germans, Italians and Slovaks emigrated. In 2002, 76.7% of residents were Romanian Orthodox, 11.4% Roman Catholic, 4.8% Pentecostal, 4.4% Baptist, and 1% Reformed.\nClimate.\nO\u021belu Ro\u0219u has a humid continental climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nEducation.\nThe town has two schools, General\u0103 1 and General\u0103 3, plus one industrial high school.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Today, there are fewer than 200 people living in Agadici. Agadici is a word derived from Turkish: \"Aga\" meaning 'colonel' and \"dici\" meaning 'daughter'. Therefore, \"Agadici\" means \"daughter of the colonel\". The town was supposedly named after a colonel's daughter when the Ottoman Empire occupied the land that is now the Banat (\"see the Teme\u015fvar Eyalet\").\nCiclova Montan\u0103.\nThe second-oldest beer in what is now Romania was produced in Ciclova; it is first attested in a document of 1728.

It is located at the southern extremity of Cara\u0219-Severin County, from the county capital, Re\u0219i\u021ba. It is crossed by national road DN57, which connects it to Oravi\u021ba, to the north, and Or\u0219ova, to the east.\nMoldova Veche.\nIn Moldova Veche village, evidence of human habitation dating to the transition between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age has been found. Additionally, there exist traces of an unfortified Dacian settlement, similar to several others in the area. \nA Roman \"fort\" located in the village supervised mining and navigation on the Danube, located in Roman Dacia. The harbour and border buildings partly lie on the ruins of the former fort with the rest below the Danube. The site was seen by the historian Leonard Bohm in the summer of 1879 when the river was low and a thorough examination of the ruins could be made. Moldova Noua was an important Roman mining centre for iron, copper, silver and gold.\nVestiges from the Dark Ages and the Early Middle Ages have been found; during the 10th and 11th centuries, the area was controlled by Glad and later Ahtum. Serbs have been living there since their replacement of the Gepids in the 5th century. \nIn 1552, when the Banat fell under Ottoman rule, Moldova Veche became the capital of a sanjak within the Teme\u015fvar Eyalet. In 1566, at the end of Suleiman the Magnificent's reign, coins of gold (\"alt\u00e2ni\") and silver (\"aspri\") were minted there. A document of 1588 records the place under the name \"Mudava\"; this is the earliest written mention. The Slavicizied Germanic-origin toponym is still used by locals. Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and the majority of Romanian philologists and historians claim that the name comes from the term of Germanic origin mulde (i.e., \"hollow\", \"quarry\" or \"drainage\"). In 1718, the area came under the Habsburg monarchy's control.\nThe village was absorbed into Moldova Nou\u0103 in 1956. It is the site of a Danube port. There is a Baptist church; the community was established in 1927, its first church built in 1967 and the present structure in 2001. Adherents are both Romanian and Serbian, with services conducted in Romanian.\nDemographics.\nIn 1910, out of 3,437 inhabitants, 2,934 were ethnic Romanians, 295 Germans, 91 Hungarians, 41 Serbs and 73 Czechs; 3,004 where belonging to Orthodoxy, 389 where Roman Catholic and 25 where Reformed.\nAt the 2011 census, 81.2% of inhabitants were Romanians, 12.8% Serbs, 3.2% Roma, 1.3% Hungarians, and 0.8% Czechs.

It is an important railroad node, being located approximately 40\u00a0km from the county seat, Re\u0219i\u021ba, 21\u00a0km from O\u021belu Ro\u0219u, 70\u00a0km from Ha\u021beg, and about 25\u00a0km from the Muntele Mic ski resort, in the \u021aarcu Mountains.\nClimate.\nCaransebe\u0219 has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), with an average of , but summers can be warm, with an average of . Rainfall can be quite abundant throughout the year.\nHistory.\nThe first traces of habitation here might date as far as Dacian times. Dacian ruins have been discovered recently near Obreja, a village 7\u00a0km away. As the Romans invaded Dacia, they built a castrum named Tibiscum, which was dug up by archaeologists near the nearby village of Jupa, a castrum which later grew to be a full city. Tibiscum is considered one of the gates of Christianity in Dacia, having an important role also in the Romanization of the local people.\nDuring the Middle Ages the area, which remained continuously inhabited, became part of the Hungarian Kingdom. In 1350 it was recorded as the seat of the Romanian district of Sebe\u0219, which later absorbed the district of Caran, forming the district of Caransebe\u0219. In the 16th century it became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and its successor the Principality of Transylvania, acting as one of the centres of the Banate of Lugos and Kar\u00e1nsebes. In the 17th century it was ceded to the Ottoman Empire, becoming part of the Teme\u015fvar Eyalet. In 1718, after prolonged wars against the Ottomans, the Habsburgs took the control of the region by the Treaty of Passarowitz. It formed part of the Banat of Temeswar crownland until 1751, when it became part of the Banat Military Frontier. In 1788 a self-inflicted defeat, the Battle of Caransebe\u0219, is supposed (the historical accuracy is in doubt) to have taken place here. In 1804 the formally separate Habsburg realms were united into the Austrian Empire. Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the demilitarisation of the Military Frontier began; Caransebe\u0219 became the seat of the short-lived Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County of Hungary in 1873, which was then merged with Krass\u00f3 County in 1881 to form Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny County.\nAfter railroads began to appear, the role of Caransebe\u0219 grew continuously. In the late 19th century, the Romanian people of the settlement elected to the Parliament of Hungary the Hungarian Lajos Mocs\u00e1ry, who was a progressive democratic politician fighting for the cultural and administrative rights of all nationalities (including the Romanians) living in the Hungarian Kingdom of that time.\nIn late October 1918, near the close of World War I, a Romanian National Committee was established in Caransebe\u0219. It formed the core of the largest Banat delegation to Alba Iulia, where the Union of Transylvania with Romania was proclaimed on December 1. Meanwhile, the entire Banat was occupied by the Serbian Army following the Armistice of Belgrade. The Serbs withdrew from the Caransebe\u0219 area in January 1919, and were replaced by the French Army. Romania began administering the Banat in late July, with troops moving in during the following weeks. In August 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, the Banat was divided between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Greater Romania, with Caransebe\u0219 assigned to the latter.\nAfter the rise of the communist regime in 1947, an airport and an airbase were built close to the city. However, the airport did not remain operational for long after the 1989 Revolution.\nEducation.\nThe city's two leading high schools are the C. D. Loga National College and the Traian Doda National College.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2021 Romanian census, Caransebe\u0219 had a population of 21,714. At the previous census, from 2011, the city had a population of 21,932, mainly Romanians (93.48%), with Ukrainians (1.56%), German (1.17%), and Hungarian (0.78%) minorities present, but in decline.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town has a length of and an area of approximately . It is located from Timi\u0219oara and from Re\u0219i\u021ba. and is traversed by the national road DN58B, which connects Re\u0219i\u021ba to Voiteg, in Timi\u0219 County. Boc\u0219a lies on the banks of the B\u00e2rzava River. To the east lie the Western Carpathian Mountains, offering a mountainous environment rich in natural resources, particularly iron, copper, and other non-ferrous minerals. Directly to the east of Boc\u0219a, the Pannonian Basin begins, featuring steppe-like landscapes.\nHistory.\nBoc\u0219a has a long-standing development dating back to the Neolithic era. It has seen continuous habitation through the Bronze Age and Iron Age, and during Roman times, it was a site for gold exploitation. First mentioned in a document in 1331, Boc\u0219a has experienced various occupations, including Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman rule. The town has a long tradition of mining, particularly for iron and copper. Mining activities date back to the 16th and 17th centuries under Turkish rule, where copper and iron were extracted. During the Habsburg period, Austrian miners revitalized the industry, establishing ironworks such as the \"Altwerk\" in 1719 and \"Neuwerk\" in 1722. These facilities processed iron ore from local sources, including the nearby Semenic Mountains and Lupac. The industrial development of Boc\u0219a was further enhanced by the construction of a railway for industrial use in the 19th century and the establishment of a hydroelectric plant in 1896. Over time, the town transitioned to producing agricultural machinery, but mining remained a significant part of its economic history. Boc\u0219a also became a cultural and educational hub, with diverse religious institutions due to successive waves of colonization. \nDemography.\nWithin the 2002 census recording 15,041 Romanians, 643 Roma, 596 Hungarians, 432 Germans, 64 Slovaks, 61 Serbs, 28 Ukrainians, and 17 Czechs were living in Boc\u0219a.\nClimate.\nBoc\u0219a has a humid continental climate (\"Cfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its current population is 3,787. The town administers one village, Pecini\u0219ca (; from 1912 to 1918 \"Csernabeseny\u0151\").\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe spa town of B\u0103ile Herculane has a long history of human habitation. Numerous archaeological discoveries show that the area has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era. The \"Pe\u0219tera Ho\u021bilor\" (Cave of the Thieves), contains multiple levels, including one from the Mousterian period, one from the Mesolithic period (late Epigravettian) and several from the later Neolithic periods.\nThe Romans established the town of \"Ad Aquas Herculis\" based on the legend that the weary Hercules stopped in the valley to bathe and rest. Unearthed stone carvings show that visiting Roman aristocrats turned the town into a Roman leisure centre. Six statues of Hercules from the time have been discovered. A bronze replica of one of them, molded in 1874, stands as a landmark in the town centre.\nRoman baths, mapped in 1774, became the thermal spring now known as Hygea's Spring, had an area of 667 m2 with 11 rooms. In the middle of the building was a circular pool of 5 m diameter with steps descending to the pool floor. There was another rectangular pool with sides of 8 x 4.2 m. On the steep Cerna bank the Romans built another five buildings around thermal springs.\nThe ruins of the amphitheatre were 43 m from the left bank of the river. It had an outer diameter of 47.4 m. The Austrian architects took the massive ruins into account in order to create a rectangular park with terraces which still exists today in the centre.\nAustrian and Ottoman troops clashed here after the Ottoman victory in the battle of Mehadia on 30 August 1788. The Ottomans won the skirmish, took the town on 7 September 1788 and advanced to Caransebe\u0219. It was retaken by the Austrians at the end of September 1789.\nClimate.\nB\u0103ile Herculane has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nThe modern spa.\nIn modern times, the spa town has been visited for its supposedly natural healing properties: hot springs with sulfur, chlorine, sodium, calcium, magnesium and other minerals, as well as negatively ionized air. Before World War II, when the first modern hotel was built (i.e. H Cerna, 1930) it remained a popular destination with Western Europeans. During the Communist era, mass tourism facilities were built, such as the 8- to 12-storied concrete hotels Roman, Hercules A, Hercules B, Afrodita, Minerva, Diana, UGSR, etc. which dominate the skyline. It was visited by all kinds of people but was especially popular with employees and retirees, who would spend their state-allotted vacation vouchers there, hoping to improve their health. Today, they share the town with a younger crowd. \nNew privately owned pensions and hotels appeared after 1989, along the Cerna/Tiena river banks, spread from the train station to the end of the hydroelectric dam. Some of the Austro-Hungarian-era buildings have become derelict, including many of the baths, because of bad management after privatization. In the late 2010s, an NGO called the Herculane Project was established to stabilise the buildings and eventually restore them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards in Italy from 774. In 800 Pope Leo III crowned King Charlemagne as Roman emperor in return for political protection, disregarding the universalist claims of the weakened Byzantine Empire. The Carolingian Empire is sometimes considered the first phase in the history of the Holy Roman Empire.\nAfter a civil war from 840 to 843 following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor but with little authority outside his own kingdom. The unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the Carolingians continued to be acknowledged. In 884 Charles the Fat reunited all the Carolingian kingdoms for the last time, but he was deposed by the Frankish nobility in 887 and died in 888, and the empire immediately fractured. With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child, the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or, in the case of the eastern kingdom, an illegitimate Carolingian. The illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911, while in the western kingdom the legitimate Carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936.\nThe population of the empire was roughly between 10 and 20\u00a0million people. Its heartland was Francia, the land between the Loire and the Rhine, where Aachen, which Charlemagne chose as his primary residence, was located. In the south it crossed the Pyrenees and bordered the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and (after 824) the Kingdom of Pamplona; to the north it bordered the kingdom of the Danes; to the west it had a short land border with Brittany, which was later reduced to a tributary; and to the east it had a long border with the Slavs and the Avars, who were eventually defeated and their land incorporated into the empire. In southern Italy, the Carolingians' claims to authority were disputed by the Byzantines and the vestiges of the Lombard kingdom in the Principality of Benevento. In its day, it was known by various Latin names; the term \"Carolingian Empire\" arose later.\nNomenclature.\nThe term \"Carolingian Empire\" is a modern convention and was not used by its contemporaries. The language of official acts in the empire was Latin. During its existence, the empire was referred to by several names. The term was used to refer to 'the whole kingdom', distinguishing it from the regional kingdoms. 'Roman empire' was commonly used to refer to the Roman traditions of imperial statehood in general, while the more complex 'empire of the Romans and Franks'\u2014sometimes with 'Roman' replacing 'of the Romans' and 'and' replacing 'or'\u2014provided the basis for modern historiographical terms, like \"Franko-Roman Empire\" or \"Frankish-Roman Empire\". 'Christian empire' was also used.\nHistory.\nRise of the Carolingians (732\u2013768).\nThough Charles Martel chose not to take the title of king (as his son Pepin III would) or emperor (as his grandson Charlemagne), he was the absolute ruler of virtually all of today's continental Western Europe north of the Pyrenees. Only the remaining Saxon realms (which he partly conquered), Lombardy, and the Spanish March were significant additions to the Frankish realms after his death.\nMartel cemented his place in history with his defense of Christian Europe against a Muslim army at the Battle of Tours in 732. The Iberian Saracens had incorporated Berber light horse cavalry with the heavy Arab cavalry to create a formidable army that had almost never been defeated. Christian European forces, meanwhile, lacked the powerful tool of the stirrup. In this victory, Charles earned the surname \"Martel\" (\"the Hammer\"). Historian Edward Gibbon calls Martel \"the paramount prince of his age\".\nPepin III accepted the nomination as king by Pope Zachary in about 741. Charlemagne's rule began in 768 at Pepin's death. He proceeded to take control of the kingdom following his brother Carloman I's death, as the two brothers co-inherited their father's kingdom.\nReign of Charlemagne (768\u2013814).\nThe Carolingian Empire during the reign of Charlemagne covered most of Western Europe, as the Roman Empire once had. Unlike the Romans, whose imperial ventures between the Rhine and the Elbe lasted fewer than 20 before being cut short by the disaster at Teutoburg Forest (9\u00a0AD), Charlemagne defeated the Germanic resistance and extended his realm to the Elbe more lastingly, influencing events almost to the Eurasian Steppes. Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor in 800.\nCharlemagne's reign was one of near-constant warfare, participating in annual campaigns, many led personally. He defeated the Lombard Kingdom in 774 and annexed it into his own domain by declaring himself 'King of the Lombards'. He later led a failed campaign into Spain in 778, ending with the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, which is considered Charlemagne's greatest defeat. He then extended his domain into Bavaria after forcing Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, to renounce any claim to his title in 794. His son Pepin was ordered to campaign against the Avars in 795 since Charlemagne was occupied with Saxon revolts. Eventually, the Avar confederation ended in 803 after Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into Pannonia. He also conquered Saxon territories in wars and rebellions fought from 772 to 804, with such events as the Massacre of Verden in 782 and the codification of the \"Lex Saxonum\" in 802.\nPrior to the death of Charlemagne, the empire was divided among various members of the Carolingian dynasty. These included King Charles the Younger who received Neustria; King Louis the Pious who received Aquitaine; and King Pepin who received Italy. Pepin died with an illegitimate son, Bernard, in 810, and Charles died without heirs in 811. Although Bernard succeeded Pepin as king of Italy, Louis was made co-emperor in 813, and the empire passed to him with Charlemagne's death in the winter of 814.\nReign of Louis the Pious and Civil War (814\u2013843).\nLouis the Pious' reign as emperor was unexpected; as the third son of Charlemagne, he was originally crowned King of Aquitaine at three years old. With the deaths of his older siblings, he went from \"a boy who became a king to a man who would be emperor.\" Although his reign was mostly overshadowed by the dynastic struggle and resultant civil war, as his epithet states, he was highly interested in matters of religion. One of the first things he did was \"ruling the people by law and with the wealth of his piety,\" namely by restoring churches. \"The Astronomer\" states that during his kingship of Aquitaine he \"built up the study of reading and singing, and also the understanding of divine and worldly letters, more quickly than one would believe.\" He also made significant effort to restore many monasteries that had disappeared prior to his reign, as well as sponsoring new ones.\nLouis the Pious' reign lacked security; he often had to struggle to maintain control of the empire. As soon as he heard of the death of Charlemagne, he hurried to Aachen, where he exiled many of Charlemagne's trusted advisors, such as Wala. Wala and his siblings were children of the youngest son of Charles Martel and so were a threat as a potential alternative ruling family. Monastic exile was a tactic Louis used heavily in his early reign to strengthen his position and remove potential rivals. In 817 his nephew King Bernard of Italy rebelled against him because he was discontent with being the vassal of Lothar, Louis' eldest son. The rebellion was quickly put down by Louis, and by 818 Bernard was captured and punished\u2014the punishment of death was commuted to blinding. However, the trauma of the procedure ending up killing him two days later. Italy was brought back into imperial control. In 822, Louis' show of penance for Bernard's death greatly reduced his prestige as emperor to the nobility; some suggest it opened him up to clerical domination.\nIn 817 Louis had established three Carolingian kingships for his sons from his first marriage: Lothar was made king of Italy and co-emperor, Pepin was made king of Aquitaine, and Louis the German was made king of Bavaria. His attempts in 823 to bring his fourth son (from his second marriage) Charles the Bald into the will was marked by the resistance of his eldest sons. Whilst this was part of the reason for strife amongst Louis' sons, some suggest that it was the appointment of Bernard of Septimania as chamberlain which caused discontent with Lothar, as he was stripped of his co-emperorship in 829 and was banished to Italy (although it is not known why; The Astronomer simply states Louis \"dismissed his son Lothar to go back to Italy\") and Bernard assumed his place as second in command to the emperor. With Bernard's influence over the emperor and empress, further discord was sowed amongst prominent nobility. Pepin was disgruntled; he had been implicated in a failed military campaign in 827, and he was tired of his father's overbearing involvement in the ruling of Aquitaine. As such, the angry nobility supported Pepin, civil war broke out during Lent in 830, and the last years of Louis' reign were plagued by civil war.\nShortly after Easter, his sons attacked Louis' empire and dethroned him in favour of Lothar. The Astronomer states that Louis spent the summer in the custody of his son, as an emperor in name only. In 831 Louis attacked his sons' kingdoms by drafting new plans for succession. Louis gave Neustria to Pepin, stripped Lothar of his imperial title and granted the Kingdom of Italy to Charles. Another partition in 832 completely excluded Pepin and Louis the German, making Lothar and Charles the sole benefactors of the kingdom, which precipitated a revolt by Pepin and Louis the German in 832, followed by a revolt by Lothar in 833, and together they imprisoned Louis the Pious and Charles. Lothar brought Pope Gregory IV from Rome under the guise of mediation, but his true role was to legitimise Lothar and his brothers' rule by deposing and excommunicating Louis.\nBy 835, peace was made within the family, and Louis was restored to the imperial throne at the church of St. Stephen in Metz. When Pepin died in 838, Louis crowned Charles king of Aquitaine, whilst the nobility elected Pepin's son Pepin II, a conflict which was not resolved until 860 with Pepin's death. When Louis the Pious died in 840, Lothar claimed the entire empire irrespective of the partitions. As a result, Charles and Louis the German went to war against Lothar. After losing the Battle of Fontenay in 841, Lothar fled to his capital at Aachen and raised a new army, which was inferior to that of the younger brothers. In the Oaths of Strasbourg in 842, Charles and Louis agreed to declare Lothar unfit for the imperial throne. This marked the east\u2013west division of the empire between Louis and Charles. Considered a milestone in European history, the Oaths of Strasbourg symbolize the birth of both France and Germany.\nAfter the Treaty of Verdun (843\u2013877).\nThe partition of Carolingian Empire was finally settled in 843 by and between Louis the Pious' three sons in the Treaty of Verdun. Lothar received the imperial title, the kingship of Italy, and the territory between the Rhine and Rhone Rivers, collectively called the Central Frankish Realm. Louis was guaranteed the kingship of all lands to the east of the Rhine and to the north and east of Italy, which was called the Eastern Frankish Realm, which was the precursor to modern Germany. Charles received all lands west of the Rhone, which was called the Western Frankish Realm.\nLothar retired Italy to his eldest son Louis II in 844, making him co-emperor in 850. By the Treaty of Pr\u00fcm (855), Lothar divided his kingdom into three parts: the Italian territory already held by Louis remained his, the territory of the former Kingdom of Burgundy was granted to his third son Charles of Burgundy, and the remaining territory for which there was no traditional name was granted to his second son Lothar II, whose realm was named Lotharingia.\nLouis II, dissatisfied with having received no additional territory upon his father's death, allied with his uncle Louis the German against his brother Lothar and his uncle Charles the Bald in 858. Lothar reconciled with his brother and uncle shortly after. Charles was so unpopular that he could not raise an army to fight the invasion and instead fled to Burgundy. He was only saved when the bishops refused to crown Louis the German king. In 860, Charles the Bald invaded Charles of Burgundy's kingdom but was repulsed. Lothar II ceded lands to Louis II in 862 for support of a divorce from his wife, Teutberga, which caused repeated conflicts with his uncles and the pope. Charles of Burgundy died in 863, and his kingdom was inherited by Louis II.\nLothar II died in 869 with no legitimate heirs, due to the pope's refusal to allow the divorce, and his kingdom was divided between Charles the Bald and Louis the German in 870 by the Treaty of Meerssen. Meanwhile, Louis the German was involved in disputes with his three sons. Louis II died in 875, and named Carloman, the eldest son of Louis the German, his heir. Charles the Bald, supported by the pope, was crowned both king of Italy and emperor. The following year, Louis the German died. Charles tried to annex his realm too, but was defeated decisively at Andernach, and East Francia was divided between Louis the Younger, Carloman of Bavaria and Charles the Fat.\nDecline and division (877\u2013888).\nAfter the death of Charles the Bald in 877, the empire was under attack in the north and west by the Vikings and faced internal struggles from Italy to the Baltic, from Hungary in the east to Aquitaine in the west. His successor, Louis the Stammerer, became king of the Western Franks, but the title of emperor lapsed. Louis the Stammerer was physically weak and died two years later, his realm being divided between his eldest two sons: Louis III gaining Neustria and Francia, and Carloman II gaining Aquitaine and Burgundy. The Kingdom of Italy was finally granted to King Carloman of Bavaria, but a stroke forced him to abdicate Italy to his brother Charles the Fat and Bavaria to Louis of Saxony. In 879, Boso of Vienne founded the Kingdom of Lower Burgundy in Provence.\nIn 881, Charles the Fat was crowned emperor while Louis of Saxony and Louis III of Francia died the following year. Saxony and Bavaria were united under Charles the Fat, and Francia and Neustria. Carloman II conquered Lower Burgundy. Carloman died in a hunting accident in 884 after a tumultuous and ineffective reign, and his lands were inherited by Charles the Fat, effectively recreating the empire of Charlemagne.\nCharles, suffering what is believed to be epilepsy, could not secure the kingdom against Viking raiders, and after buying their withdrawal from Paris in 886 was perceived by the court as being cowardly and incompetent. The following year his nephew Arnulf of Carinthia, the illegitimate son of Carloman of Bavaria, raised the standard of rebellion. Instead of fighting the insurrection, Charles fled to Neidingen and died in 888, leaving a divided entity and a disorderly succession.The empire of the Carolingians was divided: Arnulf maintained Carinthia, Bavaria, Lorraine and modern Germany; Count Odo of Paris was elected king of Western Francia (France), Ranulf II became king of Aquitaine, Italy went to Count Berengar of Friuli, Upper Burgundy to Rudolph I, and Lower Burgundy to Louis the Blind, the son of Boso of Arles, King of Lower Burgundy and maternal grandson of Emperor Louis II. The other part of Lotharingia became the duchy of Burgundy.\nDemographics.\nIn his comprehensive \"Framing the Early Middle Ages,\" Chris Wickham suggests that there are currently no reliable calculations for the period regarding the populations of early medieval towns. What is likely, however, is that most cities of the empire did not exceed the 20\u201325,000 speculated for Rome during this period. On an empire-wide level, populations expanded steadily from 750 to 850. Figures ranging from 10 to 20 million have been offered, with estimates being devised based on calculations of empire size and theoretical densities. Recently, however, Timothy Newfield challenges the idea of demographic expansion, criticising scholars for relying on the impact of recurring pandemics in the preceding period of 541-750 and ignoring the frequency of famines in Carolingian Europe.\nA study using climate proxies such as the Greenland ice core 'GISP2' has indicated that there may have been relatively favourable conditions for the empire's early years, although several harsh winters appear afterwards. Whilst demographic implications are observable in contemporary sources, the extent of the impact of these findings on the empire's populations is difficult to discern.\nEthnicity.\nThe empire was inhabited by major ethnic groups such as Franks, Alemanni, Bavarians, Thuringians, Frisians, Lombards, Goths, Romans, Celts, Basques and Slavs. Ethnicity was just one of many systems of identification in this period and was a way to show social status and political agency. Many regional and ethnic identities were maintained and would later become significant in a political role. Regarding laws, ethnic identity helped decide which codes applied to which populations, however these systems were not definitive representations of ethnicity as these systems were somewhat fluid.\nGender.\nEvidence from Carolingian estate surveys and polyptychs appears to suggest that female life expectancy was lower than that of men in this period, with analyses recording high ratios of males to females. However, it is possible this is due to a recording bias.\nGovernment.\nThe government, administration, and organization of the Carolingian Empire were forged in the court of Charlemagne in the decades around 800. In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor and adapted his existing royal administration to live up to the expectations of his title. The political reforms wrought in Aachen had an immense impact on the political definition of Western Europe for the rest of the Middle Ages. The Carolingian improvements on the old Merovingian mechanisms of governance have been lauded by historians for the increased central control, efficient bureaucracy, accountability, and cultural renaissance.\nThe Carolingian Empire was the largest western territory since the fall of Rome, but historians have come to suspect the depth of the emperor's influence and control. Legally, the Carolingian emperor exercised the \"bannum\", the right to rule and command, over all of his territories. Also, he had supreme jurisdiction in judicial matters, made legislation, led the army, and protected both the Church and the poor. His administration was an attempt to organize the kingdom, church, and nobility around him; however, its efficacy was directly dependent upon the efficiency, loyalty and support of his subjects.\nMilitary.\nAlmost every year between the accession of Charles Martel and the conclusion of the wars with the Saxons, Frankish forces went on campaign or expedition, often into enemy territory. For many years, Charlemagne would gather an assembly around Easter and launch a military effort that would typically take place through the summer as this would ensure there were enough supplies for the fighting force. Charlemagne passed regulations requiring all mustered fighting men to own and bring their own weapons; the wealthy cavalrymen had to bring their own armour, poor men had to bring spears and shields, and those driving the carts had to have bows and arrows in their possession. With regard to provisions, men were instructed not to eat food until a specific location was reached, and carts should carry three months worth of food and six months worth of weapons and clothing along with tools. Preference was shown towards mobility warfare in place of defence-in-depth infrastructure; captured fortifications were often destroyed so they could not be used to resist Carolingian authority in the future. After 800 and during the reign of Louis the Pious, efforts of expansion dwindled. Tim Reuter has shown that many military efforts during Louis' reign were largely defensive and in response to external threats.\nIt had long been held that Carolingian military success was based on the use of a cavalry force created by Charles Martel in the 730s. However, it is clear that no such \"cavalry revolution\" took place in the Carolingian period leading up to and during the reign of Charlemagne. This is because the stirrup was not known to the Franks until the late 8th century, and soldiers on horseback would therefore have used swords and lances for striking and not charging. Carolingian military success rested primarily on siege technologies and excellent logistics. However, large numbers of horses were used by the Frankish military during the age of Charlemagne. This was because a mounted cavalry provided a quick, long-distance method of transporting troops, which was critical to building and maintaining such a large empire. The importance of horses to the Carolingian military is revealed through the revised version of the \"Royal Frankish Annals\". The annals mention that, whilst Charlemagne was on campaign in 791, \"there broke out such a pestilence among the horses [...] that barely a tenth out of so many thousands are said to have survived.\" Shortage of horses played a role in preventing Carolingian forces from continuing a campaign against the Avars in Pannonia.\nThe Frankish royal bodyguards, the continuation of the Merovingian institution of the antrustion, were consciously modelled on Late Roman precedents. These guards were organized into \"schola\" and entitled \"scholares\", and used armour based on Late Roman and early Byzantine models. Frankish artistic depictions of these bodyguards also mirrored Late Roman traditions.\nPalaces.\nNo permanent capital city existed in the empire, the itinerant court being a typical characteristic of all Western European kingdoms at this time. Some palaces can, however, be distinguished as locations of central administration. In the first year of his reign, Charlemagne went to Aachen (; ). He began to build the Palace of Aachen in the 780s, with original plans developed perhaps as soon as 768. The palace chapel, constructed in 796, later became Aachen Cathedral. During the 790s, when construction picked up at Aachen, Charlemagne's court became more centred compared with the 770s where court so often found itself located in tents during campaigning. Though Aachen was certainly not intended to be a sedentary capital, it was built in the political heartland of Charlemagne's realm to act as a meeting place for aristocrats and churchmen so that patronage might be distributed, assemblies held, laws written, and even where scholarly churchmen gathered for the purposes of learning. Aachen was also a centre for information and gossip being pulled in from across the empire by courtiers and churchmen alike. Of course, despite being the centre of Charlemagne's government, until his later years, his court moved often and made use of other palaces at Frankfurt, Ingelheim and Nijmegen. The use of such structures would signal the beginnings of the palace system of government used by the Carolingian court throughout reigns of many Carolingian rulers. Stuart Airlie suggests that there were over 150 palaces throughout the Carolingian World which would provide the setting for court activity.\nPalaces were not merely locations of administrative government but also stood as important symbols. Under Charlemagne, their excellence was a translation of the treasure built up from conquest into a symbolic permanence as well as exclaiming royal authority. Contemporary chronicler Einhard suggests the construction of so-called 'public buildings' was a testament to Charlemagne's greatness and likeness to the emperors of antiquity and this connection was certainly capitalised upon by the imagery of palace decorations. Ingelheim is a particular example of such symbolism and thus the importance of the palace system in more than mere governance. The palace chapel is described as \"lined with images from the Bible\" and the hall of the palace \"decorated with a picture cycle celebrating the deeds of great kings,\" including rulers of antiquity as well as Carolingian rulers such as Charles Martel and Pippin III.\nLouis the Pious used the palace system much to the same effect as Charlemagne during his reign as king of Aquitaine, rotating his court between four winter palaces throughout the region. During his reign as emperor, he used Aachen, Ingelheim, Frankfurt, and Mainz, which were almost always the locations for general assemblies held \"two or three [times] a year in the period 816\u201328...\" and while he was not an immobile ruler, his reign has certainly been described as more static. In this way, the palace system can also been seen as a tool of continuity in governance. After the splintering of the empire, the palace system continued to be used by succeeding Carolingian rulers with Charles the Bald centring his power at Compi\u00e8gne, where the palace chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary in 877, something remarked on as a sign of continuity with Aachen's Mother of God chapel. For Louis the German, Frankfurt has been deemed his own 'neo-Aachen' and Charles the Fat's palace at S\u00e9lestat in Alsace was designed specifically to imitate Aachen.\nThe palace system as an idea for Carolingian central administration and governance has been challenged by historian F. L. Ganshof, who argues that the palaces of the Carolingians \"contained nothing resembling the specialised services and departments available at the same period to the Byzantine emperor or the caliph of Baghdad.\" However, further reading in the works of Carolingian historians such as Matthew Innes, Rosamond McKitterick, and Stuart Airlie suggest that the use of palaces were important in the evolution of Carolingian governance, and Janet Nelson argues \"palaces are places from which power emanates and is exercised...\" and the importance of palaces to Carolingian administration, learning, and legitimacy has been widely argued.\nHousehold.\nThe royal household was an itinerant body (until c. 802) that moved around the kingdom making sure good government was upheld in the localities. The most important positions were the chaplain (who was responsible for all ecclesiastical affairs in the kingdom) and the count of the palace (count palatine) (who had supreme control over the household). It also included more minor officials e.g. chamberlain, seneschal, and marshal. The household sometimes led the army (e.g. Seneschal Andorf against the Bretons in 786).\nPossibly associated with the chaplain and the royal chapel was the office of the chancellor, head of the chancery, a non-permanent writing office. The charters produced were rudimentary and mostly to do with land deeds. There are 262 surviving charters from Charles\u2019 reign as opposed to 40 from Pepin's and 350 from Louis the Pious.\nOfficials.\nThere are three main offices that enforced Carolingian authority in the localities:\nThe Comes (). Appointed by Charles to administer a county. The Carolingian Empire (except Bavaria) was divided into between 110 and 600 counties, each divided into \"centenae\", which were under the control of a vicar. At first, they were royal agents sent out by Charles but after c. 802 they were important local magnates. They were responsible for justice, enforcing capitularies, levying soldiers, receiving tolls and dues, and maintaining roads and bridges. They could technically be dismissed by the king, but many offices became hereditary. They were sometimes corrupt, although many were exemplary e.g. Count Eric of Friuli. Provincial governors eventually evolved who supervised several counts.\nThe Missi Dominici (). Originally appointed ad hoc, a reform in 802 led to the office becoming a permanent one. The \"Missi Dominici\" were sent out in pairs. One was an ecclesiastic and one secular. Their status as high officials was thought to safeguard them from the temptation of taking bribes. They made four journeys a year in their local \"missaticum,\" each lasting a month, and were responsible for making the royal will and capitularies known, judging cases and occasionally raising armies.\nThe Vassi Dominici. These were the king's vassals and were usually the sons of powerful men, holding \u2018benefices\u2019 and forming a contingent in the royal army. They also went on ad hoc missions.\nLegal system.\nThe maintenance and reform of the secular legal system was of considerable importance to the Carolingian empire, particularly to Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. The legal structure was founded upon the principle of the plurality of law, which had been inherited from the Merovingian dynasty. The principle held that the different national groups in a multi-ethnic empire were entitled to be tried under the law of their nation wherever the court was sitting.\nThe written law codes applicable to the various nationalities were referred to under the collective title of the \"leges barbarorum\". The law code relating to the Franks was the Salic Law in Neustria and the Ripuarian Law in Austrasia. To both codes were added the law codes from the empire's newly acquired territories. The pre-existing written law codes of the Lombards (Edictum Rothari) and the Burgundians (Lex Burgundionum) both of which were influenced by Roman law were incorporated into the Carolingian legal system. Other national groups such as the Thuringians, Saxons and Frisians had relied on the oral transmission of the law. Einhard recorded that after 800 Charlemagne wanted to rectify the imperfections in the legal system and commanded that all the unwritten laws of his people be put into writing. According to Einhard however Charlemagne did not accomplish more than an incomplete revision. Through a series of capitularies Charlemagne did succeed in promulgating laws which applied to the whole empire and also applying revisions and additions to the laws of each of the Carolingian regnums. Recent scholarship has held that there was strong legal literacy throughout the empire based on the distribution of capitularies which were communicated throughout the empire by the \"Missi Dominici.\"\nBasic justice was dispensed at a public assembly known as the \"mallus,\" presided over by the count, who was a local administrator and military leaders assigned by the palace to a specific area. The count was assisted by assessors drawn from the good men of the locality, who acted as a form of jury. As part of his reforms and to ensure the correct application of the law, Charlemagne replaced local assessors with officials known as the \"scabini\". The \"scabini\" were royal officials who through experience had gained knowledge of the laws of the empire. In the absence of the count the \"mallus\" could be conducted by inferior law officers vicars (\"vicarius\") and centeniers (\"centenaries\"). But In an order of 810 Charlemagne prohibited the inferior law officers from presiding at the \"mallus\" where a case could result in a sentence of death, affect personal freedom or real property. Such cases could only be presided over by a count or a \"Missi Dominici.\" The \"missi\" in addition to their duties of inspection and promulgation of the royal will, were commanded in 779 by the Capitulary of Herstal to dispense justice. \nThe Carolingian legal system was a single procedure as an appeal process was unknown under Germanic law. A free man could however petition the royal palace if he believed that he had been treated unfairly by the court system.Carolingian royal palaces served as central institutions in the judicial system and when the king was in residence the palaces could serve as a court of justice, in which the principle of the plularity of law did not apply. Einhard described that even when dressing Charlemagne would rule on a case as if he were sitting in a tribunal. \u00a0\nMany of the cases brought before the courts were resolved through the production of documentary evidence. Where witnesses were required Charlemagne introduced reforms to the procedures to be adopted. Oath helping, whereby a party to proceedings called others to swear that he was truthful, was replaced by an adversarial process in which witnesses to the facts were called before the court individually. Capitularies also introduced the system of the inquisition through which judges were empowered by the king to summon local witnesses who were credible and informed. \nCoinage.\nCoinage had a strong association with the Roman Empire, and Charlemagne took up its regulation with his other imperial duties. The Carolingians exercised controls over the silver coinage of the realm, controlling its composition and value. The name of the emperor, not of the minter, appeared on the coins. Charlemagne worked to suppress mints in northern Germany. Charlemagne also worked to make his coins in the visage of old imperial Roman coins. The coins printed under the reign of Charlemagne show a rightwards facing bust of the emperor wearing a Roman military cloak and a laurel wreath. These Frankish coins copy late Antique Roman coins, having terms such as \"imperator augustus\" and \"karolus imperator\", harkening to back imperial Roman coins bearing the face of the old emperors.\nSubdivision.\nThe Frankish kingdom was subdivided by Charlemagne into three separate areas to make administration easier. These were the inner \"core\" of the kingdom (Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy), which were supervised directly by the missatica system and the itinerant household. Outside this was the \"regna\", where Frankish administration rested upon the counts, and outside this was the marcher areas where ruled powerful governors. These marcher lordships were present in Brittany, Spain, and Bavaria.\nCharles also created two sub-kingdoms in Aquitaine and Italy, ruled by his sons Louis and Pepin respectively. Bavaria was under the command of an autonomous governor, Gerold, until his death in 796. While Charles still had overall authority in these areas, they were fairly autonomous with their own chancery and minting facilities.\n\"Placitum generalis\".\nThe annual meeting, the \"placitum generalis\" or Marchfield, was held every year (between March and May) at a place appointed by the king. It was called for three reasons: to gather the Frankish host to go on a campaign, to discuss political and ecclesiastical matters affecting the kingdom and to legislate for them, and to make judgments. All important men had to go to the meeting, and so it was an important way for Charles to make his will known. Originally the meeting worked effectively; later it merely became a forum for discussion and for nobles to express their dissatisfaction.\nOaths.\nThe oath of fidelity was a way for Charles to ensure loyalty from all his subjects. As early as 779, he banned sworn guilds between other men so that everyone took an oath of loyalty only to him. In 789 (in response to Pepin the Hunchback's rebellion), he began legislating that everyone should swear fidelity to him as king; however, in 802, he expanded the oath greatly and made it so that all men over age 12 swore it to him.\nCapitularies.\nCapitularies were the written records of decisions made by the Carolingian kings in consultation with assemblies during the 8th and 9th century. The name comes from the Latin \"'capitula'\" for \"'chapters\"' and refers to the way these records were taken and written up, in a chapter by chapter style. S\u00f6ren Kaschke regards them as \"amongst the most important sources for the governance of the Frankish Empire in the eight and ninth century.\" The use of capitularies represented a change in the pattern of contact between the king and his provinces in the Carolingian period. The contents could include a wide range of topics, including royal orders, instructions for specific officials, deliberations of assemblies on both secular and ecclesiastical affairs as well as additions and alterations to the law.\nPrimary evidence shows that capitularies were copied and disseminated all throughout Charlemagne's empire; however, there is insufficient evidence to suggest the efficacy of the capitularies and whether they were actually put into practice throughout the realm. As Charlemagne became increasingly stationary, the amount of capitularies produced increased, and was particularly noticeable after the General Admonition of 789.\nThere has been debates over the purpose of capitularies. Some historians argue that the capitularies were nothing more than a 'royal wish-list' while others argue for capitularies representing the basis of a centralised state. Capitularies were implemented through the use of the \"missi domini\".\nSome notable capitularies from Charlemagne's reign are:\nReligion and the Church.\nCharlemagne aimed to convert all those in the Frankish kingdom to Christianity and to expand both his empire and the reach of Christianity. The 789 \"Admonitio Generalis\" pronounced Charlemagne responsible for the salvation of his subjects and set out standards of education for the clergy, who previously had been mostly illiterate. The capitulary, alongside Charlemagne's constant \"effort to promote the Christian faith and a composite Greco-Roman, Judean, and Christian learned tradition\", resulted in an empire united behind the Christian faith, overseen by bishops and abbots in their own governmental role, all under a divinely crowned Emperor. Intellectuals of the time began to be concerned with eschatology, believing 800 to be 6000 AM based on calculations from Eusebius and Jerome. Intellectuals such as Alcuin reckoned that the Charlemagne's coronation as emperor on Christmas Day 800 marked the beginning of the seventh and final age of the world. These concerns may explain why Charlemagne aimed to have everyone engage in acts of penance.\nEmperors.\nFor other Carolingian kings, see List of Frankish kings. For the later emperors, see Holy Roman Emperor.\nLegacy.\nDespite the relatively short existence of the Carolingian Empire when compared to other European dynastic empires, its legacy far outlasts the state that had forged it. In historiographical terms, the Carolingian Empire is seen as the beginning of 'feudalism'; or rather, the notion of feudalism held in the modern era. Though most historians would be naturally hesitant to assign Charles Martel and his descendants as founders of feudalism, it is obvious that a Carolingian 'template' lends to the structure of central medieval political culture. Yet some argue against this assumption; Marc Bloch disdains this hunt for feudalism's birth as \"the idol of origins.\" A concerted effort can be noted by Carolingian authors, such as Einhard, to establish a shift in continuity from the Merovingian to the Carolingian, likely where no such groundbreaking difference between the two ever existed.\nThe unifying power of Charlemagne has been wielded by a succession of European rulers to bolster their own regimes; much in the same vein as Charlemagne echoed elements of Augustus in his rising years. The Ottonian dynasty, which succeeded the title of Holy Roman Emperor, magnified distant ties to the Carolingians to legitimise their dynastic ambitions as 'successors'. Four of the five Ottonian emperors crowned themselves in Charlemagne's palace in Aachen, likely to establish a continuity from the Carolingians. Even with their dynasty originating from Charlemagne's arch-foe Saxony, Ottonians still linked their dynasty to the Carolingians through direct and indirect means. Iconography of Charlemagne was utilised in later medieval periods, where he is depicted as a model knight and paragon of chivalry.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris.\nThe cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary (\"Our Lady\"), is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, including its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration. Notre-Dame is also exceptional for its three pipe organs (one historic) and its immense church bells.\nThe construction of the cathedral began in 1163 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely completed by 1260, though it was modified in succeeding centuries. In the 1790s, during the French Revolution, Notre-Dame suffered extensive desecration; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral hosted the coronation of Napoleon and the funerals of many of the French Republic's presidents. The 1831 publication of Victor Hugo's novel \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" (English title: \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\") inspired interest which led to restoration between 1844 and 1864, supervised by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. On 26 August 1944, the Liberation of Paris from German occupation was celebrated in Notre-Dame with the singing of the Magnificat. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's fa\u00e7ade was cleaned of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000. A fire in April 2019 caused serious damage, closing the cathedral for extensive and costly repairs; it reopened in December 2024.\nNotre-Dame is a widely recognised symbol of both the city of Paris and the French nation. In 1805, the Pope awarded it honorary status as a minor basilica. As the cathedral of the archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the \"cathedra\" or seat of the archbishop of Paris (currently Laurent Ulrich). In the early 21st century, about 12\u00a0million people visited Notre-Dame annually, making it the most visited monument in Paris.\nSince 1905, Notre-Dame, like the other cathedrals in France, has been owned by the French government, with the exclusive rights of use granted to the French Roman Catholic Church. The French government is responsible for its maintenance.\nOver time, the cathedral has gradually been stripped of many decorations and artworks. It still contains Gothic, Baroque, and 19th-century sculptures, 17th- and early 18th-century altarpieces, and some of the most important relics in Christendom, including the crown of thorns, and a sliver and nail from the True Cross.\nKey dates.\n4th century \u2013 Cathedral of Saint \u00c9tienne, dedicated to Saint Stephen, built just west of present cathedral\nHistory.\nIt is believed that before the arrival of Christianity in France, a Gallo-Roman temple dedicated to Jupiter stood on the site of Notre-Dame. Evidence for this includes the Pillar of the Boatmen, discovered beneath the cathedral in 1710. In the 4th or 5th century, a large early Christian church, the Cathedral of Saint \u00c9tienne, was built on the site, close to the royal palace. The entrance was situated about west of the present west front of Notre-Dame, and the apse was located about where the west fa\u00e7ade is today. It was roughly half the size of the later Notre-Dame, long\u2014and separated into nave and four aisles by marble columns, then decorated with mosaics.\nThe last church before the cathedral of Notre-Dame was a Romanesque remodelling of Saint-\u00c9tienne that, although enlarged and remodelled, was found to be unfit for the growing population of Paris. A baptistery, the Church of Saint-John-le-Rond, built about 452, was located on the north side of the west front of Notre-Dame until the work of Jacques-Germain Soufflot in the 18th century.\nIn 1160, the bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, decided to build a new and much larger church. He summarily demolished the earlier cathedral and recycled its materials. Sully decided that the new church should be built in the Gothic style, which had been inaugurated at the royal abbey of Saint Denis in the late 1130s.\nConstruction.\nThe chronicler Jean de Saint-Victor recorded in the \"Memorial Historiarum\" that the construction of Notre-Dame began between 24 March and 25 April 1163 with the laying of the cornerstone in the presence of King Louis VII and Pope Alexander III. Four phases of construction took place under bishops Maurice de Sully and Eudes de Sully (not related to Maurice), according to masters whose names have been lost. Analysis of vault stones that fell in the 2019 fire shows that they were quarried in Vexin, a county northwest of Paris, and presumably brought up the Seine by boat.\nThe first phase began with the construction of the choir and its two ambulatories. According to Robert of Torigni, the choir was completed in 1177 and the high altar consecrated on 19 May 1182 by Cardinal Henri de Ch\u00e2teau-Mar\u00e7ay, the Papal legate in Paris, and Maurice de Sully. The second phase, from 1182 to 1190, concerned the construction of the four sections of the nave behind the choir and its aisles to the height of the clerestories. It began after the completion of the choir but ended before the final allotted section of the nave was finished. Beginning in 1190, the bases of the fa\u00e7ade were put in place, and the first traverses were completed. Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem called for the Third Crusade in 1185 from the still-incomplete cathedral.\nLouis IX deposited the relics of the passion of Christ, which included the crown of thorns, a nail from the True Cross and a sliver of the True Cross, which he had purchased at great expense from the Latin Emperor Baldwin II, in the cathedral during the construction of the Sainte-Chapelle. An under-shirt, believed to have belonged to Louis, was added to the collection of relics at some time after his death.\nTransepts were added at the choir, where the altar was located, in order to bring more light into the centre of the church. The use of simpler four-part rather than six-part rib vaults meant that the roofs were stronger and could be higher. After Bishop Maurice de Sully's death in 1196, his successor, Eudes de Sully oversaw the completion of the transepts, and continued work on the nave, which was nearing completion at the time of his death in 1208. By this time, the western fa\u00e7ade was already largely built; it was completed around the mid-1240s. Between 1225 and 1250 the upper gallery of the nave was constructed, along with the two towers on the west fa\u00e7ade.\nAnother significant change came in the mid-13th century, when the transepts were remodelled in the latest Rayonnant style; in the late 1240s Jean de Chelles added a gabled portal to the north transept topped by a spectacular rose window. Shortly afterward (from 1258) Pierre de Montreuil executed a similar scheme on the southern transept. Both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture; the south portal depicts scenes from the lives of Saint Stephen and of various local saints, and the north portal featured the infancy of Christ and the story of Theophilus in the tympanum, with a highly influential statue of the Virgin and Child in the trumeau. Master builders Pierre de Chelles, Jean Ravy, Jean le Bouteiller, and Raymond du Temple succeeded de Chelles and de Montreuil and then each other in the construction of the cathedral. Ravy completed de Chelles's rood screen and chevet chapels, then began the flying buttresses of the choir. Jean le Bouteiller, Ravy's nephew, succeeded him in 1344 and was himself replaced on his death in 1363 by his deputy, Raymond du Temple.\nPhilip the Fair opened the first Estates General in the cathedral in 1302.\nAn important innovation in the 12th century was the introduction of the flying buttress. Before the buttresses, all of the weight of the roof pressed outward and down to the walls, and the abutments supporting them. With the flying buttress, the weight was carried by the ribs of the vault entirely outside the structure to a series of counter-supports, which were topped with stone pinnacles which gave them greater weight. The buttresses meant that the walls could be higher and thinner, and could have larger windows. The date of the first buttresses is not known with precision beyond an installation date in the 12th century. Art historian Andrew Tallon has argued, based on detailed laser scans of the entire structure, that the buttresses were part of the original design. According to Tallon, the scans indicate that \"the upper part of the building has not moved one smidgen in 800 years,\" whereas if they were added later some movement from prior to their addition would be expected. Tallon thus concluded that flying buttresses were present from the outset. The first buttresses were replaced by larger and stronger ones in the 14th century; these had a reach of between the walls and counter-supports.\nJohn of Jandun recognized the cathedral as one of Paris's three most important buildings [prominent structures] in his 1323 \"Treatise on the Praises of Paris\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That most glorious church of the most glorious Virgin Mary, mother of God, deservedly shines out, like the sun among stars. And although some speakers, by their own free judgment, because [they are] able to see only a few things easily, may say that some other is more beautiful, I believe, however, respectfully, that, if they attend more diligently to the whole and the parts, they will quickly retract this opinion. Where indeed, I ask, would they find two towers of such magnificence and perfection, so high, so large, so strong, clothed round about with such multiple varieties of ornaments? Where, I ask, would they find such a multipartite arrangement of so many lateral vaults, above and below? Where, I ask, would they find such light-filled amenities as the many surrounding chapels? Furthermore, let them tell me in what church I may see such a large cross, of which one arm separates the choir from the nave. Finally, I would willingly learn where [there are] two such circles, situated opposite each other in a straight line, which on account of their appearance are given the name of the fourth vowel [O]; among which smaller orbs and circles, with wondrous artifice, so that some arranged circularly, others angularly, surround windows ruddy with precious colours and beautiful with the most subtle figures of the pictures. In fact, I believe that this church offers the carefully discerning such cause for admiration that its inspection can scarcely sate the soul.\u2014\u200a\n15th\u201318th century.\nOn 16 December 1431, the boy-king Henry VI of England was crowned king of France in Notre-Dame, aged ten, the traditional coronation church of Reims Cathedral being under French control.\nDuring the Renaissance, the Gothic style fell out of style, and the internal pillars and walls of Notre-Dame were covered with tapestries.\nIn 1548, rioting Huguenots damaged some of the statues of Notre-Dame, considering them idolatrous.\nThe fountain in Notre-Dame's parvis was added in 1625 to provide nearby Parisians with running water.\nSince 1449, the Parisian goldsmith guild had made regular donations to the cathedral chapter. In 1630, the guild began donating a large altarpiece every year on 1 May. These works came to be known as the \"grands mays\". The subject matter was restricted to episodes from the Acts of the Apostles. The prestigious commission was awarded to the most prominent painters and, after 1648, members of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale.\nSeventy-six paintings had been donated by 1708, when the custom was discontinued for financial reasons. Those works were confiscated in 1793 and the majority were subsequently dispersed among regional museums in France. Those that remained in the cathedral were removed or relocated within the building by the 19th-century restorers.\nThirteen of the \"grands mays\" hang in Notre-Dame; these paintings suffered water damage during the fire of 2019 and were removed for conservation.\nAn altarpiece depicting The Visitation, painted by Jean Jouvenet in 1707, was also in the cathedral.\nThe canon Antoine de La Porte commissioned for Louis XIV six paintings depicting the life of the Virgin Mary for the choir. At this same time, Charles de La Fosse painted his \"Adoration of the Magi\", now in the Louvre. Louis Antoine de Noailles, archbishop of Paris, extensively modified the roof of Notre-Dame in 1726, renovating its framing and removing the gargoyles with lead gutters. Noailles also strengthened the buttresses, galleries, terraces, and vaults. In 1756, the cathedral's canons decided that its interior was too dark. The medieval stained glass windows, except the rosettes, were removed and replaced with plain, white glass panes. Lastly, Jacques-Germain Soufflot was tasked with the modification of the portals at the front of the cathedral to allow processions to enter more easily.\nFrench Revolution and Napoleon.\nAfter the French Revolution in 1789, Notre-Dame and the rest of the church's property in France was seized and made public property. The cathedral was rededicated in 1793 to the Cult of Reason, and then to the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1794. During this time, many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered. The twenty-eight statues of biblical kings located at the west fa\u00e7ade, mistaken for statues of French kings, were beheaded. Many of the heads were found during a 1977 excavation nearby, and are on display at the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny. For a time the Goddess of Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars. The cathedral's great bells escaped being melted down. All of the other large statues on the fa\u00e7ade, with the exception of the statue of the Virgin Mary on the portal of the cloister, were destroyed. The cathedral came to be used as a warehouse for the storage of food and other non-religious purposes.\nWith the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon Bonaparte restored Notre-Dame to the Catholic Church; this was finalised on 18 April 1802. Napoleon also named Paris's new bishop, Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, who restored the cathedral's interior. Charles Percier and Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9onard Fontaine made quasi-Gothic modifications to Notre-Dame for the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor of the French within the cathedral. The building's exterior was whitewashed and the interior decorated in Neoclassical style, then in vogue.\n19th-century restoration.\nIn the decades after the Napoleonic Wars, Notre-Dame fell into such a state of disrepair that Paris officials considered its demolition. Victor Hugo, who admired the cathedral, wrote the novel \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" (published in English as \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\") in 1831 to save Notre-Dame. The book was an enormous success, raising awareness of the cathedral's decaying state. The same year as Hugo's novel was published, anti-Legitimists plundered Notre-Dame's sacristy. In 1844 King Louis Philippe ordered that the church be restored.\nThe architect who had been in charge of Notre-Dame's maintenance, \u00c9tienne-Hippolyte Godde, was dismissed. Jean-Baptiste Lassus and Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, who had distinguished themselves with the restoration of the nearby Sainte-Chapelle, were appointed in 1844. The next year, Viollet-le-Duc submitted a budget of 3,888,500 francs, which was reduced to 2,650,000 francs, for the restoration of Notre-Dame and the construction of a new sacristy building. This budget was exhausted in 1850, and work stopped as Viollet-le-Duc made proposals for more money. In totality, the restoration cost over 12\u00a0million francs. Supervising a large team of sculptors, glass makers and other craftsmen, and working from drawings or engravings, Viollet-le-Duc remade or added decorations if he felt they were in the spirit of the original style. One of the latter items was a taller and more ornate fl\u00e8che, to replace the original 13th-century fl\u00e8che, which had been removed in 1786. The decoration of the restoration included a bronze roof statue of Saint Thomas that resembles Viollet-le-Duc, as well as the sculpture of mythical creatures on the \"Galerie des Chim\u00e8res\".\nThe construction of the sacristy was especially financially costly. To secure a firm foundation, it was necessary for Viollet-le-Duc's labourers to dig . Master glassworkers meticulously copied styles of the 13th century, as written about by art historians Antoine Lusson and Adolphe Napol\u00e9on Didron.\nDuring the Paris Commune of March through May 1871, the cathedral and other churches were closed, and some two hundred priests and the Archbishop of Paris were taken as hostages. In May, during the Semaine sanglante of \"Bloody Week\", as the army recaptured the city, the Communards targeted the cathedral, along with the Tuileries Palace and other landmarks, for destruction; the Communards piled the furniture together in order to burn the cathedral. The arson was halted when the Communard government realised that the fire would also destroy the neighbouring H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital, filled with hundreds of patients.\n20th century.\nDuring the liberation of Paris in August 1944, the cathedral suffered some minor damage from stray bullets. Some of the medieval glass was damaged, and was replaced by glass with modern abstract designs. On 26 August, a special Mass was held in the cathedral to celebrate the liberation of Paris from the Germans; it was attended by General Charles De Gaulle and General Philippe Leclerc.\nIn 1963, on the initiative of culture minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux and to mark the 800th anniversary of the cathedral, the fa\u00e7ade was cleaned of the centuries of soot and grime, restoring it to its original off-white colour.\nOn 19 January 1969, vandals placed a North Vietnamese flag at the top of the fl\u00e8che, and sabotaged the stairway leading to it. The flag was cut from the fl\u00e8che by Paris Fire Brigade Sergeant Raymond Belle in a helicopter mission, the first of its kind in France.\nThe Requiem Mass of Charles de Gaulle was held in Notre-Dame on 12 November 1970. On 26 June 1971, Philippe Petit walked across a tight-rope strung between Notre-Dame's two bell towers entertaining spectators.\nAfter the Magnificat of 30 May 1980, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass on the parvis of the cathedral.\nThe Requiem Mass of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was held at the cathedral, as with past French heads of state, on 11 January 1996.\nThe stone masonry of the cathedral's exterior had deteriorated in the 19th and 20th centuries due to increased air pollution in Paris, which accelerated erosion of decorations and discoloured the stone. By the late 1980s, several gargoyles and turrets had fallen or become too loose to remain safely in place. A decade-long renovation programme began in 1991 and replaced much of the exterior, with care given to retain the authentic architectural elements of the cathedral, including rigorous inspection of new limestone blocks. A discreet system of electrical wires, not visible from below, was also installed on the roof to deter pigeons. The cathedral's pipe organ was upgraded with a computerised system to control the mechanical connections to the pipes. The west face was cleaned and restored in time for millennium celebrations in December 1999.\n21st century.\nThe Requiem Mass of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, former archbishop of Paris and Jewish convert to Catholicism, was held in Notre-Dame on 10 August 2007.\nThe set of four 19th-century bells at the top of the northern towers at Notre-Dame were melted down and recast into new bronze bells in 2013, to celebrate the building's 850th anniversary. They were designed to recreate the sound of the cathedral's original bells from the 17th century. Despite the 1990s renovation, the cathedral had continued to show signs of deterioration that prompted the national government to propose a new renovation program in the late 2010s. The entire renovation was estimated to cost \u20ac100\u00a0million, which the archbishop of Paris planned to raise through funds from the national government and private donations. A \u20ac6\u00a0million renovation of the cathedral's fl\u00e8che began in late 2018 and continued into the following year, requiring the temporary removal of copper statues on the roof and other decorative elements.\nNotre-Dame began a year-long celebration of the 850th anniversary of the laying of the first building block for the cathedral on 12 December 2012. On 21 May 2013, Dominique Venner, a historian and white nationalist, placed a letter on the church altar and shot himself, dying instantly. Around 1,500 visitors were evacuated from the cathedral.\nFrench police arrested two people on 8 September 2016 after a car containing seven gas canisters filled with diesel fuel was found near Notre-Dame.\nOn 10 February 2017, French police arrested four people in Montpellier known to have ties to radical Islamist organisations on charges of plotting to travel to Paris and attack the cathedral. On 6 June, visitors were shut inside Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris after a man with a hammer attacked a police officer outside.\n2019 fire.\nOn 15 April 2019 the cathedral caught fire, destroying the fl\u00e8che and the \"forest\" of oak roof beams supporting the lead roof. It was speculated that the fire was linked to ongoing renovation work.\nThe fire broke out in the attic of the cathedral at 18:18, investigators concluded. The smoke detectors immediately signalled the fire to a cathedral employee, who did not summon the fire brigade but instead sent a cathedral guard to investigate. The guard was sent to the wrong location, to the attic of the adjoining sacristy, and reported there was no fire. About 15 minutes later the error was discovered and the guard's supervisor told him to go to the correct location. The fire brigade was still not notified. By the time the guard had climbed the 300 steps to the cathedral attic, the fire was well advanced. The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guard had returned from the attic and reported a now-raging fire, and more than half an hour after the fire alarm had begun sounding. Firefighters arrived in less than ten minutes.\nThe cathedral's fl\u00e8che collapsed at 19:50, bringing down 750 tonnes of stone and lead. The firefighters inside were ordered down. By this time the fire had spread to the north tower, where the eight bells were. The firefighters concentrated their efforts in the tower. They feared that, if the bells fell, they could wreck the tower, and endanger the structure of the other tower and the whole cathedral. They had to ascend a stairway threatened by fire, and to contend with low water pressure for their hoses. As others watered the stairway and the roof, a team of 20 firefighters climbed the narrow stairway of the south tower, crossed to the north tower, lowered hoses to be connected to fire engines outside the cathedral, and sprayed water on the fire beneath the bells. By 21:45, they brought the fire under control.\nThe main structure was intact; firefighters saved the fa\u00e7ade, towers, walls, buttresses, and stained-glass windows. The stone vaulting that forms the ceiling of the cathedral had several holes but was otherwise intact. The Great Organ, which has over 8,000 pipes and was built by Fran\u00e7ois Thierry in the 18th century, was also saved but damaged by water. Because of the renovation, the copper statues on the fl\u00e8che had been removed before the fire. About 500 firefighters helped to battle the fire, President Emmanuel Macron said. One firefighter was seriously injured and two police officers were hurt during the blaze.\nNo Christmas Mass was held in 2019 for the first time in more than 200 years. The first cathedral choir performance since the fire took place in December 2020; only eight members sang because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. A video of the event aired just before midnight on 24 December.\nStabilisation of the building.\nImmediately after the fire, Macron promised that Notre-Dame would be restored, and called for the work to be completed within five years. An international architectural competition was announced to redesign the fl\u00e8che and roof. The announcement drew criticism in the international press from heritage academics and professionals who faulted the French government for being too focused on quickly building a new fl\u00e8che, and neglecting to frame its response holistically as an inclusive social process encompassing the whole building and its long-term users. A new law was drafted to make Notre-Dame exempt from existing heritage laws and procedures, which prompted an open letter to Macron signed by over 1,170 heritage experts urging respect for existing regulations. The law, which passed on 11 May 2019, was hotly debated in the French National Assembly, with opponents accusing Macron's administration of using Notre-Dame for political grandstanding, and defenders arguing the need for expediency and tax breaks to encourage philanthropic giving.\nMacron suggested he was open to a \"contemporary architectural gesture\". Even before the competition rules were announced, architects around the world offered suggestions: the proposals included a fl\u00e8che made of carbon fibre, covered with gold leaf; a roof built of stained glass; a greenhouse; a garden with trees, open to the sky; and a column of light pointed upwards. A poll published in the French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" on 8 May 2019 showed that 55% of French respondents wanted a fl\u00e8che identical to the original. French culture minister Franck Riester promised that the restoration would not be hasty. On 29 July 2019, the French National Assembly enacted a law requiring that the restoration must \"preserve the historic, artistic and architectural interest of the monument.\"\nIn October 2019, the French government announced that the first stage of reconstruction, the stabilising of the structure against collapse, would last until the end of 2020. In December 2019, Monseigneur Patrick Chauvet, the rector of the cathedral, said there was still a 50% chance that Notre-Dame could not be saved due to the risk of the remaining scaffolding falling onto the three damaged vaults. Reconstruction could not begin before early 2021. Macron announced that he hoped the reconstructed Cathedral could be finished in time for the opening of the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nThe first task of the restoration was the removal of 250\u2013300 tonnes of melted metal tubes, the remains of the scaffolding, which could have fallen onto the vaults and caused further structural damage. This began in February 2020. A crane high was put in place next to the cathedral to help remove the scaffolding. The work was completed in November 2020. Wooden support beams were added to stabilise the flying buttresses and other structures.\nOn 10 April 2020, the archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, and a handful of participants, all in protective clothing to prevent exposure to lead dust, performed a Good Friday service inside the cathedral. Music was provided by the violinist Renaud Capu\u00e7on; the lectors were the actors Philippe Torreton and Judith Chemla. Chemla gave an a cappella rendition of \"Ave Maria\".\nHeading reconstruction.\nIn February 2021, the selection of oak trees to replace the fl\u00e8che and roof timbers destroyed by the fire began. A thousand mature trees were chosen from the forests of France, each of a diameter of and a height of , and an age of several hundred years. Once cut, the trees had to dry for 12 to 18 months. The trees were to be replaced by new plantings. Two years after the fire, a news report stated that: \"there is still a hole on top of the church. They're also building a replica of the church's spire\". More oak trees needed to be shipped to Paris, where they would need to be dried before use. The oaks used to make the framework were tested and selected by Sylvatest.\nOn 18 September 2021, the public agency overseeing the Cathedral stated that the safety work was completed, the cathedral was fully secured, and that reconstruction would begin within a few months.\nResearch.\nIn 2022, a preventive dig carried out between February and April before the construction of a scaffold for reconstructing the cathedral's fl\u00e8che unearthed several statues and tombs under the cathedral. One of the discoveries was a 14th-century lead sarcophagus found below where the transept crosses the church's 12th-century nave. On 14 April 2022, France's National Preventive Archaeological Research Institute (Inrap) announced that the sarcophagus was extracted from the cathedral and that scientists had examined the casket using an endoscopic camera, revealing the upper part of a skeleton. An opening was discovered below the cathedral floor, likely made around 1230 when the Gothic cathedral was first under construction; inside were fragments of a choir screen dating from the 13th century that had been destroyed in the early 18th century. In March 2023, archaeologists uncovered thousands of metal staples in various parts of the cathedral, some dating back to the early 1160s. The archaeologists concluded that \"Notre Dame is now unquestionably the first known Gothic cathedral where iron was massively used to bind stones as a proper construction material.\"\nReopening.\nThe cathedral reopened on 7 December 2024 in a ceremony presided over by Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, and attended by 1,500 world leaders and dignitaries such as US President-elect Donald Trump, US first lady Jill Biden, Britain's Prince William, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pope Francis declined an invitation from Macron to attend the reopening, holding a consistory in Rome to create 21 new cardinals on that day and planning a visit to the French island of Corsica the following week.\nColour and controversy.\nThe colour of the restored interior would be \"a shock\" to some returning visitors, according to General Jean-Louis Georgelin, the French army officer heading the restoration. \"The whiteness under the dirt was quite spectacular\". The stone was sprayed with a latex solution to remove accumulated grime and soot. The cleaning of the church interior with latex solutions was criticised by Michael Daley of Artwatch UK, referring to the earlier cleaning of St Paul's Cathedral in London. He asked, \"Is there any good basis for wishing to present an artificially brightened and ahistorical white interior?\" Jean-Michel Guilemont of the French Ministry of culture responded, \"The interior elevations will regain their original colour, since the chapels and side aisles were very dirty. Of course it is not a white colour. The stone has a blonde colour, and the architects are very attentive to obtaining a patina which respects the centuries\".\nNew window controversy.\nA new controversy arose in late 2024 over a proposal by French president Macron and the archbishop Laurent Ulrich to replace six stained glass windows installed in chapels in the 19th century by Viollet-le-Duc and undamaged by the fire, with six modernist windows designed by contemporary artist Claire Tabouret. Tabouret won a competition sponsored by the French government for a new window design. Her proposed windows would realistically depict people from different cultures praying. The proposed windows are strongly opposed by preservationists, who want the cathedral to be restored exactly as it was before the fire.\nFurthermore, Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of a museum dedicated to Notre-Dame within the H\u00f4tel-Dieu.\nTowers and the fl\u00e8che.\nThe two towers are high. The towers were the last major element of the cathedral to be constructed. The south tower was built first, between 1220 and 1240, and the north tower between 1235 and 1250. The newer north tower is slightly larger, as can be seen when they are viewed from directly in front of the church. The \"contrefort\" or buttress of the north tower is also larger. The cathedral's main peal of bells is within these towers.\nThe south tower is accessible to visitors by a stairway, whose entrance is on the south side of the tower. The stairway has 387 steps, and has a stop at the Gothic hall at the level of the rose window, where visitors could look over the parvis and see a collection of paintings and sculpture from earlier periods of the cathedral's history.\nThe cathedral's fl\u00e8che (or spirelet) was located over the transept. The original fl\u00e8che was constructed in the 13th century, probably between 1220 and 1230. It was battered, weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries, and was removed in 1786. During the 19th-century restoration, Viollet-le-Duc recreated it, making a new version of oak covered with lead. The entire fl\u00e8che weighed 750 tonnes.\nThe cockerel weathervane on top of the fl\u00e8che has both a religious and political symbolism. The cockerel is the symbol of the French state, which since 1905 has owned Notre-Dame and the other 86 cathedrals in France. It is found over all French cathedrals, as well as over the entrance of the Elys\u00e9e Palace, the residence of the French president, on other government buildings, and on French postage stamps.\nFollowing Viollet-le-Duc's plans, the fl\u00e8che was surrounded by copper statues of the Twelve Apostles\u200d\u2014\u200ca group of three at each point of the compass. In front of each group is a symbol representing one of the four evangelists: a winged ox for Saint Luke, a lion for Saint Mark, an eagle for Saint John and an angel for Saint Matthew. Just days prior to the fire, the statues were removed for restoration. While in place, they had faced outwards towards Paris, except one: the statue of Saint Thomas, the patron saint of architects, faced the fl\u00e8che, and had the features of Viollet-le-Duc.\nThe cockerel weathervane at the top of the fl\u00e8che contained three relics: a tiny piece from the Crown of Thorns in the cathedral treasury, and relics of Saint Denis and Saint Genevieve, patron saints of Paris. They were placed there in 1935 by Archbishop Jean Verdier, to protect the congregation from lightning or other harm. The cockerel was recovered in the rubble shortly after the fire, and has since been on display inside the reopened cathedral.\nThe new fl\u00e8che was put in place on 16 December 2023, and a new gilded cockerel sculpture, designed by architect Philippe Villeneuve, was also installed, containing the same relics as old fl\u00e8che, as well as the names of two thousand people who had participated in the reconstruction. Getting to work, Villeneuve's team scrutinised the journal in which Viollet-le-Duc had entered all the details of Notre-Dame's 19th century restoration work.\nIconography.\nThe Gothic cathedral was a \"liber pauperum\", a \"poor people's book\", covered with sculptures vividly illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were, at the time, illiterate. To add to the effect, all of the sculpture on the fa\u00e7ades was originally painted and gilded.\nThe tympanum over the central portal on the west fa\u00e7ade, facing the square, vividly illustrates the Last Judgment, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary.\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of grotesques or monsters. These included the gargoyle, the chimera, a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the strix or stryge, a creature resembling an owl or bat, which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet Ovid, who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings. They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.\nThe gargoyles, which were added about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows where it might erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.\nAmid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy. The central portal of the west fa\u00e7ade is decorated with carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy. The central pillar of the central door of Notre-Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a sceptre in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolising the seven steps alchemists followed in trying to transform ordinary metals into gold. On each side of the west fa\u00e7ade, there are statues of Ecclesia and Synagoga. The statues represent supersessionism, the Christian belief that Christianity has replaced Judaism.\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the fa\u00e7ade in the 17th and 18th centuries, or were destroyed during the French Revolution. They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by Viollet-le-Duc, during the 19th-century restoration.\nStained glass.\nThe stained glass windows of Notre-Dame, particularly the three rose windows, are among the most famous features of the cathedral. The west rose window, over the portals, was the first and smallest of the roses in Notre-Dame. It is in diameter, and was made in about 1225, with the pieces of glass set in a thick circular stone frame. None of the original glass remains in this window; it was recreated in the 19th century.\nThe two transept windows are larger and contain a greater proportion of glass than the rose on the west fa\u00e7ade, because the new system of buttresses made the nave walls thinner and stronger. The north rose was created in about 1250, and the south rose in about 1260. The south rose in the transept is in diameter; with the \"claire-voie\" surrounding it, a total of . It was given to the cathedral by King Louis IX of France, known as Saint Louis.\nThe south rose has 94 medallions, arranged in four circles, depicting scenes from the life of Christ and those who witnessed his time on earth. The inner circle has twelve medallions showing the twelve apostles. During later restorations, some of these original medallions were moved to circles farther out. The next two circles depict celebrated martyrs and virgins. The fourth circle shows twenty angels, and saints important to Paris, such as Saint Denis, Margaret the Virgin with a dragon, and Saint Eustace. The third and fourth circles also have some depictions of Old Testament subjects. The third circle has some medallions with scenes from the New Testament Gospel of Matthew which date from the last quarter of the 12th century. These are the oldest glass in the window.\nAdditional scenes in the corners around the rose window include Jesus's Descent into Hell, Adam and Eve, the Resurrection of Christ. Saint Peter and Saint Paul are at the bottom of the window, and Mary Magdalene and John the Apostle at the top.\nAbove the rose was a window depicting Christ triumphant seated in the sky, surrounded by his Apostles. Below are sixteen windows with painted images of Prophets. These were painted during the restoration in the 19th century by Alfred G\u00e9renthe, under the direction of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, based upon a similar window at Chartres Cathedral.\nThe south rose had a difficult history. In 1543 it was damaged by the settling of the masonry walls, and not restored until 1725\u20131727. It was seriously damaged in the French Revolution of 1830. Rioters burned the residence of the archbishop, next to the cathedral, and many of the panes were destroyed. The window was rebuilt by Viollet-le-Duc in 1861 who rotated it by fifteen degrees to give it a clear vertical and horizontal axis, and replaced the destroyed pieces of glass with new glass in the same style. The window now contains both medieval and 19th-century glass.\nIn the 1960s, after three decades of debate, it was decided to replace many of the 19th-century grisaille windows in the nave designed by Viollet-le-Duc with new windows. The new windows, made by Jacques Le Chevallier, are without human figures and use abstract designs and colour to try to recreate the luminosity of the cathedral's interior in the 13th century.\nThe fire left the three great medieval rose windows mostly intact, but with some damage. The rector of the cathedral noted that one rose window would have to be dismantled, as it was unstable and at risk. Most of the other damaged windows were of much less historical value.\nIn early 2024 Macron proposed removing six of the seven undamaged 19th-century stained glass windows created by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc in the chapels along the south aisle of the nave, and replacing them with new windows with more contemporary designs. He invited contemporary artists to submit designs for the new windows. This proposal inspired a backlash in the press, and 140,000 people signed a petition to keep the old windows. The plan for contemporary windows was rejected by the French Commission on Architectural Monuments and Patrimony in July 2024.\nBurials and crypts.\nUnlike some other French cathedrals, Notre-Dame was originally constructed without a crypt. In the medieval period, burials were made directly into the floor of the church, or in above-ground sarcophagi, some with tomb effigies (French: \"gisant\"). High-ranking clergy and some royals were buried in the choir and apse, and many others, including lower-ranking clergy and lay people, were buried in the nave or chapels. There is no surviving complete record of the burials.\nIn 1699, many of the choir tombs were disturbed or covered over during a major renovation project. Remains which were exhumed were reburied in a common tomb beside the high altar. In 1711, a small crypt measuring about was dug out in the middle of the choir which was used as a burial vault for the archbishops, if they had not requested to be buried elsewhere. It was during this excavation that the 1st-century Pillar of the Boatmen was discovered. In 1758, three more crypts were dug in the Chapel of Saint-Georges to be used for burials of canons of Notre-Dame. In 1765, a larger crypt was built under the nave to be used for burials of canons, beneficiaries, chaplains, cantors, and choirboys. Between 1771 and 1773, the cathedral floor was repaved with black and white marble tiles, which covered over most of the remaining tombs. This prevented many of these tombs from being disturbed during the French Revolution.\nIn 1858, the choir crypt was expanded to stretch most of the length of the choir. During this project, many medieval tombs were rediscovered. Likewise the nave crypt was also rediscovered in 1863 when a larger vault was dug out to install a vault heater. Many other tombs are also located in the chapels.\nGreat organ.\nOne of the earliest organs at Notre-Dame was built in 1403 by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schambantz. It was rebuilt many times over the course of 300 years; however, twelve pipes and some wood survive from Schambantz. It was replaced between 1730 and 1738 by Fran\u00e7ois Thierry, then once again rebuilt by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Clicquot. During the mid-19th-century restoration of the cathedral by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll used pipework from earlier instruments to build a new organ, which was dedicated in 1868.\nIn 1904, Charles Mutin modified and added several stops upon the suggestions of titular organist Louis Vierne. In 1924, the installation of an electric blower was financed by Rolls-Royce CEO Claude Johnson. An extensive restoration and cleaning was carried out by Joseph Beuchet in 1932 which mostly included changes to the R\u00e9cit. Between 1959 and 1963, the mechanical action with Barker levers was replaced with an electric action by Jean Hermann, and a new organ console was installed.\nThe stoplist was gradually modified by Robert Boisseau, who in 1968 added three chamade stops (8\u2032, 4\u2032, and 2\u2032/16\u2032) and by Jean-Loup Boisseau after 1975, all upon the orders of Pierre Cochereau. In autumn 1983, the electric combination system was disconnected due to short-circuit risk.\nBetween 1990 and 1992, Jean-Loup Boisseau, Bertrand Cattiaux, Philippe \u00c9meriau, Michel Giroud, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Synaptel revised and augmented the instrument. A new frame for the Jean Hermann console was created. Between 2012 and 2014, Bertrand Cattiaux and Pascal Quoirin restored, cleaned, and modified the organ. The stop and key action was upgraded, a new frame for selected components of the Hermann-Boisseau-Cattiaux console was created, a new enclosed division (\"R\u00e9sonnance expressive\", using pipework from the former \"Petite P\u00e9dale\" by Boisseau, which can now be used as a floating division), the organ case and the fa\u00e7ade pipes were restored, and a general tuning was carried out. The current organ has 115 stops (156 ranks) on five manuals and pedal, and more than 8,000 pipes.\nIn addition to the great organ in the west end, the quire of the cathedral carries a medium-sized choir organ of 2 manuals, 30 stops and 37 ranks in a nineteenth-century case from the 1960s. During the fire of 2019, it was heavily damaged by waterlogging, but is at least partially reusable. It also had a 5-stop single-manual continuo organ, which was completely destroyed by water from firefighters.\nThe great organ itself suffered minimal damage (mostly to a single pipe of the Principal 32' and substantial dust) in the fire of April 2019 and underwent maintenance for cleaning and tuning. It was formally reblessed in 2024.\nCouplers: II/I, III/I, IV/I, V/I; III/II, IV/II, V/II; IV/III, V/III; V/IV, Octave grave g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, inversion Positif/Grand-orgue, Tirasses (Grand-orgue, Positif, R\u00e9cit, Solo, Grand-Ch\u0153ur en 8; Grand-Orgue en 4, Positif en 4, R\u00e9cit en 4, Solo en 4, Grand-Ch\u0153ur en 4), Sub and Super octave couplers and Unison Off for all manuals (Octaves graves, octaves aigu\u00ebs, annulation 8\u2032); \"octaves aigu\u00ebs P\u00e9dalier\"\nAdditional features: \"Coupure P\u00e9dalier\"; \"Coupure Chamade;\" \"Appel R\u00e9sonnance;\" s\"ostenuto\" for all manuals and the pedal; cancel buttons for each division; 50,000 combinations (5,000 groups each); replay system\nOrganists.\nThe position of titular organist (\"head\" or \"chief\" organist; French: \"titulaires des grandes orgues\") of the great organ of Notre-Dame is considered one of the most prestigious organist posts in France, along with the post of titular organist of Saint Sulpice in Paris, Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's largest instrument.\nAfter the death of Pierre Cochereau, the cathedral authorities controversially decided to return to the Clicquot practice of having several titulaires, and also to guarantee that no one organist would have so much influence over the organ.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBells.\nNotre-Dame currently has ten bells. The two largest bells, Emmanuel and Marie, are mounted in the south tower. The eight others; Gabriel, Anne Genevi\u00e8ve, Denis, Marcel, \u00c9tienne, Beno\u00eet-Joseph, Maurice, and Jean-Marie; are mounted in the north tower. In addition to accompanying regular activities at the cathedral, the bells have also rung to commemorate events of national and international significance, such as the armistice of 11 November 1918, the liberation of Paris, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the September 11 attacks.\nThe bells are made with bronze for its resonance and resistance to corrosion. During the medieval period, they were often founded on the grounds of the cathedral so they would not need to be transported long distances. According to tradition, the bishop of Paris held a ceremony in which he blessed and baptized the bells, and a godparent formally bestowed a name on the bell. Most of the cathedral's early bells were named after the person who donated them, but they were also named after biblical figures, saints, bishops, and others.\nAfter the baptism, the bells were hoisted into the towers through circular openings in the vaulted ceilings and mounted to headstocks to allow the bells to swing. Notre-Dame's bells swing on a straight swinging axis, meaning the axis of rotation is just above the crown of the bell. This style of ringing produces a clearer tone, as the clapper strikes the bell on the upswing, called a flying clapper. It also causes horizontal forces, which can be up to one and a half times the weight of the bell. For this reason the bells are mounted within wooden belfries which are recessed from the towers' stone walls. These absorb the horizontal forces and prevent the bells from damaging the relatively brittle stonework. The current belfries date to the 19th-century restoration.\nBefore the French Revolution, it was common for the bells to break, and they were often removed for repairs or to be entirely recast, and sometimes renamed. The bell Guillaume, for example, was renamed three times and recast five times between 1230 and 1770.\nThe practice of bell-ringing at Notre-Dame is recorded as early as 1198. By the end of the 14th century the bells were marking the civil hours, and in 1472 they began to call to prayer for the Angelus three times a day, both practices which continue today. During the French Revolution, most of the cathedral's bells were removed and melted down. Many of them bore the names of the medieval bells, and were relatively recent recastings made from most of the same metal. During the 19th-century restoration, four new bells were made for the north tower. These were replaced in 2012 with nine as part of the cathedral's 850th anniversary celebration.\nIn addition to the main bells, the cathedral also had smaller secondary bells. These included a carillon in the medieval fl\u00e8che, three clock bells on the north transept in the 18th century, and six bells added in the 19th century \u2013 three in the reconstructed fl\u00e8che and three within the roof to be heard in the sanctuary. These were destroyed during the 2019 fire.\nClock.\nThe first clocks used at Notre-Dame were clepsydras. These were used to tell the hours, which were marked by striking bells. In the 14th century Notre-Dame had two clepsydras running simultaneously, one in the cloister and one in the church itself. A lay chamberlain was responsible for keeping the clocks filled with water and to notify a churchwarden when it was time to strike the bells for the hour.\nIn 1766, Guillot de Montjoye and Jean-Bernard de Vienne, canons and stewards of the church fabric, donated a mechanical clock to the cathedral. The movement was installed in a glass cabinet in the gallery beneath the north rose window and rang three bells outside above the north portal. Between 1812 and 1813, the clock and bells were moved to the north tower. A clock face was installed inside the church below the organ platform.\nDuring Viollet-le-Duc's restoration in the 19th century, a new clock was made. The 1867 Collin-Wagner movement, measuring across, was located in the forest underneath the central fl\u00e8che within a glass-enclosed room. This controlled four dormer clock faces visible on the transept roofs, two on each side. This clock was destroyed by the 2019 fire. Shortly after the fire, French clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Vior discovered an almost identical 1867 Collin-Wagner movement in storage at Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 Church in northern Paris. Olivier Chandez, who had been responsible for the upkeep of Notre-Dame's clock, described the find as \"almost a miracle.\" The clock cannot be installed in Notre-Dame, but it was hoped that the clock could be used to create a new clock for Notre-Dame to the same specifications as the one which was destroyed.\nOwnership.\nUntil the French Revolution, Notre-Dame was the property of the archbishop of Paris and therefore the Catholic Church. It was nationalized on 2 November 1789 and since then has been the property of the French state. Under the Concordat of 1801, use of the cathedral was returned to the Church, but not ownership. Legislation from 1833 and 1838 clarified that cathedrals were maintained at the expense of the French government. This was reaffirmed in the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, designating the Catholic Church as having the exclusive right to use it for religious purposes in perpetuity. Notre-Dame is one of seventy historic churches in France with this status. The archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees, for security, heating and cleaning, and for ensuring that the cathedral is open free of charge to visitors. The archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the French state.\nNotes.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is credited with establishing the Franciscan Missions in the Sierra Gorda, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He founded a mission in Baja California and established eight of the 21 Spanish missions in California from San Diego to San Francisco, in what was then Spanish-occupied Alta California in the Province of Las Californias of New Spain.\nSerra was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 25 September 1988 in Vatican City. Amid denunciations from Native American tribes who accused Serra of presiding over a brutal colonial subjugation, Pope Francis canonized Serra on 23 September 2015 at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., during his visit to the United States. Serra's missionary efforts earned him the title of \"Apostle of California\".\nBoth before and after his canonization, Serra's reputation and missionary work during the Spanish occupation have been condemned by critics, who cite alleged mandatory conversions to Catholicism, followed by abuse of the Native American converts.\nEarly life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSerra was born Miquel Josep Serra i Ferrer (this name is Catalan, in Castilian it is Miguel Jos\u00e9 Serra y Ferrer) in the village of Petra on the island of Mallorca (Majorca) in the Balearic Islands off the Mediterranean coast of Spain. His father Antonio Nadal Serra and mother Margarita Rosa Ferrer were married in 1707.\nBy age seven, Miquel was working the fields with his parents, helping cultivate wheat and beans, and tending the cattle. But he showed a special interest in visiting the local Franciscan friary at the church of San Bernardino within a block of the Serra family house. Attending the friars' primary school at the church, Miquel learned reading, writing, mathematics, Latin, religion and liturgical song, especially Gregorian chant. Gifted with a good voice, he eagerly took to vocal music. The friars sometimes let him join the community choir and sing at special church feasts. Miquel and his father Antonio often visited the friary for friendly chats with the Franciscans.\nAt age 16, Miquel's parents enrolled him in a Franciscan school in the capital city, Palma de Majorca, where he studied philosophy. A year later, he became a novice in the Franciscan order.\nJoins Franciscan order.\nOn September 14, 1730, some two months before his 17th birthday, Serra entered the Franciscan Order at Palma, specifically, the Alcantarine branch of the Friars Minor, a reform movement in the order. The slight and frail Serra now embarked on his novitiate period, a rigorous year of preparation to become a full member of the Franciscan Order. He was given the religious name of Jun\u00edpero in honor of Brother Juniper, who had been among the first Franciscans and a companion of Francis of Assisi. The young Jun\u00edpero, along with his fellow novices, vowed to scorn property and comfort, and to remain celibate. He still had seven years to go to become an ordained Catholic priest. He immersed himself in rigorous studies of logic, metaphysics, cosmology, and theology.\nThe daily routine at the friary followed a rigid schedule: prayers, meditation, choir singing, physical chores, spiritual readings, and instruction. The friars would wake up every midnight for another round of chants. Serra's superiors discouraged letters and visitors. In his free time, he avidly read stories about Franciscan friars roaming the provinces of Spain and around the world to win new souls for the church, often suffering martyrdom in the process. \nIn 1737, Serra became a priest, and three years later earned an ecclesiastical license to teach philosophy at the Convento de San Francisco. His philosophy course, including over 60 students, lasted three years. Among his students were fellow future missionaries Francisco Pal\u00f3u and Juan Cresp\u00ed. When the course ended in 1743, Serra told his students: \"I desire nothing more from you than this, that when the news of my death shall have reached your ears, I ask you to say for the benefit of my soul: 'May he rest in peace.' Nor shall I omit to do the same for you so that all of us will attain the goal for which we have been created.\"\nSerra was considered intellectually brilliant by his peers. He received a doctorate in theology from the Lullian College (founded in the 14th century by Ramon Lull for the training of Franciscan missionaries) in Palma de Majorca, where he also occupied the Duns Scotus chair of philosophy until he joined the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico in 1749.\nDuring Serra's last five years on the island of Majorca, drought and plague afflicted his home village of Petra. Serra sometimes went home from Palma for brief visits to his parents\u2014now separated\u2014and gave them some financial support. On one occasion he was called home to anoint his seriously ill father with the last rites. In one of his final visits to Petra, Serra found his younger sister Juana Mar\u00eda near death.\nIn 1748, Serra and Pal\u00f3u confided to each other their desire to become missionaries. Serra, now 35, was assured a prestigious career as priest and scholar if he stayed in Majorca; but he set his sights firmly on pagan lands. Applying to the colonial bureaucracy in Madrid, Serra requested that both he and Pal\u00f3u embark on a foreign mission. After weathering some administrative obstacles, they received permission and set sail for C\u00e1diz, the port of departure for Spain's colonies in the Americas.\nWhile waiting to set sail, Serra wrote a long letter to a colleague back in Majorca, urging him to console Serra's parents\u2014now in their 70s\u2014over their only son's pending departure. \"They [my parents] will learn to see how sweet is His yoke,\" Serra wrote, \"and that He will change for them the sorrow they may now experience into great happiness. Now is not the time to muse or fret over the happenings of life but rather to be conformed entirely to the will of God, striving to prepare themselves for that happy death which of all the things of life is our principal concern.\" Serra asked his colleague to read this letter to his parents, who had never attended school.\nMinistry in the Americas.\nIn 1749, Serra and the Franciscan missionary team landed in Veracruz, on the Gulf coast of New Spain (now Mexico). To get from Veracruz to Mexico City, Serra and his Franciscan companions took the Camino Real (), a rough road stretching from sea level through tropical forests, dry plains, high plateaus and volcanic sierra mountains to an altitude of . Royal officials provided horses for the 20 Franciscan friars to ride up the Camino Real. All accepted the offer, except for Serra and one companion, a friar from Andalusia. Strictly following the rule of his patron saint Francis of Assisi that friars \"must not ride on horseback unless compelled by manifest necessity or infirmity,\" Serra insisted on walking to Mexico City. He and his fellow friar set out on the Camino Real with no money or guide, carrying only their breviaries. They trusted in Providence and the hospitality of local people along the way.\nDuring the trek Serra's left foot swelled up, and a burning itch tormented him. Arriving at a farm at day's end, he could hardly stand. He attributed the swelling to a mosquito bite. His discomfort caused him to stay over at the farm another night, during which he scratched his foot and leg to excess, desperately trying to relieve the itch. The next morning his leg was raw and bleeding. This wound plagued Serra for the rest of his life.\nHobbling into Mexico City, Serra joined up with his fellow friars at the College of San Fernando de Mexico, a specialized training center and regional headquarters for Franciscan missionaries. Serra requested that he do his novitiate year again\u2014despite his academic prestige, and the fact that the college's novices were far younger men. Though his request was declined, Serra insisted on living as a novice at San Fernando: \"This learned university professor ... would often eat more sparingly in order to replace the student whose turn it was to read to the community. Or he would humbly carry trays and wait on tables with the lay brothers.\"\nMission in the Sierra Gorda.\nThe Sierra Gorda Indian missions, some 90 miles north of Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro, were nestled in a vast region of jagged mountains, home of the Pame people and a scattering of Spanish colonists. The Pames\u2014who centuries earlier had built a civilization with temples, idols and priests\u2014lived mainly by gathering and hunting, but also pursued agriculture. Many groups among them, adopting mobile guerrilla tactics, had eluded conquest by the Spanish military.\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u, arriving at the village of Jalpan, found the mission in disarray: The parishioners, numbering fewer than a thousand, were attending neither confession nor Mass. The two missionaries set about learning the Pame language from a Mexican who had lived among the Pames. But the statement by Pal\u00f3u that Serra translated the catechism into the Pame language is questionable, as Serra himself later admitted he had great difficulties learning indigenous languages.\nSerra involved Pames parishioners in the ritual reenactment of Jesus' forced death march. Erecting 14 stations, Serra led the procession himself, carrying an extremely heavy cross. At each station, the procession paused for a prayer, and at the end Serra sermonized on the sufferings and death of Jesus. On Holy Thursday, 12 Pames elders reenacted the roles of the apostles. Serra, in the role of Jesus, washed their feet and then, after the service, dined with them.\nSerra also tackled the practical side of mission administration. Working with the college of San Fernando, he had cattle, goats, sheep, and farming tools brought to the Sierra Gorda mission. Pal\u00f3u supervised the farm labor of men of the mission; the women learned spinning, sewing and knitting. Their products were collected and rationed to the mission residents, according to personal needs. Christian Pames sold their surplus products in nearby trading centers, under the friars' supervision to protect them from cheaters. Pames who adapted successfully to mission life received their own parcels of land to raise corn, beans and pumpkins, and sometimes received oxen and seeds as well.\nWithin two years, Serra had made inroads against the Pames' traditional belief system. On his 1752 visit from the Sierra Gorda mission to the college of San Fernando in Mexico City, Serra joyfully carried a goddess statue presented to him by Christian Pames. The statue, showing the face of Cachum, mother of the sun, had been erected on a hilltop shrine where some Pame chiefs lay buried.\nBack in the Sierra Gorda, Serra faced a conflict between Spanish soldiers, settlers, and mission natives or \"Indians\". Following a Spanish military victory over the Pames in 1743, Spanish authorities had sent not only Franciscan missionaries, but also Spanish/Mexican soldiers and their families into the Sierra Gorda. The soldiers had the job of pursuing runaway mission Indians and securing the region for the Spanish crown. But the soldiers' land claims clashed with mission lands that Christian Pames were working.\nSome of the soldiers' families tried to establish a town, and the officer in charge of their deployment approved their plan. The Pames objected, threatening to defend their lands by force if necessary. Soldiers and settlers let their cattle graze on Christian Pames' farmlands and bullied Pames into working for them. Serra and the College of San Fernando sided with the Pames\u2014citing the Laws of the Indies, which banned colonial settlements in mission territories.\nThe viceroy, Spain's highest official in Mexico, suspended the intrusive colony. But the townspeople protested and stayed put. The government set up commissions and looked into alternative sites for the colony. It ordered the settlers to keep their cattle out of the Pames' fields, and to pay the Pames fairly for their labor (with the friars supervising payment). After a protracted legal struggle, the settlers moved out, and in 1755 the Pames and friars reclaimed their land.\nCrowning his Sierra Gorda mission, Serra oversaw the construction of a splendid church in Jalpan. Gathering masons, carpenters, and other skilled craftsmen from Mexico City, Serra employed Christian Pames in seasonal construction work over the course of seven years to complete the church. Serra pitched in himself, carrying wooden beams and applying mortar between the stones forming the church walls.\nWork for the Inquisition.\nDuring his 1752 visit to Mexico City, Serra sent a request from the college of San Fernando to the local headquarters of the Spanish Inquisition. He asked that an inquisitor be appointed to preside over the Sierra Gorda. The next day, Inquisition officials appointed Serra himself as inquisitor for the whole region\u2014adding that he could exercise his powers anywhere he did missionary work in New Spain, as long as there was no regular Inquisition official in the region.\nIn September 1752, Serra filed a report to the Spanish Inquisition in Mexico City from Jalpan, on \"evidences of witchcraft in the Sierra Gorda missions.\" He denounced several Christian non-Indians who lived in and around the mission for \"the most detestable and horrible crimes of sorcery, witchcraft and devil worship. ... If it is necessary to specify one of the persons guilty of such crimes, I accuse by name a certain Melchora de los Reyes Acosta, a married mulattress, an inhabitant of the said mission... In these last days a certain Cayetana, a very clever Mexican woman of said mission, married to one P\u00e9rez, a mulatto, has confessed\u2014she, being observed and accused of similar crimes, having been held under arrest by us for some days past\u2014that in the mission there is a large congregation of [Christian non-Indians], although some Indians also join them, and that these persons, ... flying through the air at night, are in the habit of meeting in a cave on a hill near a ranch called El Saucillo, in the center of said missions, where they worship and make sacrifice to the demons who appear visibly there in the guise of young goats and various other things of that nature. ... If such evil is not attacked, the horrible corruption will spread among these poor [Indian] neophytes who are in our charge.\"\nAccording to modern Franciscan historians, this report by Serra to the Inquisition is the only letter of his that has survived from eight years of mission work in the Sierra Gorda. Serra's first biographer, Francisco Pal\u00f3u, wrote that Serra, in his role of inquisitor, had to work in many parts of Mexico and travel long distances. Yet the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n in Mexico City, with over a thousand volumes of indexed documents on the Inquisition, apparently contains only two references to Serra's work for the Inquisition following his 1752 appointment: his preaching in Oaxaca in 1764, and his partial handling of the case of a Sierra Gorda mulatto accused of sorcery in 1766.\nIn 1758, Serra returned to the College of San Fernando. Over the next nine years he worked in the college's administrative offices, and as a missionary and inquisitor in the dioceses of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca, Valladolid, and Guadalajara.\nPenance and mortification.\nEmulating an earlier Franciscan missionary and saint, Francisco Solano, Serra practiced various habits of penance, to purify his spirit and cultivate communion with the Passion of Christ. He wore a sackcloth spiked with bristles, or a coat interwoven with broken pieces of wire, under his gray friar's outer garment. In his austere cell, Serra kept a chain of sharp pointed iron links hanging on the wall beside his bed, to whip himself at night when sinful thoughts ran through his mind. His nightly self-flagellations at the college of San Fernando caught the ears of some of his fellow friars. In his letters to his Franciscan companions, Serra often referred to himself as a \"sinner\" and a \"most unworthy priest.\"\nIn one of his sermons in Mexico City, while exhorting his listeners to repent their sins, Serra took out his chain, bared his shoulders and started whipping himself. Many parishioners, roused by the spectacle, began sobbing. Finally, a man climbed to the pulpit, took the chain from Serra's hand and began whipping \"him\"self, declaring: \"I am the sinner who is ungrateful to God who ought to do penance for my many sins, and not the padre [Serra], who is a saint.\" The man kept whipping himself until he collapsed. After receiving the last sacraments, he later died from the ordeal.\nDuring other sermons on the theme of repentance, Serra would hoist a large stone in one hand and, while clutching a crucifix in the other, smash the stone against his chest. Many of his listeners feared that he would strike himself dead. Later, Serra suffered chest pains and shortness of breath; Pal\u00f3u suggests that Serra's self-inflicted bruises were the cause. While preaching of hell and damnation, Serra would sear his flesh with a four-pronged candle flame\u2014emulating a famed Franciscan preacher, John of Capistrano. Pal\u00f3u described this as \"quite violent, painful, and dangerous towards wounding his chest.\"\nSerra did not stand alone among Catholic missionaries in displaying self-punishment at the pulpit. The more zealous Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries did likewise. But few took it to the extremes that Serra did. The regulations of the college of San Fernando said that self-punishment should never be carried to the point of permanently incapacitating oneself.\nKing Carlos expels the Jesuits.\nOn June 24, 1767, the Viceroy of New Spain, Carlos Francisco de Croix, read a Spanish royal decree to Mexico's archbishop and assembled church officials: \"Repair with an armed force to the houses of the Jesuits. Seize the persons of all of them and, within 24 hours, transport them as prisoners to the port of Veracruz. Cause to be sealed the records of said houses and records of such persons without allowing them to remove anything but their breviaries and such garments as are absolutely necessary for their journey. If after the embarkation there should be found one Jesuit in that district, even if ill or dying, you shall suffer the penalty of death.\"\nSpain's king Carlos III had plotted the expulsion of Jesuits throughout his empire five months earlier.\nOn the Baja California peninsula, newly appointed governor Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 had to notify and remove the Jesuits from the chain of missions they had developed in forbidding territory over 70 years. By February 1768, Portol\u00e1 gathered the 16 Baja Jesuit missionaries in Loreto, from where they sailed to mainland Mexico for deportation. Sympathetic to the Jesuits, Portol\u00e1 treated them kindly even as he removed them under the king's orders.\nPresident of missions of the Californias.\nInto the vacuum created by the Jesuits' expulsion from Mexico, stepped Franciscan missionaries. In July 1767, the guardian of the college of San Fernando appointed Serra president of the missions of Baja California, heading a group of 15 Franciscan friars; Francisco Pal\u00f3u served as his second in command. Jesuit priests had developed 13 missions on that long and arid peninsula over seven decades. Two Jesuits had died at the hands of Indians in the revolt of 1734\u201336.\nIn March 1768, Serra and his missionary team boarded a Spanish sloop at San Blas, on Mexico's Pacific coast. Sailing over 200 miles up the Gulf of California, they landed at Loreto two weeks later. Gaspar de Portol\u00e1, governor of Las Californias, welcomed them at the Loreto mission, founded by Jesuits in 1697. While he gave control of the church to Serra, Portol\u00e1 controlled the living quarters and rationed out food to the friars, charging their costs to the mission.\nSerra and Pal\u00f3u found\u2014to their unpleasant surprise\u2014that they ruled only on spiritual matters: everyday management of the mission remained in the hands of the military, who had occupied the Baja missions since evicting the Jesuits. In August 1768, New Spain's inspector general Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, displeased with the sloppy military administration of the Baja missions, ordered them turned over fully to the Franciscan friars.\nThe Franciscans found that the Indian population in the Baja California mission territories had dwindled to about 7,150. By the time the Franciscans had moved north and turned the missions over to Dominican friars in 1772, the Indian population had decreased to about 5,000. \"If it goes on at this rate,\" wrote Pal\u00f3u, \"in a short time Baja California will come to an end.\" Epidemics, especially syphilis introduced by Spanish troops, were wasting the Indians. But Pal\u00f3u attributed the ravages of syphilis to God's retribution for the Indians' murder of the two Jesuit priests over 30 years earlier.\nIn 1768 Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, inspector general of New Spain, decided to send explorers and locate missions in Alta (upper) California. G\u00e1lvez aimed both to Christianize the extensive Indian populations and serve Spain's strategic interest by preventing Russian explorations and possible claims to North America's Pacific coast. G\u00e1lvez chose Serra to head the missionary team in the California expedition. Serra, now 55, eagerly seized the chance to harvest thousands of pagan souls in lands previously untouched by the church.\nBut as the expedition gathered in Loreto, Serra's foot and leg infection had become almost crippling. The commander, Gaspar de Portol\u00e1, tried to dissuade him from joining the expedition, and wrote to G\u00e1lvez about Serra's condition. Serra's fellow friar and former student Francisco Pal\u00f3u also became concerned, gently suggesting to Serra that he stay in Baja California and let the younger and stronger Pal\u00f3u make the journey to San Diego in his place. Serra rebuffed both Portol\u00e1's and Pal\u00f3u's doubts. He chided Pal\u00f3u for his suggestion: \"Let us not speak of that. I have placed all my confidence in God, of whose goodness I hope that He will grant me to reach not only San Diego to raise the standard of the Holy Cross in that port, but also Monterey.\"\nSerra suggested that the Portol\u00e1 party set off without him; he would follow and meet up with them on the way to Alta California. He then assigned friar Miguel de la Campa as chaplain to the Portol\u00e1 expedition, which set out from Loreto on March 9, 1769. Spending holy week at mission Loreto, Serra set out on March 28. \"From my mission of Loreto,\" wrote Serra, \"I took along no more provisions for so long a journey than a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese. For I was there [at mission Loreto] a whole year, in economic matters, as a mere guest to receive the crumbs of the royal soldier commissioner, whose liberality at my departure did not extend beyond the aforementioned articles.\"\nTwo servants\u2014one named Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vergerano, a 20-year-old from Magdalena, the other a soldier guard\u2014accompanied Serra on his journey from Loreto, as he rode on a feeble mule. On April 28, 1769, Serra arrived at mission San Borja, where he received a warm welcome from friar Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n. Founded just seven years before by the Jesuit Wenceslaus Linck, mission San Borja sat in an unusually arid region of Baja California. Continuing north, Serra stopped on May 5 to celebrate a Mass for the feast of the Ascension in the deserted church at Calamaju\u00e9, scarcely more than a ruined hut. The next morning he arrived at Santa Mar\u00eda, where he met up with Portol\u00e1, friar Miguel de la Campa and several members of their party. In this arid region, whose alkaline land resisted cultivation, lived the \"poorest of all\" the Indians Serra had encountered in Mexico. On Sunday May 7, Serra celebrated high Mass and preached a sermon at the mission church on the frontier of Spanish Catholicism.\nFounding Mission Velicat\u00e1.\nAfter leaving Mission Santa Mar\u00eda, Serra urged Portol\u00e1 to move ahead of the slow pack train, so they could reach Velicat\u00e1 in time for Pentecost the next day. Portol\u00e1 agreed, so the small group traveled all day May 13 to reach Velicat\u00e1 by late evening. The advanced guard of the party greeted them there.\nOn Pentecost day, May 14, 1769, Serra founded his first mission, Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1, in a mud hut that had served as a makeshift church when friar Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n had traveled up on Easter to conduct the sacraments for the Fernando Rivera expedition, the overland party that had preceded the Portol\u00e1 party. The founding celebration took place \"with all the neatness of holy poverty,\" in Serra's words. Smoke from the soldiers' guns, fired in repeated volleys, served as incense.\nThe new mission lacked Indians to convert. A few days later, friar Miguel de la Campa notified Serra that a few natives had arrived. Serra joyously rushed out to welcome twelve Indians, men and boys. \"Then I saw what I could hardly begin to believe when I read about it,\" wrote Serra. \"...\u00a0namely, that they go about entirely naked like Adam in paradise before the fall. ... We treated with them for a long time; and although they saw all of us clothed, they nevertheless showed not the least trace of shame in their manner of nudity.\" Serra placed both hands upon their heads as a token of paternal affection. He then handed them figs, which they ate immediately. One of the Indian men gave Serra roasted agave stalks and four fishes. In return, Portol\u00e1 and his soldiers offered tobacco leaves and various food items.\nThrough a Christian Indian interpreter, Serra told the Indians that de la Campa would stay at the mission to serve them. According to Stephen Hyslop, \"[Serra's] goal and that of his fellow friars was not to confirm Indians in their seeming innocence, like 'Adam in the garden, before sin', but to make them aware of their sins and move them to repent.\" The motive behind gifts of food, tobacco, and the like was, \"in the words of Serra's colleague and biographer, Father Francisco Pal\u00f3u, spiritual conquest meant enticing Indians with food and clothing, by which means they could be indoctrinated as Christians and 'gradually acquire a knowledge of what is spiritually good and evil' \".\nBack on the road, Serra found it very difficult to stay on his feet because \"my left foot had become very inflamed, a painful condition which I have suffered for a year or more. Now this inflammation has reached halfway up my leg.\" Portol\u00e1 again tried to persuade Serra to withdraw from the expedition, offering to \"have you carried back to the first mission where you can recuperate, and we will continue our journey.\" Serra countered that \"God ... has given me the strength to come so far. ... Even though I should die on the way, I shall not turn back. They can bury me wherever they wish and I shall gladly be left among the pagans, if it be God's will.\" Portol\u00e1 had a stretcher prepared, so that Christian Indians traveling with the expedition could carry Serra along the trail.\nNot wishing to burden his traveling companies, Serra departed from his usual practice of avoiding medicines: he asked one of the muleteers, Juan Antonio Coronel, if he could prepare a remedy for his foot and leg wound. When Coronel objected that he knew only how to heal animals' wounds, Serra rejoined: \"Well then, son, just imagine that I am an animal. ... Make me the same remedy that you would apply to an animal.\" Coronel then crushed some tallow between stones and mixed it with green desert herbs. After heating the mix, he applied it to Serra's foot and leg. The next morning, Serra felt \"much improved and I celebrated Mass. ... I was enabled to make the daily trek just as if I did not have any ailment. ... There is no swelling but only the itching which I feel at times.\"\nThe expedition still had to travel to San Diego. They passed through desert terrain into oak savanna in June, often camping and sleeping under large oaks. From a high hill on June 20, their advance scouts saw the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Reaching its shores that evening, the party called the spot Ensenada de Todos Santos (All Saints' Cove, today simply Ensenada). They now had less than to reach San Diego.\nPressing north, they stayed close to the ocean. On June 23, they came upon a large Indian village where they enjoyed a pleasant stopover. The natives appeared healthy, robust and friendly, immediately repeating the Spanish words they heard. Some danced for the party, offering them fish and mussels. \"We were all enamored of them,\" wrote Serra. \"In fact, all the pagans have pleased me, but these in particular have stolen my heart.\"\nThe Indians now encountered by the party near the coast appeared well-fed and more eager to receive cloth than food. On June 25, as the party struggled to cross a series of ravines, they noticed many Indians following them. When they camped for the night, the Indians pressed close. Whenever Serra placed his hands on their heads, they placed theirs on his. Coveting cloth, some begged Serra for the friar's habit he wore. Several women passed Serra's spectacles around with delight from hand to hand, until one man dashed off with them. Serra's companions rushed to recover them, the only pair of spectacles Serra possessed.\nArrival in San Diego.\nOn June 28, sergeant Jos\u00e9 Ortega, who had ridden ahead to meet the Rivera party in San Diego, returned with fresh animals and letters to Serra from friars Juan Cresp\u00ed and Fernando Parr\u00f3n. Serra learned that two Spanish galleons dispatched from Baja to supply the new missions had arrived at San Diego Bay. One of the ships, the \"San Carlos\", had sailed almost four months from La Paz, bypassing its destination by almost 200 miles before doubling back south to reach San Diego Bay. By the time it dropped anchor on April 29, scurvy had so devastated its crew that they lacked the strength to lower a boat. Men on shore from the \"San Antonio\", which had arrived three weeks earlier, had to board the \"San Carlos\" to help its surviving crew ashore.\nThe Portol\u00e1/Serra party, having trekked from Loreto and suffered dwindling food supplies along the way, arrived in San Diego on July 1, 1769. \"It was a day of great rejoicing and merriment for all,\" wrote Serra, \"because although each one in his respective journey had undergone the same hardships, their meeting ... now became the material for mutual accounts of their experiences.\"\nBetween the overland and seafaring parties of the expedition, about 300 men had started on the trip from Baja California. But no more than half of them reached San Diego. Most of the Christian Indians recruited to the overland parties had died or deserted; military officers had denied them rations when food started running low. Half of those who made it to San Diego spent months unable to resume the expedition, due to illness. Doctor Pedro Prat, who had also sailed on the \"San Carlos\" as the expedition's surgeon, struggled to treat the ill men, himself weakened from scurvy. Friar Fernando Parr\u00f3n, who had sailed on the \"San Carlos\" as chaplain, had become weak with scurvy as well. Many men who had sailed on the \"San Antonio\", including captain Juan P\u00e9rez, had also taken ill with scurvy. Despite the efforts of Doctor Prat, many of the ill men died in San Diego.\nMission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1.\nOn July 16, 1769, Serra founded Mission San Diego in honor of Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 in a simple shelter on Presidio Hill serving as a temporary church. Tensions with the local Kumeyaay people made it difficult to attract converts. The Indians accepted the trinkets Serra offered as rewards for visiting the new mission. But their craving for Spanish cloth irritated the soldiers, who accused them of stealing. Some of the Kumeyaay teased and taunted the sick soldiers. To warn them away, soldiers fired their guns into the air. The Christian Indians from Baja who remained with the Spaniards did not know the Kumeyaay language.\nOn August 15, the Feast of the Assumption, Serra and padre Sebastian Vizca\u00edno celebrated Mass at the new mission chapel, to which several Hispanics had gone for confession and Holy Communion. After Mass, four soldiers went down to the beach to bring padre Fernando Parr\u00f3n back from the \"San Carlos\", where he had been celebrating Mass.\nObserving the mission and its neighboring huts sparsely protected, a group of over 20 Indians attacked with bows and arrows. The four remaining soldiers, aided by the blacksmith and carpenter, returned fire with muskets and pistols. Serra, clutching a Jesus figurine in one hand and a Mary figurine in the other, prayed to God to save both sides from casualties. The blacksmith, Chac\u00f3n, ran about the Spanish huts unprotected by a leather jacket, shouting: \"Long live the faith of Jesus Christ and may these dogs, enemies of that faith, die!\"\nSerra's young servant Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vergerano ran into Serra's hut, his neck pierced by an arrow. \"Father, absolve me,\" he beseeched, \"for the Indians have killed me.\" \"He entered my little hut with so much blood streaming from his temples and mouth that, shortly after, I gave him absolution and helped him to die well,\" wrote Serra. \"He passed away at my feet, bathed in his blood.\" Padre Vizca\u00edno, the blacksmith Chac\u00f3n, and a Christian Indian from San Ignacio suffered wounds. That night Serra buried Vergerano secretly, concealing his death from the Indians.\nThe Indian warriors, suffering several dead and wounded, retreated with a new-found respect for the power of Spanish firearms. As local Indians cremated their dead, the wailing of their women sounded from local villages. Yet Serra wrote six months later, in a letter to the guardian of the college of San Fernando, that \"both our men and theirs sustained wounds\"\u2014without mentioning any Indian deaths. He added: \"It seems none of them died so they can still be baptized.\" Tightening security, the soldiers built a stockade of poles around the mission buildings, banning Indians from entering.\nA teenage boy from the Kumeyaay village of Kosa'aay (Cosoy, known today as Old Town, San Diego) who had often visited the mission before the outbreak of hostilities, resumed his visits with the friars. He soon learned enough Spanish for Serra to view him as an envoy to help convert the Kumeyaay. Serra urged the boy to persuade some parents to bring their young child to the mission, so that Serra could administer Catholic baptism to the child by pouring water over his head.\nA few days later, a group of Indians arrived at the mission carrying a naked baby boy. The Spaniards interpreted their sign language as a desire to have the boy baptized. Serra covered the child with some clothing and asked the corporal of the guard to sponsor the baptism. Dressed in surplice and stole, Serra read the initial prayers and performed the ceremonies to prepare for baptism. But just as he lifted the baptismal shell, filled it with water and readied to pour it over the baby's head, some Indians grabbed the child from the corporal's arms and ran away to their village in fear. The other Kumeyaay visitors followed them, laughing and jeering. The frustrated Serra never forgot this incident; recounting it years later brought tears to his eyes. Serra attributed the Indians' behavior to his own sins.\nOver six months dragged on without a single Indian convert to Mission San Diego. On January 24, 1770, the 74 exhausted men of the Portol\u00e1 expedition returned from their exploratory journey up the coast to San Francisco. They had survived by slaughtering and eating their mules along the return trek south. Commander Gaspar de Portol\u00e1, engineer and cartographer Miguel Costans\u00f3, and friar Juan Cresp\u00ed all arrived in San Diego with detailed diaries of their trip. They reported large populations of Indians living along the coast who seemed friendly and docile, ready to embrace the gospel. Serra fervently wrote to the guardian of the college of San Fernando, requesting more missionaries willing to face hardships in Alta California.\nFood remained scarce as the San Diego outpost awaited the return of the supply ship \"San Antonio\". Weighing the risk of his soldiers dying of starvation, Portol\u00e1 set a deadline of March 19, the feast of Saint Joseph, patron of his expedition: If no ship arrived by that day\u2014Portol\u00e1 told Serra\u2014he would march his men south the next morning. The anguished Serra, along with friar Juan Cresp\u00ed, insisted on staying in San Diego in the event of the Portol\u00e1 group's departure. Boarding the \"San Carlos\" (still anchored in San Diego Bay), Serra told captain Vicente Vila of Portol\u00e1's plan. Vila agreed to stay in the harbor until the relief ship arrived\u2014and to welcome Serra and Cresp\u00ed aboard if they got stranded by Portol\u00e1's departure.\nOn the morning of March 19, Serra celebrated Mass and preached a sermon at the forlorn mission on Presidio Hill. No ship appeared in the bay that morning. But around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the sails of a ship\u2014the \"San Antonio\"\u2014came into view on the horizon. It sailed past San Diego Bay, destined for Monterey. When it got to the Santa Barbara Channel, its sailors made landfall to fetch fresh water. There they learned from Indians that the Portol\u00e1 expedition had returned south. So the \"San Antonio\" also turned south, anchoring in San Diego Bay on March 23.\nMonterey.\nBolstered by the food unloaded from the \"San Antonio\", Portol\u00e1 and his men shifted their sights back north to Monterey, specified by Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez as the northern stake of Spain's empire in California. Friar Juan Cresp\u00ed prepared to accompany the second Portol\u00e1 expedition to Monterey. Leaving Mission San Diego in the hands of friars Fernando Parr\u00f3n and Francisco G\u00f3mez, Serra rode a launch out to board the \"San Antonio\". He and Cresp\u00ed would meet in Monterey. Since Serra planned to establish the mission there while having Cresp\u00ed establish mission San Buenaventura, the two friars would be living over 200 miles apart. \"Truly,\" wrote Serra to Pal\u00f3u, \"this state of solitude shall be ... the greatest of my hardships, but God in His infinite mercy will see me through.\"\nOn April 16, 1770, the \"San Antonio\" set sail from San Diego Bay, carrying Serra, doctor Pedro Prat, engineer Miguel Costans\u00f3 and a crew of sailors under captain Juan P\u00e9rez. Contrary winds blew the ship back south to the Baja peninsula, then as far north as the Farallon Islands. As the ship heaved against heavy winds, P\u00e9rez, Serra and sailors recited daily prayers, promising to make a novena and celebrate High Mass upon their safe arrival in Monterey. Several sailors fell sick with scurvy. Serra described the six-week voyage as \"somewhat uncomfortable.\"\nMeanwhile, the land expedition departed from San Diego on April 17 under the command of Portol\u00e1. His group included friar Cresp\u00ed, captain Pedro Fages, twelve Spanish volunteers, seven leather-jacketed soldiers, two muleteers, five Baja Christian Indians, and Portol\u00e1's servant. Following the same route they had taken the year before, the expedition reached Monterey Bay on May 24, without losing a single man or suffering any serious illness. \nWith the \"San Antonio\" nowhere in sight, Portol\u00e1, Cresp\u00ed and a guard walked over the hills to Point Pinos, then to a beachside hill just south where their party had planted a large cross five months before on their journey back from San Francisco Bay. They found the cross surrounded by feathers and broken arrows driven into the ground, with fresh sardines and meat laid out before the cross. No Indians were in sight. The three men then walked along the rocky coast south to Carmel Bay. Several Indians approached them, and the two groups exchanged gifts. On May 31, the \"San Antonio\" sailed into Monterey Bay and dropped anchor, reuniting the surviving men of the land and sea expeditions.\nOn Pentecost Sunday, June 3, 1770, Serra, Portol\u00e1 and the whole expedition held a ceremony at a makeshift chapel erected next to a massive oak tree by Monterey Bay, to found mission San Carlos Borromeo. \"The men of the land and sea expeditions coming from different directions met here at the same time,\" wrote Serra, \"we singing the divine praises in our launch, while the gentlemen on land sang in their hearts.\" After the raising and planting of a large cross, which Serra blessed, \"the standards of our Catholic monarch were also set up, the one ceremony ... accompanied by shouts of 'Long live the Faith!' and the other by 'Long live the King!' Added to this was the clangor of the bells, the volleys of the muskets, and the cannonading from the ship.\" Both king Carlos III and viceroy Carlos de Croix had chosen to name the new mission after Carlo Borromeo. The body of a sailor, Alexo Ni\u00f1o, who had died the day before aboard the \"San Antonio\", was buried at the foot of the newly erected cross.\nSerra realized from the start that the new mission needed relocation: While the Laws of the Indies required missions to be located near Indian villages, there were no Indian settlements near the newly christened mission by Monterey Bay. \"It might be necessary,\" wrote Serra to the guardian of the college of San Fernando, \"to change the site of the mission toward the area of Carmel, a locality indeed more delightful and suitable because of the extent and excellent quality of the land and water supply necessary to produce very abundant harvests.\"\nOn July 9, the \"San Antonio\" set sail from Monterey, bound for Mexico. Aboard were Portol\u00e1 and Miguel Costans\u00f3, along with several letters from Serra. Forty men, including the two friars and five Baja Indians, remained to develop the mission on the Monterey peninsula. In San Diego, south, 23 men remained to develop the mission there. Both groups would have to wait a year before receiving supplies and news from Mexico.\nMissions founded.\nWhen the party reached San Diego on July 1, Serra stayed behind to start Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1, the first of the 21 California missions (including the nearby Visita de la Presentaci\u00f3n, also founded under Serra's leadership).\nJunipero Serra moved to the area that is now Monterey in 1770, and founded Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo. He remained there as \"Father Presidente\" of the Alta California missions. In 1771, Serra relocated the mission to Carmel, which became known as \"Mission Carmel\" and served as his headquarters.\nUnder his presidency were founded:\nSerra was also present at the founding of the Presidio of Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara, California) on April 21, 1782, but was prevented from locating the mission there because of the animosity of Governor Felipe de Neve.\nHe began in San Diego on July 16, 1769, and established his headquarters near the Presidio of Monterey, but soon moved a few miles south to establish Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in today's Carmel, California.\nThe missions were primarily designed to bring the Catholic faith to the native peoples. Other aims were to integrate the neophytes into Spanish society, to provide a framework for organizing the natives into a productive workforce in support of new extensions of Spanish power, and to train them to take over ownership and management of the land. As head of the order in California, Serra not only dealt with church officials, but also with Spanish officials in Mexico City and with the local military officers who commanded the nearby garrison.\nIn 1773, difficulties with Pedro Fages, the military commander, compelled Serra to travel to Mexico City to argue before Viceroy Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa for the removal of Fages as the Governor of California Nueva. At the capital of Mexico, by order of Viceroy Bucareli, he printed up \"Representaci\u00f3n\" in 32 articles. Bucareli ruled in Serra's favor on 30 of the 32 charges brought against Fages, and removed him from office in 1774, after which time Serra returned to California. In 1778, Serra, although not a bishop, was given dispensation to administer the sacrament of confirmation for the faithful in California. After he had exercised his privilege for a year, Governor Felipe de Neve directed him to suspend administering the sacrament until he could present the papal brief. For nearly two years Serra refrained, and then Viceroy Majorga gave instructions to the effect that Serra was within his rights.\nFranciscans saw the Indians as children of God who deserved the opportunity for salvation, and would make good Christians. Converted Indians were segregated from Indians who had not yet embraced Christianity, lest there be a relapse. To understand the impetus behind missionary efforts in the 18th century, one must take into account the era's views on the salvation of unbaptized infants. While there were many controversies in the Church's history, the fate of unbaptized infants has never been definitively settled by an ecumenical council of Bishops in the Catholic church. \nIn the 18th century, most Catholic speculation regarding the ultimate end of unbaptized infants was still in line with the early Church Fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, who believed that unbaptized infants would receive the mildest chastisements in Hell, but no reward. For Serra and his companions, therefore, instructing the natives so that their children might also be saved would have most likely been a great concern. From this came the determined efforts of missionaries to the detriment of native cultures, which few today would support.\nDiscipline was strict, and the converts were not allowed to come and go at will. Indians who were baptized were required to live at the mission and conscripted into forced labor as plowmen, shepherds, cattle herders, blacksmiths, and carpenters on the mission. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes. Serra successfully resisted the efforts of Governor Felipe de Neve to bring Enlightenment policies to missionary work, because those policies would have subverted the economic and religious goals of the Franciscans.\nSerra wielded this kind of influence because his missions served economic and political purposes as well as religious ends. The number of civilian colonists in Alta California never exceeded 3,200, and the missions with their Indian populations were critical to keeping the region within Spain's political orbit. Economically, the missions produced all of the colony's cattle and grain, and by the 1780s were even producing surpluses sufficient to trade with Mexico for luxury goods.\nIn 1779, Franciscan missionaries under Serra's direction planted California's first sustained vineyard at Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1. Hence, he has been called the \"Father of California Wine\". The variety he planted, presumably descended from Spain, became known as the Mission grape and dominated California wine production until about 1880.\nTreatment of Native Californians.\nFrom his perspective, Serra's singular purpose was to save the souls of indigenous Americans. He believed that the death of an unconverted heathen was tragic, while the death of a baptized convert was a cause for joy. He maintained a patriarchal or fatherly attitude towards the Native American population. He wrote, \"That spiritual fathers should punish their sons, the Indians, with blows appears to be as old as the conquest of the Americas; so general in fact that the saints do not seem to be any exception to the rule.\" Punishment made clear to the natives \"that we, every one of us, came here for the single purpose of doing them good and their eternal salvation.\"\nSerra also led efforts to protect the natives from abuse under Spanish soldiers. After a series of abuses on the native population by the hand of local soldiers, Serra and other missionaries protested against governor of Alta California Pedro Fages, who refused to reprimand his soldiers. Serra then departed for Mexico on October 17, 1772 to plead his case to the viceroy Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa. Bucareli requested Serra set his grievances in writing, which led to the drafting of the Representaci\u00f3n. This document, which consisted of 32-points, also laid out the rights of Native Americans in Spanish California and protections against the soldiers, placing them under the governance of the missions. Mission Indians enjoyed rights as human beings under the protection of the Spanish monarchy, and were recognized as Hijos de Dios, or \"Children of God\". According to professor George Yagi, this stood in contrast to the treatment of Natives on the east coast of America, where they were guaranteed no rights.\nModern controversy.\nToppling and decapitation of Serra statues.\nNative Americans objected to the Catholic Church's canonization of Serra, charging the priest \"directed and approved of the torture and enslavement of Natives\" at missions that served as both religious and military installations.\nIn October 2015, slightly more than a week after the Catholic Church canonized Serra, Serra's statue in Monterey was decapitated.\nOn September 12, 2017, Santa Barbara police reported a statue of Serra located at southern California's Santa Barbara mission had been decapitated and covered with red paint.\nOn November 3, 2017, the statue of Serra located at the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel was vandalized with red paint and suffered damage during a decapitation attempt with a reciprocating saw. Though the perpetrator failed to decapitate the bronze statue of Serra, $3000 was needed to repair it as well.\nOn June 19, 2020, during the worldwide civil unrest that occurred after the murder of George Floyd, activists in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park toppled a 30-foot replica of Serra, wrapped in a friar cloak and gripping a large cross. Once the statue fell red paint was poured on it and phrases including \"Stolen Land\", \"Olone Land\", and \"Decolonize\" were spray-painted on the pedestal where the founder of Spanish Missions previously stood.\nOn June 20, 2020, a crowd of indigenous elders and young people gathered in downtown Los Angeles to witness the toppling of Serra's statue at Father Serra Park near Olvera Street. Burning sage, speaking of their ancestors and chanting \"Take it down!\" the crowd watched as activists tied a rope around Serra's statue to rip it from its pedestal. Erected by the Knights of Columbus in 1932, the group said that the statue of Serra had become a symbol of Spanish colonization in which Native Americans, prohibited from practicing their customs and religion, were beaten when they tried to escape the church-run missions.\nOn July 4, 2020, a group of people toppled the statue of Serra located near the California State Capitol in Sacramento. The group was among an estimated 200 protestors who marched through the streets of Sacramento.\nOn October 12, 2020, a group of people toppled the statue of Serra located in front of Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel, in San Rafael, California.\nFormal renamings.\nOn March 9, 2021, following a petition that began circulating after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the San Diego Unified School Board formally renamed Serra High School and its Conquistador mascot because of Serra's associations with indigenous assimilation.\nControversy over the missions Serra operated.\n\"The New York Times\" noted that some \"Indian historians and authors blame Father Serra for the suppression of their culture and the premature deaths at the missions of thousands of their ancestors.\" George Tinker, an Osage/Cherokee and professor at Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado, cites evidence that Serra required the converted Indians to labor to support the missions. Tinker writes that while Serra's intentions in evangelizing were honest and genuine, overwhelming evidence suggests that the \"native peoples resisted the Spanish intrusion from the beginning\".\nWhile administering Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, California, Serra had ongoing conflicts with Pedro Fages, who was military governor of Alta California. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on the soldiers' behalf, and the two did not get along. Serra moved the mission to Carmel due to better lands for farming, due to his conflicts with Fages, and in part to protect the Indian neophytes from the influence of Spanish soldiers.\nMark A. Noll, a professor at Wheaton College in Illinois, wrote that Serra's attitude\u2014that missionaries could, and should, treat their wards like children, including the use of corporal punishment\u2014was common at the time. Tinker argues that it is more appropriate to judge the beatings and whippings administered by Serra and others from the point of view of the Native Americans, who were the victims of the violence, and who did not punish their children with physical discipline. Salvatore J. Cordileone, archbishop of San Francisco, acknowledges Native American concerns about Serra's whippings and coercive treatment, but argues that missionaries were also teaching school and farming.\nIris Engstrand, emerita professor of history at the Catholic University of San Diego, described Serra as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;much nicer to the Indians, really, than even to the governors. He didn't get along too well with some of the military people, you know. His attitude was, 'Stay away from the Indians'. I think you really come up with a benevolent, hard-working person who was strict in a lot of his doctrinal leanings and things like that, but not a person who was enslaving Indians, or beating them, ever. ... He was a very caring person and forgiving. Even after the burning of the mission in San Diego, he did not want those Indians punished. He wanted to be sure that they were treated fairly.\nSerra wrote a letter in 1775 to Fernando Rivera y Moncada explicitly instructing the colonial commander to whip and shackle Indigenous men who had escaped from Mission San Carlos:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am sending them to you so that a period of exile and two or three whippings which Your Lordship may order applied to them on different days may serve, for them and for the rest, for a warning, and may be of spiritual benefit to all. ... If Your Lordship does not have shackles, with your permission they may be sent from here.\nDeborah A. Miranda, a professor of American literature at Washington and Lee University and an enrolled member of the Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, stated that \"Serra did not just bring us Christianity. He imposed it, giving us no choice in the matter. He did incalculable damage to a whole culture\".\nProfessor Edward Castillo, a Native American and director of Native American Studies at the Sonoma State University in California, said in a \"Firing Line\" episode with William F. Buckley Jr. that \"You can't put a whip in his [Serra's] hand. You can't put a smoking gun in his hand. And that is true. The man was an administrator.\" He compares Serra to Dillon S. Myer, who oversaw the Internment of Japanese Americans. \nCorine Fairbanks of the American Indian Movement proclaimed: \"For too long the mission system has been glorified as these wonderful moments of California's golden era. That is not true. They were concentration camps. They were places of death.\".\nPope Francis, in addition to his canonization of Serra during a visit to the United States, called on Catholics to \"embark upon a new chapter of evangelization.\" Francis further noted: \"Instead of seeming to impose new obligations, (Christians) should appear as people who wish to share their joy, who point to a horizon of beauty and who invite others to a delicious banquet. It is not by proselytizing that the Church grows, but 'by attraction'.\"\nCatholic writers maintain that the attacks on Serra impose modern judgments about the appropriateness of Christian evangelization of non-Christians, and that much of the criticism leveled against Serra results from ahistorical value judgments.\nSupport for canonization.\nDespite these concerns, thousands of Native Americans in California maintain their Catholic faith, and some supported efforts to canonize Serra. James Nieblas\u2014the first Native American priest to be ordained from the Juane\u00f1o Acjachemen Nation, a tribe evangelized by Serra\u2014was chosen to meet with Pope Francis during his visit to Washington D.C. Nieblas, a longtime supporter of Serra's canonization, stated during a 1986 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"Father Serra brought our people to this day. I think Serra would be proud ... canonization has the full support and backing of the Juaneno people.\" Members of other tribes associated with the mission system also expressed support for Serra's canonization. \nTwo members of California's Ohlone Tribe played roles in the canonization Mass by placing a relic of Serra's near the altar and reading a scripture in Chochenyo, a native language. One of the participants, Andrew Galvan, a member of the Ohlone Tribe and curator of Mission Dolores in San Francisco who sat on the Jun\u00edpero Serra Cause for Canonization board, stated prior to the ceremony that the canonization \"will be the culmination of a life's work for me. ... It will be a ceremonial opening of the door that will 'let us Indians in,' a moment I honestly didn't think I would live to see.\"\nRuben Mendoza, an archeologist of Mexican Mestizo and Native Yaqui descent who has extensively excavated missions in California, stated during a March 2015 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"Serra endured great hardships to evangelize Native Californians. In the process, he orchestrated the development of a chain of missions that helped give birth to modern California. ... When I don't go along with the idea that the missions were concentration camps and that the Spanish brutalized every Indian they encountered, I'm seen as an adversary.\"\nIn July 2015, Mendoza testified at a hearing on a proposal to remove a statue of Junipero Serra from the U.S. Capitol. In his remarks, he stated, \"What greater symbol of empowerment than that offered by Fray Jun\u00edpero Serra himself can we offer our youth? I ask that this legislative body seriously reconsider this politicized effort to minimize and erase one of the most substantive Hispanic and Latino contributions to our nation's history.\"\nBiographer Gregory Orfalea wrote of Serra: \"I see his devotion to Native Californians as heartfelt, plain-spoken and borne out by continuous example.\"\nDeath.\nDuring the remaining three years of his life, he once more visited the missions from San Diego to San Francisco, traveling more than 600 miles in the process, to confirm all who had been baptized. He suffered intensely from his disabled leg and from his chest, yet he would use no remedies. He confirmed 5,309 people, who, with but few exceptions, were California Indian neophytes converted during the fourteen years from 1770.\nOn August 28, 1784, at the age of 70, Jun\u00edpero Serra died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo from tuberculosis. He is buried there under the sanctuary. Following Serra's death, leadership of the Franciscan missionary effort in Alta California passed to Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n.\nVeneration.\nThe cause for Serra's beatification was formally opened on October 21, 1951, granting him the title of Servant of God. Serra was beatified by Pope John Paul II on September 25, 1988. The pope spoke before a crowd of 20,000 in a beatification ceremony for six; according to the pope's address in English, \"He sowed the seeds of Christian faith amid the momentous changes wrought by the arrival of European settlers in the New World. It was a field of missionary endeavor that required patience, perseverance, and humility, as well as vision and courage.\"\nDuring Serra's beatification, questions were raised about how Indians were treated while Serra was in charge. The question of Franciscan treatment of Indians first arose in 1783. The famous historian of missions Herbert Eugene Bolton gave evidence favorable to the case in 1948, and the testimony of five other historians was solicited in 1986.\nSerra was canonized by Pope Francis on September 23, 2015, as a part of the pope's first visit to the United States, the first canonization to take place on American soil. During a speech at the Pontifical North American College in Rome on May 2, 2015, Pope Francis stated that \"Friar Jun\u00edpero ... was one of the founding fathers of the United States, a saintly example of the Church's universality and special patron of the Hispanic people of the country.\" Jun\u00edpero Serra is the second native saint of the Balearic Islands after Catherine of Palma. He is also included among the Saints of the United States and M\u00e9xico.\nSerra's feast day is celebrated on July 1 in the United States and on August 28 everywhere. He is considered to be the patron saint of California, Hispanic Americans, and religious vocations.\nThe Mission in Carmel, California, containing Serra's remains has continued as a place of public veneration. The burial location of Serra is southeast of the altar and is marked with an inscription in the floor of the sanctuary. Other relics are remnants of the wood from Serra's coffin on display next to the sanctuary, and personal items belonging to Serra on display in the mission museums. A bronze and marble sarcophagus depicting Serra's life was completed in 1924 by the sculptor Jo Mora, but Serra's remains have never been transferred to that sarcophagus.\nLegacy.\nMany of Serra's letters and other documentation are extant, the principal ones being his \"Diario\" of the journey from Loreto to San Diego, which was published in \"Out West\" (March to June 1902) along with Serra's \"Representaci\u00f3n\".\nThe Jun\u00edpero Serra Collection (1713\u20131947) at the Santa Barbara Mission Archive-Library are their earliest archival materials. This library is part of the building complex of the Mission Santa Barbara, but is now a separate non-profit, independent educational and research institution. It continues to have ties to the Franciscans and the legacy of Serra.\nThe chapel at Mission San Juan Capistrano, built in 1782, is thought to be the oldest standing building in California. Commonly referred to as \"Father Serra's Church\", it is the only remaining church in which Serra is known to have celebrated the rites of the Catholic Church (he presided over the confirmations of 213 people on October 12 and 13, 1783).\nMany cities in California have streets, schools, and other features named after Serra. Examples include Junipero Serra Boulevard, a major boulevard in and south of San Francisco; Serramonte, a large 1960s residential neighborhood on the border of Daly City and Colma in the suburbs south of San Francisco; Serra Springs, a pair of springs in Los Angeles; Serra Mesa, a community in San Diego; Junipero Serra Peak, the highest mountain in the Santa Lucia Mountains; Junipero Serra Landfill, a solid waste disposal site in Colma; and Serra Fault, a fault in San Mateo County. Schools named after Serra include Jun\u00edpero Serra High School, a public school in the San Diego community of Tierrasanta renamed to Canyon Hills High School in 2021, and four Catholic high schools: Jun\u00edpero Serra High School in Gardena, Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, JSerra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, and Serra Catholic High School in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. There are public elementary schools in San Francisco and Ventura, as well as a K-8 Catholic school in Rancho Santa Margarita.\nBoth Spain and the United States have honored Serra with postage stamps.\nIn 1884, the Legislature of California passed a concurrent resolution making August 29 of that year, the centennial of Serra's burial, a legal holiday.\nSerra International, a global lay organization that promotes religious vocations to the Catholic Church, was named in his honor. The group, founded in 1935, currently numbers a membership of about 20,000 worldwide. It also boasts over 1,000 chapters in 44 countries.\nSerra's legacy towards Native Americans has been a topic of discussion in the Los Angeles area in recent years. The Mexica Movement, an indigenous separatist group that rejects European influence in the Americas, protested Serra's canonization at the Los Angeles Cathedral in February 2015. The Huntington Library announcement of its 2013 exhibition on Serra made it clear that Serra's treatment of Native Americans would be part of the comprehensive coverage of his legacy.\nOn September 27, 2015, in response to Serra's canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized. The statue of Serra was toppled and splattered with paint, and the cemetery, the mission doors, a fountain, and a crucifix were as well. The message \"Saint of Genocide\" was put on Serra's tomb, and similar messages were painted elsewhere in the mission courtyard. After the incident, law enforcement authorities launched a hate crime investigation since the only grave sites targeted for desecration were those of Europeans.\nIn 2018, Spanish producer Pedro Alonso Pablos made an animation, medium-length film dedicated to the life and work of Fray Jun\u00edpero called \"The call of Junipero\", and although the Catholic Church had no formal role during the process of creating the film, the vision that the film offers coincides with that of the Church.\nIn 2019, Stanford University renamed two buildings that had formerly been named after Serra: Serra House, where the Clayman Institute for Gender Research is located was renamed the Carolyn Lewis Attneave House, and a student dormitory located in the Lucie Stern Hall complex was renamed the Sally Ride House. The university followed the recommendations of a committee headed by Paul Brest (former dean of Stanford Law School), which had concluded that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because the mission system's violence against California Native Americans is part of the history and memory of current members of the community, we believe that features named for Junipero Serra, who was the architect and leader of the mission system, are in tension with (Stanford's) goal of full inclusion.\u2014\u200a\nIn popular culture.\nFiction.\nRobert A. Heinlein featured Serra in his serialized short fiction Lost Legacy first published in November 1941 in Super Science Stories edited by Frederick Pohl. The story is about a cache of ancient knowledge fictitiously discovered by Serra on Mt. Shasta. The fiction also features as a character Ambrose Bierce, the famous writer who disappeared and was declared dead in 1913 at age 72.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When al-Muktaf\u012b died, al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b retained the favour of the succeeding rulers, Caliph al-Muqtadir and Caliph al-Radi.\nHis biographer Ibn Khallikan, (d. 1282), relates that even in his lifetime the phrase \"to play like al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b\" was to show great skill at sha\u1e6dranj. His endgame strategies are still studied. Contemporary biographers mention his skill in blindfold chess. Al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b also taught sha\u1e6dranj.

{"id": "62241", "revid": "46546583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62241", "title": "House of Valois", "text": "Cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty\nThe Capetian House of Valois ( , , ) was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. They succeeded the House of Capet (or \"Direct Capetians\") to the French throne, and were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589. Junior members of the family founded cadet branches in Orl\u00e9ans, Anjou, Burgundy, and Alen\u00e7on.\nThe Valois descended from Charles, Count of Valois (1270\u20131325), the second surviving son of King Philip III of France (reigned 1270\u20131285). Their title to the throne was based on a precedent in 1316 (later retroactively attributed to the Merovingian Salic law) which excluded females (Joan II of Navarre), as well as male descendants through the distaff side (Edward III of England), from the succession to the French throne.\nAfter holding the throne for several centuries the Valois male line became extinct and the House of Bourbon succeeded the Valois to the throne as the senior surviving branch of the Capetian dynasty.\nUnexpected inheritance.\nThe Capetian dynasty seemed secure in the rule of the Kingdom of France both during and after the reign of King Philip IV (Philip the Fair, r.\u20091285\u00a0\u2013\u00a01313). Philip left three surviving sons (Louis, Philip and Charles) and a daughter (Isabella). Each son became king in turn, but each died young without surviving male heirs, leaving only daughters who could not inherit the throne. When Charles IV died in 1328 the French succession became more problematic.\nIn 1328 three candidates had a plausible claim to the French throne:\nIn England, Isabella of France claimed the throne on behalf of her 15-year-old son. In contrast to France it was unclear whether a woman could inherit the English crown but English precedent allowed succession through the female line (as exemplified by Henry II of England, son of Matilda). The French rejected Isabella's claim, arguing that since she herself, as a woman, could not succeed, then she could not transmit any such right to her son. Thus the French magnates chose as their new monarch Philip of Valois (Philip VI).\nBecause diplomacy and negotiation had failed, Edward III would have to back his claims with force to obtain the French throne. For a few years, England and France maintained an uneasy peace. Eventually, an escalation of conflict between the two kings led to King Philip VI confiscating the Duchy of Aquitaine (1337). Instead of paying homage for Aquitaine to the French king, as his ancestors had done, Edward claimed that he himself was the rightful King of France. These events helped launch the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) between England and France. Though England ultimately failed to win that prolonged conflict, English and British monarchs until 1801 continued to maintain, at least formally, a claim to the French throne.\nHundred Years' War.\nThe Hundred Years' War could be considered a lengthy war of succession between the houses of Valois and Plantagenet. The early reign of Philip VI was a promising one for France. The new king fought the Flemings on behalf of his vassal, the Count of Flanders, and restored that Count to power. Edward III's aggression against Scotland, a French ally, prompted Philip VI to confiscate Guyenne. In the past the English kings would have to submit to the King of France. But Edward, having descended from the French kings, claimed the throne for himself. France was then at the height of its power. No one believed that the English king could make good his claim to France.\nEdward's initial strategy was to ally with Flanders and the princes of the Empire. The alliances were costly and not very productive. While on a truce the French and English kings intervened in the War of the Breton Succession. In 1346, Edward invaded France and pillaged the countryside rather than attempt to hold territory. French forces led by Philip VI confronted Edward III at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, which resulted in a devastating and humiliating defeat for the French. Despite this, the most that Edward could make out of his victory was the capture of Calais.\nJohn II succeeded his father Philip VI in 1350. He was menaced by Charles II of Navarre, of the \u00c9vreux branch of the Capetian family, who aspired to the French throne by the right of his mother, the senior descendant of Philip IV of France. Charles' character eventually alienated both the French and English monarchs, because he readily switched sides whenever it suited his interests. In 1356, Edward, the Black Prince, eldest son and heir of Edward III, led an army to a chevauch\u00e9e in France. John pursued the Black Prince, who tried to avoid battling the French king's superior force. Negotiations broke down. In the Battle of Poitiers, the French suffered another humiliating defeat, and their king was captured. Edward hoped to capitalize on the victory by invading France and having himself crowned at Reims. But the new leader, the Dauphin Charles, avoided another pitched battle, and the city of Reims withstood siege. In the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny, the English king gained an enlarged Aquitaine in full sovereignty, gave up the duchy of Touraine, the counties of Anjou and Maine, the suzerainty of Brittany and of Flanders, and his claim to the French throne.\nCharles V became king in 1364. He supported Henry of Trast\u00e1mara in the Castilian Civil War, while the Black Prince supported the reigning king, Peter of Castile. The Black Prince won, but Peter refused to pay for his expenses. The Black Prince tried to recover his losses by raising taxes in Aquitaine, which prompted them to appeal to the King of France. War was renewed. The French recovered their territories, place after place. When Charles died in 1380, only Calais, Bordeaux and Bayonne were left to the English.\nThe ancient, great families of the feudal nobility had largely been replaced by an equally powerful class \u2013 the princes of the royal blood. With the confiscation of Guyenne, the only remaining non-Capetian peer was the Count of Flanders. The Montfort dukes of Brittany, the houses of \u00c9vreux and Bourbon, and the princes of the House of Valois, constituted the great nobility of the kingdom.\nSucceeding to the throne at the age of 11, the reign of Charles VI of France was the first minority since that of Saint Louis' in 1226. Power devolved into the hands of his uncles, the dukes of Anjou, Berry and Burgundy. The dukes squandered the resources of the monarchy to pursue their own ends. Anjou pursued his claim in the Kingdom of Naples; Berry governed his large estates in Languedoc; and Burgundy, having married the heiress of Flanders, found it more convenient to rule his vast dominions from Paris. Charles terminated his uncles' regency at the age of 21, even though he would have been entitled to it as early as the age of 14. His early reign was promising, but the onset of madness, which he may have inherited from the Bourbon dukes through his mother, would prove to be disastrous for France. Burgundy, the most powerful of the princes and peers, took power in his hands. But his nephew, Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the king's brother, contested his authority. Rivalry between the two princes and their descendants led to the Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War.\nIn 1415 Henry V of England, great-grandson of Edward III, invaded France. In the Battle of Agincourt, the Armagnac faction fought the English and was decimated. The dukes of Orl\u00e9ans and Bourbon were captured, and the Burgundian party gained ascendancy in Paris. Henry proceeded to conquer Normandy. The Armagnacs assassinated John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, a belated revenge for the assassination of Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. The new duke, Philip the Good, allied himself with the English. In the Treaty of Troyes, Henry V of England became regent of France and heir to that throne; he also married Catherine of Valois, the French king's daughter. The Dauphin Charles was effectively disinherited. To assume a greater appearance of legality, it was ratified by the Estates General later that year.\nTo accept the Treaty of Troyes would be a denial of the legitimacy of the Valois. While England was accustomed to changing her kings, the French largely adhered to theirs. The treaty was recognized only in English-controlled territories in northern France, and by the allied dukes of Burgundy and Brittany. Henry V died before his sickly father-in-law, Charles VI, leaving the future of the Lancastrian Kingdom of France in the hands of his infant son Henry VI of England, and his brother, John, Duke of Bedford.\nThe able leadership of Bedford prevented Charles VII from retaking control of northern France. In 1429, Joan of Arc successfully raised the siege of Orl\u00e9ans and had the king crowned at Reims, an important French propaganda victory. Power struggles between Bedford, his brother Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and their uncle Cardinal Beaufort hampered the English war effort. The Duke of Burgundy, alienated by the blunders of Gloucester, reconciled with the King of France in the Treaty of Arras, 1435. Bedford died that same year.\nThe warring parties arranged long truces, during which the French king prepared for the renewal of war, in contrast the English relaxed and took a break from fresh taxes. By 1450, the French had reconquered Normandy, and Guyenne the next year. A final English attempt to recover their losses ended in decisive defeat at the Battle of Castillon, 1453. With this victory, the English had been expelled in all of France except Calais. The Valois succession was upheld and confirmed.\nCentralization of power.\nWith the expulsion of the English, Charles VII had reestablished his kingdom as the foremost power of Western Europe. He created France's first standing army since Roman times, and limited papal power in the Gallican Church by the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. But his later years were marred by quarrels with his eldest son and heir, the Dauphin Louis, who refused to obey him. The dauphin was banished from court for his intrigues, and did not return to France until his father's death.\nLouis XI succeeded his father in 1461. At the beginning of his reign Louis reversed his father's policies, abolishing the Pragmatic Sanction to please the pope and the standing armies, which he distrusted, in favor of Swiss mercenaries. As a prince he had leagued with the nobility against his father, but as a king he found that his power could only be maintained by subduing them. He was the lifelong enemy of Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais, and later Duke of Burgundy. In 1465, the League of the Public Weal, an alliance of the feudal princes, which consisted of Charles, Duke of Berry, the king's brother, the Count of Charolais, the Dukes of Brittany, Bourbon, Lorraine (then a member of the House of Anjou), and several others, attempted to restore their feudal prerogatives. Louis feared a further escalation of the conflict against this formidable coalition. To obtain peace he conceded all their demands, including the Duchy of Normandy to his brother, which carried with it one-third of the offices of state.\nLouis seldom relied on the fortunes of war, but rather on intrigue and diplomacy. He maintained his power by paying pensions to well-placed people in the courts of his vassals and in neighboring states. He retook Normandy from his brother at the first opportunity. He bought off Edward IV of England to desist from attacking France. He fomented rebellions in the Burgundian dominions. At the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, he seized the duchy of Burgundy, which he claimed as a reverted fief, even though the original grant did not specify the exclusion of female heirs. But the marriage of Mary of Burgundy, heiress of Charles the Bold, to Maximilian of Austria would prove problematic for later generations. In 1481, the last male of the House of Anjou died, willing all the Angevin possessions to the king. At the end of his reign royal power had become absolute in France.\nItalian Wars.\nCharles VIII succeeded his father in 1483, at the age of 13. During his minority the nobles again attempted to seize power, but they were defeated by Charles' sister Anne of France. Charles' marriage to Anne of Brittany prevented a future total Habsburg encirclement of France.\nAs the heir of the House of Anjou, Charles VIII decided to press his claim to the Kingdom of Naples. It was the beginning of the Italian Wars. In September 1494 Charles invaded Italy with 25,000 men, and attained his object by 22 February 1495, virtually unopposed. But the speed and power of the French advance frightened the powers of Italy. The League of Venice, which consisted of the Republics of Venice and Florence, the Duchies of Milan and Mantua, the Kings of Spain and Naples, the Emperor and the Pope, united against the French. Charles, who did not wish to be trapped in Naples, had to fight against them in the Battle of Fornovo. Charles succeeded in returning to France, but all his conquests and booty were lost. The debts he incurred for the campaign prevented him from resuming the war, and he died in an accident in 1498. With his death the senior line of the House of Valois became extinct. He was succeeded by his cousin, the Duke of Orleans, who became Louis XII.\nLouis XII married his predecessor's widow, Anne of Brittany, in order to retain that province for France. The new king also continued his predecessor's policy in Italy. The Dukes of Orleans were descended from Valentina Visconti, and through her claimed the Duchy of Milan. From 1499 to 1512, excepting a brief period in 1500, Louis XII was Duke of Milan. French military activity continued in Italy, with various leagues formed to counter the dominant power. Louis died without a son, and was succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law, Francis of Angoul\u00eame, who became Francis I of France in 1515.\nFrancis I belonged to a cadet branch of the House of Orleans. In the Battle of Marignano, Francis defeated the Swiss, who had ousted his predecessor from Milan, and took control of the duchy. In the Imperial Election of 1519, the Kings of Spain, France, and England fought for the imperial title. The King of Spain was a grandson of the deceased emperor, but the electors thought him to be a foreigner as much as the French king. The kings resorted to bribes, and the Spanish king became Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.\nThe election of the Spanish king to the imperial throne made him the first monarch in Europe, both in title and in reality. Annoyed, the French king demanded that the emperor pay homage for Flanders and Artois; the emperor responded by reasserting his claim to the duchy of Burgundy. The rivalry of the French royal house with the Habsburgs dominated the rest of the sixteenth century. The emperor took Milan from the French in 1521. The King of England and the pope supported the emperor. France was surrounded by enemies on all sides. Domestic troubles led to the defection of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon and Constable of France, to the emperor. In 1525, at the Battle of Pavia, the French were defeated and the king himself was captured. Francis obtained his release through the Treaty of Madrid, in which he renounced claims in Naples and Milan, surrendered Burgundy to Spain, abandoned sovereignty over Flanders and Artois, and gave up two of his sons as hostages. Francis repudiated the treaty. Having often found himself alone in his struggle against the emperor, Francis formed the Franco-Ottoman alliance with the sultan, to the scandal of Christian Europe. Francis supported the conversion of the German princes to Protestantism, as it increased his potential allies against the emperor. In his own dominions, the Protestants were suppressed.\nHenry II succeeded to the throne in 1547. He continued his father's policies, as did his successors. He persecuted Protestants in his kingdom, while Protestants abroad were his allies. Henry captured the three bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun. French offensives failed in Italy. In 1556, Charles V abdicated, splitting the Habsburg dominions between his son, Philip II of Spain, who gained Spain and the Low Countries, and his brother Ferdinand I, who became emperor. The French retook Calais after England allied with Spain. The Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559) ended the Italian Wars. The French lost all their Italian territories except Saluzzo, and were confirmed in the possession of Calais and the three bishoprics. It was a diplomatic victory for Philip II, who gave up nothing which belonged to himself. The Spanish king retained Franche-Comt\u00e9 and was confirmed in his possession of Milan, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and the State of Presidi, making him the most powerful ruler in Italy.\nFrench Wars of Religion.\nThe last phase of Valois rule in France was marked by the French Wars of Religion. Henry II died in a jousting accident in 1559. His eldest son and heir, Francis II, succeeded him. The new king was already King of Scotland by right of his wife, Mary, Queen of Scots. The queen's maternal relatives, the House of Guise, gained an ascendancy over the young king.\nThe House of Guise was a cadet branch of the ducal House of Lorraine. They claimed descent from Charlemagne and had designs on the French throne. They considered the House of Bourbon, princes of the blood, as their natural enemies. The leading Bourbons, the brothers Antoine, King of Navarre, and Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9, were Protestants. The House of Guise identified themselves as champions of the Catholic cause. They were on the point of executing Cond\u00e9 when the young king died.\nWith the succession of her minor son Charles IX in 1560, Catherine de' Medici maneuvered for a balance of power. She released Cond\u00e9, hoping to use the Bourbons as a counterweight against the Guises. Antoine of Navarre converted to Catholicism and became Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom. The Massacre of Vassy sparked the \"first\" religious war between the Catholics and the Huguenots. Navarre and Guise died in this war. Anne de Montmorency, Constable of France, was the notable casualty of the second war. Cond\u00e9 died in the third war. The Huguenots were unable to win a substantive victory, but were able to keep an army in the field.\nHenry, King of Navarre, married Margaret of France, sister of Charles IX, in 1572. The marriage, which had been expected to reconcile the Protestants and Catholics, proved to be a disappointment. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre ensued; the Huguenots who flocked in Paris for the wedding were massacred \"en masse\". Navarre and Cond\u00e9 were spared, forced to convert, and detained. The guilt of having permitted the massacre would haunt Charles for the rest of his life. In 1573, the king's brother, Henry, Duke of Anjou, was elected King of Poland.\nIn 1574, only three months after Henry's coronation as King of Poland, he succeeded to the French throne as Henry III. The next year the king's only remaining brother, the Duke of Alen\u00e7on, fled the court and joined with Cond\u00e9 and Navarre. This combined threat forced the new king to grant the demands of the rebels. Alen\u00e7on was made Duke of Anjou. The concessions to the Huguenots disquieted the Catholics, who formed the Catholic League. The League was led by the princes of the House of Lorraine \u2013 the dukes of Guise, Mayenne, Aumale, Elboeuf, Merc\u0153ur and Lorraine, supported by Spain. The Huguenots held the southwest and were allied to England and the princes of Germany. The death of the king's brother, in 1584, meant that the Huguenot King of Navarre had become heir presumptive to the throne of France. Pressured by the Catholic League, the king issued the Treaty of Nemours, which outlawed Protestantism and made Protestants incapable of holding royal office.\nIn the resulting War of the Three Henrys, the royalists led by the king, the Huguenots led by Henry of Navarre, and the Catholic League led by Henry of Guise, fought a three-way contest for the control of France. After the humiliation of the Day of the Barricades, Henry III fled from Paris. Guise had entered Paris against his express prohibition; he resolved to assassinate the audacious duke. The assassination of Guise drew the odium of the Catholic League. Henry III sought the alliance of Navarre. The two kings were on the point of taking Paris with their great army, when the French king fell by the hands of an assassin. With his death the male line of the House of Valois had been completely extinguished, after reigning for 261 years in France.\nSuccession.\nThe royal Bourbons originated in 1272, when the youngest son of King Louis IX married the heiress of the lordship of Bourbon. The house continued for three centuries as a cadet branch, serving as nobles under the Direct Capetian and Valois kings.\nIn 1589, at the death of Henry III of France, the House of Valois became extinct in the male line. Under the Salic law, the Head of the House of Bourbon, as the senior representative of the senior-surviving branch of the Capetian dynasty, became King of France as Henry IV.\nList of Valois kings of France.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nValois-Angoul\u00eame.\nThe application of the Salic Law meant that with the extinction of the Valois in the male line, the Bourbons succeeded to the throne as descendants of Louis IX.\nOther significant titles held by the House of Valois.\nCount of Valois.\nHouse of Valois\nLatin Emperor of Constantinople.\nHouse of Valois\nHouse of Valois\u2013Courtenay\nCounts and Dukes of Alen\u00e7on.\nHouse of Valois\nHouse of Valois-Alen\u00e7on\nHouse of Fran\u00e7a (Portugal)\nCounts and Dukes of Anjou.\nHouse of Valois-Anjou\nDukes of Burgundy.\nHouse of Valois-Burgundy\nDukes of Brabant.\nHouse of Valois-Burgundy-Brabant\nCounts of Nevers.\nHouse of Valois-Burgundy-Nevers\nDukes of Orl\u00e9ans.\nHouse of Valois\nHouse of Valois-Orl\u00e9ans\nDuke of Brittany.\nHouse of Valois\u2013Orl\u00e9ans\nHouse of Valois-Orl\u00e9ans-Angoul\u00eame\nCounts of Angoul\u00eame.\nHouse of Valois-Orl\u00e9ans-Angoul\u00eame\nForms of address.\nForms of address for Valois kings and princes included \"Most Christian Majesty\", \"Dauphin\", \"your Grace\", \"Your Majesty\", \"Most regal Majesty\".\nFamily tree.\nUnlike in some other family trees, siblings here are not listed in birth order.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The First Republic lasted until the declaration of the First Empire on 18 May 1804 under Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, although the form of government changed several times.\nOn 21 September 1792, the deputies of the Convention, gathered for the first time, unanimously decided the abolition of the constitutional monarchy in France.\nAlthough the Republic was never officially proclaimed on 22 September 1792, the decision was made to date the acts from the year I of the Republic. On 25 September 1792, the Republic was declared \"one and indivisible\". From 1792 to 1802, France was at war with the rest of Europe. It also experienced internal conflicts, including the wars in Vend\u00e9e.\nThis period was characterised by the downfall and abolition of the French monarchy, the establishment of the National Convention and the Reign of Terror, the Thermidorian Reaction and the founding of the Directory, and, finally, the creation of the Consulate and Napoleon's rise to power.\nEnd of the monarchy in France.\nUnder the Legislative Assembly, which was in power before the proclamation of the First Republic, France was engaged in war with Prussia and Austria. In July 1792, Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, commanding general of the Austro\u2013Prussian Army, issued his Brunswick Manifesto, threatening the destruction of Paris should any harm come to King Louis XVI and his family.\nThis foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil amid the French Revolution and deepened the passion and sense of urgency among the various factions. In the insurrection of 10 August 1792, citizens stormed the Tuileries Palace, killing six hundred of the King's Swiss guards and insisting on the removal of the king.\nA renewed fear of counterrevolutionary action prompted further violence, and in the first week of September 1792, mobs of Parisians broke into the city's prisons. They killed over half of the prisoners, including nobles, clergymen, and political prisoners, but also common criminals, such as prostitutes and petty thieves. Many victims were murdered in their cells: raped, stabbed, and/or slashed to death. This became known as the September Massacres.\nNational Convention (1792\u20131795).\nAs a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution.\nThe convention's first act was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. Louis XVI, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of Capet, was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed.\nThroughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, and was given a monumental task: \"To deal with the radical movements of the Enrag\u00e9s, food shortages and riots, the revolt in the Vend\u00e9e and in Brittany, recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.\"\nMost notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and perceived enemies of the republic began to be executed by guillotine at an ever-increasing rate. This began a period which is known today as the Reign of Terror.\nDespite growing discontent with the National Convention as a ruling body, in June the Convention drafted the Constitution of 1793, which was ratified by popular vote in early August. However, the Committee of Public Safety was seen as an \"emergency\" government, and the rights guaranteed by the 1789 \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" and the new constitution were suspended under its control.\nThe constitution of the republic did not provide for a formal head of state or a head of government.\nIt could be discussed whether the head of state would have been the president of the National Convention under international law. However, this changed every two weeks and was therefore not formative.\nDirectory (1795\u20131799).\nAfter the arrest and execution of Robespierre on 28 July 1794, the Jacobin club was closed, and the surviving Girondins were reinstated. A year later, the National Convention adopted the Constitution of the Year III. They reestablished freedom of worship, began releasing large numbers of prisoners, and most importantly, initiated elections for a new legislative body.\nOn 3 November 1795, the Directory was established. Under this system, France was led by a bicameral Parliament, consisting of an upper chamber called the Council of Elders (with 250 members) and a lower chamber called the Council of Five Hundred (with, accordingly, 500 members), and a collective Executive of five members called the Directory (from which the historical period gets its name). Due to internal instability, caused by hyperinflation of the paper monies (\"Assignats\"), and French military disasters in 1798 and 1799, the Directory lasted only four years, until overthrown in 1799.\nConsulate (1799\u20131804).\nThe French Consulate era began with the coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799. Members of the Directory itself planned the coup, indicating clearly the failing power of the Directory. Napoleon Bonaparte was a co-conspirator in the coup and became head of the government as the First Consul.\nOn 18 May 1804, Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor of the French by the . He would later proclaim himself Emperor of the French, ending the First French Republic and ushering in the French First Empire.\nIn conjunction with this powerful executive authority, four assemblies were established:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
