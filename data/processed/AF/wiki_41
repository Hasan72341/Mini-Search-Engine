She was a premier star during Hollywood's silent and early golden eras. Regarded as one of the greatest screen actresses of all time, she is known for her melancholic and somber screen persona, her film portrayals of tragic characters, and her subtle and understated performances. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on its list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.\nGarbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film \"The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling\". Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, \"Torrent\" (1926). Garbo's performance in \"Flesh and the Devil\" (1926), her third movie in the United States, made her an international star. In 1928, Garbo starred in \"A Woman of Affairs,\" which catapulted her to MGM's highest box-office star, surpassing the long-reigning Lillian Gish. Other well-known Garbo films from the silent era are \"The Mysterious Lady\" (1928), \"The Single Standard\" (1929), and \"The Kiss\" (1929).\nWith Garbo's first sound film, \"Anna Christie\" (1930), MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline \"Garbo talks!\" That same year she starred in \"Romance\" and for her performances in both films she received her first combined nomination out of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. By 1932 her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contracts and she became increasingly selective about her roles. She continued in films such as \"Mata Hari\" (1931), \"Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)\" (1931), \"Grand Hotel\" (1932), \"Queen Christina\" (1933), and \"Anna Karenina\" (1935).\nMany critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in \"Camille\" (1936) to be her finest and the role gained her a third Academy Award nomination. However, Garbo's career soon declined and she became one of many stars labelled box office poison in 1938. Her career revived with a turn to comedy in \"Ninotchka\" (1939), which earned her a fourth Academy Award nomination. \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941), a box-office flop, was the last of her 28 feature films. Following this commercial failure, she continued to be offered movie roles, though she declined most of them. Those she did accept failed to materialize, either due to lack of funds or because she dropped out during filming. In 1954, Garbo was awarded an Academy Honorary Award \"for her luminous and unforgettable screen performances\".\nOver time, Garbo would decline all opportunities to return to the screen. In her retirement, she shunned publicity, led a private life, and became an art collector whose paintings included works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pierre Bonnard and Kees van Dongen. Although she refused throughout her life to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: \"I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio\u00a0... I really wanted to live another life.\"\nEarly life and education.\nGreta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in S\u00f6dermalm, Stockholm, Sweden at 7:30\u00a0p.m. She was the third, and youngest, child of Anna Lovisa (n\u00e9e Karlsson, 1872\u20131944), who worked at a jam factory, and Karl Alfred Gustafsson (1871\u20131920), a laborer. She had an older brother, Sven Alfred (1898\u20131967), and an older sister, Alva Maria (1903\u20131926). Garbo was nicknamed Kata, which was how she had mispronounced her first name, for the first ten years of her life.\nHer parents met in Stockholm, where her father had been visiting from Frinnaryd. He moved to Stockholm to become independent and worked as a street cleaner, grocer, factory worker and butcher's assistant. He married Anna, who moved from H\u00f6gsby. The family was impoverished and lived in a three-bedroom cold-water flat at Blekingegatan No. 32. They raised their three children in a working-class district regarded as the city's slum. Garbo later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was eternally grey\u2014those long winter's nights. My father would be sitting in a corner, scribbling figures on a newspaper. On the other side of the room, my mother is repairing ragged old clothes, sighing. We children would be talking in very low voices, or just sitting silently. We were filled with anxiety, as if there were danger in the air. Such evenings are unforgettable for a sensitive girl, but also for a girl like me. Where we lived, all the houses and apartments looked alike, their ugliness matched by everything surrounding us.\nGarbo was a shy daydreamer as a child. She disliked school and preferred to play alone. She was a natural leader who became interested in theatre at an early age. She directed her friends in make-believe games and performances, and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school, and, typical of a Swedish working-class girl at that time, she did not attend high school. She later acknowledged a resulting inferiority complex.\nThe Spanish flu spread throughout Stockholm in the winter of 1919 and her father, to whom she was very close, became ill and lost his job. Garbo cared for him, taking him to the hospital for weekly treatments. He died in 1920 when she was 14 years old.\nCareer.\n1920\u20131924: Beginnings.\nGarbo first worked as a soap-lather girl in a barber shop before taking a job in the PUB department store where she ran errands and worked in the millinery department. After modeling hats for the store's catalogues, Garbo earned a more lucrative job as a fashion model at Nordiska Kompaniet. In 1920, a director of film commercials for the store cast Garbo in roles advertising women's clothing. Her first commercial premiered on 12 December 1920 In 1922, Garbo caught the attention of director Erik A. Petschler, who gave her a part, credited as Greta Gustafson, in his short comedy \"Peter the Tramp\", released as \"Luffar-Petter\".&lt;ref name=\"SFdb/3537\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"nypl/Luffar-Petter |\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"loc.gov/2021670583\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;From 1922 to 1924, she studied at the Royal Dramatic Training Academy in Stockholm. She was recruited in 1924 by the Finnish director Mauritz Stiller to play a principal part in his film \"The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling\", a dramatization of the famous novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, which also featured the actor Lars Hanson. Stiller became her mentor, training her as a film actress and managing all aspects of her nascent career. She followed her role in \"G\u00f6sta Berling\" with a starring role in the German film \"Die freudlose Gasse\" (\"Joyless Street\" or \"The Street of Sorrow\", 1925), directed by G. W. Pabst and co-starring Asta Nielsen. She praised Asta and said: \"In terms of expression and versatility, I am nothing to her.\"\nAccounts differ on the circumstances of her first contract with Louis B. Mayer, at that time vice president and general manager of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Victor Seastrom, a respected Swedish director at MGM, was a friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one, Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer, but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of \"G\u00f6sta Berling\". He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. \"It was her eyes,\" his daughter recalled him saying, \"I can make a star out of her.\" In the second version, Mayer had already seen \"G\u00f6sta Berling\" before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter: \"This director is wonderful, but what we really ought to look at is the girl\u00a0... The girl, look at the girl!\" After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: \"I'll take her without him. I'll take her \"with\" him. Number one is the girl.\"\n1925\u20131929: Silent film stardom.\nIn 1925, Garbo, who was unable to speak English, was brought to Hollywood from Sweden at the request of Mayer. After a 10-day crossing on the in July, Garbo and Stiller arrived in New York where they remained for more than six months without word from MGM. They decided to travel to Los Angeles on their own but another five weeks passed without contact from the studio. On the verge of returning to Sweden, Garbo wrote her boyfriend back home, \"You're quite right when you think I don't feel at home here\u00a0... Oh, you lovely little Sweden, I promise that when I return to you, my sad face will smile as never before.\" A Swedish friend in Los Angeles helped by contacting MGM production boss Irving Thalberg, who agreed to give Garbo a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, \"the result of the test was electrifying. Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the young actress the following day, arranging to fix her teeth, making sure she lost weight and giving her English lessons.\"\nDuring her rise to stardom, film historian Mark Vieira notes, \"Thalberg decreed that henceforth, Garbo would play a young, but worldly wise, woman.\" However, according to Thalberg's actress wife, Norma Shearer, Garbo did not necessarily agree with his ideas stating \"Miss Garbo at first didn't like playing the exotic, the sophisticated, the woman of the world. She used to complain, \"Mr. Thalberg, I am just a young gur-rl!\" Irving tossed it off with a laugh. With those elegant pictures, he was creating the Garbo image\". Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film, she was cast in \"Torrent\" (1926), an adaptation of a novel by Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, with director Monta Bell. She replaced Aileen Pringle, 10 years her senior, and played a peasant girl turned singer, opposite Ricardo Cortez. \"Torrent\" was a hit, and, despite its cool reception by the trade press, Garbo's performance was well received.\nGarbo's success in her first American film led Thalberg to cast her in a similar role in \"The Temptress\" (1926), based on another Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez novel. In this, her second film, she played opposite the popular star Antonio Moreno but was given top billing. Her mentor Stiller, who had persuaded her to take the part, was assigned to direct. For both Garbo (who did not want to play another vamp and did not like the script any more than she did the first one) and Stiller, \"The Temptress\" was a harrowing experience. Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno, was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo. Re-shooting \"The Temptress\" was expensive, and even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926\u20131927 season, it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. However, Garbo received rave reviews, and MGM had a new star.\nAfter her lightning ascent, Garbo made eight more silent films, and all were hits. She starred in three of them with the leading man John Gilbert. About their first movie, \"Flesh and the Devil\" (1926), silent film expert Kevin Brownlow states that \"she gave a more erotic performance than Hollywood had ever seen.\" Their on-screen chemistry soon translated into an off-camera romance, and by the end of the production, they began living together. The film also marked a turning point in Garbo's career. Vieira wrote: \"Audiences were mesmerized by her beauty and titillated by her love scenes with Gilbert. She was a sensation.\" Profits from her third movie with Gilbert, \"A Woman of Affairs\" (1928), catapulted her to top Metro star of the 1928\u20131929 box office season, usurping the long-reigned silent queen Lillian Gish. In 1929, reviewer Pierre de Rohan wrote in the \"New York Telegraph\": \"She has glamour and fascination for both sexes which have never been equaled on the screen.\"\nThe impact of Garbo's acting and screen presence quickly established her reputation as one of Hollywood's greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She \"lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips,\" he says. \"Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids. Worlds turned on her movements.\"\nDuring this period, Garbo began to require unusual conditions during the shooting of her scenes. She prohibited visitors\u2014including the studio brass\u2014from her sets and demanded that black flats or screens surround her to prevent extras and technicians from watching her. When asked about these eccentric requirements, she said: \"If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.\"\nDespite her status as a star of silent films, the studio feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound, and delayed the shift for as long as possible. MGM itself was the last Hollywood studio to convert to sound, and Garbo's last silent film, \"The Kiss\" (1929), was also the studio's. Despite the fears, Garbo became one of the biggest box-office draws of the next decade.\n1930\u20131939: Transition to sound and continued success.\nIn late 1929, MGM cast Garbo in \"Anna Christie\" (1930), a film adaptation of the 1922 play by Eugene O'Neill, her first speaking role. The screenplay was adapted by Frances Marion, and the film was produced by Irving Thalberg and Paul Bern. Sixteen minutes into the film, she famously utters her first line, \"Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy, baby.\" The film premiered in New York City on 21 February 1930, publicized with the catchphrase \"Garbo talks!\", and was the highest-grossing film of the year. Her performance received positive reviews; Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" remarked that Garbo was \"even more interesting through being heard than she was in her mute portrayals. She reveals no nervousness before the microphone and her careful interpretation of Anna can scarcely be disputed.\" Garbo received her first Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance, although she lost to MGM colleague Norma Shearer. Her nomination that year included her performance in \"Romance\" (1930). After filming ended, Garbo\u2014along with a different director and cast\u2014filmed a German-language version of \"Anna Christie\" that was released in December 1930. The film's success certified Garbo's successful transition to talkies. In her follow-up film, \"Romance\", she portrayed an Italian opera star, opposite Lewis Stone. She was paired opposite Robert Montgomery in \"Inspiration\" (1931), and her profile was used to boost the career of the relatively unknown Clark Gable in \"Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)\" (1931). Although the films did not match Garbo's success with her sound debut, she was ranked as the most popular female star in the United States in 1930 and 1931.\nGarbo followed with two of her best-remembered roles. She played the World War I German spy in the lavish production of \"Mata Hari\" (1931), opposite Ram\u00f3n Novarro. When the film was released, it \"caused panic, with police reserves required to keep the waiting mob in order.\" The following year, she played a Russian ballerina in \"Grand Hotel\" (1932), opposite an ensemble cast, including John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, and Wallace Beery, among others. The film won that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Both films were MGM's highest-earning films of 1931 and 1932, respectively, and Garbo was dubbed \"the greatest money-making machine ever put on screen\". Garbo's close friend Mercedes de Acosta then penned a screenplay for her to portray Joan of Arc, but MGM rebuffed the idea, and the project was shelved. By this time she had a fanatical worldwide following and the phenomenon of \"Garbomania\" reached its peak. After appearing in \"As You Desire Me\" (1932), the first of three films in which Garbo starred opposite Melvyn Douglas, her MGM contract expired, and she returned to Sweden.\nAfter nearly a year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her contract with MGM on the condition that she would star in \"Queen Christina\" (1933), and her salary would be increased to $300,000 per film. The film's screenplay had been written by Salka Viertel; although reluctant to make the movie, MGM relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested Charles Boyer or Laurence Olivier, but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover John Gilbert. The studio balked at the idea of casting Gilbert, fearing his declining career would hurt the film's box-office, but Garbo prevailed. \"Queen Christina\" was a lavish production, becoming one of the studio's biggest productions at the time. Publicized as \"Garbo returns\", the film premiered in December 1933 to positive reviews and box-office triumph and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The movie, however, met with controversy upon its release; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co-star.\nAlthough her domestic popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s, high profits for Garbo's films after \"Queen Christina\" depended on the foreign market for their success. The type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel were highly successful abroad, but considerably less so in the United States. In the midst of the Great Depression, American screen audiences seemed to favor \"home-grown\" screen couples, such as Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. David O. Selznick wanted to cast Garbo as the dying heiress in \"Dark Victory\" (eventually released in 1939 with other leads), but she chose Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" (1935), in which she played another of her renowned roles. Her performance won her the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. The film was successful in international markets, and had better domestic rentals than MGM anticipated. Still, its profit was significantly diminished because of Garbo's exorbitant salary.\nGarbo selected George Cukor's romantic drama \"Camille\" (1936) as her next project. Thalberg cast her opposite Robert Taylor and former co-star, Lionel Barrymore. Cukor carefully crafted Garbo's portrayal of Marguerite Gautier, a lower-class woman, who becomes the world-renowned mistress Camille. Production was marred, however, by the sudden death of Thalberg, then only thirty-seven, which plunged the Hollywood studios into a \"state of profound shock\", writes David Bret. Garbo had grown close to Thalberg and his wife, Norma Shearer, and had often dropped by their house unannounced. Her grief for Thalberg, some believe, was more profound than for John Gilbert, who died earlier that same year. His death also added to the sombre mood required for the closing scenes of \"Camille\". When the film premiered in New York on 12 December 1936, it became an international success, Garbo's first major success in three years. She won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for her performance, and she was nominated once more for an Academy Award. Garbo regarded \"Camille\" as her favorite out of all of her films.\nGarbo's follow-up project was Clarence Brown's lavish production of \"Conquest\" (1937), opposite Charles Boyer. The plot was the dramatized romance between Napoleon and Marie Walewska. It was MGM's biggest and most-publicized movie of its year, but upon its release, it became one of the studio's biggest failures of the decade at the box office. When her contract expired soon thereafter, she returned briefly to Sweden. On 3 May 1938, Garbo was among the many stars\u2014including Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Luise Rainer, Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire, and Dolores del R\u00edo, among others\u2014dubbed to be \"Box Office Poison\" in an article published by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners of America.\nAfter the box-office failure of \"Conquest\", MGM decided a change of pace was needed to resurrect Garbo's career. For her next movie, the studio teamed her with producer-director Ernst Lubitsch to film \"Ninotchka\" (1939), her first comedy. The film was one of the first Hollywood movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as being rigid and gray when compared to Paris in its pre-war years. \"Ninotchka\" premiered in October 1939, publicized with the catchphrase \"Garbo laughs!\", commenting on the departure of Garbo's serious and melancholy image as she transferred to comedy. Favoured by critics and box-office success in the United States and abroad, it was banned in the Soviet Union.\n1941\u20131948: Last work and retirement.\nWith George Cukor's \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success in \"Ninotchka\" by re-teaming her with Melvyn Douglas in another romantic comedy which sought to transform her into a chic, modern woman. She played a \"double\" role that featured her dancing the rhumba, swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical failure, but, contrary to popular belief, it performed reasonably well at the box office. Garbo referred to the film as \"my grave\". \"Two-Faced Woman\" was her last film; she was thirty-six and had made 28 feature films in a span of 16 years.\nAlthough Garbo felt humiliated by the negative reviews of \"Two-Faced Woman\", she did not intend to retire at first. But her films depended on the European market, and when it fell through because of the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM. Garbo signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make \"The Girl from Leningrad\", but the project quickly dissolved. She still thought she would continue when the war was over, though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. Salka Viertel, Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945: \"Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it.\" Garbo also worried about her age. \"Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off.\" George Cukor, director of \"Two-Faced Woman\", and often blamed for its failure, said: \"People often glibly say that the failure of \"Two-Faced Woman\" finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque over-simplification. It certainly threw her, but I think that what really happened was that she just gave up. She didn't want to go on.\"\nStill, Garbo signed a contract in 1948 with producer Walter Wanger, who had produced \"Queen Christina\", to shoot a picture based on Balzac's \"La Duchesse de Langeais\". Max Oph\u00fcls was slated to adapt and direct. She made several screen tests, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize, and the project was abandoned. The screen tests\u2014the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera\u2014were thought to have been lost for 41 years until they were re-discovered in 1990 by film historians Leonard Maltin and Jeanine Basinger. Parts of the footage were included in the 2005 TCM documentary \"Garbo\".\nIn 1949, she was offered the role of fictional silent-film star Norma Desmond in \"Sunset Boulevard\", directed by \"Ninotchka\" co-writer Billy Wilder. However, after a meeting with film producer Charles Brackett, she insisted that she had no interest in the part whatsoever.\nShe was offered many roles both in the 1940s and throughout her retirement years but rejected all but a few of them. In the few instances when she did accept them, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused throughout her life to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring, four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: \"I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio\u00a0... I really wanted to live another life.\"\nPublic persona.\nFrom the early days of her career, Garbo avoided industry social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating, \"As early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I've always been moody. I detest crowds, I don't like many people.\" The artist James Montgomery Flagg said in 1933 that when he was allowed to sketch Garbo at a director's party in Hollywood some years earlier she told him she suffered from melancholia. At that time she had a Swedish phonograph record of laughs of all kinds which she played when visiting, to observe her hosts' response. In 1937, in a letter to her friend, Austrian actress and writer Salka Viertel, she wrote: \"I go nowhere, see no one... It is hard and sad to be alone, but sometimes it's even more difficult to be with someone...\" In another letter in 1970 she wrote: \"I feel very tired and cannot seem to get myself together to plan where to go... I am sorry but something always seem to go a little wrong with me, and it is not in my head either...\"\nBecause Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood's publicity rules. She was routinely referred to by the press as the \"Swedish Sphinx\". Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique she projected both on screen and in real life. MGM eventually capitalized on it, for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery. In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century's most publicized women. She is closely associated with a line from \"Grand Hotel\", one which the American Film Institute in 2005 voted the 30th-most memorable movie quote of all time, \"I want to be alone; I just want to be alone.\" The theme was a running gag in her movies that began during the silent period. According to a 1955 piece in LIFE magazine, Garbo explained that she'd said: \"I want to be \"let\" alone\", not \"I want to be alone\".\nFashion and personal style.\nAfter starring in \"Torrent\" (1926), she became known as \"the Art Deco Diva\". She favored men's shoes and clothes and her style has been described as \"trench coat, simple shoes, shirts, cigarette pants, slouch hat and big sunglasses.\" Garbo has been credited with popularizing the \"slouchy hat\".\nPersonal life.\nRetirement.\nIn her retirement, Garbo generally led a private life of simplicity and leisure. She made no public appearances and assiduously avoided the publicity she loathed. Contrary to myth, from the beginning she had many friends and acquaintances with whom she socialized and travelled, although it has also been said that in later years she did not trust many people and therefore did not have many close friends. Her usual response to anyone asking her about a comeback was \"I have made enough faces\", as she once said to David Niven.\nGarbo was often perplexed about what to do and how to spend her time, always struggling with her many eccentricities and her life-long melancholy and moodiness. (\"Drifting\" was the word she frequently used; in 1946 she told reporters, \"I have no plans, either for the movies or anything else. I'm just drifting.\") As she approached her sixtieth birthday in 1965, she told a frequent walking companion, \"In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave me for the rest of my life.\" She told another friend in 1971, \"I suppose I suffer from very deep depression.\" One biographer claims that she could have been bipolar. \"I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me\", she said in 1933.\nBeginning in the 1940s, Garbo became an art collector. Although many of the paintings she owned were of negligible monetary value, she also owned valuable works by Renoir, Rouault, Kandinsky, Bonnard and Jawlensky. Her art collection was worth millions of dollars when she died in 1990.\nOn 9 February 1951, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and bought a seven-room apartment at 450 East 52nd Street in Manhattan in 1953, where she lived for the rest of her life. Her New York apartment buzzer was identified by a solitary G and the interior was a \"light and airy study in pink\". In order to protect her privacy, she preferred being addressed as \"Miss [Harriet] Brown\". Her close friends were only allowed to call her Miss Garbo or G.G.; if they called her Greta, she wouldn't respond.\nGarbo was a dinner guest at the White House on 13 November 1963, just nine days before the assassination of JFK. She spent the night at the Washington, D.C. home of philanthropist&lt;ref name=\"latimes/me-mahoney21\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Stephenson Mahoney. Garbo's niece reported that Garbo had always spoken of it as a \"magical evening\".\nItalian film director Luchino Visconti allegedly attempted to bring Garbo back to the screen in 1969 with the small part of Maria Sophia, Queen of Naples in his adaptation of Proust's \"Remembrance of Things Past\". He exclaimed: \"I am very pleased with the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust.\" Claims that Garbo was interested in the part cannot be substantiated.\nIn 1971, Garbo vacationed in Southern France at the summer home of her close friend Baroness C\u00e9cile de Rothschild who introduced her to Samuel Adams Green, an art collector and curator in New York City. Green became an important friend and walking companion. He was in the habit of tape-recording all of his telephone calls, including many of his conversations with Garbo. He did so with her permission, but Garbo ended the friendship in 1981 after being falsely told that Green had played the tapes to friends. In his last will and testament, Green bequeathed all of the tapes in 2011 to the film archives at Wesleyan University. The tapes reveal Garbo's personality in later life, her sense of humor, and various eccentricities. In 1977, Garbo wrote to Frederick Sands: \"I am forever running away from something or somebody\"... \"Unconsciously I have always known that I was not destined for real and lasting happiness.\"\nAlthough she was increasingly withdrawn in her final years, Garbo became close to her cook and housekeeper Claire Koger, who worked for her for 31 years. \"We were very close\u2014like sisters,\" Koger said.\nThroughout her life, Garbo was known for taking long daily walks with companions or by herself. In retirement, she walked the streets of New York City, dressed casually and wearing large sunglasses. \"Garbo-watching\" became a sport for photographers, the media, admirers, and curious New Yorkers, but she strictly maintained her privacy and her elusive mystique followed her to the end.\nNorwegian actress Liv Ullmann, who was dubbed \"The New Greta Garbo\", and played Anna Christie on Broadway in 1977, saw Garbo in the street and ran after her, in hopes of meeting her and telling her she was playing Anna Christie. Garbo ran away from her and disappeared into Central Park. Ullmann gave up the chase after she saw that Garbo looked \"frightened\". She said: \"Yes, she outpaced me. But when she turned and looked so frightened I gave up and didn't follow her. I was younger; I could have made it, but I didn't.\"\nRelationships.\nGarbo never married, had no children, and lived alone for most of her adult life. Her most famous romance was with her frequent MGM co-star John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her develop acting skills on the set and teaching her how to behave like a star, socialize at parties, and deal with studio bosses. They co-starred again in three more hits: \"Love\" (1927), \"A Woman of Affairs\" (1928), and \"Queen Christina\" (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to Garbo numerous times and she finally accepted, but backed out just before the wedding. \"I was in love with him,\" she said. \"But I froze. I was afraid he would tell me what to do and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss.\" In later years when asked about Gilbert, Garbo said \"I can't remember what I ever saw in him.\" According to Ava Gardner's autobiography, Garbo admitted to her that Gilbert was the only man she'd ever really loved but he had \"let [her] down\" by having a \"superstitious affair\" with \"a little extra\" during their last film and she had never forgiven him.\nIn 1937, Garbo met Leopold Stokowski, then conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, with whom she had a brief, but highly publicized relationship while the pair traveled throughout Europe the following year; whether the relationship was romantic or platonic is uncertain. In his diary, Erich Maria Remarque discusses a liaison with Garbo in 1941, and in his memoir, Cecil Beaton described an affair with her in 1947 and 1948. In 1941, she met the Russian-born millionaire George Schlee, who was introduced to her by his wife, fashion designer Valentina. Nicholas Turner, Garbo's close friend for 33 years, said that, after she bought an apartment in the same building, \"Garbo moved in and took Schlee from Valentina right away.\" Schlee would divide his time between the two, becoming Garbo's close companion and advisor until his death in 1964.\nGarbo once said: \"If I were ever to love anyone, it would be Mauritz Stiller.\"\nRecent biographers and others have speculated that because it can be assumed she had intimate relationships with women as well as men, Garbo was bisexual, possibly even \"predominantly lesbian\". In 1927, Garbo was introduced to stage and screen actress Lilyan Tashman, and they may have had an affair, according to some writers. Silent film star Louise Brooks stated that she and Garbo had a brief liaison the following year.\nIn 1931, Garbo befriended the writer and acknowledged lesbian Mercedes de Acosta, whom she met through Salka Viertel, and, according to Garbo's and de Acosta's biographers, began a sporadic and volatile romance.\nThe two remained friends\u2014with ups and downs\u2014for almost 30 years, during which time Garbo wrote de Acosta 181 letters, cards, and telegrams, now at the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. Garbo's family, which controls her estate, has made only 87 of these items publicly available.\nIn 2005, Mimi Pollak's estate released 60 letters Garbo had written to her in their long correspondence. Several letters suggest she may have had romantic feelings for Pollak for many years. After learning of Pollak's pregnancy in 1930, for example, Garbo wrote: \"We cannot help our nature, as God has created it. But I have always thought you and I belonged together.\" In 1975, she wrote a poem about not being able to touch the hand of her friend with whom she might have been walking through life.\nDeath.\nGarbo was successfully treated for breast cancer in 1984. Towards the end of her life, only Garbo's closest friends knew she was receiving six-hour dialysis treatments three times a week at The Rogosin Institute in New York Hospital. A photograph appeared in the media in early 1990, showing Koger assisting Garbo, who was walking with a cane, into the hospital.\nGarbo died on Easter Sunday, 15 April 1990, aged 84, in the hospital, as a result of pneumonia and renal failure. Daum later claimed that towards the end, she also suffered from gastrointestinal and periodontal ailments.\nGarbo was cremated and her ashes were interred nine years later in 1999 at Skogskyrkog\u00e5rden Cemetery just south of her native Stockholm.\nGarbo made numerous investments, primarily in stocks and bonds, and left her entire estate of $32million () to her niece.\nLegacy.\nGarbo was an international movie star during the late silent era and the \"Golden Age\" of Hollywood who became a screen icon.\n For most of her career, Garbo was the highest-paid star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, making her for many years the studio's \"premier prestige star\". After her death, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published an obituary calling her \"the most alluring, vibrant and yet aloof character to grace the motion-picture screen.\" The April 1990 \"Washington Post\" obituary said that \"at the peak of her popularity, she was a virtual cult figure.\"\nGarbo possessed a subtlety and naturalism in her acting that set her apart from other actors and actresses of the period. About her work in silents, film critic Ty Burr said: \"This was a new kind of actor\u2014not the stage actor who had to play to the far seats, but someone who could just look and with her eyes literally go from rage to sorrow in just a close-up.\"\nFilm historian Jeffrey Vance said that Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and, most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters and the truth of the situation. \"She doesn't act,\" said \"Camille\" co-star Rex O'Malley, \"she lives her roles.\" Clarence Brown, who directed seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer, \"Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has been able to do that on screen.\" Director George Sidney adds: \"You could call it underplaying, but in underplaying, she overplayed everyone else.\"\nMany critics have said that few of Garbo's 24 Hollywood films are artistically exceptional, and that many are simply bad. It has been said, however, that her commanding and magnetic performances usually overcome the weaknesses of plot and dialogue. As one biographer put it, \"All moviegoers demanded of a Garbo production was Greta Garbo.\"\nFilm historian Ephraim Katz: \"Of all the stars who have ever fired the imaginations of audiences, none has quite projected a magnetism and a mystique equal to Garbo. 'The Divine', the 'dream princess of eternity', the 'Sarah Bernhardt of films', are only a few of the superlatives writers used in describing her over the years\u00a0... She played heroines that were at once sensual and pure, superficial and profound, suffering and hopeful, world-weary and life-inspiring.\"\nAmerican film actress Bette Davis: \"Her instinct, her mastery over the machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman's acting. I only know that no one else so effectively worked in front of a camera.\"\nMexican film actress Dolores del R\u00edo: \"The most extraordinary woman (in art) that I have encountered in my life. It was as if she had diamonds in her bones and in her interior light struggled to come out through the pores of her skin.\"\nAmerican film director George Cukor: \"She had a talent that few actresses or actors possess. In close-ups, she gave the impression, the illusion of great movement. She would move her head just a little bit, and the whole screen would come alive, like a strong breeze that made itself felt.\"\nAmerican film actor Gregory Peck: \"If you ask me my favorite actress of all time, I will tell you that it is Greta Garbo. She shared her emotions with the camera and the audience. They were very truthful emotions. To my mind, she was an early practitioner of the Method. She felt everything she did and had the intelligence to go with it. ... And that is the key for the audience. If they believe it, then they've spent a couple of good hours at the cinema.\"\nAmerican film actress Kim Novak: \"You know, my idol, I idolize Greta Garbo. I just loved her work so much. She was, again, so real. She was not -- to me, she wasn't stylized. You could see any of her work right now. She was just amazing, and what I loved about it also was there was an air of mystery about her work. There was always something more. She didn't give you everything. She held back, and I like that. I probably -- she was my role model.\"\nDocumentary portrayals.\nGarbo is the subject of several documentaries, including four made in the United States between 1990 and 2005, and one made for the BBC in 1969:\nIn art and literature.\nGarbo has been memorialized in art and literature both during and after her life. Garbo was one of the subjects of French composer Charles Koechlin's \"Seven Stars Symphony\" (1933), which consisted of seven movements, each dedicated to a Hollywood star.\nAuthor Ernest Hemingway provided an imaginary portrayal of Garbo in his novel \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1940): \"Maybe it is like the dreams you have when someone you have seen in the cinema comes to your bed at night and is so kind and lovely\u00a0... He could remember Garbo still\u00a0... Maybe it was like those dreams the night before the attack on Pozoblanco, and [Garbo] was wearing a soft silky wool sweater when he put his arms around her, and when she leaned forward, and her hair swept forward and over his face, and she said why had he never told her that he loved her when she had loved him all this time? ... and it was as true as though it had happened\u00a0...\"\nGarbo was portrayed by Betty Comden in the film \"Garbo Talks\" (1984). The plot concerns a dying Garbo fan (Anne Bancroft) whose last wish is to meet her idol. Her son (played by Ron Silver) diligently searches for the elusive Garbo, determined to fulfill his mother's wish.\nA statue of Greta Garbo titled \"Statue of Integrity\" by J\u00f3n Leifsson sits isolated deep in the forest in H\u00e4rjedalen.\nThe Cole Porter song \"You're the Top\" makes a passing reference to the importance of her salary. Garbo is mentioned in The Kinks' 1972 song \"Celluloid Heroes\" and the 1977 song \"Right Before Your Eyes\" by Ian Thomas, which was covered by America in 1982. Greta Garbo is mentioned in the 1981 Kim Carnes hit song \"Bette Davis Eyes\" and she was the subject of the 1985 Freddie Mercury song, \"Living On My Own\". The 1988 song, \"Garbo\" by Austrian musician Falco serves as a tribute in the form of a love song. In the 1990 song \"Vogue\" by Madonna, Greta Garbo is the first mentioned of a list of stars from Hollywood's Golden Age. Greta Garbo is also the namesake of and mentioned in the song \"Garbo\" by Stevie Nicks. \nIn 2023, notable artist William Kentridge included a drawing of Garbo in his solo museum exhibition at The Broad in Los Angeles.\nPornographic film director Peter de Rome shot footage of Garbo walking across First Avenue that he inserted into his 1974 feature \"Adam &amp; Yves.\" Its presence was explained by having one of the characters recalling how he once saw the elusive star. The Garbo footage was used without the star's knowledge or permission, and she was not paid for her appearance.\nAwards and honors.\nGarbo was nominated four times for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1930, a performer could receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film. Garbo received her nomination for her work in both \"Anna Christie\" and for \"Romance\".\nShe lost out to Irving Thalberg's wife, Norma Shearer, who won for \"The Divorcee\". In 1937, Garbo was nominated for \"Camille\", but Luise Rainer won for \"The Good Earth\". Finally, in 1939, Garbo was nominated for \"Ninotchka\", but again came away empty-handed. \"Gone With the Wind\" swept the major awards, including Best Actress, which went to Vivien Leigh. In 1954, however, she was awarded an Academy Honorary Award \"for her luminous and unforgettable screen performances\". Predictably, Garbo did not show up at the ceremony, and the statuette was mailed to her home address.\nGarbo twice received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress: for \"Anna Karenina\" in 1935, and for \"Camille\" in 1936. She won the National Board of Review Best Acting Award for \"Camille\" in 1936; for \"Ninotchka\" in 1939; and for \"Two-Faced Woman\" in 1941. The Swedish royal medal Litteris et Artibus, which is awarded to people who have made important contributions to culture (especially music, dramatic art, or literature) was presented to Garbo in January 1937. In a 1950 \"Daily Variety\" opinion poll, Garbo was voted \"Best Actress of the Half Century\", In 1957, she was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.\nIn November 1983, she received the Commander, 1st Class, of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star from King Carl XVI Gustaf, the King of Sweden. In 1985, she was awarded the Illis quorum by the government of Sweden. In 1985, a star was nicknamed after her. For her contributions to cinema, in 1960, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn 1985, a star was nicknamed after her.\nGarbo appears on a number of postage stamps, and in September 2005, the United States Postal Service and Swedish Posten jointly issued two commemorative stamps bearing her image.\nOn 6 April 2011, Sveriges Riksbank announced that Garbo's portrait was to be featured on the 100-krona banknote, beginning in 2014\u20132015.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography and further reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63438", "revid": "12712128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63438", "title": "Jack Tramiel", "text": "American businessman and Holocaust survivor (1928\u20132012)\nJack Tramiel (, ; born Idek Trzmiel, ; December 13, 1928\u00a0\u2013 April 8, 2012) was a Polish-American businessman and Holocaust survivor, best known for founding Commodore International. The PET, VIC-20, and Commodore 64 are some home computers produced while he was running the company. Tramiel later formed Atari Corporation after he purchased the remnants of the original Atari, Inc. from its parent company. He was one of six people spotlighted when the computer was denoted \"Machine of the Year\" by \"Time\" magazine in 1982.\nEarly years.\nTramiel was born as \"Idek Trzmiel\", but some sources also list the names Juda Trzmiel, Jacek Trzmiel, or Idek Tramielski (the word \"https://\" in Polish means bumblebee) into a Jewish family, the son of Abram Josef Trzmiel and Rifka Bentkowska. The whole family lived on A. Napi\u00f3rkowskiego Street (today S. Przybyszewskiego Street) in G\u00f3rniak district in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in 1939, his family was transported by Nazi occupiers to the Jewish ghetto in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where he worked in a garment factory. When the ghettos were liquidated, his family was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He was examined by Josef Mengele and selected for a work party, after which he and his father were sent to the labor camp Ahlem near Hanover, while his mother remained at Auschwitz. Like many other inmates, his father was reported to have died of typhus in the work camp; however, Tramiel believed he was killed by an injection of gasoline. Tramiel was rescued from the labor camp in April 1945 by the 84th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.\nOn November 10, 1947, Tramiel immigrated to the United States. He soon joined the U.S. Army, where he learned how to repair office equipment, including typewriters.\nCommodore.\nTypewriters and calculators.\nIn 1953, while working as a taxi driver, Tramiel bought a shop in the Bronx to repair office machinery, securing a $25,000 loan for the business from a U.S. Army entitlement. He named it Commodore Portable Typewriter. Tramiel wanted a military-style name for his company, but names such as Admiral and General were already taken, so he settled on the Commodore name.\nIn 1956, Tramiel signed a deal with Czechoslovak typewriter manufacturer Zbrojovka Brno NP to assemble and sell their typewriters in North America. However, as Czechoslovakia was part of the Warsaw Pact, they could not be imported directly into the U.S., so Tramiel used parts from Zbrojovka's Consul typewriters and set up Commodore Business Machines in Toronto, Canada. After Zbrojovka began developing their own hardware Commodore signed an agreement in 1962 with Rheinmetall-Borsig AG and began to sell Commodore portable typewriters made from the parts of older Rheinmetall-Borsig typewriters. In 1962, Commodore went public, but the arrival of Japanese typewriters in the U.S. market made the selling of Czechoslovak typewriters unprofitable. Struggling for cash, the company sold 17% of its stock to Canadian businessman Irving Gould, taking in $400,000 and using the money to re-launch the company in the adding machine business, which was profitable for a time before the Japanese entered that field as well. Stung twice by the same source, Gould suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to learn why they were able to outcompete North Americans in their own local markets. It was during this trip that Tramiel saw the first digital calculators, and decided that the mechanical adding machine was a dead end.\nWhen Commodore released its first calculators, combining an LED display from Bowmar and an integrated circuit from Texas Instruments (TI), it found a ready market. However, after slowly realizing the size of the market, TI decided to cut Commodore out of the middle, and released their own calculators at a price point below Commodore's cost of just the chips. Gould once again rescued the company, injecting another $3\u00a0million, which allowed Commodore to purchase MOS Technology, Inc. an IC design and semiconductor manufacturer, a company which had also supplied Commodore with calculator ICs. When their lead designer, Chuck Peddle, told Tramiel that calculators were a dead end and computers were the future, Tramiel told him to build one to prove the point.\nHome computers.\nPeddle responded with the Commodore PET, based on his company's MOS Technology 6502 processor. It was first shown, privately, at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, and soon the company was receiving 50 calls a day from dealers wanting to sell the computer. The PET became a success\u2014especially in the education field, where its all-in-one design was a major advantage. Much of their success with the PET came from the business decision to sell directly to large customers, instead of selling to them through a dealer network. The first PET computers were sold primarily in Europe, where Commodore had also introduced the first wave of digital handheld calculators.\nAs prices dropped and the market matured, the PET's monochrome monitor (green text on black screen) was at a disadvantage in the market when compared to machines like the Apple II and Atari 8-bit computers, which offered color graphics and could be hooked to a television as an inexpensive display. Commodore responded with the VIC-20, and then the Commodore 64, which became the best-selling home computer of all time. The VIC-20 was the first computer to sell one million units. The Commodore 64 sold several million units. It was during this time that Tramiel coined the phrase, \"We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.\" An industry executive attributed to Tramiel the discontinuation of the TI-99/4A home computer in 1983, after the company had lost hundreds of millions of dollars, stating that \"TI got suckered by Jack\". By 1983 Commodore had $1 billion in annual revenue.\nDeparture.\nGould had controlled the company since 1966. He and Tramiel often argued, but Gould usually let Tramiel run Commodore by himself. Tramiel was considered by many to be a micromanager who did not believe in budgets, viewing them as a \"license to steal\"; he insisted on approving and personally signing every expense greater than $1,000, which meant that operations stopped when Tramiel went on his frequent business trips and vacations. His management style made it difficult for Commodore to hire and keep executives, but was effective. Adam Osborne wrote in 1981:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The microcomputer industry abounds with horror stories describing the way Commodore treats its dealers and its customers. However, Jack Tramiel has built a large and profitable organization by offering a capable product. Tramiel definitely plays hardball, but he deserves credit for what he has been able to accomplish.\nTramiel angrily left a January 13, 1984 meeting of Commodore's board of directors led by chairman Gould, and never returned to the company. What happened at the board meeting remains unclear, but the departure surprised the industry because of Commodore's great success against competitors. The press reported the poor relationship between Tramiel and Gould as the cause. Neil Harris, editor of \"Commodore Magazine\", recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well, came that fateful Consumer Electronics Show in January of '84 \u2013 a very strange press conference. Jack Tramiel got on stage in front of a whole ballroom full of press people to make the announcement that in the calendar year of 1983, Commodore had sold more than a billion dollars worth of products. Just phenomenal. In three years the company had grown from under $100\u00a0million to over a billion dollar corporation. Just unbelievable growth. A success story. But Jack was on stage and he didn't look like a happy man, and Jack was not someone to hide his emotions generally \u2013 it just seemed strange for some of us in the back of the room. Three days after the show, Jack announced that he was resigning from the company. Apparently there had been some falling out between him and the chairman of the board, Irving Gould, and from that day on the company was not the same place.\nTramiel said that he had resigned from Commodore because he disagreed with Gould \"on the basic principles, how to run the company. And I felt that if I could not go into my office smiling, and being happy, I'd better quit\". Their disagreement was so bitter that, after his departure, \"Commodore Magazine\" was forbidden to quote Tramiel or mention his name. \"Ahoy!\" wrote that although Tramiel's \"obsession with controlling the cost of every phase of the manufacturing process\" had led to record profits during the home computer price war, his \"inflexible one-man rule\" had resulted in poor dealer relations and \"a steady turnover of top executives at Commodore\". The magazine concluded \"it has become increasingly clear that the company is just too big for one man, however talented, to run\".\nDuring a question and answer session at CommVEx v11 (July 18, 2015), Jack's son, Leonard Tramiel, stated that now that both Irving Gould and his dad Jack were both deceased, he could finally reveal to the crowd what really transpired between Jack and Irving Gould that resulted in Tramiel leaving Commodore: On January 13, 1984 during a meeting with Irving, Jack told Irving that treating the assets of the company as his own and using them for personal use was wrong. He said to Irving, \"you can't do that while I'm still president\" to which Irving responded by saying \"Goodbye\". Three days after the show, Jack announced to the public that he was resigning from the company.\nWhilst acknowledging this description of events, David Pleasance (the eventual managing director of Commodore UK) also states that Gould told him the falling out was due to Tramiel's insistence on his three sons joining the board.\nIn a 1986 interview with Dr. Achim Becker for the German newspaper DATA WELT, when asked the question \"Why did you leave Commodore? Is there a simple answer to this question?\" Jack Tramiel said:If you ask the people who have worked with me, they will tell you that I have changed virtually nothing in the last 25 years. I've always been one of them. Just because we were a billion-dollar company, we didn't have to throw money out the window like a billion-dollar company. Because, if you spend more, you have to raise prices. The man I worked for disagreed. When business was better, he wanted to spend more. That's one of the points where we disagreed. We also disagreed on the issue of financing. I felt that the moment our stock was trading high, we should have issued new stock; especially since we had never had an increase since we went public in 1962. With the $120 million we would have earned from 2 million new shares, we could have paid all our debts to the banks and strengthened the company's position. It would have allowed us to weather any storm without relying on the banks. The man I worked for thought this would dilute his share in the company and lose influence in the process - that was absolutely wrong. Those were the main reasons. In short, our philosophies were different. It got to the point where I said to him: Either I can run the company the way I think it should be run or I have to leave. I was told very kindly: If you don't want to do it the way I do, then leave. And I left.\nIn an interview with \"Fortune\" magazine on April 13, 1998, Tramiel said \"Business is war, I don't believe in compromising, I believe in winning.\".\nAtari.\nAfter a short break from the computer industry, he formed a new company named Tramel Technology, Ltd., in order to design and sell a next-generation home computer. The company was named \"Tramel\" to help ensure that it would be pronounced correctly (i.e., \"tra \u2013 mel\" instead of \"tra \u2013 meal\").\nIn July 1984, Tramel Technology bought the Consumer Division of Atari Inc. from Warner Communications. The division had fallen on hard times due to the video game crash of 1983. TTL was then renamed Atari Corporation, and went on to produce the 16-bit Atari ST computer line based on Motorola's 68000 CPU, directly competing with Apple's Macintosh and Commodore's Amiga, which also used the same CPU. Under Tramiel's direction, the Atari ST was a considerable success in Europe, and globally in the professional music market.\nDespite successfully shipping the ST, Tramiel's poor personal reputation hurt Atari. One retailer said in 1985 about the ST that because of its prior experience with Tramiel \"Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch\". A software company executive said \"Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun. I don't know if Tramiel will be following his old habits ... I don't see a lot of people rushing to get software on the machine.\" (One ex-Commodore employee said that to Tramiel \"software wasn't tangible\u2014you couldn't hold it, feel it, or touch it\u2014so it wasn't worth spending money for\".) Steve Arnold of LucasArts said after meeting with Tramiel that he reminded him of Jabba the Hutt, while within Atari Darth Vader was often the comparison. Another executive was more positive, stating \"Jack Tramiel is a winner. I wouldn't bet against him.\" In 1988 Stewart Alsop II called Tramiel and Alan Sugar \"the world's two leading business-as-war entrepreneurs\".\nIn the late 1980s, Tramiel decided to step away from day-to-day operations at Atari, naming his son, Sam, President and CEO. In 1995, Sam suffered a heart attack, and his father returned to oversee operations. In 1996, Tramiel sold Atari to disk-drive manufacturer Jugi Tandon Storage in a reverse merger deal. The newly merged company was named JTS Corporation, and Tramiel joined the JTS board.\nLater years.\nMichael Tomczyk recalled that when Tramiel asked the German government for financial incentives for Commodore to take over a factory,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Germans said, \"Why should we give you concessions?\" to which Jack replied, \"You owe it to me \u2013 I\u2019m an Auschwitz survivor\" \u2013 then he added \u2013 \u201cBesides, it will be great PR for you.\" They accepted his logic and gave us the plant which was in Braunschweig, West Germany.&lt;br&gt;\nI asked Jack if he held resentment toward the Germans to which he replied, \"The German people didn\u2019t kill the Jews. The rules killed the Jews. Germans always follow the rules and if the rules are made by madmen, they still follow the rules.\" Another time I asked him how he dealt with the memories of Auschwitz and he immediately replied, \"I live in the future.\"\nTramiel was a co-founder of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which was opened in 1993. He was among many other survivors of the Ahlem labor camp who tracked down U.S. Army veteran Vernon Tott, who was among the 84th Division which rescued survivors from the camp and had taken and stored photographs of at least 16 of the survivors. Tott, who died of cancer in 2005, was personally commemorated by Tramiel with an inscription on one of the Holocaust Museum's walls saying \"To Vernon W. Tott, My Liberator and Hero\".\nTramiel retired in 1996 and moved to Monte Sereno, California. In 2004, for the last time, he visited his Polish hometown, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nTramiel died of heart failure in Stanford, California on April 8, 2012, aged 83.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He went to Paris in 1765 to be with his uncle Bernard and to study medicine, graduating with a doctorate in 1770, with a thesis on animal and vegetable physiology. His uncle introduced him to the Jardin du Roi, where he was appointed as a botany Demonstrator and deputy to L. G. Le Monnier, professor of botany there in 1770. Le Monnier had succeeded Antoine-Laurent's uncle Antoine in 1759. Lectures by eminent botanists, including the Jusssieu dynasty were popular there, especially among pharmacists. His lecture on the classification of Ranunculaceae in 1773 to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences led to his election as a member that year. In 1784 he was appointed to a Royal Commission by Louis XVI, as one of five commissionaires to investigate animal magnetism, publishing a dissenting opinion from the majority, suggesting further investigation was required.\nThe publication of Jussieu's \"Genera plantarum\" in 1789 was rapidly followed by the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789\u20131799). Jussieu adhered to the revolutionary principles and was appointed to a position in the municipal government of Paris, where he had the task of managing all the hospitals. With the overthrow of the monarchy, the Jardin du Roi was renamed the Jardin des plantes, and Jussieu was instrumental in reorganizing the Jardin as the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in 1790, where he became a professor of botany, holding the chair in Botanique \u00e0 la campagne. He was also Director of the museum from 1794 to 1795, and again from 1798 to 1800. Jussieu immediately set about setting up a herbarium, a task greatly facilitated by the seizure of foreign collections by the revolutionary armies, and by the confiscation of the assets of the church and aristocracy. In 1808, Napoleon appointed him to the position of counsellor of the university.\nHe remained at the museum until 1826, when he was succeeded by his son Adrien-Henri. At the museum he published many papers in the museum's annals (\"Annales du Museum d\u2019histoire naturelle\" 1802\u20131813) and its succeeding \"M\u00e9moires du Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle\" (1815\u2013), as well as contributing articles to Frederic Cuvier's (1816\u20131830). He was also a member of the Masonic Lodge, Les Neuf S\u0153urs.\nWork.\nJussieu's system of plant classification, based on the relative value of their characteristics, served as the basis for natural systems of taxonomy. His system was first published in a paper on Ranunculaceae in 1773. The following year he developed the concept further in a paper on the arrangement of plants in the Jardin de Roi, based on the work of his uncle Bernard at the Trianon garden in Versaille. The work dealt primarily with suprafamilial ranks of classification. The following five years were devoted to applying his ideas to the entire plant kingdom, culminating in his epochal work, the \"Genera plantarum\" (1789). In preparing this work he had access to a large number of herbaria and botanical gardens. Although at first British and German botanists, firm adherents of the Linnaean system, were wary of what they considered radical ideas emanating from the French revolution, the work soon gained wide acceptance in scientific circles, and was actively promoted by eminent botanists including Robert Brown and A. P. de Candolle. \nIn the \"Genera plantarum\" (1789), Jussieu adopted a methodology based on the use of multiple characters to define groups, an idea derived from naturalist Michel Adanson. This was a significant improvement over the \"artificial\" system of Linnaeus, whose most popular work classified plants into classes and orders based on the number of stamens and pistils, though Jussieu did keep Linnaeus' binomial nomenclature. He extended his uncle's ideas about the value of the characteristics of plants. These characteristics were considered to be of unequal value, with some subordinate to others in a hierarchical system. As Jusssieu put it, plant characteristics should be \"pes\u00e9s et non compt\u00e9s\" (weighed, not counted), in assigning each to a definite group. The names he gave to his uncle's three major groupings were Acotyledon, Monocotyledon, and Dicotyledon. These were then divided into fifteen classes and one hundred families. The most important features of the \"Genera plantarum\" are the division into groups and the description and circumscription of the 100 families (\"ordines naturales\"). With the resumption of his scientific work at the museum, Jussieu's publications (some 60 memoirs) largely dealt with further elaborating the principles of the \"Genera plantarum\" and more detailed circumscription and description of the families he had named, work that was very much influenced by Joseph G\u00e4rtner. Although he worked on a second edition of \"Genera plantarum\", all that was published was his \"Introductio\", posthumously in 1837.\nList of selected publications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources: ; ; \nAwards and memberships.\nMember of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (1773), elected foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1788).\nLegacy.\nJussieu's \"natural\" system of classification soon replaced the artificial sexual one of Linnaeus. The system of suprageneric nomenclature in botany is officially dated to 4 Aug 1789 with the publication of the \"Genera Plantarum\" (Gen. Pl.). The \"Genera plantarum\" was far-reaching in its impact; many of the present-day plant families are still attributed to Jussieu. Morton's 1981 \"History of botanical science\" counts 76 of Jussieu's families conserved in the ICBN, versus just 11 for Linnaeus, for instance. Writing of the natural system, Sydney Howard Vines remarked: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The glory of this crowning achievement belongs to Jussieu: he was the capable man who appeared precisely at the psychological moment, and it is the men that so appear who have made, and will continue to make, all the great generalisations of science.\"\nDe Jussieu and his family have been commemorated by a number of images, including a bust and medallion by David d'Angers (Pierre-Jean David), upon his death. A statue of Jussieu, commissioned for 10,000\u00a0Fr by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Legendre-H\u00e9ral in 1842, stands in the Galerie de Botanique of the Jardin des Plantes. Another, by Jean-Baptiste Gustave Deloye is on the balustrade of the Natural History Museum, Vienna (facing Maria-Theresien-Platz). The Jussieu botanical dynasty is commemorated in the neighbourhood of the Jardin des Plantes by the Place Jussieu, (Quartier Saint-Victor, 5th arrondissement) Rue Jussieu, the Jussieu metro station and the Jussieu science campus of the University of Paris. The Jussieu family are also commemorated by street names in Marseille and Lyon, their family home. The Jussieu Peninsula in South Australia is also named after Antoine Laurent Jussieu, as is an asteroid.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation Juss. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63444", "revid": "48885933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63444", "title": "Helen of Troy", "text": "Most beautiful woman in Greek mythology\nHelen (), also known as Helen of Troy, or Helen of Sparta, and in Latin as Helena, was a figure in Greek mythology said to have been the most beautiful woman in the world. She was believed to have been the daughter of Zeus by Leda or Nemesis, and the sister of Clytemnestra, Castor, Pollux, Philonoe, Phoebe and Timandra. She was first married to King Menelaus of Sparta \"who became by her the father of Hermione, and, according to others, of Nicostratus also.\" Her subsequent marriage to Paris of Troy was the most immediate cause of the Trojan War.\nElements of her putative biography come from ancient Greek and Roman authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, Virgil and Ovid. In her youth, she was abducted by Theseus. A competition between her suitors for her hand in marriage saw Menelaus emerge victorious. All of her suitors were required to swear an oath (known as the \"Oath of Tyndareus\") promising to provide military assistance to the winning suitor, if Helen were ever stolen from him. The obligations of the oath precipitated the Trojan War. When she married Menelaus she was still very young. In most accounts, including Homer's, Helen ultimately fell in love with Paris and willingly went to Troy with him, though there are also stories in which she was abducted. \nThe legends of Helen during her time in Troy are contradictory. Homer depicts her ambivalently, both regretful of her choice and sly in her attempts to redeem her public image. Other accounts have a treacherous Helen who simulated Bacchic rites and rejoiced in the carnage she caused. In some versions, Helen does not arrive in Troy, but instead waits out the war in Egypt. Ultimately, Paris was killed in action, and in Homer's account, Helen was reunited with Menelaus, though other versions of the legend recount her ascending to Olympus instead. A cult associated with her developed in Hellenistic Laconia, both at Sparta and elsewhere; at Therapne she shared a shrine with Menelaus. She was also worshipped in Attica and on Rhodes.\nStories of her beauty have inspired artists and writers to represent her as the personification of ideal human beauty. Images of Helen started appearing in the 7th\u00a0century\u00a0BC. In Classical Greece, her elopement\u2014or abduction\u2014was a popular motif. In medieval illustrations, this event was frequently portrayed as a seduction, whereas in Renaissance paintings it was usually depicted as a \"rape\" (i.\u00a0e., a \"forced abduction\") by Paris. Christopher Marlowe's lines from his tragedy \"Doctor Faustus\" (1604) are frequently cited: \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\"\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of Helen's name continues to be a problem for scholars. In the 19th century, Georg Curtius related \"Helen\" () to the moon (Selene; ). But two early dedications to Helen in the Laconian dialect of ancient Greek spell her name with an initial digamma (\u03dc, probably pronounced like a w), which rules out any etymology originally starting with simple \"*s-\".\nIn the early 20th century, \u00c9mile Boisacq considered \u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 to derive from the well-known noun meaning \"torch\". It has also been suggested that the \u03bb of arose from an original \u03bd, and thus the etymology of the name would be connected with the root of \"Venus\". Linda Lee Clader, however, says that none of the above suggestions offers much satisfaction.\nMore recently, Otto Skutsch has advanced the theory that the name Helen might have two separate etymologies, which belong to different mythological figures respectively, namely \"*S\u1e77elen\u0101\" (related to Sanskrit \"svara\u1e47\u0101\" \"the shining one\") and \"*Selen\u0101\", the first a Spartan goddess, connected to one or the other natural light phenomenon (especially St. Elmo's fire) and sister of the Dioscuri, the other a vegetation goddess worshiped in Therapne as \u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u0394\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 (\"Helena of the Trees\").\nOthers have connected the name's etymology to a hypothetical Proto-Indo-European sun goddess, noting the name's connection to the word for \"sun\" in various Indo-European cultures including the Greek proper word and god for the sun, Helios. In particular, her marriage myth may be connected to a broader Indo-European \"marriage drama\" of the sun goddess, and she is related to the divine twins, just as many of these goddesses are. Martin L. West has thus proposed that \"Helena\" (\"mistress of sunlight\") may be constructed on the PIE suffix \"-n\u0101\" (\"mistress of\"), connoting a deity controlling a natural element.\nPrehistoric and mythological context.\nHelen first appears in the poems of Homer, after which she became a popular figure in Greek literature. These works are set in the final years of the Age of Heroes, a mythological era which features prominently in the Greek mythological canon. Because the Homeric poems are known to have been transmitted orally before being written down, some scholars speculate that such stories were passed down from earlier Mycenaean Greek tradition, and that the Age of Heroes may itself reflect a mythologized memory of that era.\nRecent archaeological excavations in Greece suggest that modern-day Laconia was a distinct territory in the Late Bronze Age, while the poets narrated that it was a rich kingdom. Archaeologists have unsuccessfully looked for a Mycenaean palatial complex buried beneath present-day Sparta. Modern findings suggest the area around Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia.\nFamily.\nHelen and Menelaus had a daughter, Hermione. Hesiod says she was \"a child unlooked for,\" and Homer writes she was Helen's first and only child. Different sources say she was also the mother of one or more sons, named Aethiolas, Nicostratus, Megapenthes and Pleisthenes. Still, according to others, these were instead illegitimate children of Menelaus and various lovers.\nAccording to other sources that also contradict Homer, Helen and Paris had four sons \u2014 Corythus, Bunomus, Aganus, Idaeus \u2014 and a daughter whom Helen named after herself after winning the game contest against Paris. Dictys Cretensis claims that Corythus, Bunomus and Idaeus died during the Trojan War when an earthquake caused the roof of the room where they slept to collapse. Helen's daughter by Paris was reportedly killed by her own grandmother, Hecuba, during the fall of Troy.\nMythology.\nBirth.\nIn most sources, including the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", Helen is the daughter of Zeus and of Leda, the wife of the Spartan king Tyndareus. Euripides' play \"Helen\", written in the late 5th century BC, is the earliest source to report the most familiar account of Helen's birth: that, although her putative father was Tyndareus, she was actually Zeus' daughter. In the form of a swan, the king of gods was chased by an eagle, and sought refuge with Leda. The swan gained her affection, and the two mated. Leda then produced an egg, from which Helen emerged. The First Vatican Mythographer introduces the notion that two eggs came from the union: one containing Castor and Pollux; one with Helen and Clytemnestra. Nevertheless, the same author earlier states that Helen, Castor and Pollux were produced from a single egg. Fabius Planciades Fulgentius also states that Helen, Castor and Pollux are born from the same egg. Pseudo-Apollodorus states that Leda had intercourse with both Zeus and Tyndareus the night she conceived Helen.\nOn the other hand, in the \"Cypria\", part of the Epic Cycle, Helen was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. The date of the \"Cypria\" is uncertain, but it is generally thought to preserve traditions that date back to at least the 7th century\u00a0BC. In the \"Cypria\", Nemesis did not wish to mate with Zeus. She therefore changed shape into various animals as she attempted to flee Zeus, finally becoming a goose. Zeus also transformed himself into a goose and raped Nemesis, who produced an egg from which Helen was born. Presumably, in the \"Cypria\", this egg was somehow transferred to Leda. Later sources state either that it was brought to Leda by a shepherd who discovered it in a grove in Attica, or that it was dropped into her lap by Hermes.\nAsclepiades of Tragilos and Pseudo-Eratosthenes related a similar story, except that Zeus and Nemesis became swans instead of geese. Timothy Gantz has suggested that the tradition that Zeus came to Leda in the form of a swan derives from the version in which Zeus and Nemesis transformed into birds.\nPausanias states that in the middle of the 2nd century\u00a0AD, the remains of an egg-shell, tied up in ribbons, were still suspended from the roof of a temple on the Spartan acropolis. People believed that this was \"the famous egg that legend says Leda brought forth\". Pausanias traveled to Sparta to visit the sanctuary, dedicated to Hilaeira and Phoebe, in order to see the relic for himself.\nPausanias also says that there was a local tradition that Helen's brothers, \"the Dioscuri\" (i.e. Castor and Pollux), were born on the island of Pefnos, adding that the Spartan poet Alcman also said this, while the poet Lycophron's use of the adjective \"Pephnaian\" (\"\u03a0\u03b5\u03c6\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\") in association with Helen, suggests that Lycophron may have known a tradition which held that Helen was also born on the island.\nYouthful abduction by Theseus.\nTwo Athenians, Theseus and Pirithous, thought that since they were sons of gods, they should have divine wives; they thus pledged to help each other abduct two daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen, and Pirithous vowed to marry Persephone, the wife of Hades. Theseus took Helen and left her with his mother Aethra or his associate Aphidnus at Aphidnae or Athens. Theseus and Pirithous then traveled to the underworld, the domain of Hades, to kidnap Persephone. Hades pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast, but, as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Helen's abduction caused an invasion of Athens by Castor and Pollux, who captured Aethra in revenge, and returned their sister to Sparta. In Goethe's \"Faust\", Centaur Chiron is said to have aided the Dioscuri brothers in returning Helen home.\nIn most accounts of this event, Helen was quite young; Hellanicus of Lesbos said she was seven years old and Diodorus makes her ten years old. On the other hand, Stesichorus said that Iphigenia was the daughter of Theseus and Helen, which implies that Helen was of childbearing age. In most sources, Iphigenia is the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, but Duris of Samos and other writers, such as Antoninus Liberalis, followed Stesichorus' account.\nOvid's \"Heroides\" give us an idea of how ancient and, in particular, Roman authors imagined Helen in her youth: she is presented as a young princess wrestling naked in the palaestra, alluding to a part of girls' physical education in classical (not Mycenaean) Sparta. Sextus Propertius imagines Helen as a girl who practices arms and hunts with her brothers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] or like Helen, on the sands of Eurotas, between Castor and Pollux, one to be victor in boxing, the other with horses: with naked breasts she carried weapons, they say, and did not blush with her divine brothers there.\nSuitors.\nWhen it was time for Helen to marry, many kings and princes from around the world came to seek her hand, bringing rich gifts with them or sent emissaries to do so on their behalf. During the contest, Castor and Pollux had a prominent role in dealing with the suitors, although the final decision was in the hands of Tyndareus. Menelaus, her future husband, did not attend but sent his brother, Agamemnon, to represent him. He was chosen as he had the most wealth.\nOath of Tyndareus.\nTyndareus was afraid to select a husband for his daughter, or send any of the suitors away, for fear of offending them and giving grounds for a quarrel. Odysseus was one of the suitors, but had brought no gifts because he believed he had little chance to win the contest. He thus promised to solve the problem, if Tyndareus in turn would support him in his courting of Penelope, the daughter of Icarius. Tyndareus readily agreed, and Odysseus proposed that, before the decision was made, all the suitors should swear a most solemn oath to defend the chosen husband against whoever should quarrel with him. After the suitors had sworn not to retaliate, Menelaus was chosen to be Helen's husband because he was the \"greatest in possessions\" and had offered the most gifts. As a sign of the importance of the pact, Tyndareus sacrificed a horse. Helen and Menelaus became rulers of Sparta, after Tyndareus and Leda abdicated. Menelaus and Helen rule in Sparta for at least ten years; they have a daughter, Hermione, and (according to some myths) three sons: Aethiolas, Maraphius, and Pleisthenes.\nThe marriage of Helen and Menelaus marks the beginning of the end of the age of heroes. Concluding the catalog of Helen's suitors, Hesiod reports Zeus' plan to obliterate the race of men and the heroes in particular. The Trojan War, caused by Helen's elopement with Paris, is going to be his means to this end.\nSeduction or kidnapping by Paris.\nParis, a Trojan prince, came to Sparta to claim Helen, in the guise of a supposed diplomatic mission. Before this journey, Paris had been appointed by Zeus to judge the most beautiful goddess; Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite. In order to earn his favour, Aphrodite promised Paris the most beautiful woman in the world. Swayed by Aphrodite's offer, Paris chose her as the most beautiful of the goddesses, earning the wrath of Athena and Hera.\nAlthough Helen is sometimes depicted as being forcibly abducted by Paris, most Ancient Greek sources, following Homer, believed that Helen fell in love with the Trojan prince, and went to Troy willingly. In Homer, Helen herself says she followed Paris, or that she was led to Troy by Aphrodite. Herodotus, who says Paris \"carried off\" (\"\u1f01\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\") Helen, states Paris \"got her to fly\" with him. The \"Cypria\" simply mentions that after giving Helen gifts, \"Aphrodite brings the Spartan queen together with the Prince of Troy.\" Apollodorus says Paris persuaded Helen to leave with him, and Sappho argues that Helen willingly left behind Menelaus and their daughter, Hermione, to be with Paris:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nSome say a host of horsemen, others of infantry and others\n of ships, is the most beautiful thing on the dark earth\n but I say, it is what you love\nFull easy it is to make this understood of one and all: for\n she that far surpassed all mortals in beauty, Helen her\n most noble husband\nDeserted, and went sailing to Troy, with never a thought for\n her daughter and dear parents.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nDio Chrysostom gives a completely different account of the story, questioning Homer's credibility: after Agamemnon had married Helen's sister, Clytemnestra, Tyndareus sought Helen's hand for Menelaus for political reasons. However, Helen was sought by many suitors, who came from far and near, among them Paris who surpassed all the others and won the favor of Tyndareus and his sons. Thus he won her fairly and took her away to Troia, with the full consent of her natural protectors. \"Cypria\" narrate that in just three days Paris and Helen reached Troy. Homer narrates that during a brief stop-over in the small island of Kranai, according to \"Iliad\", the two lovers consummated their passion. On the other hand, \"Cypria\" note that this happened the night before they left Sparta.\nIn her book \"Helen of Troy: Myth, Beauty, Devastation\", Ruby Blondell posits, \"Though [Helen's] departure is typically referred to as an 'abduction', none of our sources claims that Paris took Helen by force against her will. Her complicity is essential to her story\".\nIn Egypt.\nAt least three Ancient Greek authors denied that Helen ever went to Troy; instead, they suggested, Helen stayed in Egypt during the Trojan War. Those three authors are Euripides, Stesichorus, and Herodotus. In the version put forth by Euripides in his play \"Helen\", Hera fashioned a likeness (\"eidolon\", \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd) of Helen out of clouds at Zeus' request, Hermes took her to Egypt, and Helen never went to Troy, but instead spent the entire war in Egypt. An \"eidolon\" is also present in Stesichorus' account, but not in Herodotus' rationalizing version of the myth. In addition to these accounts, Lycophron (822) states that Hesiod was the first to mention Helen's \"eidolon\". This may mean Hesiod stated this in a literary work, or that the idea was widely known/circulated in early archaic Greece during the time of Hesiod and was consequently attributed to him.\nHerodotus adds weight to the \"Egyptian\" version of events by putting forward his own evidence\u2014he traveled to Egypt and interviewed the priests of the temple (\"Foreign Aphrodite\", \u03be\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7) at Memphis. According to these priests, Helen had arrived in Egypt shortly after leaving Sparta, because strong winds had blown Paris's ship off course. King Proteus of Egypt, appalled that Paris had seduced his host's wife and plundered his host's home in Sparta, disallowed Paris from taking Helen to Troy. Paris returned to Troy without a new bride, but the Greeks refused to believe that Helen was in Egypt and not within Troy's walls. Thus, Helen waited in Memphis for ten years, while the Greeks and the Trojans fought. Following the conclusion of the Trojan War, Menelaus sailed to Memphis, where Proteus reunited him with Helen.\nIn Troy.\nWhen he discovered that his wife was missing, Menelaus called upon all the other suitors to fulfill their oaths, thus beginning the Trojan War.\nThe Greek fleet gathered in Aulis, but the ships could not sail for lack of wind. Artemis was enraged by a sacrilege, and only the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter, Iphigenia, could appease her. In Euripides \"Iphigenia in Aulis\", Clytemnestra, Iphigenia's mother and Helen's sister, begs her husband to reconsider his decision, calling Helen a \"wicked woman\". Clytemnestra tries to warn Agamemnon that sacrificing Iphigenia for Helen's sake is, \"buying what we most detest with what we hold most dear\". However, Agamemnon went through with the act; the winds turned, and the fleet set sail for Troy.\nBefore the opening of hostilities, the Greeks dispatched a delegation to the Trojans under Odysseus and Menelaus; they endeavored without success to persuade Priam to hand Helen back. A popular theme, \"The Request of Helen\" (Helenes Apaitesis, \u1f19\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), was the subject of a drama by Sophocles, now lost.\nHomer paints a poignant, lonely picture of Helen in Troy. She is filled with self-loathing and regret for what she has caused; by the end of the war, the Trojans have come to hate her. When Hector dies, she is the third mourner at his funeral, and she says that, of all the Trojans, Hector and Priam alone were always kind to her:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWherefore I wail alike for thee and for my hapless self with grief at heart;\nfor no longer have I anyone beside in broad Troy that is gentle to me or kind;\nbut all men shudder at me.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThese bitter words reveal that Helen gradually realized Paris' weaknesses, and decided to ally herself with Hector. There is an affectionate relationship between the two, and Helen has harsh words for Paris when she compares the two brothers:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter Paris was killed in combat, there was some dispute among the Trojans about which of Priam's surviving sons she should remarry: Helenus or Deiphobus, but she was given to the latter.\nDuring the Fall of Troy.\nDuring the fall of Troy, Helen's role is ambiguous. In Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Deiphobus gives an account of Helen's treacherous stance: when the Trojan Horse was admitted into the city, she feigned Bacchic rites, leading a chorus of Trojan women, and, holding a torch among them, she signaled to the Greeks from the city's central tower. In the \"Odyssey\", however, Homer narrates a different story: Helen circled the Horse three times, and she imitated the voices of the Greek women left behind at home\u2014she thus tortured the men inside (including Odysseus and Menelaus) with the memory of their loved ones, and brought them to the brink of destruction.\nAfter the deaths of Hector and Paris, Helen became the paramour of their younger brother, Deiphobus; but when the sack of Troy began, she hid her new husband's sword, and left him to the mercy of Menelaus and Odysseus. In \"Aeneid\", Aeneas meets the mutilated Deiphobus in Hades; his wounds serve as a testimony to his ignominious end, abetted by Helen's final act of treachery. Stesichorus wrote that both the Greeks and Trojans gathered to stone her to death. \nWhen Menelaus finally found her, he raised his sword to kill her. He had demanded that only he should slay his unfaithful wife; but, when he was ready to do so, she dropped her robe from her shoulders, and the sight of her beauty caused him to let the sword drop from his hand. Electra wails:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alas for my troubles! Can it be that her beauty has blunted their swords?\nFate.\nHelen returned to Sparta and lived with Menelaus, where she was encountered by Telemachus in Book 4 of \"The Odyssey\". She and Menelaus were seemingly reconciled and had a harmonious married life\u2014he holding no grudge at her having run away with a lover and she feeling no restraint in telling anecdotes of her life at Troy.\nAccording to another version, used by Euripides in his play \"Orestes\", Helen had been saved by Apollo from Orestes and was taken up to Mount Olympus almost immediately after Menelaus' return. She was then made a sea goddess who watches over sailors alongside her brothers, Castor and Pollux. A curious fate is recounted by Pausanias (3.19.11\u201313), which has Helen share the afterlife with Achilles.\nPausanias recorded a different version of Helen's ultimate fate. According to him, when Menelaus died, his sons kicked Helen out of the palace, so she went to Rhodes, where an old friend of hers, Polyxo the wife of Tlepolemus, ruled. Tlepolemus had perished during the Trojan War leaving Polyxo a widow with a young child, so unbeknownst to Helen, Polyxo deeply resented her now. She pretended to receive Helen warmly, but when the queen of Sparta relaxed in a bath, she sent handmaidens dressed up as Furies to seize Helen and hang her from a tree. Thereafter the Rhodians worshipped her as Helen of the Tree (\"Helene Dendritis\"). There are other traditions concerning the punishment of Helen. For example, she is offered as a sacrifice to the gods in Tauris by Iphigeneia, or Thetis, enraged when Achilles dies because of Helen, kills her on her return journey.\nTlepolemus was a son of Heracles and Astyoche. Astyoche was a daughter of Phylas, King of Ephyra who was killed by Heracles. Tlepolemus was killed by Sarpedon on the first day of fighting in the \"Iliad\". Nicostratus was a son of Menelaus by his concubine Pieris, an Aetolian slave. Megapenthes was a son of Menelaus by his concubine Tereis, with no further origin.\nIn Euripides's tragedy \"The Trojan Women\", Helen is shunned by the women who survived the war and is to be taken back to Greece to face a death sentence. This version is contradicted by two of Euripides' other tragedies, \"Electra\", which predates The Trojan Women, and \"Helen\", as Helen is described as being in Egypt during the events of the Trojan War in each.\nArtistic representations.\nFrom Antiquity, depicting Helen would be a remarkable challenge. The story of Zeuxis deals with this exact question: how would an artist immortalize ideal beauty? He eventually selected the best features from five virgins. The ancient world starts to paint Helen's picture or inscribe her form on stone, clay and bronze by the 7th century BC. Homer attributes her with white skin, while Sappho describes her as \"xanthe\", which is translated as \"golden\" and is used towards individuals with light hair, which includes blond, red and brown hair, and Euripides says she had \"gold [\"xanthes\"] curls\". Her eyes were described as \"\u03ba\u03c5\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2\" (kuaneos), which is usually translated as \"dark\" or \"dark-blue\". However, scholarly interpretation holds that \"\u03ba\u03c5\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2\" likely denoted brown eyes, contrasting with \"\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\" (glaukos), the term used for gray or blue eyes. A later Latin account, probably from the fifth century\u00a0CE, falsely attributed to Dares Phrygius, describes Helen as \"She was beautiful, ingenuous, and charming. Her legs were the best; her mouth the cutest. There was a beauty-mark between her eyebrows\". Bettany Hughes notes that Helen and other Homeric heroes tend to be described and depicted by ancient Greeks as being \"xanthos\" (\"golden-haired\"), and she argues that such look was linked with the connections of ancient heroes and heroines to the gods, as light-haired individuals were less common in ancient Mediterranean than dark-haired ones.\nHelen is frequently depicted on Athenian vases as being threatened by Menelaus and fleeing from him. This is not the case, however, in Laconic art: on an Archaic stele depicting Helen's recovery after the fall of Troy, Menelaus is armed with a sword but Helen faces him boldly, looking directly into his eyes; and in other works of Peloponnesian art, Helen is shown carrying a wreath, while Menelaus holds his sword aloft vertically. In contrast, on Athenian vases of c. 550\u2013470, Menelaus threateningly points his sword at her.\nThe abduction by Paris was another popular motif in ancient Greek vase-painting; definitely more popular than the kidnapping by Theseus. In a famous representation by the Athenian vase painter Makron, Helen follows Paris like a bride following a bridegroom, her wrist grasped by Paris' hand. The Etruscans, who had a sophisticated knowledge of Greek mythology, demonstrated a particular interest in the theme of the delivery of Helen's egg, which is depicted in relief mirrors.\nIn Renaissance painting, Helen's departure from Sparta is usually depicted as a scene of forcible removal (rape) by Paris. This is not, however, the case with certain secular medieval illustrations. Artists of the 1460s and 1470s were influenced by Guido delle Colonne's \"Historia destructionis Troiae\", where Helen's abduction was portrayed as a scene of seduction. In the \"Florentine Picture Chronicle\" Paris and Helen are shown departing arm in arm, while their marriage was depicted into Franco-Flemish tapestry.\nIn Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\" (1604), Faust conjures the shade of Helen. Upon seeing Helen, Faustus speaks the famous line: \"Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships, / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium.\" (Act V, Scene I.) Helen is also conjured by Faust in Goethe's \"Faust\".\nIn William Shakespeare's play Troilus and Cressida, Helen is a minor character who adores Troilus.\nIn Pre-Raphaelite art, Helen is often shown with shining curly hair and ringlets. Other painters of the same period depict Helen on the ramparts of Troy, and focus on her expression: her face is expressionless, blank, inscrutable. In Gustave Moreau's painting, Helen will finally become faceless; a blank \"eidolon\" in the middle of Troy's ruins.\nCult.\nThe major centers of Helen's cult were in Laconia. At Sparta, the urban sanctuary of Helen was located near the Platanistas, so called for the plane trees planted there. Ancient sources associate Helen with gymnastic exercises or/and choral dances of maidens near the Evrotas River. This practice is referenced in the closing lines of Lysistrata, where Helen is said to be the \"pure and proper\" leader of the dancing Spartan women. Theocritus conjures the song epithalamium Spartan women sung at Platanistas commemorating the marriage of Helen and Menelaus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWe first a crown of low-growing lotus\nhaving woven will place it on a shady plane-tree.\nFirst from a silver oil-flask soft oil\ndrawing we will let it drip beneath the shady plane-tree.\nLetters will be carved in the bark, so that someone passing by\nmay read in Doric: \"Reverence me. I am Helen's tree.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nHelen's worship was also present on the opposite bank of Eurotas at Therapne, where she shared a shrine with Menelaus and the Dioscuri. The shrine has been known as the Menelaion (the shrine of Menelaus), and it was believed to be the spot where Helen was buried alongside Menelaus. Despite its name, both the shrine and the cult originally belonged to Helen; Menelaus was added later as her husband. In addition, there was a festival at the town, which was called Meneleaeia (\u039c\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) in honour of Menelaus and Helen.\nIsocrates writes that at Therapne Helen and Menelaus were worshiped as gods, and not as heroes. Clader argues that, if indeed Helen was worshiped as a goddess at Therapne, then her powers should be largely concerned with fertility, or as a solar deity. There is also evidence for Helen's cult in Hellenistic Sparta: rules for those sacrificing and holding feasts in their honor are extant.\nHelen was also worshiped in Attica along with her brothers, and on Rhodes as Helen \"Dendritis\" (Helen of the Trees, \u0388\u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u0394\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2); she was a vegetation or a fertility goddess. Martin P. Nilsson has argued that the cult in Rhodes has its roots to the Minoan, pre-Greek era, when Helen was allegedly worshiped as a vegetation goddess. Claude Calame and other scholars try to analyze the affinity between the cults of Helen and Artemis Orthia, pointing out the resemblance of the terracotta female figurines offered to both deities.\nIn popular culture.\nEarly depictions.\nHelen frequently appeared in Athenian comedies of the fifth century BC as a caricature of Pericles's mistress Aspasia. In Hellenistic times, she was associated with the moon due to the similarity of her name to the Greek word \u03a3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 (\"Sel\u0113n\u0113\"), meaning \"Moon, goddess of the moon\". One Pythagorean source claimed that Helen had originally come from a colony on the moon, where people were larger, stronger, and \"fifteen times\" more beautiful than ordinary mortals. She is one of the eponymous women the tragedy \"The Trojan Women\" produced in 415 BC by the Greek playwright Euripides.\nDio Chrysostom absolved Helen of guilt for the Trojan War by making Paris her first, original husband and claiming that the Greeks started the war out of jealousy. Virgil, in his \"Aeneid\", makes Aeneas the one to spare Helen's life, rather than Menelaus, and instead portrays the act as a lofty example of self-control. Meanwhile, Virgil also makes Helen more vicious by having her betray her own husband Deiphobos and give him over to Menelaus as a peace offering. The satirist Lucian of Samosata features Helen in his famous \"Dialogues of the Dead\", in which he portrays her deceased spirit as aged and withered.\nIn the early Middle Ages, after the rise of Christianity, Helen was seen as a pagan equivalent to Eve from the Book of Genesis. Helen was so beloved by early medieval Christians that she even took on some of the roles of the Virgin Mary.\nDuring the Renaissance, the French poet Pierre de Ronsard wrote 142\u00a0sonnets addressed to a woman named H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Surg\u00e8res, in which he declared her to be the \"true\", French Helen, rather than the \"lie\" of the Greeks.\nDante's \"Inferno\" has Helen tormented in the circle of lust alongside Paris.\n\"Faust\".\nHelen appears in various versions of the Faust myth, including Christopher Marlowe's 1604 play \"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus\", in which Faustus famously marvels, \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\" upon seeing a demon impersonating Helen. The line, which is frequently quoted out of context, is a paraphrase of a statement from Lucian's \"Dialogues of the Dead\". It is debated whether the phrase conveys astonishment at Helen's beauty, or disappointment that she is not more beautiful. Helen appears in Marlowe's play as a voiceless image conjured by Mephistopheles. Helen first appears displayed to scholars as a vision to admire. Her second appearance is when Faustus calls for her in despair. Not speaking herself, Faustus shows she is an object of desire and destruction. She walks about to parade her beauty silently, tempting Faustus. In connection to the myth of Helen of Troy, Helen is often blamed with causing the Trojan War; Marlowe's portrayal of Helen may function as a test of Faustus\u2019 damnation. It is undetermined if the Helen in \"Doctor Faustus\" is the real Helen or merely a disguised entity that mimicks her beauty, blurring the lines of blame for Faustus' temptation. Marlowe's portrayal of Helen blurs the line between a beautiful, angel-like figure and an evil, dangerously tempting figure, allowing her to be ambiguous in regard to her role in Faustus' damned fate.\nThe German poet and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe re-envisioned the meeting of Faust and Helen. In \"\", the union of Helen and Faust becomes a complex allegory of the meeting of the classical-ideal and modern worlds.\nHelen of Troy is a minor character in the opera \"Mefistofele\" by Arrigo Boito, which received its premiere in Milan in 1868.\n19th and 20th centuries.\nIn 1803, when French zoologist Fran\u00e7ois Marie Daudin was to name a new species of beautifully colored snake, the trinket snake (\"Coelognathus helena\"), he chose the specific name \"helena\" in reference to Helen of Troy.\nIn 1864, Paris saw the premiere of the operetta \"La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\" by Jacques Offenbach.\nIn 1881, Oscar Wilde published a poem entitled \"The New Helen\", in which he declared his friend Lillie Langtry to be the reincarnation of Helen of Troy. Wilde portrays this new Helen as the antithesis of the Virgin Mary, but endows her with the characteristics of Jesus Christ himself. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats compared Helen to his muse, Maude Gonne, in his poems \"No Second Troy\" (1916) and \"A Man Young and Old\" (1928). The anthology \"The Dark Tower\" by C. S. Lewis includes a fragment entitled \"After Ten Years\". In Egypt after the Trojan War, Menelaus is allowed to choose between the real, disappointing Helen and an ideal Helen conjured by Egyptian magicians.\nThe English Pre-Raphaelite painter Evelyn De Morgan portrayed a sexually assertive Helen in her 1898 painting \"Helen of Troy\". Salvador Dal\u00ed was obsessed with Helen of Troy from childhood and saw his wife Gala Dal\u00ed and the surrealist character Gradiva as the embodiments of Helen. He dedicates his autobiography \"Diary of a Genius\" to \"my genius Gala Gradiva, Helen of Troy, Saint Helen, Gala Galatea Placida.\"\nMinor planet 101 Helena discovered by James Craig Watson in 1868, is named after Helen of Troy.\nJohn Erskine's 1925 bestselling novel \"The Private Life of Helen of Troy\" portrayed Helen as a \"sensible, bourgeois heroine\", but the 1927 silent film of the same name, directed by Alexander Korda, transformed Helen into \"a shopaholic fashion maven\".\nIn 1928, Richard Strauss wrote the German opera \"Die \u00e4gyptische Helena\" (\"The Egyptian Helena\"), which is the story of Helen and Menelaus's troubles when they are marooned on a mythical island.\nThe 1938 short story, \"Helen O'Loy\", written by Lester del Rey, details the creation of a synthetic woman by two mechanics. The title is wordplay that combines \"Helen of Troy\" with \"alloy\".\nThe 1951 Swedish film \"Sk\u00f6na Helena\" is an adapted version of Offenbach's operetta, starring Max Hansen and Eva Dahlbeck. In 1956, a Franco-British epic titled \"Helen of Troy\" was released, directed by Oscar-winning director Robert Wise and starring Italian actress Rossana Podest\u00e0 in the title role. It was filmed in Italy, and featured well-known British character actors such as Harry Andrews, Cedric Hardwicke, and Torin Thatcher in supporting roles.\nThe 1971 film \"The Trojan Women\" was an adaptation of the play by Euripides in which Irene Papas portrayed (a non-blonde) Helen of Troy.\nIn the 1998 TV series \"Hercules\", Helen appears as a supporting character at Prometheus Academy as a student. Helen is caring and enthusiastic. She was the most popular girl in the academy and Adonis' girlfriend. Helen tries her best to keep Adonis from behaving stupidly, but mostly fails. She likes Hercules, but as a friend. She is a princess as in the myth but is not a half-sister of Hercules in the series. She was voiced by Jodi Benson.\n21st century.\nA 2003 television version of Helen's life up to the fall of Troy, \"Helen of Troy\", in which she was played by Sienna Guillory. In this version, Helen is depicted as unhappy in her marriage and willingly runs away with Paris, with whom she has fallen in love, but still returns to Menelaus after Paris dies and Troy falls.\nHelen was portrayed by Diane Kruger in the 2004 film \"Troy\". In this adaptation, as in the 2003 television version, she is unhappily married to Menelaus and willingly leaves with Paris, whom she loves. However, in this version she does not return to Sparta with Menelaus (who is killed by Hector), but escapes Troy with Paris and other survivors when the city falls.\nInspired by the line, \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...?\" from Marlowe's \"Faustus\", Isaac Asimov jocularly coined the unit \"millihelen\" to mean the amount of beauty that can launch one ship. Canadian novelist and poet Margaret Atwood re-envisioned the myth of Helen in modern, feminist guise in her poem \"Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing\".\nIn the \"Legends of Tomorrow\" episode \"Helen Hunt\", Helen is portrayed by Israeli-American model and actress Bar Paly. In the episode, Helen is an anachronism appearing in 1930s Hollywood. She lands a job as an actress and unintentionally starts a war between two film studios. The Legends travel to the 1930s and try to get Helen back to the Bronze Age. She regretfully goes along, telling the team she wishes to stay away due to men constantly fighting and dying over her. After analyzing historical records of Helen's impact on history, Zari Tomaz finds the best time to take her away from the fighting of her time and takes her to Themyscira. Helen reappears in the season three finale, \"The Good, the Bad and the Cuddly\", as an Amazon warrior who assists the Legends in defeating the demon Mallus's army.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdditional references.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63446", "revid": "43660803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63446", "title": "Dwarves in Middle-earth", "text": "Humanoid race in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium\nIn the fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Dwarves are a race inhabiting Middle-earth, the central continent of Arda in an imagined mythological past. They are based on the dwarfs of Germanic myths who were small humanoids that lived in mountains, practising mining, metallurgy, blacksmithing and jewellery. Tolkien described them as tough, warlike, and lovers of stone and craftsmanship.\nThe origins of Tolkien's Dwarves can be traced to Norse mythology; Tolkien also mentioned a connection with Jewish history and language.\nDwarves appear in his books \"The Hobbit\" (1937), \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954\u201355), and the posthumously published \"The Silmarillion\" (1977), \"Unfinished Tales\" (1980), and \"The History of Middle-earth\" series (1983\u201396), the last three edited by his son Christopher Tolkien.\nCharacteristics.\nThe medievalist Charles Moseley described the dwarves of Tolkien's legendarium as \"Old Norse\" in their names, their feuds, and their revenges. In the appendix on \"Durin's Folk\" in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien describes dwarves as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" considers Tolkien's use of the adjective \"thrawn\", noting its similarity with \"\u00der\u00e1inn\", a noun meaning \"obstinate person\", and a name found in the Norse list of Dwarf-names, the \"Dvergatal\" in the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\". Tolkien took it for the name, Thr\u00e1in, of two of Thorin Oakenshield's ancestors. It suggests this may have been a philological joke on Tolkien's part.\nDwarves were long-lived, with a lifespan of some 250 years. They breed slowly, for no more than a third of them are female, not all marry, and they have children only late in life. Tolkien names only one female, D\u00eds, Thorin's sister. They are still considered children in their 20s, as Thorin was at age 24; and as \"striplings\" in their 30s. Despite his young age, D\u00e1in Ironfoot was 32 when he killed Azog, the orc chieftain of Moria. They had children starting in their 90s.\nThe Dwarves are described as \"the most redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples\" \u2013 a warlike race who fought fiercely against their enemies, including other Dwarves. Highly skilled in the making of weapons and armour, their main weapon was the battle axe, but they also used bows, swords, shields and mattocks, and wore armour.\nSauron gave seven Rings of Power to Dwarf lords. The Rings caused them to be wrathful and greedy for gold, but they were not brought under Sauron's domination, nor did they gain longer life. Eventually all seven Rings were destroyed or reclaimed by Sauron. One of the rings was given to Durin III, and passed down to Thr\u00f3r, who gave it to his son Thr\u00e1in II, father of Thorin Oakenshield. Sauron captured Thr\u00e1in and took the ring from him in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.\nIn-fiction origins.\nThe Dwarves are portrayed in \"The Silmarillion\" as an ancient people who awake during the Years of the Trees, after the Elves at the start of the First Age, but before Men when the Sun and Moon are created. The Vala Aul\u00eb, impatient for the arising of the Children of Il\u00favatar, creates the seven &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, intending them to be his children to whom he could teach his crafts. He teaches them Khuzdul, a language he had devised for them. Il\u00favatar, creator of Arda, is aware of the Dwarves' creation and sanctifies them. Because they had been made by a Vala, Dwarves lacked souls until granted them by Il\u00favatar. Aul\u00eb sealed the seven Fathers of the Dwarves in stone chambers in far-flung regions of Middle-earth to await their awakening.\nEach of the Seven Fathers founds one of the seven Dwarf clans. Durin I is the eldest, and the first of his kind to awake in Middle-earth. He awakens in Mount Gundabad, in the northern Misty Mountains, and founds the clan of Longbeards (Durin's Folk); they found the city of Khazad-d\u00fbm below the Misty Mountains, and later realms in the Grey Mountains and Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). Two others lie in sleep in the north of the \"Ered Luin\" (Blue Mountains), and they found the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards. The remaining four clans, the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots come from the East. After the end of the First Age, the Dwarves spoken of are almost exclusively of Durin's line.&lt;ref name=\"R. Tolkien 1954 pp. 52/53\" group=T&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nA further division, the even shorter &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Petty-dwarves, appears in \"The Silmarillion\" and \"The Children of H\u00farin\". Moseley likens &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;M\u00eem, the last known Petty-dwarf, to the similarly named Mime from the \"Nibelungenlied\".\nArtefacts.\nMining, masonry, and metalwork.\nAs creations of Aul\u00eb, they are attracted to the substances of Arda. They mine and work precious metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. They are unrivalled in smithing, crafting, metalworking, and masonry, even among the Elves. The Dwarf-smith Telchar is the greatest in renown. They build immense halls under mountains for their cities. They build many famed halls including the Menegroth, Khazad-d\u00fbm, and Erebor. Among the many treasures they forge are the named weapons Narsil, the sword of Elendil, the Dragon-helm of Dor-l\u00f3min and the necklace Nauglam\u00edr, the most prized treasure in Nargothrond and the most famed Dwarven work of the Elder Days. In \"The Hobbit\", Thorin gives Bilbo a Mithril coat of linked rings of mail.\nLanguage and names.\nIn Sindarin (Grey-elvish) the Dwarves are called \"Naugrim\" (\"Stunted People\"), \"Gonnhirrim\" (\"Stone-lords\"), and \"Dornhoth\" (\"Thrawn Folk\"), and \"Hadhodrim\". In Quenya they are the \"Cas\u00e1ri\". The Dwarves call themselves \"Khaz\u00e2d\" in their own language, Khuzdul. Khuzdul is created for them by Aul\u00eb, rather than being descended from an Elvish language, as most of the languages of Men are. They write it using Cirth runes, a writing system originally created by Elves in Beleriand to write Sindarin, and later more fully developed by Daeron, an Elf of Doriath. The Cirth runes are adapted by Dwarves for writing Khuzdul. The Dwarves keep their language secret and do not normally teach it to others, so they learn both Quenya and Sindarin to communicate with the Elves, especially the Noldor and Sindar. By the Third Age the Dwarves are estranged from the Elves and no longer routinely learn their language. Instead, they mostly use Westron (Common Speech), a Mannish tongue, in communicating with other races.\nEach Dwarf has two personal names, a secret, \"inner\" name in Khuzdul, which is used only among other Dwarves and is never revealed to outsiders, and a public, \"outer\" name for use with other races, taken from the language of the people amongst whom the Dwarf lives. For example, the Dwarves of Moria and the Lonely Mountain use outer names taken from the language of the Men of the north where they lived.\nIn reality, Tolkien took the names of 12 of the 13 dwarves \u2013 excluding Balin \u2013 that he used in \"The Hobbit\" from the Old Norse \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", long before the idea of Khuzdul arose. When he came to write \"The Lord of the Rings\", in order to explain why the Dwarves had Norse names, he created an elaborate fiction that many of the languages used in the book were \"translated\" into real-life languages for the benefit of the reader, roughly retaining the relationships of the languages among themselves. Thus, Westron was translated into English, the related but more archaic language of the Rohirrim was translated into Anglo-Saxon (Old English), and the even more distantly related language of Dale was translated into Norse. It is possible that the problem of explaining the Dwarves' Norse names was the origin of the entire structure of the Mannish languages in Middle-earth along with the fiction of \"translation\".\nCalendar.\nTolkien's only mention of the Dwarves' calendar is in \"The Hobbit\", regarding the \"dwarves' New Year\" (\"Durin's Day\"), which occurs on the day of the last new moon of autumn. However, in his first drafts of the book, Durin's Day was the \"first\" new moon of autumn. After he had finished writing the book, Tolkien went back and changed all occurrences of the date to the last new moon, more in keeping with the real-world Celtic calendar, but overlooked one mention in Chapter IV, which still named the date as the first new moon. Tolkien never noticed this inconsistency, and it was not corrected until the 1995 edition of the book. The astronomer Bradley E. Schaefer has analysed the astronomical determinants of Durin's Day. He concluded that \u2013 as with many real-world lunar calendars \u2013 the date of Durin's Day is observational, dependent on the first visible crescent moon.\nAnalysis.\nNorse myth.\nIn Tolkien's \"The Book of Lost Tales\", the very few Dwarves who appear are portrayed as evil beings, employers of Orc mercenaries and in conflict with the Elves\u2014who are the imagined \"authors\" of the myths, and are therefore biased against Dwarves. Tolkien was inspired by the dwarves of Norse myths and of later Germanic folklore (such as that of the Brothers Grimm), from whom his Dwarves take their characteristic affinity with mining, metalworking, and crafting.\nJewish history.\nIn \"The Hobbit\", Dwarves are portrayed as occasionally comedic and bumbling, but largely as honourable, serious-minded, and proud. Tolkien was influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding Jewish people and their history. The dwarves' characteristics of being dispossessed of their homeland in Erebor, and living among other groups but retaining their own culture, are derived from the medieval image of Jews, while, according to the Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff, their warlike nature stems from accounts in the Hebrew Bible. Medieval views of Jews also saw them as having a propensity for making well-crafted and beautiful things, a trait shared with Norse dwarves. The Dwarf calendar invented for \"The Hobbit\" reflects the Jewish calendar's Rosh Hashanah in beginning in late autumn.\nSemitic-style language.\nIn \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien continued the themes of \"The Hobbit\". When giving Dwarves their own language, Khuzdul, Tolkien decided to create an analogue of a Semitic language influenced by Hebrew phonology. Like medieval Jewish groups, the Dwarves used their own language only among themselves, and adopted the languages of those they live amongst for the most part, for example taking public names from the cultures they lived within, whilst keeping their \"true-names\" and true language a secret. Tolkien further underlined the diaspora of the Dwarves with the lost stronghold of the Mines of Moria. Tolkien elaborated on Jewish influence on his Dwarves in a letter: \"I do think of the 'Dwarves' like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue...\" In the last interview before his death, Tolkien said \"The dwarves of course are quite obviously, wouldn't you say, that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic, obviously, constructed to be Semitic.\" This raises the question, examined by Rebecca Brackmann in \"Mythlore\", of whether there was an element of antisemitism, however deeply buried, in Tolkien's account of the Dwarves, inherited from English attitudes of his time. Brackman notes that Tolkien himself attempted to work through the issue in his Middle-earth writings. It has been suggested that the formation of the deep friendship between the dwarf Gimli and elf Legolas in the \"Lord of the Rings\", overcoming longtime mutual suspicion, can be seen as Tolkien's reply toward \"Gentile anti-Semitism and Jewish exclusiveness\".\nThe philologist Helge Fauskanger analyses Khuzdul, finding in it features of Semitic languages.\nSpelling.\nThe original editor of \"The Hobbit\" \"corrected\" Tolkien's plural \"dwarves\" to \"dwarfs\", as did the editor of the Puffin paperback edition. According to Tolkien, the \"real 'historical' plural\" of \"dwarf\" is \"dwarrows\" or \"dwerrows\". He described the word \"dwarves\" as \"a piece of private bad grammar\". In Appendix F of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien explained that if people still spoke of \"dwarves\" regularly, English might have retained a special plural for the word \"dwarf\", as with the irregular plural of \"goose\", \"geese\". Despite his fondness for it, the form \"dwarrow\" only appears in his writing as \"Dwarrowdelf\" (\"Dwarf-digging\"), a name for Moria. He used \"Dwarves\", instead, corresponding to his \"Elves\" as a plural for \"Elf\". Tolkien used \"dwarvish\" and \"dwarf(-)\" (e.g. \"Dwarf-lords\", \"Old Dwarf Road\") as adjectives for the people he created.\nAdaptations.\nFilms.\nIn Rankin-Bass' 1977 animated film adaptation of \"The Hobbit\", Thorin was voiced by Hans Conreid, with Don Messick voicing Balin, John Stephenson voicing Dori, Jack DeLeon voicing Dwalin, F\u00edli, K\u00edli, \u00d3in, Gl\u00f3in, Ori, Nori, Bifur, and Bofur, and Paul Frees voicing Bombur.\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film \"The Lord of the Rings\", the part of the Dwarf Gimli was voiced by David Buck.\nIn Peter Jackson's live action adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, Gimli's character is from time to time used as comic relief, whether with jokes about his height or his rivalry with the elf Legolas. Gimli is played by John Rhys-Davies, who gave the character a \"Welsh-derived\" accent.\nIn Jackson's three-film adaptation of \"The Hobbit\", Thorin is portrayed by Richard Armitage, with Ken Stott as Balin, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as K\u00edli, Dean O'Gorman as F\u00edli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, Jed Brophy as Nori, Adam Brown as Ori, John Callen as \u00d3in, Peter Hambleton as Gl\u00f3in, William Kircher as Bifur, James Nesbitt as Bofur, and Stephen Hunter as Bombur. Jackson's films introduce a story arc not found in the original novel, in which Kili and the Elf Tauriel (a character also invented for the films) fall in love.\nRole-playing games.\nIn Iron Crown Enterprises' \"Middle-earth Role Playing\" (1986), Dwarf player-characters receive statistical bonuses to Strength and Constitution, and subtractions from Presence, Agility and Intelligence. Seven \"Dwarven Kindreds\", named after each of the founding fathers\u2014Durin, B\u00e1vor, Dw\u00e1lin, Thr\u00e1r, Druin, Thel\u00f3r and B\u00e1rin\u2014are given in \"The Lords of Middle-earth\u2014Volume III\" (1989).\nIn Decipher Inc.'s \"The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game\" (2001), based on the Jackson films, Dwarf player-characters get bonuses to Vitality and Strength attributes and must be given craft skills.\nIn the real-time strategy game \"\", and its , both based on the Jackson films, Dwarves are heavily influenced by classical military practice, and use throwing axes, war hammers, spears, and circular shields. One dwarf unit is the \"Phalanx\", similar to its Greek counterpart.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Heuristic reasoning is often based on induction, or on analogy... Induction is the process of discovering general laws... Induction tries to find regularity and coherence... Its most conspicuous instruments are generalization, specialization, analogy.[...] Heuristic discusses human behavior in the face of problems [... that have been] preserved in the \"wisdom of proverbs\".\nContext.\nGigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier (2011) state that sub-sets of \"strategy\" include heuristics, regression analysis, and Bayesian inference.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately than more complex methods...\u2014\u200a\nHeuristics are strategies based on rules to generate optimal decisions, like the anchoring effect and utility maximization problem. These strategies depend on using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings, machines and abstract issues. When an individual applies a heuristic in practice, it generally performs as expected. However it can alternatively create systematic errors.\nThe most fundamental heuristic is trial and error, which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts to finding the values of variables in algebra problems. In mathematics, some common heuristics involve the use of visual representations, additional assumptions, forward/backward reasoning and simplification.\nDual process theory concerns embodied heuristics.\nHeuristic rigour models.\nLakatosian heuristics is based on the key term: Justification (epistemology).\nOne-reason decisions.\nOne-reason decisions are algorithms that are made of three rules: search rules, \"confirmation rules\" (stopping), and decision rules\nRecognition-based decisions.\nA class whose function is to determine and filter out superfluous things.\nTracking heuristics.\n\"Tracking heuristics\" is a class of heuristics.\nHistory.\nGeorge Polya studied and published on heuristics in 1945. Polya (1945) cites Pappus of Alexandria as having written a text that Polya dubs \"Heuristic\". Pappus' heuristic problem-solving methods consist of analysis and synthesis.\nContemporary.\nThe study of heuristics in human decision-making was developed in the 1970s and the 1980s, by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, although the concept had been originally introduced by the Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon. Simon's original primary object of research was problem solving that showed that we operate within what he calls \"bounded rationality\". He coined the term \"satisficing\", which denotes a situation in which people seek solutions, or accept choices or judgements, that are \"good enough\" for their purposes although they could be optimised.\nRudolf Groner analysed the history of heuristics from its roots in ancient Greece up to contemporary work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, proposing a cognitive style \"heuristic versus algorithmic thinking\", which can be assessed by means of a validated questionnaire.\nAdaptive toolbox.\nThe \"adaptive toolbox\" contains strategies for fabricating heuristic devices. The core mental capacities are recall (memory), frequency, object permanence, and imitation. Gerd Gigerenzer and his research group argued that models of heuristics need to be formal to allow for predictions of behavior that can be tested. They study the fast and frugal heuristics in the \"adaptive toolbox\" of individuals or institutions, and the ecological rationality of these heuristics; that is, the conditions under which a given heuristic is likely to be successful. The descriptive study of the \"adaptive toolbox\" is done by observation and experiment, while the prescriptive study of ecological rationality requires mathematical analysis and computer simulation. Heuristics \u2013 such as the recognition heuristic, the take-the-best heuristic and fast-and-frugal trees \u2013 have been shown to be effective in predictions, particularly in situations of uncertainty. It is often said that heuristics trade accuracy for effort but this is only the case in situations of risk. Risk refers to situations where all possible actions, their outcomes and probabilities are known. In the absence of this information, that is under uncertainty, heuristics can achieve higher accuracy with lower effort. This finding, known as a less-is-more effect, would not have been found without formal models. The valuable insight of this program is that heuristics are effective not despite their simplicity \u2013 but because of it. Furthermore, Gigerenzer and Wolfgang Gaissmaier found that both individuals and organisations rely on heuristics in an adaptive way.\nCognitive-experiential self-theory.\nHeuristics, through greater refinement and research, have begun to be applied to other theories, or be explained by them. For example, the cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST) is also an adaptive view of heuristic processing. CEST breaks down two systems that process information. At some times, roughly speaking, individuals consider issues rationally, systematically, logically, deliberately, effortfully, and verbally. On other occasions, individuals consider issues intuitively, effortlessly, globally, and emotionally. From this perspective, heuristics are part of a larger experiential processing system that is often adaptive, but vulnerable to error in situations that require logical analysis.\nAttribute substitution.\nIn 2002, Daniel Kahneman and Shane Frederick proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called \"attribute substitution\", which happens without conscious awareness. According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgement (of a \"target attribute\") that is computationally complex, a more easily calculated \"heuristic attribute\" is substituted. In effect, a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without being aware of this happening. This theory explains cases where judgements fail to show regression toward the mean. Heuristics can be considered to reduce the complexity of clinical judgments in health care.\nAcademic disciplines.\nPsychology.\nIn psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, either learned or inculcated by evolutionary processes. These psychological heuristics have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgements, and solve problems. These rules typically come into play when people face complex problems or incomplete information. Researchers employ various methods to test whether people use these rules. The rules have been shown to work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases can lead to systematic errors or cognitive biases.\nPhilosophy.\nA heuristic device is used when an entity \"X\" exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity \"Y\".\nA good example is a model that, as it is never identical with what it models, is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in this sense. A classic example is the notion of utopia as described in Plato's best-known work, \"The Republic\". This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in \"The Republic\" is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development. Rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a noun to describe a rule of thumb, procedure, or method. Philosophers of science have emphasised the importance of heuristics in creative thought and the construction of scientific theories. Seminal works include Karl Popper's \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\" and others by Imre Lakatos, Lindley Darden, and William C. Wimsatt.\nLaw.\nIn legal theory, especially in the theory of law and economics, heuristics are used in the law when case-by-case analysis would be impractical, insofar as \"practicality\" is defined by the interests of a governing body.\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons. In truth, actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects. For instance, in all states in the United States the legal drinking age for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary delineation is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\nThe same reasoning applies to patent law. Patents are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted monopoly on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including University of North Dakota law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as software patents \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.\nArtificial intelligence.\nThe bias\u2013variance tradeoff gives insight into describing the less-is-more strategy. A heuristic can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space. The heuristic is derived by using some function that is put into the system by the designer, or by adjusting the weight of branches based on how likely each branch is to lead to a goal node.\nBehavioural economics.\nHeuristics refers to the cognitive shortcuts that individuals use to simplify decision-making processes in economic situations. Behavioral economics is a field that integrates insights from psychology and economics to better understand how people make decisions.\nAnchoring and adjustment is one of the most extensively researched heuristics in behavioural economics. Anchoring is the tendency of people to make future judgements or conclusions based too heavily on the original information supplied to them. This initial knowledge functions as an anchor, and it can influence future judgements even if the anchor is entirely unrelated to the decisions at hand. Adjustment, on the other hand, is the process through which individuals make gradual changes to their initial judgements or conclusions.\nAnchoring and adjustment has been observed in a wide range of decision-making contexts, including financial decision-making, consumer behavior, and negotiation. Researchers have identified a number of strategies that can be used to mitigate the effects of anchoring and adjustment, including providing multiple anchors, encouraging individuals to generate alternative anchors, and providing cognitive prompts to encourage more deliberative decision-making.\nOther heuristics studied in behavioral economics include the representativeness heuristic, which refers to the tendency of individuals to categorize objects or events based on how similar they are to typical examples, and the availability heuristic, which refers to the tendency of individuals to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind.\nStereotyping.\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgements about things they have never seen or experienced. They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions), to classifying a plant as a tree based on it being tall, having a trunk, and that it has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist Walter Lippmann in his book \"Public Opinion\" (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien's Middle-earth\nUngoliant () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, described as an evil spirit in the form of a giant spider. Her name means \"dark spider\" in Sindarin. She is mentioned briefly in \"The Lord of the Rings\", and plays a supporting role in \"The Silmarillion\", enabling the Dark Lord Melkor to destroy the Two Trees of Valinor and darken the world.\nHer origins are unclear, as Tolkien's writings do not explicitly reveal her nature, other than that she is from \"before the world\"; this may mean she is a Maia, an immortal spirit. Scholars have likened the story of Ungoliant and Melkor to John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", where Sin conceives a child, Death, by Satan: Sin and Death are always hungry. There are limited parallels in Norse myth: while there are female giants, they are not usually spiders, though the Devil appears as a spider in an early Icelandic tale, and a female giant in the \"Prose Edda\" is named N\u00f3tt (\"Night\"), she and her brood dwelling in and personifying darkness.\nEtymology.\n\"Ungoliant\" means 'dark spider' in Tolkien's invented language of Sindarin. It is a loan word from .\nIn early versions, recorded in \"Morgoth's Ring\", Tolkien writes \"Ungoliant\u00eb\".\nInternal history.\nTolkien's original writings say that Ungoliant was a primeval spirit of night, named M\u00f3ru, who aided Melkor in his attack upon the Two Trees of Valinor, draining them of their sap after Melkor had injured them. She also consumed the reserves of light from the wells of Varda. Afterward the light of the trees persisted only within the Silmarils of F\u00ebanor. Ungoliant helped Melkor evade the Valar by shrouding them both in the impenetrable darkness she produced.\nMelkor had promised Ungoliant to yield anything she wished in return for her aid, but betrayed this promise by withholding the Silmarils, and summoned the Balrogs to repel her. Ungoliant fled to the Ered Gorgoroth in Beleriand. At some point she gave birth to the Giant Spiders, including the character Shelob of \"The Lord of the Rings\". In \"The Silmarillion\", it is stated that when she went into hiding her hunger was such that she would mate with other spiders only to devour them later, with her offspring used as food once fully grown. \"The Silmarillion\" suggests that Ungoliant's unremitting hunger may perhaps have driven her to devour herself.\nAnalysis.\nAccording to the Tolkien scholar John Wm. Houghton, the story of Ungoliant and Morgoth is comparable to the account in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" in which Sin conceives a child, Death, by Satan. Both Sin and Death are always hungry; Satan says he will feed them, and leads them to the world.\nJoe Abbott, writing in \"Mythlore\", comments that Ungoliant and Shelob are similar monsters, \"product of a singular concept\". He observes that they are female giants, something found in Northern folklore. Those are not usually in spider form, but he notes an early Icelandic example where \"the Devil appears as a spider and has his leg cut off\". On Ungoliant's race, he notes Tolkien's remark in \"The Theft of Melko\" (in \"The Book of Lost Tales\") that \"Mayhap she was bred of mists and darkness on the confines of the Shadowy seas, in the utter dark that came between the overthrow of the Lamps and the kindling of the Trees, but \"more like she has always been\" [Abbott's italics]; and she it is who loveth still to dwell in that black place \"taking the guise\" of an unlovely spider.\" He draws attention to Tolkien's suggestions that Ungoliant has always existed and that she is simply choosing to appear (in the \"guise\") as a spider, and states that this means she must be an immortal Maia, a spirit-being able to take on physical form. He offers the parallel of Nott (\"Night\"), an Icelandic female giant in the \"Gilfaginning\" in the \"Prose Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson. Nott was dark, like all her kindred, just as Ungoliant and all her brood dwell in and \"personify\" darkness.\nIn \"Mythlore\", Candice Fredrick and Sam McBride write that Ungoliant and the lesser spider Shelob signify purely irrational evil, \"wholly preoccupied with their own lusts; they operate on the pleasure principle.\" They contrast this with the Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron, who, while also wholly evil, possess the power of rational thought, \"evil guided by rationality\". Thus, Melkor can think long-term, exploiting other beings to achieve his goals, whereas Ungoliant chooses \"instant gratification\". They further assert that the spiders' irrationality required Tolkien to make them female, while the Dark Lords' analytical thought identified them as male.\nIn a version of \"Of the Darkening of Valinor\" written after \"The Lord of the Rings\", and not included in \"The Silmarillion\", Tolkien added that \"[Ungoliant\u00eb] would not dare the perils of Aman, or the power of the dreadful Lords, without a great reward; for she feared the eyes of Manw\u00eb and Varda more even than the wrath of Melkor.\" Kristine Larsen, in \"Mallorn\", comments that this mention of Varda's power over the great spider is unique.\nLegacy.\nUngoliant has been the subject of several heavy metal music songs. Her conflict with Morgoth over the Silmaril was the subject of Blind Guardian's song \"Into the Storm\", from their 1998 album \"Nightfall in Middle-Earth\". Austrian black metal band Summoning had a song called \"Ungolianth\" on their 1995 album \"Minas Morgul\". On their 2006 album \"The Morrigan's Call\", the Irish Celtic metal band Cruachan featured a song called \"Ungoliant\", as well as one named after Shelob.\nUngoliant is mentioned in the 2012 film \", the first film of Peter Jackson's film trilogy of \"The Hobbit\", when the wizard Radagast the Brown conjectures on the origin of malevolent giant spiders endemic to Mirkwood.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63455", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63455", "title": "Men in Middle-earth", "text": "Human race as it appears in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth fiction\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth fiction, Man and Men denote humans, whether male or female, in contrast to Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and other humanoid races. \nMen are described as the second or younger people, created after the Elves, and differing from them in being mortal. Along with Ents and Dwarves, these are the \"free peoples\" of Middle-earth, differing from the enslaved peoples such as Orcs.\nTolkien uses the Men of Middle-earth, interacting with immortal Elves, to explore a variety of themes in \"The Lord of the Rings\", especially death and immortality. This appears throughout, but is the central theme of an appendix, \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\". Where the Hobbits stand for simple, earthbound, comfort-loving people, Men are far more varied, from petty villains and slow-witted publicans to the gentle warrior Faramir and the genuinely heroic Aragorn; Tolkien had wanted to create a heroic romance suitable for the modern age. Scholars have identified real-world analogues for each of the varied races of Men, whether from medieval times or classical antiquity. \nThe weakness of Men, \"The Lord of the Rings\" asserts, is the desire for power; the One Ring promises enormous power, but is both evil and addictive. Tolkien uses Aragorn and the warrior Boromir, the two Men in the Fellowship that was created to destroy the Ring, to show opposite reactions to that temptation. It becomes clear that, except for Men, all the peoples of Middle-earth are dwindling and fading: the Elves are leaving, and the Ents are childless. By the Fourth Age, Middle-earth is peopled with Men, and indeed Tolkien intended it to represent the real world in the distant past.\nCommentators have questioned Tolkien's attitude to race, given that good peoples are white and live in the West, while enemies may be dark and live in the East and South. However, others note that Tolkien was strongly anti-racist in real life.\nIn the fictional world.\nCreation.\nThe race of Men in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world, in his books \"The Hobbit\", \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Silmarillion\", is the second race of beings, the \"younger children\", created by the One God, Il\u00favatar. Because they awoke in the First Age at the start of the Years of the Sun, long after the Elves, the Elves called them the \"afterborn\", or in Quenya the \"Atani\", the \"Second People\". Like Elves, Men first awoke in the East of Middle-earth, spreading all over the continent and developing a variety of cultures and ethnicities. Unlike Tolkien's Elves, Men are mortal; when they die, they depart to a world unknown even to the godlike Valar.\nFree peoples.\nMen are one of the four \"free peoples\" in the list-poem spoken by the Ent Treebeard; the others being Elves, Dwarves, and Ents. Hobbits, not included on that list, were a branch of the lineage of Men. Hobbits were not known to the Ents, but on meeting Merry and Pippin, Treebeard at once worked that people into the list.\nThe concept of the free peoples is shared by Elrond. The Tolkien scholar Paul H. Kocher writes that, in the style of the medieval Great Chain of Being, this list places Men and the other speaking peoples higher than the beasts, birds, and reptiles which he lists next. \"Man the mortal, master of horses\" is listed last among the free peoples, who were created separately.\nDiversity.\nAlthough all Men in Tolkien's legendarium are related to one another, there are many different groups with different cultures. Those on the side of the hobbits in \"The Lord of the Rings\" are the D\u00fanedain, the men who fought on the side of the Elves in the First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand, from whom other friendly groups, the Rangers including Aragorn, and the men of Gondor are descended; and their allies the Rohirrim.\nThe main human adversaries in \"The Lord of the Rings\" are the Haradrim and the Easterlings. The Haradrim or Southrons were hostile to Gondor, and used elephants in war. Tolkien describes them as \"swart\", meaning \"dark-skinned\". The Easterlings lived in Rh\u00fbn, the vast eastern region of Middle-earth; they fought in the armies of Morgoth and Sauron. Tolkien describes them as \"slant-eyed\"; they ride horses or wagons, leading to the name \"wain-riders\". The Variags of Khand formed a third but smaller group, who appear as vassals of Mordor in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Their name is from (\"Variag\"), meaning the Varangians, Viking or other Germanic warriors who served as mercenaries. Other human adversaries include the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans, good men gone wrong; and the Corsairs of Umbar, rebels of Gondor.\nSandra Ballif Straubhaar notes in \"The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" that Faramir, son of the Steward of Gondor, makes an \"arrogant\" speech, of which he later \"has cause to repent\", classifying the types of Men as seen by the Men of N\u00famen\u00f3rean origin at the end of the Third Age; she notes, too, that his taxonomy is probably not to be taken at face value.\nHistory.\nIn a world with other intelligent and cultured races, Men in Middle-earth interact with each other and with the other races in a complex history, narrated mainly in \"The Silmarillion\". Men are in general friendly with the other free peoples, especially Elves; they are implacable enemies of the enslaved peoples, especially Orcs. In the First Age, Men, the Edain, lived in Beleriand on the extreme West of Middle-earth. They form an alliance with the Elves and join a disastrous war against the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, which destroys Beleriand. As a reward for fighting in the war, the creator, Eru Iluvatar, gives the Edain the new island of N\u00famenor as their home.\nThe key difference between Men and Elves now becomes central to the story: Elves are immortal, and return to Valinor, home of the godlike Valar, when they become weary of Middle-earth, or are killed in battle. Men, however, are mortal. Morgoth's servant, Sauron, tempts the Men of N\u00famenor to attack Valinor, in their search for immortality: Sauron has falsely insinuated that Men can become immortal just by being in that place. The Men and N\u00famenor are destroyed: the island is drowned, Atlantis-like, beneath the waves; the world is made round; and Valinor is removed from the world, so that only the Elves can reach it. Sauron's body is destroyed, but his spirit escapes to become the new Dark Lord of Middle-earth. A remnant of the Men of N\u00famenor who remained faithful, under Elendil, sail to Middle-earth, where they found the kingdoms of Arnor in the North and Gondor in the South, remaining known as the D\u00fanedain, \"Men of the West\". Arnor becomes fragmented, and declines until its kings become Rangers in the wilds, but they retain their memory of N\u00famenor or \"Westernesse\", through many generations down to Aragorn, a protagonist in \"The Lord of the Rings\". The line of kings in Gondor eventually dies out, and the country is ruled by Stewards, the throne empty, until Aragorn returns.\nIntermarriage and immortality.\nTolkien stated that the core theme of \"The Lord of the Rings\" was death and the human desire to escape it. The theme, which recurs throughout the work, is sharply visible in an appendix, \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\", in which the immortal Elf Arwen chooses mortality so that she can marry the mortal Man Aragorn. The result, as with the earlier intermarriage of their ancestors L\u00fathien and Beren in the First Age in Beleriand, was to make Aragorn's line exceptionally long-lived among Men, and as the royal family intermarried with other people of Gondor, to maintain or extend the lifespan of the entire race.\nFading.\nThe overall feeling in \"The Lord of the Rings\", however, despite the victories and Aragorn's long-awaited kingship and marriage, is of decline and fall, echoing the view of Norse mythology that everything will inevitably be destroyed. As the Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns put it, \"Here is a mythology where even the gods can die, and it leaves the reader with a vivid sense of life's cycles, with an awareness that everything comes to an end, that, though [the evil] Sauron may go, the elves will fade as well.\" This fits with Tolkien's equation of Middle-earth with the real Earth at some distant epoch in the past, and with his apparent intention to create a mythology for England. He could combine medieval myths and legends, hints from poems and nearly-forgotten names to build a world of Wizards and Elves, Dwarves, Rings of Power, Hobbits, Orcs, Trolls and Ringwraiths, and heroic Men with Elvish blood in their veins, and follow their history through long ages, provided that at the end he tore it all down again, leaving nothing, once again, but dim memories. By the end of \"The Lord of the Rings\", the reader has learnt that the Elves have left for the Uttermost West, never to return, and that the other peoples, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ents and all the rest, are dwindling and fading, leaving only a world of Men.\nKocher writes that the furthest look into Man's future in \"The Lord of the Rings\" is the conversation between the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, close friends, at the moment when they first visit Minas Tirith, the capital city of the Men of Gondor, \"and see the marks of decay around them\". Gimli says that the works of Men always \"fail of their promise\"; Legolas replies that even if that's so, \"seldom do they fail of their seed\", in marked contrast to the scarcity of children among Elves and Dwarves, implying that Men will outlast the other races. Gimli suggests again that Men's projects \"come to naught in the end but might-have-beens\". Legolas just replies \"To that the Elves know not the answer\". Kocher comments that this \"sad little fugue\" is at variance with the hopeful tone of the rest of the work, remaining cheerful even in the face of apparently insuperable odds.\nAnalysis.\nAmbition for power.\nKocher writes that the Rings of Power reflected the characteristics of the race that was to wear them. Those for Men \"stimulated and implemented their ambition for power\". Whereas the tough Dwarves resisted Sauron's domination, and the Elves hid their Rings from him, with Men his plan \"works perfectly\", turning the ambitious kings into Ringwraiths, the nine Black Riders. With the One Ring to rule them, Sauron gains complete control over them, and they become his most powerful servants. Kocher comments that for Tolkien, the exercise of personal free will, the most precious gift, is \"the distinguishing mark of his individuality\". The wise, like the Wizard Gandalf and the Elf-queen Galadriel, therefore avoid putting pressure on anybody. In contrast, Sauron is evil exactly because he seeks to dominate the wills of others; the Ringwraiths, the nine fallen kings of Men, are the clearest exemplars of the process.\nKocher states that the leading Man in \"The Lord of the Rings\" is Aragorn, though critics often overlooked him in favour of Frodo as protagonist. Aragorn is one of two Men in the Fellowship of the Ring, the nine walkers from the Free Peoples opposed to the nine Black Riders. The other is Boromir, elder son of the Steward of Gondor, and the two Men are sharply opposed. Both are ambitious, and both intend one day to rule Gondor. Boromir means to fight valiantly, to save Gondor, with any help he can get, and to inherit the Stewardship. Aragorn knows he is in the line of kings by his ancestry, but he is unknown in Gondor. When they meet at the Council of Elrond, they dispute who has been holding back Sauron. Aragorn presents the shards of the broken sword of his ancestor, Elendil, and asks Boromir if he wants the House of Elendil (the line of kings) to return. Boromir evasively replies that he would welcome the sword. The One Ring is then shown to the Council. Boromir at once thinks of using it himself. Elrond explains how dangerous the Ring is; Boromir reluctantly sets the idea of using it aside for the moment, and suggests again that Elendil's sword might help save Gondor, if Aragorn is strong enough. Aragorn replies gracefully to the tactless suggestion. Kocher comments that by being both bold and tactful, Aragorn has won all that he wanted from Boromir: the sword is genuine, as is Aragorn's claim to own it, and he has been invited back to Gondor. The Fellowship set off, temporarily united; when they reach Parth Galen, Boromir tries to seize the Ring from Frodo, causing Frodo to use the Ring to escape; the Fellowship is scattered. Orcs attack, seeking the Ring; Boromir repents, and dies trying to save the Hobbits, an act which redeems him. Aragorn gives Boromir an honourable boat-funeral. The quest eventually succeeds, and Aragorn, growing in strength through many perils and wise decisions is crowned King. Boromir gave in to the temptation of power, and fell; Aragorn responded rightfully, and rose.\nRace.\nThe status of the friendly races has been debated by critics. David Ibata, writing in \"The Chicago Tribune\", asserts that the protagonists in \"The Lord of the Rings\" all have fair skin, and they are mainly blond-haired and blue-eyed as well. Ibata suggests that having the \"good guys\" white and their opponents of other races, in both book and film, is uncomfortably close to racism. The theologian Fleming Rutledge states that the leader of the Dr\u00faedain, Gh\u00e2n-buri-Gh\u00e2n, is treated as a noble savage. Michael N. Stanton writes in \"The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" that Hobbits were \"a distinctive form of human beings\", and notes that their speech contains \"vestigial elements\" which hint that they originated in the North of Middle-earth.\nThe scholar Margaret Sinex states that Tolkiens' construction of the Easterlings and Southrons draws on centuries of Christian tradition of creating an \"imaginary Saracen\". Zakarya Anwar judges that while Tolkien himself was anti-racist, his fantasy writings can certainly be taken the wrong way.\nWith his different races of Men arranged from good in the West to evil in the East, simple in the North and sophisticated in the South, Tolkien had, in the view of John Magoun, constructed a \"fully expressed moral geography\": Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South \"regresses into hot savagery\". The film-maker Andrew Stewart, writing in \"CounterPunch\", concurs that the geography of Middle-earth deliberately pits the good Men of the West against the evil Men and Orcs of the East. \nPeter Jackson, in his \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, clothes the Haradrim in long red robes and turbans, and has them riding their elephants, giving them the look in Ibata's opinion of \"North African or Middle Eastern tribesmen\". Ibata notes that the film companion book, \"The Lord of the Rings: Creatures\", describes them as \"exotic outlanders\" inspired by \"12th century Saracen warriors\". Jackson's Easterling soldiers are covered in armour, revealing only their \"coal-black eyes\" through their helmet's eye-slits. Ibata comments that they look Asian, their headgear recalling both Samurai helmets and conical \"Coolie\" hats.\nFrom \"clod\" to hero.\nThe Tolkien scholar Deborah C. Rogers compares the Men of \"The Lord of the Rings\" with the Hobbits. She notes that the Hobbits are to an extent the low, simple, earthbound \"clods\" of the story who like beer and comfort and do not wish to go on adventures; they fit the antihero of modern literature and Northrop Frye's lower literary modes including various forms of humour. \nIn contrast, Tolkien's Men are not all of a piece: Rogers mentions the \"petty villain\", Bill Ferny; the \"loathsome\" Grima Wormtongue; the \"slow-thinking\" publican Barliman Butterbur of Bree; \"that portrait of damnation\", Denethor, Steward of Gondor; and at the upper end of the scale, the kingly Th\u00e9oden, brought back to life from Wormtongue's corruption; the \"gentle warrior\" Faramir and his brother the hero-villain Boromir; and finally the ranger Aragorn, who becomes king.\nAragorn is the opposite of hobbitish: tall, not provincial, untroubled by the discomforts of the wild. At the start, in Bree, he appears as a Ranger of the North, a weatherbeaten man named Strider. Gradually the reader discovers he is heir to the throne of Gondor, engaged to be married to Arwen, an Elf-woman. Equipped with a named magical sword, he emerges as an unqualified hero, in Frye's \"High Mimetic\" or \"Romantic\" literary mode, making the whole novel indeed a heroic romance: he regains his throne, marries Arwen, and has a long, peaceful, and happy reign.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63459", "revid": "1310473062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63459", "title": "Great River Road", "text": "Tourist route from Venice, Louisiana, to Lake Itasca, Minnesota\nThe Great River Road is a collection of state and local roads that follow the course of the Mississippi River. It begins at Lake Itasca, Minnesota, and passes through Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi, before terminating in Venice, Louisiana. It formerly extended north into Canada, serving the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. The road is designated as both a National Scenic Byway and an All-American Road in several states along the route.\nThe term \"Great River Road\" refers both to a series of roadways and to a larger region inside the US and in each state, used for tourism and historic purposes. Some states have designated or identified regions of state interest along the road and use the roads to encompass those regions.\nIt is divided into two main sections: the Great River Road and the National Scenic Byway Route. The eponymous segment runs on both sides of the river from Louisiana through the state borders of Kentucky/Illinois and Missouri/Iowa, excepting the full length of the road in Arkansas. A five-state section of the road has been designated a National Scenic Byway, running through Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In 2021, eight of the 10 state routes were designated All-American Roads by the Federal Highway Administration, highlighting their national significance and one-of-a-kind features.\nDeveloped in 1938, the road took 30 years of planning until it was built. It has a separate commission in each state. These in turn cooperate through the Mississippi River Parkway Commission (MRPC). The 2,340 miles (3,765\u00a0km) are designated with a green-and-white sign showing a river steamboat inside a pilotwheel with the name of the state or province. The over-all logo reads \"Canada to Gulf\" where the local name would be, and most MRPC publications denote the route as beginning at Lake Itasca in Minnesota and ending in Louisiana.\nRoute description.\nThe Great River Road is not a single road but a designated route along connected segments of named and numbered highways and streets maintained by state, county, or local jurisdictions.\nNational and other routes.\nUntil the early 1980s, a single Canada-to-Gulf alignment of the Great River Road, serving all ten states, was eligible for special federal funding. The states posted \"National Route\" plates above the markers on this route and marked their own alternate routes across the river, creating two alignments between New Orleans and Hastings-Point Douglas. Signs marking the National Route are now used only in Illinois and Minnesota. The National Route followed the following segments:\nMore recently, much of the Great River Road, including a portion in every state, has been designated a National Scenic Byway.\nWestern route.\nFew if any signs are present in Louisiana, but the route has been defined by state law. It begins at Venice on the west bank, following LA 23 into Gretna, where the eastern route splits. The western route, historically part of the National Route here, turns west on LA 18, which it follows all the way to Donaldsonville except for a detour on LA 541 from Harvey to Bridge City. A short piece of LA 1 connects the Great River Road to LA 405, which hugs the river to another junction with LA 1 in Plaquemine. LA 988 loops off LA 1 from northern Plaquemine back to yet another junction south of Port Allen, where the route leaves LA 1 again on Oaks Avenue, which becomes LA 987-5 and turns north along the river on River Road. LA 987-4 (Court Street) leads back west to Jefferson Avenue, which the Great River Road follows north to LA 986 along the river and under the Huey P. Long Bridge (US 190), which carries the National Route to the east bank (with access via LA 987-1).\nA state alternate route begins along LA 986, becoming LA 415 near Lobdell and continuing along the river to Hermitage. LA 416 takes the route inland along the False River, an oxbow lake, to LA 1 near Knapp. LA 1 is followed through New Roads to Keller, where LA 15 splits to continue along the river to southwest of Vidalia. LA 131 leads northeast to Vidalia, from which US 425 and US 65 take the Great River Road to Arkansas.\nThe Great River Road enters Arkansas from Louisiana on US 65, which it follows to Dumas. The National Route enters the state on the Greenville Bridge (originally the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge from 1940 to its replacement in 2010 by the current bridge), following US 82 to join US 65 near Lake Village. There it turns northeast on US 165, splitting onto Highway 1 in DeWitt until an intersection near Turner. The route follows a sequence of minor state highways: Highway 316 east, Highway 318 south, and Highway 20 east to Elaine, and Highway 44 northeast to Helena. It then uses short segments of Highway 20 and US 49 to reach US 49B into downtown Helena, where it leaves the state highway system, following Columbia, McDonough, and Holly Streets through a residential area. Between Helena and Bear Creek Lake, the Great River Road runs along County Road 239, a partially unpaved roadway hugging the east side of Crowley's Ridge through the St. Francis National Forest. Highway 44 begins again at Bear Creek Lake and takes the route northwest across Crowley's Ridge into Marianna, where it turns north on Poplar Street, west on Chestnut Street, and north on US 79. At Hughes, the Great River Road leaves US 79 and turns east on Highway 38, then north on Highway 147 around the north shore of Horseshoe Lake and on to US 70 at Lehi. US 70 leads east into West Memphis, where the National Route historically crossed the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge. The final leg of Arkansas's Great River Road turns north at West Memphis and uses Highway 77 and US 61 north into Missouri.\nThe Great River Road is marked entirely along state-maintained highways in Missouri, with more than half along US 61. Although plates for the National Route are not used in the state, it can be identified based on signage in Illinois.\nA state alternate route enters the state from Arkansas and follows US 61, including two overlaps with I-55, all the way to Perryville. The National Route crosses the Mississippi from Illinois on the Chester Bridge, following Route 51 south to Perryville and then turning north along US 61. At exit 170 south of Festus, the Great River Road joins I-55, following that highway into St. Louis and using I-44 and I-70 to exit 220 on the St. Peters-O'Fallon border. From there the National Route follows the entire length of Route 79 to I-72 in Hannibal, where it crosses the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge back to Illinois. A second state alternate begins in Hannibal by running west on I-72 to its end at US 61, then turning north on US 61. It follows Route 168 to Palmyra, rejoining US 61 for the rest of its path to Iowa, except for the portion through La Grange and Canton, where the Great River Road uses the former alignment of US 61, now Route B.\nAs with Missouri, the National Route in Iowa can mostly be inferred by Illinois signage. On the other hand, the Great River Road uses a number of county and local roads in Iowa.\nA state alternate route crosses the Des Moines River from Missouri into Keokuk, following US 136 into downtown. It follows a convoluted alignment, turning southeast on Main Street (still US 136), northeast on 4th Street, northwest on Orleans Avenue, northeast on 7th Street, northwest on Grand Avenue, and northeast on Rand Park Terrace, curving northwest onto the river-hugging Mississippi River Road (CR X28 and CR X21) through Montrose to US 61. US 61 and US 61 Business lead through Fort Madison to the Fort Madison Bridge and the entrance of the National Route into Iowa.\nThe National Route returns to US 61 via US 61 Business, splitting to follow CR X62 and Madison Avenue into Burlington. It turns east onto Main Drive through Crapo Park and curves back north on Main Street, which leads to CR X99 (former Iowa 99) to north of Toolesboro and CR X61 into Muscatine. After turning onto US 61 Business, the National Route leaves the state on the Norbert F. Beckey Bridge (Iowa 92).\nA second state alternate route continues on US 61 Business, turning east to follow Iowa 22 along the river to Davenport. It follows another US 61 Business through that city and US 67 through Bettendorf, remaining on that highway until Sabula where it then follows US 52 north. After passing over the Great River Road Bridge in Bellevue the route reaches US 20 in Dubuque.\nThe National Route reenters Iowa on the Julien Dubuque Bridge (US 20), turning north onto Iowa 946 to reach US 52. In northern Sageville, the Great River Road turns north on CR C9Y, soon splitting onto Mud Lake Road, which, along with Circle Ridge Road, forms a loop back to CR C9Y in Sherrill. In Millville, the county road returns to US 52, which is followed into Guttenberg. As of 2012, the route through that city leaves US 52 east on Koerner Street, turning north on River Park Drive, west on Broadway Street, north on 2nd Street, west on Kosciusko Street, north on 3rd Street and through the municipal marina to CR X56. The Great River Road follows the entire length of CR X56 (including former Iowa 340) to McGregor, and then continues north on Iowa 76 and CR X52 (partly former Iowa 364) to Lansing, where the National Route crosses the Black Hawk Bridge (Iowa 9) to Wisconsin.\nFinally, Iowa 26 carries a state alternate from Lansing north to the Minnesota state line at New Albin.\nThe Great River Road enters Minnesota on MN 26, connecting to US 61 in La Crescent via a short piece of MN 16. Except for a detour onto MN 316, US 61 carries this state alternate route to its junction with the National Route in Hastings.\nEastern route.\nA state alternate route begins in Gretna and crosses the Crescent City Connection (US 90 Business) into New Orleans. Tchoupitoulas Street leads along the river to Audubon Park, with Magazine Street, Leake Avenue, and Oak Street continuing from the other side of the park to the city line. In Jefferson Parish, the road becomes River Road (partly LA 611-1), from which the Great River Road jogs northwest on Hickory Street to LA 48. LA 48 hugs the river to Norco, where US 61 crosses the Bonnet Carre Spillway to LA 628, connecting in LaPlace to LA 636-3 and LA 44. Another river-hugging highway, LA 44 leads to Burnside, where LA 942 continues to Darrow; the route then follows LA 75, LA 991, and LA 327 around the curves of the river to Baton Rouge. Through that city, the Great River Road uses LA 30, Government Street, River Road (partly US 61 Business), State Capitol Drive, Third Street, Spanish Town Road, Fifth Street, and Capitol Access Road (LA 3045) to I-110. At the Airline Highway interchange on I-110, the National Route comes over the Huey P. Long Bridge (US 190) and turns north to follow I-110 and US 61 into Mississippi.\nIn January 1811, there was a rebellion of several hundred enslaved and free black people referred to as the 1811 German Coast uprising, beginning in St. John the Baptist Parish and continuing on a route through lower Louisiana toward New Orleans. A Louisiana militia countered the rebellion, the largest revolt of enslaved persons in United States history. Afterward, there were trials on the plantations and executions of the majority involved in the revolt. The heads of many of those executed were placed on spikes along the Great River Road.\nSome sources show the Great River Road continuing south from New Orleans along the east bank on LA 46 and LA 39 to Pointe \u00e0 la Hache or even further down to Venice.\nIn Mississippi, much of the Great River Road follows US 61. Between Onward and west of Lula, it runs nearer to the river on MS 1. The routing in the vicinity of Lula is not marked; the only state-maintained road connecting to US 61 is US 49. Historically, the National Route turned off MS 1 at Greenville and followed US 82 to the Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge (replaced by the Greenville Bridge in 2010).\nThe Great River Road enters Tennessee on US 61, following that highway along 3rd Street into Downtown Memphis. The National Route historically crossed the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge, meeting 3rd Street at Crump Boulevard. The route follows a number of city streets along the riverfront: G.E. Patterson Avenue, Main Street, Beale Street, Riverside Drive, Jefferson Avenue, Front Street (passing the Pyramid), the A.W. Willis Bridge, Island Drive, Mud Island Drive, Second Street, and Whitney Avenue, joining US 51 in northern Memphis. It soon turns off on SR 388, and then follows a sequence of local roads past Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park: Locke Cuba Road, Bluff Road, Riverbluff Road, Herring Hill Road (which is partly unpaved), Pryor Road, and Richardson Landing Road. At Richardsons the route turns east with SR 59 to Covington, then runs north on US 51.\nAfter crossing the Hatchie River on its westernmost bridge, the Great River Road again leaves US 51 at Henning, looping west on SR 87, north on partly unpaved Crutcher Lake Road (past Fort Pillow State Park) and Four Mile Lane, and east on SR 19 to rejoin US 51 at Ripley. It leaves US 51 for the last time at Halls, following SR 88 west to near Hales Point, turning north on SR 181 atop a levee to SR 79 near Cottonwood Grove. The route continues north, slightly east of the levee, along Hoecake Road, Robison Bayou Road, Bingham Road, Mooring Road, and SR 21 into Tiptonville. The Great River Road ends its Tennessee stretch by following SR 78 to the state line.\nThe Great River Road's National Route enters Kentucky from Tennessee on KY 94 and runs northeast and east through Hickman. At Cayce it turns north to follow KY 239, continuing on KY 123 from west of Clinton through Columbus to the Bardwell area. There two routes are signed, one following KY 123 to Bardwell and the other bypassing the city to the west on KY 1203. The last leg in Kentucky takes US 51 to the bridge across the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois.\nSigns are present for an alternate route that runs inland through Fulton, Clinton, and Arlington along KY 125, KY 166, KY 1648, US 51, and KY 80. It leaves the main route at Hickman and ends north of Columbus.\nPortions of the Great River Road in Illinois are signed as the National Route, while other portions lack this banner. National Route signs continue to Mississippi River bridges, with the unbannered alternate routes spurring from these before the crossings. A number of spurs are also signed to parks and other points of interest off the main route.\nThe initial segment in Illinois is part of the National Route, entering from Kentucky at Cairo and leaving at Chester. It follows US 51 off the Cairo Ohio River Bridge through Cairo, and then IL 3 paralleling the river to near Chester. Before entering Chester city limits, the route turns west onto a signed truck bypass that runs closer to the river. It ends by turning southwest onto the Chester Bridge (IL 150) to Missouri.\nThe first section of unbannered route stretches from Chester to near Fall Creek. It begins at the approach to the Chester Bridge, following IL 150 and the remainder of the truck bypass back to IL 3, which carries the Great River Road all the way to East St. Louis. But instead of continuing along IL 3 through the riverside industrial areas, the route turns east on I-55 / I-70, north on IL 111, and back west on I-270 to rejoin IL 3 in Granite City. It soon leaves IL 3 for the last time to follow IL 143 into downtown Alton and then a short piece of US 67 to reach IL 100, which runs directly along the river for a significant distance before turning inland at Grafton. Rather than cross the Illinois River on the Brussels Ferry, the Great River Road remains with IL 100 alongside the Illinois River, first on the east side to the Hardin Bridge and then on the west side to Kampsville. There it turns west to rejoin the Mississippi River, following IL 96 to north of Hull and former IL 57 to the I-172 interchange near Fall Creek.\nThe National Route reenters Illinois on the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge (I-72) from Hannibal, Missouri and follows I-172 north to the IL 57 interchange, where the unbannered route from Chester ends. It follows extant IL 57 into Quincy and then US 24 and IL 96 to a point east of Warsaw, turning west onto that city's Main Street and leaving to the northeast on 6th Street. A short jog east on US 136 in Hamilton returns the Great River Road to IL 96, which it follows, mostly right along the river, through Nauvoo to Niota. The National Route turns northwest there on IL 9 to the Fort Madison Bridge into Fort Madison, Iowa.\nIL 96 continues to carry the unbannered route beyond Niota to Lomax, where IL 96 turns inland and the Great River Road follows Carman Road to US 34 near Gulfport. After following US 34 east to near Gladstone, it again turns north onto IL 164 through Oquawka, turning north just east of that village onto a county road that becomes 10th Street in Keithsburg. Main Street leads west to 4th Street and another county road, ending up on IL 17 west of Joy. Finally, after 2.5 miles (4\u00a0km) of travel west on IL 17 to a point north of New Boston, a third north\u2013south county road (designated as CR A in Rock Island County) takes Great River Road traffic to IL 92 opposite Muscatine, Iowa.\nThe National Route reenters from Muscatine, following IL 92 east through the Quad Cities except for a detour onto County Road TT east of Illinois City. On the East Moline-Silvis border, the Great River Road turns back north along IL 84, which stays near the river most of the way to a point southeast of Galena. US 20 carries the route through Galena to East Dubuque, where the National Route crosses the river one last time into Dubuque, Iowa on the Julien Dubuque Bridge. No route is signed on the Illinois side of the Mississippi north of East Dubuque, although Wisconsin Highway 35 has Great River Road markers all the way to the state line (at IL 35).\nWIS 35, which hugs Wisconsin's western border, carries most of the Great River Road in that state from its entrance near East Dubuque, Illinois. The longest separation from WIS 35 is between Tennyson and a point south of Bridgeport, where WIS 35 heads inland through Lancaster and the Great River Road follows WIS 133 to Cassville, County VV and County A to Bagley, and County X and County C to return to WIS 35. The historic National Route entered Wisconsin on the Black Hawk Bridge (WIS 82), turning north on WIS 35 near De Soto. US 61 and US 53 take the route through downtown La Crosse, which WIS 35 bypasses to the east, and it follows WIS 35 Business in Holmen. Finally, at Prescott, the Great River Road turns west on US 10 across the St. Croix River on the Prescott Drawbridge into Minnesota.\nOn entering Minnesota, the east-side alignment of the Great River Road (here signed as the National Route) follows US 10 west and US 61 south across the Mississippi on the Hastings Bridge into Hastings, where it joins with the west-side alignment.\nThe two sides of the Great River Road combine at the south end of the Hastings Bridge (US 61) in Hastings, Minnesota, with a single route (marked as the National Route) continuing to the headwaters at Lake Itasca. The route leaves Hastings to the west by following County 42, which begins along 2nd Street, west to the junction with MN 55. MN 55 turns north as it merges with US 52, and the Great River Road soon splits onto County 56 (former MN 56) into South St. Paul. There it follows I-494 east across the Mississippi on the Wakota Bridge and again turns north on US 10 / US 61, soon entering St. Paul. Shepard Road/Warner Road (mostly County 36 and 37) takes the route west along the St. Paul riverfront to I-35E, where it turns back south and recrosses the Mississippi on the Lexington Bridge. MN 13 takes it to Mendota, at which point it crosses the Minnesota River near its mouth on the Mendota Bridge (MN 55) and passes Fort Snelling. After MN 55 enters Minneapolis, the Great River Road turns east on 46th Street (County 46), south on Minnehaha Avenue, and east on Godfrey Parkway to reach the south end of the West River Parkway, a segment of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. This scenic drive parallels the west bank of the Mississippi through downtown Minneapolis, becoming West River Road at the Plymouth Avenue Bridge and ending at the Broadway Avenue Bridge (County 66). After crossing the Mississippi again, the Great River Road turns north on Marshall Street (County 23) and East River Road (County 1), then turns back west to cross the Mississippi one last time in the Twin Cities area on the I-694 Bridge. From there to Champlin (opposite Anoka), it sticks to the old pre-freeway route of US 169 as much as possible, taking MN 252 north to Brookdale Drive and jogging east to West River Road, which leads to County 12 into Champlin.\nCounty 12 continues along the Mississippi, becoming County 42 in Wright County. The route jogs north on MN 101 and then turns west on County 39 along the river to Monticello. There it picks up former MN 152 (which has been supplanted by I-94), now known as County 75 to St. Cloud. Through that city, the Great River Road follows Clearwater Road and 9th Avenue, crossing the Mississippi into Sauk Rapids on the Sauk Rapids Regional Bridge. County 33 (Benton Drive) leads to Sartell and another river crossing, the Sartell Bridge (County 29 / County 133), from which it uses the short County 78 to reach County 1. This road and its continuations in Morrison County - County 21, 25, and 52 - follow the west bank of the Mississippi to Little Falls, where it jogs east on MN 27 to County 213, which ends at MN 115 at the Camp Ripley entrance. The Camp Ripley Bridge takes MN 115 east to its terminus at MN 371, which the Great River Road follows north to Baxter, crossing the Mississippi at the south city limits.\nAs of 2010, the route through Baxter left MN 371 at College Drive, heading east back over the Mississippi on the College Drive Bridge into Brainerd. There it turned north on East River Road, east on Laurel Street, north on 6th Street (MN 371 Business), east on MN 210, and north on 8th Avenue (County 3). However, the left turn from College Drive onto East River Road is no longer permitted due to a reconstruction project.\nThe Great River Road leaves Brainerd to the north on County 3 (former MN 25), crossing the Mississippi again at the city limits. North of Merrifield it turns east on County 19, which leads to County 11 and then MN 6 south across the Mississippi and into Crosby. MN 210 leads east to Aitkin, where the route turns back to the north on County 1 and crosses the river yet again, then follows the unpaved County 21 and County 10 (separated by a bit of US 169) to Palisade. County 10 continues as a paved road from that city, north across MN 200 near Jacobson and northwest to Grand Rapids (becoming County 3 in Itasca County). The Great River Road does not cross the river in the Grand Rapids area, turning south on 7th Avenue, west on 10th Street and County 23, north on County 76, and west on County 63. At MN 6 the route jogs south to County 28, where it turns west and soon enters Cass County as County 65. Several more turns\u2014north on County 74, west on County 3, and north to remain on County 3\u2014take it to another Mississippi crossing onto County 18, from which it turns west on US 2 into Ball Club. County 39 and a bit of MN 46 lead to County 9, which runs southwest across the river at the Lake Winnibigoshish outlet and back to US 2, where it turns west to and beyond Bena.\nFrom Bena to Bemidji, the Great River Road follows a large number of county roads that approximate the winding course of the Mississippi. These are, in order, 91, 54, 91, 10, 39 (bridge across the Mississippi near the Cass Lake outlet), 12, 33 (bridge between Allens Bay and Andrusia Lake), 8 (bridge between Andrusia Lake and Wolf Lake), 27, and 12 (yet another bridge). The route turns west onto 1st Street to reach MN 197, which crosses the river again into downtown Bemidji, where it turns west on 5th Street. That road continues west and south as County 7 (with yet another bridge), County 3, and County 10, from which the Great River Road again turns west on County 9, which becomes County 40 in Clearwater County and crosses the river yet again. Turning south on County 2, the route crosses the Mississippi River one last time before it crosses MN 200 and enters Itasca State Park on County 122.\nCanadian extensions.\nThe Great River Road formerly continued north into Canada. There were two routes, one from Bemidji into Ontario and the other from Lake Itasca into Manitoba. The former followed US 71 to the Fort Frances\u2013International Falls International Bridge, then Highway 71 to Longbow Corners on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 17) east of Kenora. Some sources indicate that it continued east on Highway 17 to Dryden or north on Highway 596 to Minaki. The other route followed MN 200 west from Lake Itasca to Zerkel, then ran north on MN 92 to Clearbrook, County 5 and BIA 3 to the shore of Lower Red Lake, MN 89 to Roseau, and east on MN 11 to Warroad. Crossing into Manitoba on MN 313, the Great River Road then followed Highway 12 north to near Ste. Anne, Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) to Winnipeg, and Highway 59 to near Victoria Beach, where it turned southeast on Highway 11 to near Seven Sisters Falls, Provincial Road 307 to near Rennie, Highway 44 to near West Hawk Lake, and finally east on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highways 1 and 17) to join the Ontario branch at Kenora.\nHistory.\nThe Mississippi River Parkway Planning Commission was formed in 1938 to develop plans for what was to become the Great River Road. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes urged the governors of the 10 states along the Mississippi River to form the commission. State planning officials had been developing the concept of a Mississippi River Parkway as an extension of an idea for a recreational river road that had been first put forward by the Missouri Planning Board in 1936.\nThe commission was instrumental not only in the early planning and development of the parkway but also in its construction, promotion, marketing, and development. (Now known as the Mississippi River Parkway Commission and headquartered in Minneapolis, the commission continues to promote, preserve, and enhance the resources of the Mississippi River Valley and the Great River Road. Representatives of the 10 states and two Canadian provinces serve on the commission's board of directors, and they serve as chairpersons of their state Mississippi River Parkway commissions.)\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Public Lands held hearings in 1939 and 1940 to discuss a bill that would have authorized a feasibility study of the Mississippi River Parkway concept. While popular, the parkway idea was soon overshadowed by World War II.\nIt wasn't until 1949 that Congress approved funding for a feasibility study. The study, \"Parkway for the Mississippi River\", was completed by the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) (predecessor agency to the Federal Highway Administration) in 1951.\nThe study concluded that a parkway for the Mississippi River would benefit the nation as a whole. However, the report made an important distinction. Because it would be too expensive to build an entirely new parkway, BPR recommended instead that the project be designated a scenic route.\nThe scenic route would consist of existing riverside roads, and new construction would be limited to connecting the existing roads so that a continuous route could be developed. The existing roads would be upgraded to parkway quality. The modified approach would save a great deal of land acquisition and new construction costs. Another consideration was that some of the most scenic locations along the river had already been preempted by existing highways, railroads, and towns and cities.\nThe concept of a scenic route rather than a national parkway was adopted. As a result, the Great River Road is not owned by the National Park Service, as is the case with true national parkways, such as the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways. Instead, the states have developed the Great River Road through a nationally coordinated program. BPR recommended \"that the selected route shall be improved in a superior manner and that it should be dedicated to recreational purposes as well as to moving traffic\". The needed construction and improvements \"can be done with regular apportionments under the federal highway act or by the states on their own...\"\nWith the Federal Highway Act of 1954, Congress responded to the recommendations of BPR by appropriating planning funds. BPR was authorized to work with each of the states to develop specific criteria for the parkway and to determine one specific route within each state for the Mississippi River Parkway. By the late 1950s, the familiar green-and-white pilot's wheel marker began to spring up on various sections of the designated route. Planning continued through the 1960s. The 1961 Iowa highway map was the first map in that state to highlight the route.\nWith the completion of all the planning reports in early 1970, actual development of the Great River Road was ready to begin. Although a number of states put up Great River Road highway signs and used available state funds for scenic bluff protection and road improvements, full-scale development funds were not yet available. Legislation to fund the development of the Great River Road was included for the first time as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973. From 1973 to 1982, Congress authorized a total of $314 million for the Great River Road. Most of those funds ($251 million) were allocated directly to the states.\nWith funds available, development could begin in earnest. In 1976, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued program guidelines setting criteria for the Great River Road. The states then set up their own procedures for selecting the route of the Great River Road within their state boundaries.\n\"The Great River Road should be located within designated segments to take advantage of scenic views and provide the traveler with the opportunity to enjoy the unique features of the Mississippi River and its recreational opportunities\", the guidelines said. The criteria also specified that the Great River Road should provide for a variety of experiences or themes, including history, geology, and culture, and that the road should provide convenient access to larger population centers. Protection of the Mississippi River corridor was required by \"appropriate route selection, effective control and development, and scenic easement acquisition\".\nThe route of the federal Great River Road consists of sections that conform to the FHWA guidelines and that were eligible for the Great River Road funds in the 1970s and early 1980s. The states have designated alternative routes that include sections with significant scenic, historic, and recreational interest. While the federal Great River Road crisscrosses the river within each state, the alternative routes provide Great River Road routes on both sides of the river from the headwaters to the gulf. The Mississippi River Parkway Commission makes no distinction between the federal and state routes in its promotional efforts. However, some states do use highway signs that distinguish between a federal and state route.\nIn 2021, eight of the 10 state Great River Road National Scenic Byways were named All-American Roads by the Federal Highway Administration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63461", "revid": "4626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63461", "title": "Goldberry", "text": "Fictional character from Middle-Earth\nGoldberry is a character from the works of the author J. R. R. Tolkien. She first appeared in print in a 1934 poem, \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", where she appears as the wife of Tom Bombadil. Also known as the \"River-woman's daughter\", she is described as a beautiful, youthful woman with golden hair. She is best known from her appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien's high fantasy epic \"The Lord of the Rings\", first published in 1954 and 1955. \nLike her husband, Goldberry's role and origins are enigmatic and have been debated by scholars. On her possible origins, scholars have compared her with a character in George MacDonald's 1867 fairy tale \"The Golden Key\", and with the eponymous character in the late-medieval lyric poem \"The Maid of the Moor\". Her characterisation has been described as a mixture of the domestic and the supernatural, connected in some way with the river Withywindle in the Old Forest of Middle-earth. Some have suggested that she may be a divine being in Tolkien's mythology; others, that she recalls the biblical Eve, a token of the unfallen creation; and an embodiment of joy, serving with Tom Bombadil as a model of the Catholic sacrament of marriage.\nBoth Bombadil and Goldberry were omitted from Peter Jackson's film trilogy; they were, however, included in the 1991 Russian television play \"Khraniteli\" and the second season of \"\".\nOrigins.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien never explored the specific details regarding Goldberry's origins. Tom Bombadil says that he discovered her in the river Withywindle within the Old Forest, and her title \"River-woman's daughter\" strongly suggests that she is not a mortal human being. In a 1958 letter, Tolkien wrote that Goldberry \"represents the actual seasonal changes\" in \"real river-lands in autumn\". He conveyed this notion through a poem recited by Frodo Baggins in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", specifically the lines \"O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!\" \nFor the scholar of literature Isabelle Pantin, the sequence involving Goldberry in \"The Lord of the Rings\" is reminiscent of a passage from \"The Golden Key\" by George MacDonald: the heroine, Tangle, after having almost been suffocated by a tree believing herself being pursued by the bears of Goldilocks, is taken in by a kindly old lady dressed in a mermaid's finery and holding a basin full of fish. Pantin noted that Goldberry herself is reminiscent of the Goldilocks character: she has a similar hairstyle and her house appears to be as comfortable as that of the bears.\nThe Tolkien scholar John M. Bowers writes that Goldberry recalls \"The Maid of the Moor\", a late-medieval lyric familiar to Tolkien which contains the lines\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAppearances.\nGoldberry first appeared in Tolkien's 1934 poem, \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", re-worked into a 1962 poetry collection of the same name. The poem tells of how she drags Tom into the river before he escapes, returning later to capture her and make her his bride. \nIn \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", the first volume of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Frodo and his companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin encounter Goldberry and Tom in the Old Forest near Buckland. After the Hobbits are rescued from Old Man Willow, the couple offers them refuge in their cottage, which is surrounded by a pond of water lilies. The hobbits' stay is brief but strange, for Bombadil and Goldberry are clearly more than they seem. Like her earlier incarnation, Goldberry retains a link with nature, and more particularly running water. She is described as having a mermaid adornment on her hair, her gown \"rustled softly like the wind on the flowered banks of a river\" as she ran, and the songs she sings to the hobbits remind them of \"ponds and waters larger than they had ever known.\"\nGoldberry's final reference in Tolkien's works prior to his death is in the poem \"Once Upon a Time\", published in 1965. Described as wearing \"a wild-rose crown\", she blows away a dandelion clock from within a lady-smock.\nAnalysis.\nType of being.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHer long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feet in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.\n \u2014 \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", book 1, ch. 7, \"In the House of Tom Bombadil\"\nGoldberry does not fit easily into any of Tolkien's definitions of sentient beings in his world, and like Tom Bombadil she remains an enigma. With regards to Goldberry's true nature within the context of Middle-earth, the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggested that Goldberry is similar to the many named water spirits of traditional English folklore such as Jenny Greenteeth or Peg Powler of the River Tees, though she is a noticeably gentler figure than they are. The scholar Ann McCauley believed that she is likely a water sprite, while John D. Rateliff suggested that, at least within the context of Tolkien's early mythology, she should be seen as one of the wide category of fays, spirits, and elementals.\nGoldberry's association with water, writes Leo Carruthers, thematically links Bombadil with V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen and his fianc\u00e9e Aino from the \"Kalevala\", the Finnish national epic. \nThe scholar Ruth Noel calls Bombadil and Goldberry \"undisguised personifications of land untouched by humans\".\nAnother proposed explanation is that she is one of the Ainur, specifically the Vala Yavanna. There are physical similarities between Goldberry and Yavanna: both characters have blond hair and dress in green, and are associated with the plant kingdom, which would make Tom Bombadil an avatar of Aul\u00eb, husband of Yavanna. Taryne Jade Taylor associates Goldberry with the Greek myth of the goddess Persephone, for the way she is captured by Bombadil and its association with the rhythm of the seasons, as well as \u00c9ta\u00edn, a deity in Irish mythology associated with light. For Christina Ljungberg, Goldberry is one of the three divinities of personified Nature that exist on the side of good: she represents the immanent goddess, while Elbereth or Varda represents the transcendent goddess, and the elf queen Galadriel combines these two aspects. \nGender role.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGoldberry, with the smooth and kind way she relates to her odd husband Tom Bombadil and through her elegance, accomplishment, and connection to the natural world, brings much needed peace to Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". She seeks nothing, longs for nothing, yet appreciates and nurtures everything and everyone around her. \n \u2014 Katherine Hasser, \"\"\nIn the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", Katherine Hasser observed that Goldberry appeared to the hobbits in the diverse roles of \"goddess, nurturer, and manager of domestic responsibilities\". With regards to her initial appearance, Hasser said Tolkien's description evokes a \"Botticelli-like image of a woman embodied and surrounded by the natural characteristics of her environment\", and her clothing reflects her peaceful, symbiotic connection with the natural world. \nGoldberry is sometimes discussed in critical commentary about the roles of women in \"The Lord of the Rings\". She is presented as a hospitable domestic figure, a good hostess who feeds passing travellers. While the scholar of children's literature Melissa McCrory Hatcher called her \"a mystical washer-woman\", Hasser emphasized that the most significant point about Goldberry as a feminine figure is that she shares a cooperative and reciprocal domestic relationship with Bombadil, with a dynamic of equality that is not seen in other romantic pairings in Tolkien's body of work as the other Middle-earth peoples often have a clearer separation of gender roles within their societies. Hasser noted that Goldberry is the sole female character in \"The Lord of the Rings\" who does not have a personal agenda, and that she provides a feminine figure who is \"pure, content, significant to the world around her, and wise\" in its narrative.\nTheological role.\nFor several critics, the appearance of Goldberry in \"The Lord of the Rings\" foreshadows that of Galadriel's later appearance: both are beautiful and of regal stature, live in an isolated domain and are associated with water. Ann McCauley Basso compared Goldberry as a biblical Eve figure to Galadriel's Mary. In an entry on redemption in mythopoeic writing by the Catholic writer Joseph Pearce for the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", the apparent innocence and primitive nature of Goldberry and Tom Bombadil is analogous to Adam and Eve, as they represent the \"Unfallen Creation\".\nSacrament of marriage.\nThe scholar Brandon Best sees Goldberry's relationship to Tom Bombadil as a model of the sacrament of marriage, something to be witnessed rather than explained. Further, they sing of all creation, celebrating the natural order, and they include themselves as part of that order, with Goldberry's song:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRobert Chapman-Morales notes that scholars such as L. Eugene Startzman and Jennifer Raimundo see Goldberry and Bombadil as embodiments of unexpected joy, an aspect of Tolkien's eucatastrophe. He quotes one of Tolkien's letters: \"the government of a 'family' ... was not a monarchy ... It was a 'dyarchy', in which master and mistress had equal status, if different functions.\" He notes also that Basso describes the couple's marital joy, and he remarks on their \"mutual respect when we see how different they are, yet how perfectly they work together\".\nAdaptations.\nRadio.\nIn a twelve-part radio adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" which ran from 1955 to 1956, the producer Terence Tiller wrote Goldberry as Tom Bombadil's daughter. This alteration annoyed Tolkien, though he conceded that the events described in the 1934 poem are not clearly summarized in the published version of \"The Lord of the Rings\". \nThe chapters involving the Old Forest and its characters were omitted from Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell's 1981 radio adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\". In 1992, Sibley produced a radio series, \"Tales from the Perilous Realm\", which featured short texts by Tolkien; the episode \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" covered \"The Lord of the Rings\" chapters cut from the 1981 adaptation, including those about the Old Forest. Goldberry is voiced by Sorcha Cusack for the adaptation. \nFilm.\nIn 1957 Tolkien was consulted about a cartoon of \"The Lord of the Rings\", its first proposed cinematic treatment. On the subject of Goldberry, he said he would much rather that she be omitted from the adaptation than make a cameo appearance without context or meaning. The film director Peter Jackson omitted Goldberry and Bombadil from his films; he stated that this was because they did little to advance the story and would have made the films unnecessarily long. \nOnly one adaptation includes Goldberry, the 1991 Russian \"Khraniteli\", where she is portrayed by Regina Lialeikite (as \"Zolotinka\"). The version uses a green screen technique to present her as much larger than the hobbits dining at her table.\nGoldberry is portrayed by Raya Yarbrough in the second season of \".\nGames and other media.\nAlong with Bombadil, Goldberry appears as a non-player character in the 2002 video game \", where she is voiced by Kath Soucie.\nGoldberry appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game \"The Lord of the Rings Online\". She is found in \"Goldberry's Glade\" in the Old Forest, where a quest to gather lilies on her behalf at the foot of Old Man Willow is given to the player by Bombadil. Her race is referred to as \"River-maid\", as the game also features Goldberry's sister Naruhel, an original character who is of a darker and crueller nature.\nThe 1969 \"Harvard Lampoon\" novel \"Bored of the Rings\" depicts a parody character named \"Hashberry\", partner to the equally drug-soaked Tim Benzedrine. Her name was a reference to Haight-Ashbury, a district of San Francisco nicknamed Hashbury and widely seen as the origin of hippie counterculture.\nThe 2023 \"\" set \"The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth\" includes the card \u201cGoldberry, River-Daughter\u201d and represents her as a Nymph whose color alignment is blue.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. She appears in the novel \"The Lord of the Rings\". Arwen is one of the half-elven who lived during the Third Age; her father was Elrond half-elven, lord of the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell, while her mother was the Elf Celebrian, daughter of the Elf-queen Galadriel, ruler of Lothl\u00f3rien. She marries the Man Aragorn, who becomes King of Arnor and Gondor.\nIn Peter Jackson's film adaptation, Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. She plays a more active role in the film than in the book, personally rescuing the Hobbit Frodo from the Black Riders at the Fords of Bruinen (a role played by Glorfindel in the book).\nFictional biography.\nNarrative.\nArwen was the youngest child of Elrond, lord of the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell and leader of the High Elves remaining in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age, and Celebr\u00edan, daughter of Galadriel, ruler of the Elvish forest realm of Lothl\u00f3rien. Her elder brothers were the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Her name \"Ar-wen\" means 'noble maiden' in Sindarin. She was given the name \"Evenstar\" as the most beautiful of the last generation of High Elves in Middle-earth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Arwen said: \"Dark is the Shadow, and yet my heart rejoices; for you, Estel, shall be among the great whose valour will destroy it.\"\nBut Aragorn answered: \"Alas! I cannot foresee it, and how it may come to pass is hidden from me. Yet with your hope I will hope. And the Shadow I utterly reject. But neither, lady, is the Twilight for me; for I am mortal, and if you will cleave to me, Evenstar, then the Twilight you must also renounce.\"\nAnd she stood then as still as a white tree, looking into the West, and at last she said: \"I will cleave to you, D\u00fanadan, and turn from the Twilight. Yet there lies the land of my people and the long home of all my kin.\" She loved her father dearly.\n J.R.R. Tolkien\n , \"The Lord of the Rings\", Appendix A, part I (v) \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\"\nAs told in \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\", an appendix to \"The Lord of the Rings\", in his twentieth year Aragorn met Arwen for the first time in Rivendell, where he lived under Elrond's protection. Arwen, then over 2,700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living with her grandmother, Galadriel, in Lothl\u00f3rien. Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight. Thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lothl\u00f3rien. Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love, and on the mound of Cerin Amroth they committed themselves to marrying each other. In making that choice, Arwen gave up the Elvish immortality available to her as a daughter of Elrond, and agreed to remain in Middle-earth instead of travelling to the Undying Lands.\nArwen first appears in the text of \"The Lord of the Rings\" in Rivendell, shortly after Frodo Baggins wakes in the House of Elrond: she sits beside her father at the celebratory feast. When the Fellowship of the Ring comes to Lothl\u00f3rien, Aragorn remembers his earlier meeting with Arwen and pauses in reverence.\nShortly before Aragorn takes the Paths of the Dead, he is joined by a contingent of his people accompanied by Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, who bring him a gift from Arwen: a banner of black cloth. The banner is unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of Elendil figured in \"mithril\", gems, and gold; this becomes the first triumphant public announcement of the king's return.\nAfter the ring is destroyed, Aragorn becomes king of Arnor and Gondor. Arwen arrives at Minas Tirith, and they are married. She gives Frodo the Evenstar: her necklace with a white stone, to aid him when his injuries trouble him.\nArwen serves as inspiration and motivation for Aragorn, who must become King of both Arnor and Gondor before Elrond will allow her to marry him. \"The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen\" relates that Aragorn and Arwen had a son, Eldarion, and at least two unnamed daughters. One year after Aragorn's death, Arwen dies at the age of 2,901.\nRelationships.\nThrough her father, Elrond, Arwen was the granddaughter of E\u00e4rendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-elven), great-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct descendant of the ancient House of Hador. Through her great-grandmother, Idril, Arwen was a descendant of King Turgon of the Noldor. Through her mother, she was the granddaughter of the Elf-queen Galadriel of Lothl\u00f3rien. Through both of her parents, Arwen was a direct descendant of the ancient Elven House of Finw\u00eb. Furthermore, Arwen was a descendant of Beren and L\u00fathien, whose story resembled hers. Indeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of L\u00fathien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale (\"Tin\u00faviel\").\nArwen was a distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's ancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of N\u00famenor, was her father Elrond's brother, who chose to live as a Man rather than as one of the Eldar. Arwen became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of Arnor. By their marriage, the lines of the Half-elven were reunited. Their union served, too, to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the three kings of the high Elves (Ingw\u00eb, Finw\u00eb, and the brothers Olw\u00eb and Elw\u00eb) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood through Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath.\nAnalysis.\nAs related in \"The History of Middle-earth\", Tolkien conceived the character of \"Elrond's daughter\" late in the writing. Prior to this, he had considered having Aragorn marry \u00c9owyn of the royal family of Rohan.\nArwen is depicted as extremely beautiful; she is in Melissa Hatcher's view in \"Mythlore\" \"a symbol of the unattainable, a perfect match for the unattainable Aragorn in \u00c9owyn's eyes.\" Carol Leibiger wrote in the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\" that Arwen's lack of involvement follows the general Elvish pattern, already established in \"The Silmarillion\" and continued in \"The Lord of the Rings\", of retreating to safe havens.\nThe scholar of English literature Nancy Enright wrote that Arwen, like Christ, is an immortal who voluntarily chooses mortality out of love, in her case for Aragorn. She granted that Arwen is not a conspicuous character, and unlike \u00c9owyn does not ride into battle, but stated that her inner power is \"subtly conveyed\" and present throughout the novel.\nAdaptations.\nPeter Jackson's film series.\nIn Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. The films give her a more prominent role than her literary counterpart. \nIn the first film, Arwen searches for Aragorn and single-handedly rescues Frodo Baggins from the Black Riders at Bruinen, thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. During this flight, Arwen wields the sword Hadhafang, which according to film merchandise was once wielded by her father and had belonged to his grandmother Idril Celebrindal.\nIn the film adaptation of \"\", the injured Aragorn is revived by a dream or vision of Arwen, who kisses him and asks the Valar to protect him.\nIn the film, Arwen does not send Aragorn the banner she has made; instead, Elrond takes the sword Narsil, reforged as And\u00faril, to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that Arwen's fate has become bound to the One Ring, and that she is dying. The Tolkien scholar Janet Brennan Croft comments that Jackson makes Arwen passive, denying her independence of mind; from being a constant support, she is a distraction, even a temptation, to Aragorn, whom Croft likens to \"the American Superhero\", and their marriage, in the book a sign of his rightful kingship, is in the film something he accepts as if he was condemned to it.\nIn the extended version, Elrond asks Arwen, in Elvish with English subtitles, to accompany him to safety in Valinor, away from Middle-earth.\nThe Tolkien scholar Dimitra Fimi comments that the procession of Elves in the scene \"Arwen's vision\" in the extended version borrows visually from the \"Celtic\" imagery of John Duncan's 1911 Pre-Raphaelite painting \"Riders of the Sidhe\". \nSauron uses the Palant\u00edr to show Aragorn a dying Arwen (a scene from the future) in the hope of weakening his resolve.\nThe films portray Arwen as becoming human through her love for Aragorn; as in the novel, she follows the choice of her ancestor L\u00fathien to become a mortal woman for the love of a mortal man. The films introduce a jewelled pendant called the \"Evenstar\" which Arwen gives to Aragorn as a token of their love. A similar pendant appears in Marion Zimmer Bradley's short story \"The Jewel of Arwen\", although in that story Arwen gives it to \"the Ring-Bearer\" rather than to Aragorn. In Tolkien's novel, Arwen gives Frodo \"a white gem like a star...hanging upon a silver chain\" before he leaves Minas Tirith, saying, \"When the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you...this will bring you aid\".\nIn earlier versions of the script, Arwen fought in the Battle of Helm's Deep and brought the sword And\u00faril to Aragorn. Some scenes of Arwen fighting in Helm's Deep were filmed before both the film's writers (with Liv Tyler's approval) reconsidered the change and deleted her from the sequence. The critic John D. Rateliff wrote approvingly of the deletion of what he calls \"Arwen, \", even though it came \"at the cost of reducing her to a sort of Lady of Shallott languishing for most of the final two films\".\nIn the Mythopoeic Society's \"Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings\", Cathy Akers-Jordan, Victoria Gaydosik, Jane Chance, and Maureen Thum all contend that the portrayal of Arwen and other women in the Jackson films is thematically faithful to or compatible with Tolkien's writings, despite the differences.\nOther.\nIn the 1981 BBC radio serialisation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Arwen is voiced by Sonia Fraser. In the musical theatre adaptation of \"Lord of the Rings\", Arwen, played in London in 2007 by Rosalie Craig, sings the Prologue, and three musical numbers: \"The Song of Hope\", \"Star of E\u00e4rendil\" (with the Elven chorus) and \"The Song of Hope Duet\" (with Aragorn). In the 2009 fan film \"The Hunt for Gollum\", Arwen is played by Rita Ramnani.\nThe \"Lord of the Rings\" board game made use of a rendition of Arwen by Jackson's conceptual designer, the illustrator John Howe; the work was inspired by the French actress Isabelle Adjani.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's fantasy setting of Middle-earth. Known for its horsemen, the Rohirrim, Rohan provides its ally Gondor with cavalry. Its territory is mainly grassland. The Rohirrim call their land the Mark or the Riddermark, names recalling that of the historical kingdom of Mercia, the region of Western England where Tolkien lived.\nTolkien grounded Rohan in elements inspired by Anglo-Saxon tradition, poetry, and linguistics, specifically in its Mercian dialect, in everything but its use of horses. Tolkien used Old English for the kingdom's language and names, pretending that this was in translation of Rohirric. Meduseld, the hall of King Th\u00e9oden, is modelled on Heorot, the great hall in \"Beowulf\".\nWithin the plot of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Rohan plays a critical role in the action\u2014first against the wizard Saruman in the Battle of the Hornburg, then in the climactic Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There, Th\u00e9oden leads the Rohirrim to victory against the forces of Mordor; he is killed when his horse falls, but his niece \u00c9owyn kills the leader of the Ringwraiths.\nEtymology.\nTolkien's own account, in an unsent letter, gives both the fictional and the actual etymologies of Rohan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Rohan\" is stated (III 391, 394) to be a later softened form of \"Rochand\". It is derived from Elvish \"*rokk\u014d\" \u2018swift horse for riding\u2019 (Q[uenya] \"rocco\", S[indarin] \"roch\") + a suffix frequent in names of lands [e.g. Beleriand, Ossiriand]. ...\n\"Rohan\" is a famous name, from Brittany, borne by an ancient proud and powerful family. I was aware of this, and liked its shape; but I had also (long before) invented the Elvish horse-word, and saw how Rohan could be accommodated to the linguistic situation as a late Sindarin name of the Mark (previously called \"Calenar\u00f0on\" 'the (great) green region') after its occupation by horsemen. Nothing in the history of Brittany will throw any light on the \u00c9orlingas. ...\nGeography.\nIn Tolkien's Middle-earth, Rohan is an inland realm. Its countryside is described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland which is frequently windswept. The meadows contain \"many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs\" that water the grasses. The cartographer Karen Wynn Fonstad calculated Rohan to be 52,763 square miles (136,656\u00a0km2) in area (slightly larger than England).\nBorders.\nRohan is bordered to the north by the Fangorn forest, home to the Ents (tree-giants) led by Treebeard, and by the great river Anduin, called Langflood by the Rohirrim. To the northeast are the walls of Emyn Muil. After the War of the Ring, the kingdom is extended northwards over the Limlight to the borders of Lothl\u00f3rien. To the east are the mouths of the River Entwash, and the Mering Stream, which separated Rohan from the Gondorian province of An\u00f3rien, known to the Rohirrim as Sunlending. To the south lie the White Mountains (\"Ered Nimrais\"). To the west are the rivers Adorn and Isen, where Rohan borders the land of the Dunlendings. To the northwest, just under the southern end of the Misty Mountains, lies the walled circle of Isengard around the ancient tower of Orthanc; at the time of the War of the Ring, it had been taken over by the evil wizard Saruman. The area of the western border where the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains drew near to each other is known as the Gap of Rohan.\nCapital.\nThe capital of Rohan is the fortified town of Edoras, on a hill in a valley of the White Mountains. \"Edoras\" is Old English for \"enclosures\". The town of Edoras was built by Rohan's second King, Brego son of Eorl the Young. The hill on which Edoras is built stands in the mouth of the valley of Harrowdale. The river Snowbourn flows past the town on its way east towards the Entwash. The town is protected by a high wall of timber.\nMeduseld, the Golden Hall of the Kings of Rohan, is in the centre of the town at the top of the hill. \"Meduseld\", Old English for \"mead hall\", is meant to be a translation of an unknown Rohirric word with the same meaning. Meduseld is based on the mead hall Heorot in \"Beowulf\"; it is a large hall with a thatched roof that appears golden from far off. The walls are richly decorated with tapestries depicting the history and legends of the Rohirrim, and it serves as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisors, and a gathering hall for ceremonies and festivities. It is at Meduseld that Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf meet with King Th\u00e9oden. Legolas describes Meduseld in a line that directly translates a line of \"Beowulf\", \"The light of it shines far over the land\", representing \"l\u00edxte se l\u00e9oma ofer landa fela\". The hall is anachronistically described as having louvres to remove the smoke, derived from William Morris's 1889 \"The House of the Wolfings\".\nOther settlements.\nUpstream from Edoras, deeper into Harrowdale, are the hamlets of Upbourn and Underharrow. At the head of Dunharrow (from Old English \"D\u00fbnhaerg\", \"the heathen fane on the hillside\") is a refuge, Firienfeld, in the White Mountains. Aldburg, capital of the Eastfold, is the original settlement of Eorl the Young. The Hornburg, a major fortress guarding the western region, is in Helm's Deep, a valley in the White Mountains.\nRegions.\nThe kingdom of Rohan, also called the Mark, is primarily divided into two regions, the East-mark and the West-mark. They are each led by a marshal of the kingdom. Rohan's capital, Edoras, lies in a small but populous region in the centre south of the kingdom, the Folde. In an earlier concept, Rohan's capital region was called the King's Lands, of which the Folde was a sub-region to the south-east of Edoras. North of the Folde, the boundary between the East-mark and West-mark runs along the Snowbourn River and the Entwash. Most of the rest of Rohan's population is spread along the foothills of the White Mountains in both directions from the Folde. In the West-mark the Westfold extends along the mountains to Helm's Deep (the defensive centre of Westfold) and to the Gap of Rohan. Beyond the Gap of Rohan lies the West Marches, the kingdom's far west borderland. The Eastfold extends along the White Mountains in the opposite direction (and was thus a part of the East-mark). It is bound by the Entwash to the north. Its eastern borderland is called the Fenmarch; beyond this lies the Kingdom of Gondor.\nThe centre of Rohan is a large plain, divided by the Entwash into the East Emnet and the West Emnet. These regions fell respectively into the East-mark and the West-mark. The northernmost region of Rohan, and the least populous, is the Wold. The Field of Celebrant (named for a synonym of the River Silverlode), even further north, is added to Rohan after the War of the Ring.\nCulture.\nPeople.\nThe Rohirrim are distantly related to the D\u00fanedain of Gondor, having descended from the same place. Unlike the inhabitants of Gondor, who are portrayed as enlightened and highly civilized, the Rohirrim are shown as being at a lower level of enlightenment.\nThe names and many details of Rohirric culture are derived from Germanic cultures, particularly that of the Anglo-Saxons and their Old English language, towards which Tolkien felt a strong affinity. Anglo-Saxon England was defeated by the cavalry of the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, and some Tolkien scholars have suggested that the Rohirrim are Tolkien's wishful version of an Anglo-Saxon society that retained a \"rider culture\", and would have been able to resist such an invasion. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that Tolkien derived the emblem of the House of \u00c9orl, a \"white horse upon green\", from the Uffington White Horse carved into the grass of the chalk downs in England.\nWhile Tolkien represents the Rohirrim with Anglo-Saxon culture and language, their ancestors are given Gothic attributes. The names of Rhovanion's royal family, (the ancestors of the Rohirrim), include such names as Vidugavia, Vidumavi and Vinitharya, which are of Gothic origin. Vidugavia specifically has been seen as an synonym for Vitiges, king of the Ostrogoths in Italy from 536 to 540. Tolkien saw this as a parallel with the real-world relationship between Old English and Gothic.\nIn response to a query about clothing styles in Middle-earth, Tolkien wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHorses and warfare.\nThe armies of Rohan were largely horsemen. The basic tactical unit was the \"\u00e9ored\", Old English for \"a unit of cavalry, a troop\", which at the time of the War of the Ring had a nominal strength of 120 riders.\nIn time of war, every able man was obliged to join the Muster of Rohan. Rohan was bound by the Oath of \u00c9orl to help Gondor in times of peril, and the latter asked for their aid through the giving of the Red Arrow. This has a historical antecedent in the Old English poem \"Elene\", in which Constantine the Great summoned an army of mounted Visigoths to his aid against the Huns by sending an arrow as a \"token of war\". Gondor could also call the Rohirrim in need by lighting the warning beacons of Gondor, seven signal fires along the White Mountains from Minas Tirith to the Rohan border: \"Amon D\u00een\", \"Eilenach\", \"Nardol\", \"Erelas\", \"Min-Rimmon\", \"Calenhad\" and \"Halifirien\".\nAt the start of the War of the Ring a Full Muster would have been over 12,000 riders. Among the horses of the Rohirrim were the famed \"mearas\", the noblest and fastest horses that ever roamed Arda. It was because of the close affiliation with horses, both in war and peace, that they received their name.\nLanguage.\nTolkien generally called the language simply \"the language of Rohan\" or \"of the Rohirrim\". The adjectival form \"Rohirric\" is common; Tolkien once also used \"Rohanese\". Like many languages of Men, it is akin to Ad\u00fbnaic, the language of N\u00famen\u00f3reans, and therefore to the Westron or Common Speech.\nThe Rohirrim called their homeland the \"Riddermark,\" a modernization by Tolkien of Old English \"Riddena-mearc\", meaning, according to the Index to \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"the border country of the knights\"; also \"\u00c9o-marc\", the \"Horse-mark\", or simply the \"Mark\". They call themselves the \"\u00c9orlingas\", the Sons of \u00c9orl. Tolkien rendered the language of the Riders of Rohan, Rohirric, as the Mercian dialect of Old English. Even words and phrases that were printed in modern English showed a strong Old English influence. This solution occurred to Tolkien when he was searching for an explanation of the Eddaic names of the dwarves already published in \"The Hobbit\". Tolkien, a philologist, with a special interest in Germanic languages, pretended that the names and phrases of Old English were translated from Rohirric, just as the English used in The Shire was supposedly translated from Middle-earth's Westron or Common Speech. Examples include \"\u00e9ored\" and \"mearas\". The Riders' names for the cunningly-built tower of Isengard, Orthanc, and for the Ents, the tree-giants of Fangorn forest, are similarly Old English, both being found in the phrase \"or\u00feanc enta geweorc\", \"cunning work of giants\" in the poem \"The Ruin\", though Shippey suggests that Tolkien may have chosen to read the phrase also as \"Orthanc, the Ent's fortress\".\nIn \"The Two Towers\", chapter 6, the Riders of Rohan are introduced before they are seen, by Aragorn, who chants in the language of the Rohirrim words \"in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and the Dwarf\", a \"lai\" that Legolas senses \"is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men\". The song is called the \"Lament of the Rohirrim\". To achieve a resonant sense of the lost past, the now-legendary time of a peaceful alliance of the Horse-lords with the realm of Gondor, Tolkien adapted the short \"Ubi sunt\" (\"Where are they?\") passage of the Old English poem \"The Wanderer\".\n\"Thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall and fair was Eorl the Young, who rode down out of the North,\" Aragorn explains, after singing the \"Lament\".\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn the 13th century of the Third Age, the Kings of Gondor made close alliances with the Northmen of Rhovanion, a people said in \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be akin to the Three Houses of Men (later the D\u00fanedain) from the First Age. In the 21st century, a remnant tribe of such Northmen, the \u00c9oth\u00e9od, moved from the valleys of Anduin to the northwest of Mirkwood, disputing with the Dwarves over the treasure-hoard of Scatha the dragon.\nIn 2509, Cirion the Steward of Gondor summoned the \u00c9oth\u00e9od to help repel an invasion of Men from Rh\u00fbn and Orcs from Mordor. Eorl the Young, lord of the \u00c9oth\u00e9od, answered the summons, arriving unexpected at a decisive battle on the Field of Celebrant, routing the orc army. As a reward, \u00c9orl was given the Gondorian province of Calenardhon (except for Isengard).\nKingdom of Rohan.\nEorl the Young founded the Kingdom of Rohan in the former Calenardhon; the royal family was known as the House of Eorl. The first line of kings lasted for 249 years, until the ninth king Helm Hammerhand died. His sons had been killed earlier, and his nephew Fr\u00e9al\u00e1f Hildeson began the second line of kings, which lasted until the end of the Third Age. The two lines of kings are buried in two lines of grave mounds below the royal hall at Edoras, like those at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden, or Sutton Hoo in England.\nIn 2758, Rohan was invaded by Dunlendings under Wulf, son of Freca, of mixed Dunland and Rohan blood. The King, Helm Hammerhand, took refuge in the Hornburg until help from Gondor and Dunharrow arrived a year later. Soon after this Saruman took over Isengard, and was welcomed as an ally.\nWar of the Ring.\nSaruman used his influence through the traitor Grima Wormtongue to weaken Th\u00e9oden. Saruman then launched an invasion of Rohan, with victory in early battles at the Fords of Isen, killing Th\u00e9oden's son, Th\u00e9odred. Saruman was defeated at the Battle of the Hornburg, where the tree-like Huorns came from the forest of Fangorn to help the Rohirrim.\nTh\u00e9oden then rode with his army to Minas Tirith, helping to break its siege in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and killing the leader of the Haradrim, but was killed when his horse fell. He was succeeded by his nephew \u00c9omer. His niece \u00c9owyn and the hobbit Merry Brandybuck killed the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl.\n\u00c9omer rode with the armies of Gondor to the Black Gate of Mordor and took part in the Battle of the Morannon against the forces of Sauron. At this time, the destruction of the Ruling Ring in Mount Doom ended the battle and the war. \u00c9owyn married Faramir, Prince of Ithilien.\nAnalysis.\nThe Tolkien scholar Jane Chance writes that Th\u00e9oden is transformed by Gandalf into a good bold \"Germanic king\"; she contrasts this with the failure of \"the proud Beorhtnoth\" in the Old English poem \"The Battle of Maldon\". In her view, in the account of the battle of Helm's Deep, the fortress of the Riddermark, Tolkien is emphasising the Rohirrim's physical prowess.\nThe philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that the Riders of Rohan are, despite Tolkien's protestations, much like the ancient English (the Anglo-Saxons), but that they differed from the ancient English in having a culture based on horses. They use many Old English words related to horses; their name for themselves is \"\u00c9otheod\", horse-people, and the names of riders like \u00c9omund, \u00c9omer, and \u00c9owyn begin with the word for \"horse\", \"eo[h]\". In Shippey's view, a defining virtue of the Riders is panache, which he explains means both \"the white horsetail on [\u00c9omer's] helm floating in his speed\" and \"the virtue of sudden onset, the dash that sweeps away resistance.\" Shippey notes that this allows Tolkien to display Rohan both as English, based on their Old English names and words like \"\u00e9ored\" (\"troop of cavalry\"), and as \"alien, to offer a glimpse of the way land shapes people\". \nShippey states further that \"the Mark\" (or the Riddermark), the land of the Riders of Rohan \u2013 all of whom have names in the Mercian dialect of Old English, was once the usual term for central England, and it would have been pronounced and written \"marc\" rather than the West Saxon \"mearc\" or the Latinized \"Mercia\".\nThe Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger, agreeing with Shippey's description of the Rohirrim as \"Anglo-Saxons on Horseback\", calls the sources for them \"quite obvious to anyone familiar with Anglo-Saxon literature and culture\". The resemblances, according to Honegger, include masterly horsemanship, embodying the Old English saying \"\u00c9orl sceal on \u00e9os boge, \u00e9ored sceal getrume r\u00eddan\" (\"The leader shall on horse's back, warband shall ride in a body\"). The Riders are a Germanic warrior-society, exemplifying the \"northern heroic spirit\", like the Anglo-Saxons. But the \"crucial\" fact is the language; Honegger notes that Tolkien had represented Westron speech as modern English; since Rohan spoke a related but older language, Old English was the natural choice in the same style; Tolkien's 1942 table of correspondences also showed that the language of the people of Dale was represented by Norse. Honegger notes that this does not equate the Rohirrim with the Anglo-Saxons (on horseback or not), but it does show a strong connection, making them \"the people most dear to Tolkien and all medievalists.\"\nJane Ciabattari writes on BBC Culture that Lady \u00c9owyn's fear of being caged rather than \"doing great deeds\" by riding to battle with the Rohirrim resonated with 1960s feminists, contributing to the success of \"Lord of the Rings\" at that time.\nPortrayal in adaptations.\nFor Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, the Poolburn Reservoir in Central Otago, New Zealand was used for Rohan scenes. The theme for Rohan is played on a Hardanger fiddle. \nA fully realised set for Edoras was built on Mount Sunday in the upper reaches of the Rangitata Valley, near Erewhon in New Zealand. Some of the set was built digitally, but the main buildings atop the city were built on location; the mountain ranges in the background were part of the actual location shot. The interiors of buildings such as the Golden Hall, however, were located on soundstages in other parts of New Zealand; when the camera is inside of the Golden Hall, looking out the open gates, the image of the on-set Edoras set is digitally inserted into the door-frame. The site was known among the cast and crew for being extremely windy, as can be seen during the film and DVD interviews. After filming, Mount Sunday was returned to its original state, but even with no remaining set the location is a popular Tolkien tourism destination.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Though DEM is very closely related to molecular dynamics, the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact, particle deformation and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, ice and rock mechanics. DEM has been extended into the Extended Discrete Element Method taking heat transfer, chemical reaction and coupling to CFD and FEM into account.\nDiscrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a continuum. In the case of solid-like granular behavior as in soil mechanics, the continuum approach usually treats the material as elastic or elasto-plastic and models it with the finite element method or a mesh free method. In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a fluid and use computational fluid dynamics. Drawbacks to homogenization of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.\nThe DEM family.\nThe various branches of the DEM family are the distinct element method proposed by Peter A. Cundall and Otto D. L. Strack in 1979, the generalized discrete element method, the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., Munjiza and Owen). The general method was originally developed by Cundall in 1971 to problems in rock mechanics. \nWilliams showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method, allowing deformation and fracturing of particles. Its application to geomechanics problems is described in the book \"Numerical Methods in Rock Mechanics\". The 1st, 2nd and 3rd International Conferences on Discrete Element Methods have been a common point for researchers to publish advances in the method and its applications. Journal articles reviewing the state of the art have been published by Williams and O'Connnor, Bicanic, and Bobet et al. (see below). A comprehensive treatment of the combined Finite Element-Discrete Element Method is contained in the book \"The Combined Finite-Discrete Element Method\".\nApplications.\nThe fundamental assumption of the method is that the material consists of separate, discrete particles. These particles may have different shapes and properties that influence inter-particle contact. Some examples are:\nTypical industries using DEM are:\nOutline of the method.\nA DEM-simulation is started by first generating a model, which results in spatially orienting all particles and assigning an initial velocity. The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically.\nThe following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations:\nOn a molecular level, we may consider:\nAll these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An integration method is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from Newton's laws of motion. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this loop is repeated until the simulation ends.\nTypical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:\nThermal DEM.\nThe discrete element method is widely applied for the consideration of mechanical interactions in many-body problems, particularly granular materials. Among the various extensions to DEM, the consideration of heat flow is particularly useful. Generally speaking in Thermal DEM methods, the thermo-mechanical coupling is considered, whereby the thermal properties of an individual element are considered in order to model heat flow through a macroscopic granular or multi-element medium subject to a mechanical loading. Interparticle forces, computed as a part of classical DEM, are used to determined areas of true interparticle contact and thus model the conductive transfer of heat from one solid element to another. A further aspect that is considered in DEM is the gas phase conduction, radiation and convection of heat in the interparticle spaces. To facilitate this, properties of the inter-element gaseous phase need to be considered in terms of pressure, gas conductivity and the mean-free path of gas molecules.\nLong-range forces.\nWhen long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation increase quadratically with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant galaxy: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a quadtree in the two-dimensional case and an octree in the three-dimensional case.\nHowever, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic boundary conditions); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.\nAlgorithms to deal with long-range force include:\nCombined finite-discrete element method.\nFollowing the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting, packaging and flow simulations, and impact analysis.\nAdvantages and limitations.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nBook\nPeriodical\nProceedings"}

This is in contrast to bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, which govern the process of \"reorganization\" of a debtor. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is the most common form of bankruptcy in the US.\nFor businesses.\nWhen a financially troubled business is unable to pay creditors, the business may file (or be compelled by creditors to file) for bankruptcy in a federal court under Chapter 7, which means that the business ceases operations unless those operations are continued by the Chapter 7 trustee. In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee is appointed almost immediately, with broad powers to examine the finances of the business in bankruptcy; generally, the trustee sells the assets and distributes the money to the creditors.\nThe investors who took the least amount of risk prior to the bankruptcy are generally paid first. For example, secured creditors will have taken less risk, because the credit that they will have extended is usually backed by collateral, such as assets of the debtor company. Fully secured creditors\u2014that is, creditors, \nsuch as collateralized bondholders and mortgage lenders, for whom the value of collateral equals or exceeds the amount of debt outstanding\u2014have a legally enforceable right to the collateral securing their loans or to the equivalent value, a right that generally cannot be defeated by bankruptcy.\nIn a Chapter 7 case, a corporation or partnership does not receive a bankruptcy discharge, whereas an individual may (see \u00a0https://). Once all assets of the corporate or partnership debtor have been fully administered, the case is closed. The debts of the corporation or partnership theoretically continue to exist until applicable statutory periods of limitations expire.\nFor individuals.\nIndividuals who reside, have a place of business, or own property in the United States may file for bankruptcy in a federal court under Chapter 7 (\"straight bankruptcy\", or liquidation). Chapter 7, as with other bankruptcy chapters, is not available to individuals who have had bankruptcy cases dismissed within the prior 180 days under specified circumstances.\nIn a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the individual is allowed to keep certain exempt property. Most liens, however (such as real estate mortgages and security interests for car loans), survive. The value of property that can be claimed as exempt varies from state to state. Other assets, if any, are sold (\"liquidated\") by the trustee to repay creditors. Many types of unsecured debt are legally discharged by the bankruptcy proceeding, but there are various types of debt that are not discharged in a Chapter 7. Common exceptions to discharge include child support, income taxes less than three years old, property taxes, student loans (unless the debtor prevails in a adversary proceeding brought to determine the dischargeability of the student loan), and fines and restitution imposed by a court for any crimes committed by the debtor. Spousal support is likewise not covered by a bankruptcy filing, nor are property settlements through divorce. Despite their potential non-dischargeability, all debts must be listed on bankruptcy schedules.\nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on an individual's credit report for ten years from the date of filing the Chapter 7 petition. This contrasts with a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which stays on an individual's credit report for seven years from the date of filing the Chapter 13 petition. This may make credit less available or may make lending terms less favorable, although high debt can have the same effect.\nAnother aspect to consider is whether the debtor can avoid a challenge by the United States Trustee to his or her Chapter 7 filing as \"abusive\". One factor in considering whether the U.S. Trustee can prevail in a challenge to the debtor's Chapter 7 filing is whether the debtor can otherwise afford to repay some or all of his debts out of disposable income in the five year time frame provided by Chapter 13. If so, then the U.S. Trustee may succeed in preventing the debtor from receiving a discharge under Chapter 7, effectively forcing the debtor into Chapter 13.\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 made changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that include, along with many other reforms, language imposing a means test for Chapter 7 cases.\nCreditworthiness and the likelihood of receiving a Chapter 7 discharge are some of the issues to be considered in determining whether to file bankruptcy. The effect of bankruptcy on creditworthiness in many cases might not be significant, because by the time many debtors are ready to file for bankruptcy, their credit score is already extremely low. Also, new credit extended post-petition is not covered by the discharge, so creditors may offer new credit to the newly-bankrupt.\nMethods of filing.\nOfficial Federal bankruptcy forms are prescribed in the relevant Rules, and are a computer based equivalent option of paper forms. Software can also be used, which generates court-ready forms and is more simple for users. Bankruptcy petition preparers can aid in completing applications, as can a bankruptcy attorney.\nBAPCPA revisions.\nOn October 17, 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) went into effect. This legislation was the biggest reform to the bankruptcy laws since 1978. The legislation was enacted after years of lobbying efforts by banks and lending institutions and was intended to prevent abuses of the bankruptcy laws.\nMeans test.\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within. The amendments effectively subject most debtors who have an income, as calculated by the Code, above the debtor's state census median income to a 60-month disposable income based test. This test is referred to as the \"means test\". The means test provides for a finding of abuse if the debtor's disposable monthly income is higher than a specified floor amount or portion of their debts. If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of \"special circumstances.\" Debtors whose income is below the state's median income are not subject to the means test.\nNotably, the Code-calculated income is based on the prior six months and may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual current income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \"current monthly income\" as \"presumed income\". If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. The inapplicability to non-consumer debt allows business debtors to \"abuse\" credit without repercussion unless the court finds \"cause.\"\n\"Special circumstances\" does not confer judicial discretion; rather, it gives a debtor an opportunity to adjust income by documenting additional expenses or loss of income in situations caused by a medical condition or being called or order to active military service. However, the assumption of abuse is only rebutted where the additional expenses or adjustments for loss of income are significant enough to change the outcome of the means test. Otherwise, abuse is still presumed despite the \"special circumstances.\"\nCredit counseling.\nAnother major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. \u00a7109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing, the debtor received an \"individual or group briefing\" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator.\nThe new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 complete an \"instructional course concerning personal financial management.\" If a Chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, this constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new \u00a7727(a)(11). The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months.\nApplicability of exemptions.\nBAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \"forum shopping\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing \u00a7522(b)(3). If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.\nBAPCPA also \"capped\" the amount of a homestead exemption that a debtor can claim in bankruptcy, despite state exemption statutes. Also, there is a \"cap\" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1,215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case, added value to a homestead. The provision provides that \"any value in excess of $125,000\" added to a homestead can not be exempted. The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (\u00a7522(p)). This \"cap\" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his or her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition).\nLien avoidance.\nSome types of liens may be avoided through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. The definition of \"household goods\" was changed limiting \"electronic equipment\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. The definition now excludes works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500 (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles (\u00a7522(f)(1)(B)). Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was built on the order of Charles II of England, who directed his colonial governors to link Charleston, South Carolina, and Boston, Massachusetts. The section north of New York City, laid out on January 22, 1673, became the Upper Boston Post Road. The road was finally completed in 1735. Much of the Post Road is now U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 20.\nThe King's Highway Historic District in New Jersey covers U.S. Route 206 and New Jersey Route 27, connecting Lawrenceville with Kingston through Princeton. In Pennsylvania, much of the route is now U.S. Route 13. (In Philadelphia, Route 13 becomes Frankford Avenue.) Through Maryland, the King's Highway largely follows U.S. Route 1. From Virginia southward, the modern U.S. Route 17 has many segments that follow the old King's Highway.\nHistory.\nThe Boston Post Road was a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston that evolved into the first major highways in the United States. Some routes followed trails in use by Native Americans long before Europeans arrived. Some of these important native trails had been used long enough that they were two feet below the surrounding woodland.\nFollowing a trail known as the Pequot Path, the Upper Post Road was first laid out in 1673. Used by post riders to deliver the mail, it was later widened and smoothed so that horse-drawn wagons or stagecoaches could use it. During the 19th century, turnpike companies took over and improved pieces of the road. Large sections of the various routes are still called the \"King's Highway\" and \"Boston Post Road\".\nIn 1761, Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin ordered milestones placed along the route from Boston to Saco, Maine, then to Machias, as a northern extension of King's Highway, a route which is now marked by the Presumpscot Falls Bridge in Falmouth, Maine, among other landmarks. As part of his duties, Franklin conducted inspections of the roads that were used for delivering mail as settlements along the coast increased. One method of charging for mail service was by mileage, so Franklin invented an odometer to measure mileage more accurately. The King's Highway, as a result, morphed into the Post Road.\nRoute.\nHerman Moll's 1729 \"Post Map\" describes the route:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63480", "revid": "50446179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63480", "title": "The Eminem Show", "text": "2002 studio album by Eminem\nThe Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 26, 2002, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records and Interscope Records. Eminem produced most of the album himself, with additional production by Dr. Dre, Jeff Bass, and Mr. Porter. While Eminem's previous two albums explored the frustration of life among America's underclass, \"The Eminem Show\" marked a drastic thematic shift. Guest appearances include Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae and Eminem's daughter, Hailie Jade. \n\"The Eminem Show\"'s themes are predominantly based on Eminem's prominence in hip-hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts of fame. It also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. It notably also incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem's previous albums. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, \"The Eminem Show\" was regarded as Eminem's most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego. The album was widely considered the most anticipated album of 2002.\n\"The Eminem Show\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks and topped the charts in 16 other countries. It produced four commercially successful singles, \"Without Me\", \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\", \"Superman\", and \"Sing for the Moment\", and it features one of his most popular songs, \"'Till I Collapse\". The album was a critical success, with praise directed at Eminem's mature, introspective lyricism and the album's experimental production. Several publications named it the best album of 2002 and among the best albums of the 2000s.\n\"The Eminem Show\" was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. The album has since been certified 12\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time, the second-best-selling album of the 21st century, and the best-selling hip hop album of all time. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while \"Without Me\" won Best Music Video.\nBackground.\nSpeaking to \"Spin\", Eminem said, \"Eventually, I might need some drama in my life to inspire me [...] With \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", everything that everybody was saying\u2013I took that, and it was my ammo. And then when shit died down a little bit, I had other turmoil in my personal life, so that was what I was able to dump out on \"The Eminem Show\". Now, I just gotta wait for the next phase of my life. But something always seems to happen, man; something's always gotta be fucking turbulent.\"\nEminem cited that the inspiration for the album was taken from the Peter Weir-directed 1998 science fiction comedy-drama film \"The Truman Show\". Jim Carrey starred in the film as the lead character Truman Burbank, a man who unwittingly lives inside a TV show, where his life is broadcast to viewers around the world. Eminem spoke on the film's influence, saying, \"My life felt like it was becoming a circus around that time, and I felt like I was always being watched [...] Basically, Jim Carrey wrote my album.\"\nRecording.\nSpeaking with \"Rolling Stone\" in 2002, Eminem said \"'Sing for the Moment' was the first song I wrote for the album; 'Cleanin Out My Closet' was the second. I had the line in 'Cleanin Out My Closet' \u2014 'I'd like to welcome y'all out to \"The Eminem Show\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Nobold/styles.css\"/&gt;'\u2014and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, 'My life is really like a fucking show'. I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin' over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year [lawsuits, divorce and the threat of jail time] that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that's when half of the album was wrote\".\nEminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming \"8 Mile\". Production was used for both the soundtrack of the film and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the songs which eventually became the released singles). Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album's executive producer, produced only three individual tracks: \"Business\", \"Say What You Say\", and \"My Dad's Gone Crazy\". Regarding his increase in producing, Eminem told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple\u2014just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I'm so into producing, it's a fucking job.\"\nSingles.\n\"Without Me\" was released as the album's lead single on May 14, 2002.\n\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was released as the album's second single on July 29 of that same year. Releasing singles from this album went on a hiatus when \"Lose Yourself\" (one of the singles from 2002 soundtrack, \"\") was released on October 28.\nReleasing singles from this album resumed when \"Superman\" (which features Dina Rae) was released as the third single on January 21, 2003.\n\"Sing for the Moment\" was released as the fourth single on February 25 of that same year.\n\"Business\" was released as the fifth and final single on July 22, though it was unreleased in the United States.\nMusic and lyrics.\nStylistically, \"The Eminem Show\" has a lighter tone than \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" and incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem's previous albums, featuring mixed guitar-driven melodies with hip-hop rhythms. In an interview with British magazine \"The Face\" in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record. He continued that he \"tried to get the best of both worlds\" on the album. Eminem spoke on specific rock influences, saying, \"I listened to a lot of '70s rock growing up, when I was real little. When I go back and listen to them songs, like Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix...'70s rock had this incredible feel to it.\" Notably, \"Sing For The Moment\" contains a sample of Aerosmith's \"Dream On\" as well as a reinterpretation of its guitar solo. Another rock sample on the album is the kick-clap beat of \"'Till I Collapse\", which is an interpolation of the intro from Queen's \"We Will Rock You\".\nWhile Eminem's previous two albums explored the frustration of life among America's underclass, \"The Eminem Show\" marked a thematic shift. The themes of \"The Eminem Show\" are predominantly based on Eminem's prominence in hip-hop culture and the subsequent envy towards him, as well as his thoughts on his unexpected enormous success and its consequential negative effects on his life. The album also touches on Eminem's thoughts on themes surrounding American politics, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Speaking on his use of political commentary on the album, Eminem told \"Rolling Stone\", \"You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don't agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do.\" Writing for \"Spin\", rock critic Alan Light said that the album may have proved that Eminem is the most \"dexterous, vivid writer in pop music\". The album also sees Eminem dissing several artists, including Mariah Carey, Moby, Canibus and Limp Bizkit, while Dr. Dre disses Jermaine Dupri on the song \"Say What You Say\", and so does Timbaland at the very end of the song.\nLyrically, the album also displays a dramatic shift from the misogynistic and homophobic lyrics presented on \"The Marshall Mathers LP\". Eminem told \"Spin\", \"One of the frustrating things was people saying, 'He's got to cuss to sell records,' [...] That's why with this album, I toned it down a bit as far as shock value. I wanted to show that I'm a solid artist, and I'm here to stay.\" Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, \"The Eminem Show\" was regarded as a departure from Eminem's previous albums with it being more personal and reflective and a step back of the Slim Shady alter ego. Eminem said during an interview with MTV that he felt that \"The Eminem Show\" was his \"best record so far\". In 2006, \"Q\" said that Eminem's first two albums \"aired dirty laundry, then the world's most celebrated rapper [Eminem] examined life in the hall of mirrors he'd built for himself.\"\nWith the release of \"The Eminem Show\", Eminem was considered to be more socially acceptable: there were no protests over his lyrics, boycotts, and talk shows discussing his impact on America's youth. A columnist of \"The New York Observer\" wrote that Eminem had become a \"guilty pleasure\" for baby boomers, describing him as \"the most compelling figure to have emerged from popular music since the holy trinity of [Bob] Dylan, [John] Lennon, and [Mick] Jagger.\"\nCensored version.\nThe \"clean version\" of \"The Eminem Show\" censors many more profanities and derogatory words than in clean versions of Eminem's previous albums, in which the words \"goddamn\", \"prick\", \"bastard\", \"piss\", \"bitch\", \"ass\", and \"shit\" were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted, obscured by sound effects, or back-masked. In addition to this, entire sentences were sometimes removed from the censored version for being very sexually charged. The entire song \"Drips\" was removed in early clean versions and is heard only as four seconds of silence moving on to the next track, \"Without Me\". Later on, digital releases of the clean version removed \"Drips\" completely, moving the next 11 songs up on the tracklist. Some copies of the clean version, however, feature an edited version of \"Drips\".\nThere are some inconsistencies in the clean version's censorship. In the skit \"The Kiss\", Eminem's shouting of the word \"motherfucker!\" is still audible in the censored version. In the track, \"Soldier\", which is a continuation of \"The Kiss\", the word \"bitch\" was used three times, and can be clearly heard once. Also, in \"White America\", the word \"flag\" is back masked when he raps, \"To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker\".\nCritical reception.\n\"The Eminem Show\" was met with critical acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews.\nAlex Needham of \"NME\" hailed \"The Eminem Show\" as a \"fantastic third album\" that \"is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors\". David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt the album's more personal lyrics \"succeed in fleshing out Eminem's complexities and contradictions\", nonetheless concluding that \"[l]ike its predecessors, though, \"The Eminem Show\" is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem's dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor.\" Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Kris Ex argued that Eminem \"may have made the best rap-rock album in history\".\n\"Slant Magazine\"'s Sal Cinquemani wrote that he \"peels back some of the bullshit fa\u00e7ade and reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers\" on an album that \"displays a\u2014dare I say it?\u2014more 'mature' Eminem.\" In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album \"proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders\". Critic Robert Christgau wrote: \"I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem's changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers's worst traumas and the specifics of his success.\"\nEdna Gundersen of \"USA Today\" wrote that Eminem is \"as good as he gets but in the end inflicts more damage on himself, hoisting \"The Eminem Show\" to a level of self-absorption rivaled only by Woody Allen\", and despite the presence of some mediocre tracks, he \"displays an admirable dexterity in blending invective and invention, even though his approach is more reactionary than revolutionary.\" \"Uncut\" wrote, \"Behind the hype and the swagger, he's still baring enough of his soul for \"The Eminem Show\" to be compelling theatre.\" \"Q\" was more mixed in its assessment, stating that as \"Eminem outgrows his old alter-id, so the obligatory pantomime villainy, skits and crass cameos by Shady Records signings become a hindrance.\" Marc L. Hill of \"PopMatters\" felt that the album lacked the shock factor of his previous albums and described it as \"a disappointing combination of promising musical experimentation and uninspired lyrics.\"\n\"Blender\" named \"The Eminem Show\" the best album of 2002. The album became Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while \"Without Me\" won Eminem his first Best Music Video award. The album swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The album also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, both Album of the Year and Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Album at the 2002 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, both Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the 2003 American Music Awards, Best International Album at the 2003 Brit Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.\nLegacy and reappraisal.\n\"The Eminem Show\" received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem's most personal and best work. The album cemented Eminem's \"three-peat\" of classic hip-hop albums, following the critical appraisal of \"The Slim Shady LP\" and \"The Marshall Mathers LP\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was later ranked at number 84 on the same magazine's Best Albums of the 2000s Decade. In 2007, it was ranked number 63 by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their list of the Definite 200 Albums of All Time. In 2012, \"Complex\" magazine deemed it a \"classic\" album that \"cemented Eminem's place as one of the most important figures in rap history\", and has included it on their list of 100 Best Albums of the \"Complex\" Decade, placing it at number 5. Following the 15th anniversary of the album, the Grammy Awards also described \"The Eminem Show\" as a \"classic album\". \"Popdose\" ranked the album at 79 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. In 2015, \"The Eminem Show\" was ranked number 56 on the Greatest of All Time \"Billboard\" 200 Albums.\nCommercial performance.\n\"The Eminem Show\" was originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootlegged copies appeared online via peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. It was provided by Rabid Neurosis (RNS), an MP3 warez release organisation who pirated the album twenty-five days prior to release. Radio show \"Opie and Anthony\" broadcast the entire album on May 17, 2002. Interscope decided to release the album earlier than planned, on May 28 to prevent bootlegging. However, many stores in the United States began selling it even earlier than the new release date on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, \"America Couldn't Wait\". Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. \"The Eminem Show\" was Eminem's first album to include lyrics to all its songs inside the CD booklet. Additionally, the first 2,000,000 copies of the album shipped in the United States included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. A week before the album's release, it was the second-most played CD on computers, the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. It was considered the most anticipated album of 2002.\nDespite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. \"The Eminem Show\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first day, marking the first time an album had topped the chart from only a day's sale. It sold 1,322,000 copies in the following week, its first full week of sales, then sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week to bring its four-week sales total to just under 3 million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the \"Billboard\" 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 12 million copies, making it Eminem's second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States. The album has sold 10,3 million copies on United States. It has also achieved Diamond certification in Canada and 18\u00d7 Platinum in Australia.\n\"The Eminem Show\" has sold 27 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and Eminem's best-selling album. It reached number one in 18 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart.\nExpanded edition.\nOn May 24, 2022, Eminem announced the release of the expanded edition of the album on his social media to celebrate its 20th anniversary. On May 26, 2022, Eminem released the new expanded edition, which contains instrumentals of selected tracks, freestyles and live versions of songs from previous albums performed with his longtime friend and collaborator Proof at Tramps, New York and Fuji Rock Festival, Japan. It also features four new tracks which were recorded during the initial recording sessions but not included in the original version of the album; \"Stimulate\", which was kept off the album due to time constraints and instead appeared on the bonus disc of the \"8 Mile\" , \"Bump Heads\" and \"The Conspiracy Freestyle\" (which had appeared on other Shady Records releases), and an unreleased song, \"Jimmy, Brian and Mike\", which had a verse and chorus re-recorded by Eminem especially for the expanded edition. Physical versions of the expanded edition were released later in the year, including a 4xLP vinyl set, CD, and cassette. Along with \"Curtain Call 2\", it was nominated for an Outstanding Anthology/Compilation/Reissue at the 2023 Detroit Music Awards.\nTrack listing.\nNotes\nPersonnel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63484", "revid": "50420380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63484", "title": "Show cat", "text": "Cat entered into a cat show\nA show cat (also known as a purebred cat or pedigreed cat) is one that has been judged to be close to the physical ideal for its breed standard at a cat show. Not all pedigreed cats are show cats, many are just pets but the ones with the best conformation and personality are often shown in associations such as the CFA and TICA in the US, the GCCF in the UK or the FiFe in the rest of Europe. Uncommonly, a prize-winning pedigreed show cat can be worth thousands of dollars but most are loved pets. In order to compare examples of breeds and improve stock, cat shows are held where judges evaluate the cats according to a breed standard. Pedigreed cats are often identified with microchip implants.\nIssues.\nHealth.\nA common conception is that all pedigreed cats are less healthy than random-bred cats due to inbreeding. The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations by Lipinski et al. showed that pedigreed cats are more inbred than random bred cats. For some breeds such as Singapura and Burmese the genetic diversity is very low. Some breeders take great care to select for the healthiest animals, and this has the potential to reduce the incidence of health issues. An example of this is blindness in the Abyssinian caused by PRA, which have been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008. Many of the worst, like PKD in Persians, Hip Dysplasia in British Shorthairs and Maine Coons, HCM in Maine Coons, Persians, Exotic Shorthair, British Shorthair, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ragdoll and Bengal, are still present in high frequencies. The frequency of HCM in British Shorthairs are 2.1% for females and 20.4% for males. The frequency of Hip Dysplasia in Maine Coons is 36.3% or 30.2%. Some breeders use preventive screening, but no studies documenting possible reductions in prevalences exists.\nBreeding.\nGenerally, breeds are established using few cats as founders and outcrossing is mostly not allowed. It is also normal that breeds go through population bottlenecks because of the popular sire syndrome. It is quite normal that cats winning in shows are found attractive to breeders and these cats end up being overused and eventually they are present many or perhaps all pedigrees many times. This population structure is addressed in Patterns of molecular genetic variation among cat breeds. Quote - \"As a consequence of small effective population sizes, founder effects, and population bottlenecks, cat breeds have become repositories of spontaneous mutations causative of hereditary disease.\" One example is the presence of the mutation R820W, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in 30% of all Ragdolls.\nBreeds have different origins, some are manmade or the result of mutation, while others are found in nature. Some breeds of cat have been created by taking a single tom cat or queen with an unusual physical characteristic that breeds true. The entire Cornish Rex breed can be traced back to a single parent animal with an unusual genetic mutation producing a curly coat. Both the Burmese and Tonkinese breeds can be traced back to a single cat, Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma in the 1930s. Breeders continually strive to eliminate negative characteristics that various cat breeds exhibit as the breeds are developed. There is not really any such thing as a 'purebred' cat since all registered breeds began as random-bred cats. In this case, 'pedigreed' is a more accurate term.\nMeeting breed standards.\nCat breeders are continually competing to find the 'ideal' of the breed \u2013 the cats that come closest to fitting the breed standard. Because of this, the physical characteristics of a prize-winning show cat have gradually changed in some breeds. This genetic shifting is most obvious in the two oldest, most popular and most distinctive breeds of show cat - the Persian and the Siamese. However, some show cats are naturally occurring breeds that are perpetuated to keep the original look of a cat from a particular region. Examples are the Maine Coon and Turkish Van.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books about baseball history and statistics. His approach, which he named sabermetrics after the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), scientifically analyzes and studies baseball, often through the use of statistical data, in an attempt to determine why teams win and lose.\nIn 2006, \"Time\" named him in the \"Time\" 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. In 2003, James was hired as senior advisor on Baseball Operations for the Boston Red Sox and worked for the team for 17 years during which they won four World Series championships.\nEarly life.\nJames was born in Holton, Kansas. He joined the United States Army in 1971. After his service, he graduated from the University of Kansas in 1973 with degrees in English and economics, and in 1975 with a degree in education.\nCareer.\n\"The Bill James Baseball Abstract\"s.\nAn aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles in his mid-twenties after leaving the United States Army. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp's pork and beans cannery. Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (\"e.g.,\" \"Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?\"), and then presented data and analysis that offered an answer.\nEditors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James began self-publishing an annual book titled \"The Bill James Baseball Abstract\", beginning in 1977. The first edition, titled \"1977 Baseball Abstract: Featuring 18 categories of statistical information that you just can't find anywhere else\", presented 68 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in \"The Sporting News\". Seventy-five people purchased the booklet. The 1978 edition, subtitled \"The 2nd annual edition of baseball's most informative and imaginative review\", sold 250 copies. Beginning in 1979, James wrote an annual preview of the baseball season for \"Esquire\", and continued to do so through 1984.\nThe first three editions of the \"Baseball Abstract\" garnered respect for James's work, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in \"Sports Illustrated\". New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.\nWhile writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's \"Percentage Baseball\", in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day.\nPost-\"Abstract\"s work.\nIn 1988, James ceased writing the \"Abstract\", citing workload-related burnout and concern about the volume of statistics on the market. He has continued to publish hardcover books about baseball history, which have sold well and received admiring reviews. These books include three editions of \"The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\" (1985, 1988, 2001, the last entitled \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\").\nJames has also written several series of new annuals:\nIn 2008, James launched http://. Subscribers could read James's new, original writing and interact with one another\u2014as well as with James\u2014in a question-and-answer format. The web site also offered new \"profiles\" of teams and players full of facts and statistics that hoped to map what James has termed \"the lost island of baseball statistics\". On June 9, 2023, James wrote an article for the site announcing that it would soon be closed in order for James to \"focus on other projects\".\nSTATS, Inc..\nIn an essay published in the 1984 \"Abstract\", James vented his frustration about Major League Baseball's refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game. James proposed the creation of Project Scoresheet, a network of fans that would work together to collect and distribute this information.\nWhile the resulting non-profit organization never functioned smoothly, it worked well enough to collect accounts of every game from 1984 through 1991. James's publisher agreed to distribute two annuals of essays and data\u2014the 1987 and 1988 editions of \"Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook\" (though only the first of these featured writing by James).\nThe organization was eventually disbanded, but many of its members went on to form for-profit companies with similar goals and structure. STATS, Inc., the company James joined, provided data and analysis to every major media outlet before being acquired by Fox Sports in 2001.\nInnovations.\nAmong the statistical innovations attributable to James are:\nAlthough James may be best known as an inventor of statistical tools, he has often written on the limitations of statistics and urged humility concerning their place amid other kinds of information about baseball. To James, context is paramount: he was among the first to emphasize the importance of adjusting traditional statistics for park factors and to stress the role of luck in a pitcher's win\u2013loss record. Many of his statistical innovations are arguably less important than the underlying ideas. When he introduced the notion of secondary average, it was as a vehicle for the then-counterintuitive concept that batting average represents only a fraction of a player's offensive contribution. (The runs-created statistic plays a similar role vis-\u00e0-vis the traditional RBI.) Some of his contributions to the language of baseball, like the idea of the \"defensive spectrum\", border on being entirely non-statistical.\nAcceptance and employment in mainstream baseball.\nOakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane began applying sabermetric principles to running his low-budget team in the early 2000s, to notable effect, as chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"\".\nIn 2003, James was hired by a former reader, John Henry, the new owner of the Boston Red Sox.\nOne point of controversy was in handling the relief pitching of the Red Sox. James had previously published analysis of the use of the closer in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual and used him in suboptimal circumstances. He wrote that it is \"far better to use your relief ace when the score is tied, even if that is the seventh inning, than in the ninth inning with a lead of two or more runs.\" The Red Sox in 2003 staffed their bullpen with several marginally talented relievers. Red Sox manager Grady Little was never fully comfortable with the setup, and designated unofficial closers and reshuffled roles after a bad outing. When Boston lost a number of games due to bullpen failures, Little reverted to a traditional closer approach and moved Byung-hyun Kim from being a starting pitcher to a closer. The Red Sox did not follow James's idea of a bullpen with no closer, but with consistent overall talent that would allow the responsibilities to be shared. Red Sox reliever Alan Embree thought the plan could have worked if the bullpen had not suffered injuries. During the 2004 regular season Keith Foulke was used primarily as a closer in the conventional model; however, Foulke's usage in the 2004 postseason was along the lines of a relief ace with multiple inning appearances at pivotal times of the game. Houston Astros manager Phil Garner also employed a relief ace model with his use of Brad Lidge in the 2004 postseason.\nDuring his tenure with the Red Sox, James published several new sabermetric books (see #Bibliography below). Indeed, although James was typically tight-lipped about his activities on behalf of the Red Sox, he is credited with advocating some of the moves that led to the team's first World Series championship in 86 years, including the signing of non-tendered free agent David Ortiz, the trade for Mark Bellhorn, and the team's increased emphasis on on-base percentage.\nAfter the Red Sox suffered through a disastrous 2012 season, Henry stated that James had fallen \"out of favor [in the front office] over the last few years for reasons I really don't understand. We've gotten him more involved recently in the central process and that will help greatly.\"\nOn October 24, 2019, James announced his retirement from the Red Sox, saying that he had \"fallen out of step with the organization\" and added that he hadn't earned his paycheck with the Red Sox for the last couple of years. During his time with the team, Bill James received four World Series rings for the team's 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018 World Series titles.\nOther writing.\nJames has written two true crime books, \"Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence\" (2011) and \u2013 together with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James \u2013 \"The Man from the Train\" (2017). The latter is an attempt to link scores of murders of entire families in the early 20th century United States to a single perpetrator. Those murders include the Villisca axe murders. The Jameses propose a solution to the murders based on the signature elements these killings share with each other.\nJames is a fan of the University of Kansas men's basketball team and has written about basketball. He has created a formula for what he calls a \"safe lead\" in the sport.\nIn culture.\nMichael Lewis, in his 2003 book \"\", dedicates a chapter to James's career and sabermetrics as background for his portrayal of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics' unlikely success.\nJames was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2007.\nJames was profiled on \"60 Minutes\" on March 30, 2008, in his role as a sabermetric pioneer and Red Sox advisor. In 2010, he was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.\nJames made a guest appearance on \"The Simpsons\" 2010 episode \"MoneyBART\". He claimed \"I've made baseball as fun as doing your taxes.\"\nSteven Soderbergh's planned film adaptation of \"\" would have featured an animated version of James as a \"host\". This script was discarded when director Bennett Miller and writer Aaron Sorkin succeeded Soderbergh on the project. Ultimately, the 2011 film mentions James several times. His bio is briefly recapped, and Billy Beane is depicted telling John Henry that Henry's hiring of James is the reason Beane is interested in the Red Sox general manager job.\nControversies.\nDowd Report controversy.\nIn his \"Baseball Book 1990\", James heavily criticized the methodology of the Dowd Report, which was an investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner Bart Giamatti) on the gambling activities of Pete Rose. James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. (James's attitude on the matter surprised many fans, especially after the writer had been deeply critical of Rose in the past, especially what James considered to be Rose's selfish pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time record for base hits.)\nJames expanded his defense of Rose in his 2001 book \"The New Historical Baseball Abstract\", with a detailed explanation of why he found the case against Rose flimsy. James wrote \"I would characterize the evidence that Rose bet on baseball as... well, not quite non-existent. It is extremely weak.\" This countered the popular opinion that the case against Rose was a slam dunk, and several critics claimed James misstated some of the evidence in his defense of Rose. Derek Zumsteg of Baseball Prospectus wrote an exhaustive review of the case James made and concluded: \"James' defense of Rose is filled with oversights, errors in judgment, failures in research, and is a great disservice to the many people who have looked to him for a balanced and fair take on this complicated and important issue.\"\nIn 2004, Rose admitted publicly he had bet on baseball and confirmed the Dowd Report was correct. James remained steadfast, continuing to insist that the evidence available to Dowd at the time was insufficient to reach the conclusion that it did.\nPaterno controversy.\nOn November 4, 2011, Jerry Sandusky was indicted for committing sex crimes against young boys, which brought the Penn State child sex abuse scandal to national attention. On December 11, 2011, James published an article called \"The Trial of Penn State\", depicting an imaginary trial in which Pennsylvania State University defended itself against charges of \"acting rashly and irresponsibly in the matter of Joe Paterno, in such a manner that [they] defamed, libeled and slandered Paterno, unfairly demolishing his reputation.\"\nOn July 12, 2012, the Freeh report was released, charging Paterno and three other University officials with covering up reports of sexual assaults and enabling the attacker to prey on other children for more than a decade, often in Pennsylvania State University facilities. Soon afterwards, during an interview on ESPN radio, James claimed that the Freeh report's characterizations of Paterno as a powerful figure were wrong, and that it was not Paterno's responsibility to report allegations of child molestation to the police. \"[Paterno] had very few allies. He was isolated and he was not nearly as powerful as people imagine him to have been.\" When asked if he knew anyone who had showered with a boy they were not related to, James said it was a common practice when he was growing up. \"That was actually quite common in the town I grew up in. That was quite common in America 40 years ago.\"\nThe July 2012 interview comments were widely criticized. Rob Neyer wrote in defense of James. James's employer, the Boston Red Sox, issued a statement disavowing the comments James made and saying that he had been asked not to make further public comments on the matter.\n\"Replaceable players\" controversy.\nOn November 7, 2018, James participated in a Twitter conversation regarding comments made by agent Scott Boras about teams \"tanking\". James wrote:If the players all retired tomorrow, we would replace them, the game would go on; in three years it would make no difference whatsoever. The players are NOT the game, any more than the beer vendors are.This was arguably consistent with thoughts James had publicly expressed prior to his affiliation with the Red Sox. In an article in \"The 1988 Bill James Baseball Abstract\", he had written:This nation could support, without any detectable loss of player quality, at a very, very minimum, 200 major league teams.Nonetheless, in the context of James's association with the Red Sox front office and baseball's checkered labor history (including alleged collusion amongst the owners in the previous offseason to curb free agent salaries), the tweets were taken by many as inflammatory. Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Tony Clark called James's comments \"reckless and insulting\". Other active or former players also objected. James told the \"New York Times\":I don't know that the idea that the game endures and we're all just passing through it is inherently an offensive idea. But if I phrased it in an offensive way, that was not my intention.The Red Sox responded by issuing a statement saying:Bill James is a consultant to the Red Sox. He is not an employee, nor does he speak for the club. His comments on Twitter were inappropriate and do not reflect the opinions of the Red Sox front office or its ownership group. Our Championships would not have been possible without our incredibly talented players \u2014 they are the backbone of our franchise and our industry. To insinuate otherwise is absurd.\nPersonal life.\nJames married Susan McCarthy in 1978. They have three children.\nIn January 2024, James announced that he had suffered a stroke, which impeded the use of his right hand.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63493", "revid": "1261736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63493", "title": "Ken Griffey Jr.", "text": "American baseball player (born 1969)\nGeorge Kenneth Griffey Jr. (born November 21, 1969), nicknamed \"Junior\" and \"the Kid\", is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played 22 years in Major League Baseball (MLB). He spent most of his career with the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati Reds, along with a short stint with the Chicago White Sox. The first overall pick in the 1987 draft and a 13-time All-Star, Griffey is widely considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time. His 630 home runs rank as the seventh-most in MLB history. Griffey was also an exceptional defender and won 10 Gold Glove Awards in center field. He is tied for the record of most consecutive games with a home run (eight, with Don Mattingly and Dale Long).\nGriffey signed lucrative deals with companies of international prominence like Nike and Nintendo; his popularity reflected well upon MLB and is credited by some with helping restore its image after the 1994 labor dispute. Griffey is one of only 31 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four different calendar decades.\nFollowing his playing career, Griffey joined the Mariners' front office as a special consultant. He was inducted into both the Mariners Hall of Fame and the Reds Hall of Fame. In 2016, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 99.32% of the vote, breaking pitcher Tom Seaver's record of 98.84%, a record that had stood for 24 years. \nGriffey is the son of former MLB player Ken Griffey Sr. and the father of former football player Trey Griffey.\nEarly life.\nGriffey was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21, 1969. His family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, as his father, Ken Griffey Sr., made his MLB debut on August 25, 1973 for the Cincinnati Reds. Griffey Jr. was only three years old at the time. He was in the clubhouse during his father's back-to-back championships in the 1975 and 1976 World Series. When Griffey was a young child, his father instilled in him the pride of a team accomplishment rather than the individual performance: \"My dad would have bopped me on the head when I was a kid if I came home bragging about what I did on the field. He only wanted to know what the team did.\" An incident during his father's tenure with the New York Yankees, where Griffey Jr. was told to leave the dugout while sitting with his father, while a white player's (Graig Nettles) son was allowed to practice on the field, would lead to Griffey Jr. refusing to contemplate signing with the Yankees during his career.\nGriffey attended Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati, the same high school as his future teammate Barry Larkin, where he was the U.S. high school baseball player of the year in 1987. He hit .478 with 17 home runs in his two seasons of high school baseball. Griffey also played football as a wide receiver and received scholarship offers to play college football for such programs as Oklahoma and Michigan.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Griffey with the first overall selection of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft, held on June 2, 1987. He received a signing bonus of $160,000. On June 11, 1987, Griffey joined the Bellingham Mariners of the Class A short season Northwest League. He made his professional debut on June 16 and hit his first professional home run the following day against the Everett Giants at Everett Memorial Stadium. A bronze plaque was installed at the approximate site of the ball's landing spot\u2014 from home plate. In 54 games with Bellingham, he hit .313 with 14 home runs, 40 runs batted in (RBI), and 13 steals. \"Baseball America\" magazine named him the Northwest League's best prospect.\nIn 1988, Griffey joined the San Bernardino Spirit of the High-A California League. During his 58 games, Griffey batted .338, hit 11 home runs, drove in 42 runs, and stole 32 bases. Late in the season, Griffey was promoted to the Vermont Mariners of the Double-A Eastern League. He played the final 17 games with the club, hitting .279 with two home runs and 10 RBI. Griffey had a total of 129 games in his two seasons in the minor leagues, earning 103 total runs and 27 total home runs.\nSeattle Mariners (1989\u20131999).\nIn his first 11 seasons with Seattle (1989\u20131999), Griffey established himself as one of the most prolific and exciting players of the era, racking up 1,752 hits, 398 home runs, 1,152 RBI, and 167 stolen bases. He led the American League in home runs for four seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, and 1999), was voted the A.L. MVP in 1997, and batted .297.\nGriffey's defense in center field was widely considered the standard of elite fielding during the decade, exemplified by his streak of 10 consecutive Gold Gloves from 1990 to 1999. His impressive range allowed frequent spectacular diving plays, and he often dazzled fans with over-the-shoulder basket catches and robbed opposing hitters of home runs by leaping up and pulling them back into the field of play. He was a frequent participant in the All-Star Game with the Mariners and led the American League multiple times in different hitting categories. He was featured on the Wheaties cereal box and had his own signature sneaker line from Nike.\nOn April 3, 1989, in his first MLB plate appearance, Griffey hit a line-drive double off Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart at the Oakland Coliseum. One week later in his first at-bat at the Kingdome, Griffey hit his first major league home run. Entering the majors, Griffey was a highly touted prospect. In 1989, he was the #1 card in Upper Deck's first set of baseball cards, with his card becoming one of the most popular cards of its era. He also licensed a chocolate bar in 1989 in Seattle that sold more than 1 million bars in its first year.\nIn 1990 and 1991, Griffey and his father became the first son and father to play on the same team at the same time. In his father's first game as a Mariner, on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back singles in the first inning and both scored. On September 14, the pair hit back-to-back home runs in the top of the first off California Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, becoming the first father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs. On September 21, Ken Griffey Jr. stole a fly ball hit by Sammy Sosa from his father, who was playing left field, for the third out of the inning. Then-20 year old Griffey Jr. was subsequently grounded by his father in the dugout after the play for going inside the former's previously established \"three square feet territory\" in left field for fly balls and had his car keys confiscated. The duo played a total of 51 games together before Griffey Sr. retired in June 1991.\nAt the MLB Home Run Derby in 1993, held at Oriole Park in Baltimore, Griffey hit the warehouse beyond the right-field wall on the fly and he is still the only player ever to do so. As with every home run that hits Eutaw Street, each feat is honored with a circular plaque, embedded in the concourse's walkway, in the exact spot where the ball landed. In 1994, he led the league in All-Star voting . That season, which ended prematurely in August due to the players' strike, Griffey hit 30 home runs in the Mariners' first 65 games. He had four multi-home run games that year. Although his pace cooled somewhat in the final eight weeks of the season (he only hit 10 home runs in the Mariners' last 47 games), his 40 home runs by August 12 led the American League, two ahead of Chicago's Frank Thomas and four ahead of Cleveland's Albert Belle.\nOne of the most memorable moments of Griffey's career with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, the Mariners and Griffey were on the verge of elimination, but came back to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 5, with Griffey on first base, teammate Edgar Mart\u00ednez hit a double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid into home with the winning run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. The 1995 ALDS kicked off a brief rivalry between the Yankees and Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that he would never play for the Yankees, because the Yankees allegedly treated his father, Ken Griffey Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting his dad in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing that children did not belong in the clubhouse, kick him out. Although the Mariners subsequently lost the ALCS to the Cleveland Indians, The Double and Griffey's run remains one of the most memorable events in Mariners history, capping a season that \"saved baseball in Seattle\", Seattle's improbable late-season playoff run that year, spurred by Griffey's return from injury, led to the construction of Safeco Field and the future security of a franchise rumored for years to be on the move. The play also inspired the title of the video game \"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run\" for the Super Nintendo.\nIn 1997, Griffey led the Mariners to the AL West title and captured the American League Most Valuable Player Award, hitting .304 with 56 home runs and 147 RBI during 157 games. On April 15, 1997, Griffey wore the number 42, which led to an MLB tradition started in 1999 known as Jackie Robinson Day. The next season, 1998, was a season which was followed closely by the national media as both Griffey and Mark McGwire entered the summer ahead of the pace of Roger Maris' home run record of 61. Despite Griffey falling short, Major League Baseball put forth an effort to draw a new set of young fans and regain those disenchanted by the 1994 strike focused on McGwire, Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, and Griffey's pursuit of Maris' record. Griffey, however, fell out of the spotlight due to some nagging injuries and was surpassed by McGwire and Sosa, who both broke the record set by Maris. Despite falling out of the record chase, Griffey nearly duplicated his 1997 statistics, finishing with a .284 average, 56 home runs and 146 RBI in 161 games.\nIn 1999, he ranked 93rd on \"The Sporting News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. This list was compiled during the 1998 season, counting only statistics through 1997. At age 29 (going on 30), he was the youngest player on the list. That year, Griffey was elected to the MLB All-Century Team. However, when \"TSN\" updated their list for a new book in 2005, despite having surpassed 400 and 500 home runs, Griffey remained at Number 93.\nWhile with Seattle, Griffey was a 10-time American League Gold Glove winner, the 1992 All-Star Game MVP, 1997 AL MVP, 1998 ESPY co-winner for Male Athlete of the Year, 1999 \"Players Choice Awards\" Player of the Decade (by the players), and was named to the All-Century team in 1999.\nDeparture from Seattle (1999\u20132000).\nGriffey formerly lived in the same neighborhood in Orlando as golfer Payne Stewart. After Stewart's death in a plane crash on October 25, 1999, Griffey started expressing a desire to live closer to his relatives in his hometown of Cincinnati. Not only did Griffey want to live closer, but he wanted to be able to raise his kids, Trey and Taryn (Tevin was not born at the time). On February 10, 2000, Griffey was traded to the Reds for pitcher Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike Cameron, and minor leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer. Griffey signed a nine-year, $112.5 million contract with the Reds following the trade, with a club option for a 10th. Earlier that offseason, Griffey vetoed a trade to the New York Mets for Roger Cede\u00f1o, Octavio Dotel, and a relief pitcher variously reported as Dennis Cook or Armando Ben\u00edtez. Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, said afterward that Griffey would only accept a trade to the Reds, and \"[i]f he can't go to Cincinnati, then he's going back to Seattle for the final year of his contract.\"\nCincinnati Reds (2000\u20132008).\n2000\u20132004.\nIn 2000, Griffey changed his number from 24 to 30, the number his father wore while playing in both Cincinnati and Seattle; the number 24 was already retired in honor of Tony P\u00e9rez. The 2000 season began what has generally been seen as a decline in Griffey's superstar status. Although his statistics during this season were respectable, they were far below his previous level of play: in 145 games, Griffey hit .271 with 40 home runs and 118 RBI, but his .942 on-base plus slugging was his lowest mark in five years. From 2001 through 2004, Griffey was plagued by a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The cumulative effects of the injuries lowered his bat speed, resulting in less power and fewer home runs (he slugged only .426 before succumbing to injury in 2002, his lowest output in seven years). Injuries forced Griffey to miss 260 out of 486 games from 2002 through 2004, diminishing both his skills and his star reputation.\nIn 2004, Griffey avoided major injury during the first half of the season, and on June 20 became the 20th player to hit 500 career home runs. His 500th home run came on Father's Day in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, with his father in the stands; the homer tied Griffey with his father in career hits with 2,143. However, the injury bug bit again just before the All-Star break; he suffered a partial hamstring tear, knocking him out of the All-Star Game and putting him on the disabled list yet again.\nGriffey finished the 2004 season on the disabled list after suffering a rupture of his right hamstring in San Francisco. The play in question occurred at AT&amp;T Park in a game against the San Francisco Giants. Griffey was starting in right field for the first time in his 16-year Major League career when he raced toward the gap to try to cut off a ball before it got to the wall. He slid as he got to the ball, but in the process hyper-extended his right leg, tearing the hamstring completely off the bone. He later came out of the game, complaining of \"tightness\" in the hamstring exacerbated by chilly conditions in San Francisco. However, there was far more to it than anyone realized at the time.\nShortly after this injury, the Reds' team physician, Timothy Kremchek, devised an experimental surgery dubbed \"The Junior Operation\" that would use three titanium screws to reattach Griffey's hamstring. For several weeks, Griffey's right leg was in a sling that kept it at a 90-degree angle, and he was not able to move the leg until late October. After an intense rehabilitation period, he returned for the 2005 season. In April, he hit .244 with one homer (on April 30) and nine RBI.\n2005\u20132006.\nStarting May 1, the 2005 season saw the resurgence of a healthy Griffey. His 35 home runs were his highest since his first year with the Reds as Griffey slowly moved up the career home run list. He ended the season tied with Mickey Mantle, after having passed Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, and Eddie Murray.\nEarly in September, he strained a tendon in his left foot (an injury unrelated to his past hamstring and calf problems), and was listed as day-to-day for several weeks. On September 22, with the Reds out of playoff contention, Griffey decided to sit out for the rest of the season so he could immediately have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and a separate operation to repair scars from his 2004 hamstring operation. Still, his 128 games in 2005 were the most he had played since 2000. Griffey's resurgence was recognized when he was named National League Comeback Player of the Year. He played in the World Baseball Classic for the American team that off-season with his father as a coach. Griffey batted .524, but the USA failed to reach the semifinals.\nAt the start of the 2006 season, Griffey changed his number from 30 to 3 to honor his three children. During the second game of the 2006 regular season, Griffey hit home run #537, surpassing Mickey Mantle for 12th on the all-time list. He returned on May 11 from a knee injury suffered April 12, and hit a walk-off three-run home run in the bottom of the 11th inning against the Washington Nationals. On June 5, Griffey tied Fred McGriff's record by hitting a home run in his 43rd different ballpark, at the St. Louis Cardinals' Busch Stadium. On June 19, Griffey hit career home run #548 against the Mets, tying him with Mike Schmidt, and then six days later passed Schmidt with #549 against the Cleveland Indians. On June 27, he hit his 550th career home run against the Kansas City Royals. On September 25, 2006, Griffey hit his 27th home run of the season against Chicago Cubs relief pitcher Scott Eyre to tie Reggie Jackson for tenth on the all-time home run list.\nGriffey's injuries continued in the 2006 off-season. While on holiday in the Bahamas with his family, he broke his wrist. Griffey said his hand felt fine and he expected to be ready to go for 2007 spring training.\n2007.\nAt the beginning of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Ryan Freel took over center field for the Reds, and Griffey Jr. was moved to right field. Reds manager Jerry Narron said, \"I've got to do everything I can do to put our best club out there. My feeling is that with Ryan Freel out there, it gives us strong defense up the middle.\"\nOn May 10, 2007, Griffey hit his sixth home run of the season and the 569th of his career, tying Rafael Palmeiro for ninth place on the career home runs list. He passed Palmeiro on May 13 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Griffey tied Harmon Killebrew for eighth on the all-time list hitting his 573rd career home run on May 22. He then surpassed him on May 25 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nOn June 22, 2007, Griffey made his first return to Seattle after his trade to the Reds. Before the game, the Mariners honored him with a 15-minute presentation which included a highlight reel of his playing career with the Mariners, a presentation of a \"The House that Griffey Built\" memorial by Mariners hall-of-famers and former teammates Jay Buhner and Edgar Mart\u00ednez, and a four-minute standing ovation from the sold-out crowd. Griffey did not expect such a welcome or a turnout by fans when he came back, and a short but emotional speech was given by Griffey afterwards. Many of the fans in attendance made signs professing their gratitude and adoration toward him with quotes such as: \"The House that Griffey Built\", \"Seattle Junior\", and \"Griffey we miss you.\" Griffey went 1-for-5 in the game. On June 24, Griffey hit his 583rd and 584th career home runs, tying and passing Mark McGwire for seventh place on the all-time career home run list.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWow. Never did I imagine that it would be like this coming back. I spent 11 years here, 11 wonderful years here. ... This place will be [my] home. ... I didn't realize how much I missed being in Seattle.\n\u2013An excerpt from Griffey's short speech as noted above.\nFollowing the Cincinnati Reds versus Seattle Mariners series from June 22\u201324, 2007, a fan movement emerged petitioning Mariners' management to bring Griffey back. Over 1,900 signatures were collected on a fan vid-blog/petition.\nGriffey received the most votes of any player in the National League for the 2007 All-Star balloting, and in the July 10 game, he went on to drive in two runs for the National League. On July 16, 2007, Griffey hit his 587th home run to pass Frank Robinson for sixth place on the all-time home run list. On July 18, 2007, Griffey hit his 2,500th hit, a first-inning single off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz.\nOn September 19, 2007, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Griffey fielded a Derrek Lee single in right field, then suddenly went down in pain. The injury, first thought to be a lower abdominal strain, was later revealed to be a season-ending groin strain. This marked one of many seasons in Cincinnati in which Griffey had to end the year on the disabled list. Griffey ended the 2007 season with 593 career home runs.\nOn August 22, 2007, Griffey was selected as an all-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, on a list of nine players considered the greatest defensive players in the last 50 years. He finished the season with 78 runs, 146 hits, 24 doubles, one triple, 30 home runs, 93 RBI, and a .277 batting average in 144 games.\n2008.\nOn April 4, 2008, Griffey passed Reggie Jackson for 16th on the all-time list after driving in his 1,702nd run. On June 9, Griffey hit his 600th home run on a 3\u20131 pitch from Mark Hendrickson of the Florida Marlins in the first inning at Land Shark Stadium in Miami. Fans of both teams gave him a standing ovation.\nDespite being ranked second in the National League All-Star voting for outfielders for most of the first half of the season, Griffey finished fourth with 2,907,746 ballots, 87,000 votes behind Kosuke Fukudome. He was not selected to the All-Star Game as a reserve. At the All-Star Break, Griffey was batting .239 with 12 home runs and 42 RBI. \"I always have a backup plan... If you can't hit a tough lefty, bunt. If you can't hit a tough righty, bunt. If you can't go to the All-Star Game, go to the Bahamas,\" Griffey said.\nOn July 30, Griffey hit his 608th career home run in his last game for the Reds.\nGriffey was criticized by some for his effort during his stint with the Reds. Gregg Doyel had this to say of the years Griffey was with the Reds in comparison to the 2010 Reds team: \"It's a different Reds team than the older, beer-bellied softball teams of recent years. Those Reds were Ken Griffey and Adam Dunn lounging on the clubhouse's leather couches, hitting home runs, misplaying balls in the outfield, and thinking they had it all figured out, when all they knew how to do was lose.\"\nChicago White Sox (2008).\nOn July 31, 2008, at the MLB trade deadline, Griffey was traded to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Nick Masset and infielder Danny Richar, ending his nine-year tenure in Cincinnati. In his first game with the White Sox, he went 2-for-3 with 2 RBI, a walk, and a run.\nOn August 20, 2008, Griffey hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox, off the Mariners' R. A. Dickey, which moved him into a tie with former outfielder Sammy Sosa for fifth place in career home runs. He surpassed Sosa on September 23, with one off Minnesota's Matt Guerrier.\nGriffey's signature moment with the White Sox came on September 30, the last game of the 2008 season; an extra 163rd game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins to break the tie atop the AL Central. In the fifth inning of the scoreless game, the Twins threatened with Michael Cuddyer on third and one out. Twins third baseman Brendan Harris flied out softly to Griffey in center field, who threw a strike to White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski, who tagged out Cuddyer at home in a home plate collision to complete the double play and end the threat. The White Sox went on to beat the Twins, 1\u20130, to advance to the 2008 American League Division Series, where they fell to the Tampa Bay Rays.\nOn October 30, 2008, the White Sox declined a $16\u00a0million option on Griffey, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. Griffey received a buyout for $4\u00a0million, split between the Reds and White Sox. Griffey hit .249 with 18 home runs and 71 RBI during 143 games with the Reds and White Sox in 2008. When the 2008 season ended he said he wouldn't retire, saying \"I've got things to do.\"\nSeattle Mariners (second stint) (2009\u20132010).\nAs a free agent, Griffey was courted by the Mariners and the Atlanta Braves. The national media was dubious about Griffey's ability to contribute meaningfully, with \"The Washington Post\" noting \"... the Mariners are not about to sign Griffey for baseball reasons; they're bringing him back to Seattle to sell tickets.\" Griffey ultimately accepted a contract offer from the Mariners on February 18, 2009, after \"agonizing\" over the decision. Griffey indicated he was motivated by sentimental reasons toward Seattle, where he received an overwhelmingly positive reception when he last played there as a Cincinnati Red in June 2007, but was inclined towards the Braves for its proximity to his home in Orlando, Florida, and his desire to be with his family during the season. Apparently, Griffey was very close to signing with the Braves; however, a premature report emerged from \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" that an Atlanta deal was done and a conversation with Willie Mays and his own 13-year-old daughter played a factor in his choice. Griffey once again sported #24 with the Mariners; the team had not issued the number to any player or coach in the nine years between his two stints in Seattle.\nGriffey went 1-for-3 with a home run in his regular-season debut on April against the Minnesota Twins. The home run was Griffey's eighth Opening Day home run; as of 2025, he is tied with Frank Robinson and Adam Dunn for first place in this category. On April 15, 2009, Griffey hit his 400th home run as a Mariner (613th of career), off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Jered Weaver, becoming the first MLB player to hit 400 home runs with one club (Mariners) and 200 home runs with another (Reds). AP stated, \"Griffey returned to the Mariners in 2009 and almost single-handedly transformed what had been a fractured, bickering clubhouse with his leadership, energy and constant pranks.\"\nOn June 23, 2009, at Safeco Field, Griffey hit the 5,000th home run in franchise history, off San Diego Padres pitcher Chad Gaudin. This was Griffey's 619th career home run. On July 1, Griffey hit career home run 621 at the new Yankee Stadium, off Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte in the sixth inning. It marked the 44th different ballpark in which he had hit a home run. On August 12, 2009, against his former team, the Chicago White Sox, he hit a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 14th inning to win the game, 1\u20130, for the Mariners.\nGriffey returned to the Mariners for the 2010 campaign with a similar one-year contract to that of 2009, but struggled offensively over the first two months while posting a .184 batting average. On April 27, Griffey passed Andre Dawson for 45th on the career hit list. On May 20, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Griffey hit a run-scoring single off Blue Jays' closer Kevin Gregg to win the game, 4\u20133, for the Mariners. After starting the ninth inning trailing 3\u20131, the Mariners rallied in the bottom of the ninth to load the bases on two singles and a walk, then tied the game via a walk and a sacrifice fly. The walk-off single was the final hit and run batted in of Griffey's MLB career, and moved him past Rafael Palmeiro to 14th on the all-time RBI list.\nRetirement.\nIn May 2010, Mariners' manager Don Wakamatsu made the decision to significantly limit Griffey's play due to his ongoing poor performance. On May 10, beat writer Larry LaRue reported that Wakamatsu had not used Griffey in a pinch-hitting situation the prior week, with two players stating that Griffey had been asleep. National media quickly covered the incident, dubbed \"Napgate\". In the ensuing days, teammate Mike Sweeney said he challenged anyone who said Griffey was asleep \"to stand up and fight me\" with Wakamatsu denying Griffey had been asleep; however, Griffey did not deny it. Griffey's agent said in a radio interview that LaRue's initial report had been posted in error and that LaRue had asked his newspaper to remove it, a claim both LaRue and his editor denied. In the aftermath of his report, some Mariners players boycotted LaRue.\nOn June 2, with the clubhouse still in turmoil, Griffey left the Mariners after the second game of a four-game series against the Minnesota Twins, leaving in the middle of the night for a cross-country drive to his home in Florida. He released a statement through the Mariners announcing his retirement effective immediately. Mariners president Chuck Armstrong was only made aware of this by Griffey's agent a few hours before gametime the next day; Griffey then called from the road to confirm it. His retirement was announced at Safeco Field before the Mariners played the Twins. In an interview on March 17, 2011, Griffey stated he had retired to avoid being a distraction for the team.\nPost-playing career.\nOn February 17, 2011, Griffey was hired by the Mariners as a special consultant. He is involved with the Mariners at spring training and the regular season, along with visiting most of the Mariners minor-league affiliates.\nOn January 22, 2013, the Mariners announced Griffey would be the seventh person inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame. Griffey joined Alvin Davis (1997), Dave Niehaus (2000), Jay Buhner (2004), Edgar Mart\u00ednez (2007), Randy Johnson (2012) and Dan Wilson (2012). He was formally inducted on August 10.\nA campaign had been formed to rename a section of First Avenue South, which runs adjacent to T-Mobile Park, to Ken Griffey Jr. Drive just after his announcement to retire from baseball. Later, the campaign changed direction after the death of Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus in November 2010 to Dave Niehaus Way South.\nWriter Bill Simmons pointed out the prevalent belief that Griffey was the best home run hitter of the 1990s who everyone was convinced never used performance enhancing drugs. Therefore, Simmons stated Griffey was the one player who would be the most devastating to \"an entire generation of American men\" should he ever be linked to steroids.\nOn August 9, 2014, Griffey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. Griffey returned to Cincinnati for the weekend activities and choked up during his speech when he mentioned wearing the same uniform as his dad. Ron Oester, Dave Parker, and Jake Beckley joined Griffey in the Class of 2014.\nIn 2018, \"The Seattle Times\" named Griffey as the most important athlete in Seattle sports history.\nOn October 25, 2021, Griffey joined the Mariners ownership group, becoming the first former player to hold partnership interest in the Mariners.\nBaseball Hall of Fame election.\nOn January 6, 2016, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.32 percent of the vote, breaking the record previously held by Tom Seaver's 98.84 percent in 1992. (Mariano Rivera later became the first unanimous inductee in 2019.) A flag bearing Griffey's number 24 was flown from Seattle's Space Needle following the announcement. Griffey is one of four Baseball Hall of Fame inductees who have been chosen first overall in an MLB draft. The other three are Chipper Jones, who was inducted in 2018, Harold Baines, who was inducted by the Veterans Committee in 2019, and Joe Mauer, who was inducted in 2024.\nCoinciding with his Hall of Fame election, the Mariners announced on January 8, 2016, that they would retire his jersey number 24. The retirement took effect with the start of the 2016 MLB season, with the formal ceremony taking place prior to the Mariners' August 6 game. The jersey retirement includes the number 24 also being taken out of circulation of all of the Mariners minor league affiliates.\nThe Mariners also honored Griffey in a unique fashion in the 2016 MLB draft, selecting his son Trey in the 24th round (matching his jersey number), even though Trey, at the time a wide receiver at the University of Arizona, had not played baseball since his preteen years.\nOn July 29, 2021, Griffey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame's Board of Directors.\nAs of 2021, Griffey is also working as a senior adviser to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2008, Griffey released a series of charity wines to support The Ken Griffey Jr. Family Foundation, a fund that supports several causes, including the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and several children's hospitals across the United States. He is also an honorary co-chairman of the AOPA Foundation's Hat in the Ring Society, a charitable organization that promotes aviation safety and education.\nPersonal life.\nIn April 2007, Griffey was diagnosed with pleurisy, an inflammation of the lining of the cavity surrounding the lungs which can cause painful respiration and other symptoms.\nGriffey and his wife Melissa have three children: Ken Griffey III (Trey), daughter Taryn Kennedy, and son Tevin Kendall. Trey was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) (2017\u20132019). Taryn attended the University of Arizona and played for the women's basketball team.\nThe Griffey family resides in Windermere, Florida, where Ken Griffey Sr. also lives.\nGriffey was named an American Public Diplomacy Envoy by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on November 18, 2008.\nGriffey has a private pilot certificate and owns a Cirrus SR22.\nSince 2015, Griffey has worked as a sports photographer, and has been credentialed to shoot MLB, MLS, NFL, and IndyCar events and the 2025 Masters Tournament.\nThe video game \"MLB The Show 17\" includes Griffey as the cover athlete for the American version of the game.\nThe Griffey family joined as a minority owner in the Seattle Sounders FC on November 17, 2020.\nOn May 26, 2024, Griffey drove the pace car for the Indianapolis 500.\nSuicide attempt.\nIn January 1988, Griffey attempted suicide by swallowing 277 aspirin pills but wound up in intensive care at Providence Hospital in Mount Airy, Ohio. Griffey Jr. cited arguments with his father, depression, and anger as reasons for his attempted suicide. On his failed attempt, he said, \"It seemed like everyone was yelling at me in baseball, then I came home and everyone was yelling at me there. I got depressed. I got angry. I didn't want to live.\" He stated that he had also previously contemplated taking his own life, but he had not acted on it until this incident. After Griffey swallowed the aspirin, his girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital. While in intensive care, he ripped the IV from his arm in order to stop an argument between him and his father. Both Griffey and his father stated that the incident changed their relationship, and since then, there has been better understanding for both of them.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63499", "revid": "19124223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63499", "title": "Boston Post Road", "text": "Road in the northeast United States\nThe Boston Post Road was a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, that evolved into one of the first major highways in the United States.\nThe three major alignments were the Lower Post Road (now U.S. Route\u00a01 (US\u00a01) along the shore via Providence, Rhode Island), the Upper Post Road (now US\u00a05 and US\u00a020 from New Haven, Connecticut, by way of Springfield, Massachusetts), and the Middle Post Road (which diverged from the Upper Road in Hartford, Connecticut, and ran northeastward to Boston via Pomfret, Connecticut).\nIn some towns, the area near the Boston Post Road has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, since it was often the first road in the area, and some buildings of historical significance were built along it. The Boston Post Road Historic District, including part of the road in Rye, New York, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The Post Road is also famous for milestones that date from the 18th century, many of which survive to this day. In parts of Connecticut (generally east of Hartford), it is also known as Route\u00a06.\nHistory.\nThe Upper Post Road was originally called the Pequot Path and had been in use by Native Americans long before Europeans arrived. Some of these important native trails were in many places as narrow as two feet.\nWhat is now called the Old Connecticut Path and the Bay Path were used by John Winthrop the Younger to travel from Boston to Springfield in November 1645, and these form much of the basis for the Upper Post Road.\nThe colonists first used this trail to deliver the mail using post riders. The first ride to lay out the Upper Post Road started on January 1, 1673. Later, the newly blazed trail was widened and smoothed to the point where horse-drawn wagons or stagecoaches could use the road. The country's first successful long-distance stagecoach service was launched by Levi Pease along the upper road in October 1783.\nDuring the 19th century, turnpike companies took over and improved pieces of the road. Large sections of the various routes are still called the \"King's Highway\" and \"Boston Post Road\". Much of the Post Road is now U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 5, and U.S. Route 20.\nMileposts were measured from the intersection of Broadway and Wall Street in New York (one block west of Federal Hall) and from the old Boston city-line on Washington Street, near the present-day Massachusetts Turnpike.\nThe Metropolitan Railroad Company was chartered in 1853 to run streetcars down the stretch of the road on Washington Street in Roxbury, which is now served by the MBTA Silver Line. The Upper and Lower Boston Post Roads were designated U.S. Routes 1 and 20 in 1925 (though Route 20 has since been substantially modified).\nNew York.\nManhattan.\nMuch of the route in Manhattan, where it was known as the Eastern Post Road, was abandoned between 1839 and 1844, when the current street grid was laid out as part of the Commissioners' Plan that had been originally advanced in 1811. The following sections of the road still exist:\nThese milestones were once present in Manhattan:\nThe Bronx.\nIn southwestern Westchester County, now the Bronx, the Boston Post Road came off the Kings Bridge and quickly turned east, with the Albany Post Road continuing north to Albany, New York. It passed over the Bronx River on the Williams Bridge, and left The Bronx on Bussing Avenue, becoming Kingsbridge Road in Westchester County. In more detail, it used the following modern roads:\nWestchester County.\nThe Boston Post Road entered what is now Westchester County on Kingsbridge Road, and turned north on Third Avenue-Columbus Avenue (Route 22), forking off onto Colonial Place. It continued across Sandford Boulevard (Sixth Street) where there is no longer a road, and curved east and southeast around the hill, hitting Sandford Boulevard-Colonial Avenue at the Hutchinson River Parkway interchange. It then continued east on Colonial Avenue-Kings Highway, merging with U.S. Route 1. From there to the Connecticut border, the Post Road used US 1, except for several places, where Post Road used the following roads:\nUpper Post Road.\nThe Upper Post Road was the most traveled of the three routes, being the furthest from the shore and thus having the fewest and shortest river crossings. It was also considered to have the best taverns, which contributed to its popularity. The Upper Post Road roughly corresponds to the alignment of U.S. Route 5 from New Haven, Connecticut, to Hartford; Connecticut Route 159 from Hartford to Springfield, Massachusetts; U.S. Route 20 from Springfield to Warren, Massachusetts (via Route 67); Massachusetts Route 9 from Warren to Worcester; an unnumbered road (Lincoln Street in Worcester, Main Street in Shrewsbury, and West Main Street in Northborough) to Northborough; and U.S. Route 20 from Northborough to Boston. A series of historic milestones erected in the 18th century survive along its route from Springfield to Boston.\nLower Post Road.\nThe Lower Post Road hugged the shoreline of Long Island Sound all the way to Rhode Island and then turned north through Providence to Boston. It traversed what is now the most densely populated part of Connecticut, including the state\u2019s three largest cities; as a result, it is the best-known of the routes today. The Lower Post Road roughly corresponds to the original alignment of U.S. Route 1 in eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.\nConnecticut.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMassachusetts.\nIn Massachusetts, the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike was established in 1803 as a straighter route between Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and Roxbury, Massachusetts, mostly west of the Post Road. It is known as Washington Street in many of the towns it passes through. https:// Due to its avoidance of built-up areas, the southern half of this road was little-used. In addition, another well-used route passed west of this turnpike along current Route 1A.\nThe Post Road entered Massachusetts at the town of Attleboro's Newport Avenue (Route 1A) through the settlement of South Attleboro. It continued northeast on Newport Avenue along Route 123, splitting to the north (staying with Newport Avenue) to cross into North Attleborough.\nSouth of North Attleborough center, the old road is known as Old Post Road. The old road crossed the turnpike (now US 1) just south of the intersection with Route 120, forming a small curve before merging with the turnpike north of the intersection. This curved alignment is now gone, so traffic must use US 1. Additionally, US 1 leaves the turnpike at the Route 120 intersection to bypass North Attleborough center on East Washington Street.\nThe Lower Post Road passed through North Attleborough Center on Washington Street, later used as part of the turnpike. Another short curved alignment still exists to the west of Washington Street north of the center, now called \"Park Street\". Just north of this, the route crosses the Ten Mile River and then enters a complicated five-way intersection with US 1 and Route 1A. US 1 straight ahead is the old turnpike, and US 1 to the right was built in the 1930s. The Post Road went to the right onto Elmwood Street. The fork to the left onto Route 1A through Plainville center was an alternate route to Boston.\nElmwood Street enters the town of Plainville, where it becomes Messenger Street. The road merges with Route 106 before crossing Route 152 at Wilkins Four Corners and entering Foxborough.\nThere is a road passing from the town of Sharon into East Walpole which is known as Old Post Road, which continues north as Pleasant Street into Norwood. https://\nIn Norwood, the oldest route of the Post Road followed Neponset Street south until the intersection with Pleasant Street. The newer route followed Washington Street through the center of Norwood, south towards Walpole.\nThe Post Road turned from East Street onto Washington Street, heading south towards Norwood.\nIn Dedham, the road followed modern-day Lower East Street north to Boston. Here the Post Road splits, with the oldest route (prior to 1704) following East Street in an arc around the old marshes until it meets Washington Street (Route 1A) south of the Dedham village center.\nThe new road (in use by 1744) followed High Street to Court Street, and continued south along Highland Street and Elm Street, rejoining East Street south of Interstate 95.\nIn Roxbury, the road turned down Roxbury Street and followed modern-day Centre Street around the edge of Fort Hill, crossing Stony Brook at a bridge in the location of the modern-day Jackson Square MBTA station. The road continued following Centre Street southwards through modern-day Hyde Square and Jamaica Plain, and southwards to Dedham.\nIn the colonial city, the road began at the Old State House, the government center of the 18th-century city. Once called Cornhill, Orange, and Newbury Street, it's now modern-day Washington Street, running southwards off the Boston Neck towards the village of Roxbury.\nMiddle Post Road.\nThe Middle Post Road was the shortest, fastest, and youngest portion of the route. From Hartford, it ran into the Eastern Upper Highlands, an area with large native Indian populations. During King Philip's War of 1675, travel in these areas was often dangerous for settlers. It was not until the end of the war and establishment of the Colonial post system that the area began to become populated, and the middle post road was established as the fastest route. This area of the state continues to remain underpopulated in contrast to other portions of Connecticut, and accordingly, portions of the original post road have been preserved due to various circumstances. It split from the Upper Post Road in Hartford, and initially ran roughly along current U.S. Route 44 through Bolton Notch and towards Mansfield Four Corners. From Mansfield, it went through Ashford, Pomfret, and headed into Massachusetts via the town of Thompson, along Thompson Road. In Massachusetts, the Middle Post Road runs along sections of modern Route 16 to Mendon, then through Bellingham, and then via Route 109 from Medway to Dedham where it meets with the Lower Post Road (old U.S. Route 1) heading into Boston.\nConnecticut.\nStarting at the Old State House, the road crossed the Connecticut River over the area that is now occupied by the Founders Bridge, initially by ferry and later by bridge. It is notable that until 1783, Hartford's eastern boundaries included present-day East Hartford and Manchester.\nAlthough the road crossed via the route of the Founders Bridge from Hartford, this area was later developed into an enormous highway interchange, and thus much of the historic road was destroyed. In the early years of Connecticut's history, East Hartford was privately owned. What remains of the route is the path of Interstate 84 / Route 6, which connects to Manchester's Middle Turnpike East.\nSince Manchester was a part of Hartford until 1783, the area was made up of settlements and present-day boroughs. The post road can be traced along present-day Middle Turnpike East through central Manchester. It later passed through Manchester Green, where the post road became reconnected with Route 6, and, for the first time, U.S. Route 44. Just before leaving Manchester and entering Bolton, the post road breaks off Route 44 onto Middle Turnpike East (the portion of Route 44 between Manchester and Bolton is known as \"New Bolton Road\")\nBolton serves a unique role in the post road, as it was the border between the flat and tranquil Connecticut River Valley, and the hilly and turbulent Eastern Upper Highlands. Entering Bolton on Middle Turnpike East, the traveler encountered a fork and could choose to head southeast on Bolton Center Street (later Center Street) to the settlement of Bolton, or stay on Middle Turnpike East to reconnect with Route 44 and head east on the original Mohegan Indian Trail through Bolton Notch, a natural depression in the ridge that dramatically sped up transit and served as a demarcation between the two geologic landscapes. Within the Bolton settlement was White's Tavern, notable for having housed the staff of General Rochambeau, whose unit camped in the settlement during the revolutionary war. To exit Bolton, one heads north on Notch Road until reaching Route 44, just outside Bolton Notch. Route 44 then connects to Coventry.\nBetween Bolton and Mansfield, the road passed through the borough of North Coventry, entirely along present-day U.S. Route 44, known locally as the Boston Turnpike. Along the Willimantic River (and border of Mansfield) stands the Brigham Tavern, which holds the distinction of having housed George Washington around the period of the Revolutionary War. This plaque can be seen in front of the Brigham Tavern; it is currently a private residence.\nLike Coventry, the post road follows the path of present-day U.S. Route 44. After crossing the Willimantic River from Coventry, the road crosses through Mansfield Four Corners, and towards Ashford.\nThe road connects on Route 44 from Mansfield, and runs directly through the borough of Ashford. It stops, however, at Phoenixville, which then heads north towards Eastford on Route 198. Before reaching Eastford, however, it takes a right onto Route 244 (\"Brayman Hollow Road\") which headed directly to Pomfret.\nAt the center of Pomfret, Route 244 headed east turns into U.S. Route 44. The post road turns left shortly after the intersection with Route 169 onto Allen Road which quickly merges into Freedley Road. The road then heads northeast into Woodstock.\nThe post road briefly passes through the Harrisville section of town on Tripp Road before entering Putnam.\nSoon after entering Putnam, the road crosses over Route 171 onto West Thompson Road headed into Thompson.\nThe post road soon follows over West Thompson Dam. The road once passed through the village of West Thompson, which was flooded purposely to control the Quinebaug River. The original post road can be seen from the Dam when water levels in West Thompson Lake are low enough. Once over the Dam the road turns into Route 193 and travels through historic Thompson Hill. Continuing northeast, the road bears right at a fork onto East Thompson Road and follows all the way to the Massachusetts state line.\nMassachusetts.\nCrosses the Massachusetts state line into the town of Douglas as Southwest Main Street. This section passes through Douglas State Forest and is one of the most remote parts of the route that is still used as a public road. A section here was still unpaved until 2002. At the center of Douglas, the Post Road follows Massachusetts Route 16 eastward to East Douglas. Where Route 16 turns south, the Post Road continues east as Northeast Main Street, which leads to the Uxbridge town line. French General Lafayette traveled this road to join forces with Washington, and stopped in Douglas during the Revolutionary War.\nEntering Uxbridge, the name of the road changes to Hartford Avenue. Hartford Avenue is a major cross-town road and follows the route of the Post Road for its entire length. From the Douglas town line to the intersection of Massachusetts Route 122, it is known as Hartford Avenue West; from Route 122 to the Mendon town line, it is known as Hartford Avenue East. The original stone arch bridge over the Blackstone Canal is still in use today. There was a Civil War encampment near the stone-arch bridge, and the road was used by troops during the French and Indian Wars and as a supply route during the War of 1812. George Washington stopped here a number of times when traveling this road, including when he took command of the Continental Army at Boston in 1775, and on his post-Inaugural tour of New England in 1789.\nThe Post Road enters the town from Uxbridge as Hartford Avenue West. It follows that road to Route 16, which follows the route of the Post Road for approximately one-half-mile eastward to Maple Street, which follows the route into Mendon town center. From there, the Post Road followed a Providence-Worcester post road south out of the village. This section is now part of Providence Street. About south of the town center the roads diverged. The Post Road heads east, now known as Hartford Avenue East. This road follows the original Post Road route to the Bellingham town line. Historic milestone 37 is still located along the route.http://\nThe Post Road enters from Mendon as Hartford Avenue. Massachusetts Route 126 joins the road shortly before crossing over Interstate 495. Route 126 follows the Post Road route the remainder of the way to the Medway town line.\nThe original Post Road from Mendon followed Village Street through Medway to the Tavern and Inn in Medway Village near the Charles River. The post road followed (present day) Village Street through Millis (part of Medway until 1885). In the early 19th century, the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike was built (now Rt 109), a straight route built through the Great Black Swamp, and up a large hill in the center of town.\nThe original Post Road in Millis followed Village St from Medway, crossing current Massachusetts Rt 109, and then following the current Dover Road to the location of a series of Bridges over the Charles River leading into Medfield. In the period from 1806 to 1810, the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike was built (now Route 109), nearly going broke in attempting to build a causeway over the Charles River at the Medfield town line and through the Great Black Swamp.\nThe upper post road (US 20) also runs through Weston, and links directly to The Gifford School\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.\nDespite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.\nHistory.\nIn 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a \"multi-cell wing type aerial device\u2014\"\"a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil... More particularly the invention contemplates the provision of a wing of rectangular or other shape having a canopy or top skin and a lower spaced apart bottom skin\", a governable gliding parachute with multi-cells and controls for glide.\nIn 1954, Walter Neumark predicted (in an article in \"Flight\" magazine) a time when a glider pilot would be \"able to launch himself by running over the edge of a cliff or down a slope ... whether on a rock-climbing holiday in Skye or skiing in the Alps.\"\nIn 1961, the French engineer Pierre Lemongine produced improved parachute designs that led to the Para-Commander (PC). The Para-Commander had cutouts at the rear and sides that enabled it to be towed into the air and steered, leading to parasailing/parascending.\nDomina Jalbert invented the parafoil, which had sectioned cells in an aerofoil shape, an open leading edge, a closed trailing edge, and was inflated by passage through the air\u200d\u2014\u200athe ram-air design. He filed US Patent 3131894 on January 10, 1963.\nAbout that time, David Barish was developing the sail wing (single-surface wing) for recovery of NASA space capsules\u2014\"slope soaring was a way of testing out... the Sail Wing.\" After tests on Hunter Mountain, New York, in September 1965, he went on to promote slope soaring as a summer activity for ski resorts.\nAuthor Walter Neumark wrote \"Operating Procedures for Ascending Parachutes\", and in 1973 he and a group of enthusiasts with a passion for tow-launching PCs and ram-air parachutes broke away from the British Parachute Association to form the British Association of Parascending Clubs (which later became the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association). In 1997, Neumark was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club of the UK. Authors Patrick Gilligan (Canada) and Bertrand Dubuis (Switzerland) wrote the first flight manual, \"The Paragliding Manual\" in 1985, coining the word \"paragliding\".\nThese developments were combined in June 1978 by three friends, Jean-Claude B\u00e9temps, Andr\u00e9 Bohn and G\u00e9rard Bosson, from Mieussy, Haute-Savoie, France. After inspiration from an article on slope soaring in the \"Parachute Manual\" magazine by parachutist and publisher Dan Poynter, they calculated that on a suitable slope, a \"square\" ram-air parachute could be inflated by running down the slope; B\u00e9temps launched from Pointe du Pertuiset, Mieussy, and flew 100 m. Bohn followed him and glided down to the football pitch in the valley 1000 metres below. Parapente ( being French for 'slope') was born.\nFrom the 1980s, equipment has continued to improve, and the number of paragliding pilots and established sites has continued to increase. The first (unofficial) Paragliding World Championship was held in Verbier, Switzerland, in 1987, though the first officially sanctioned FAI World Paragliding Championship was held in K\u00f6ssen, Austria, in 1989.\nEurope has seen the greatest growth in paragliding, with France alone registering in 2011 over 25,000 active pilots.\nStarting in 2022, feasibility studies of paragliding from above 8000meters have been in progress in the Everest region of Nepal\u200d\u2014\u200a this would effectively be paragliding from the highest starting altitude on the planet.\nEquipment.\nWing.\nThe paraglider wing or canopy is usually what is known in engineering as a \"ram-air airfoil\". Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape. When inflated, the wing's cross-section has the typical teardrop aerofoil shape. Modern paraglider wings are made of high-performance non-porous materials such as ripstop nylon.\nIn most modern paragliders (from the 1990s onwards), some of the cells of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile. Holes in the internal ribs allow a free flow of air from the open cells to these closed cells to inflate them, and also to the wingtips, which are also closed. Almost all modern paragliders follow a \"sharknose\" design of the leading edge, by which the inflation opening is not at the front of the wing, but slightly backwards on the underside of the wing, and following a concave shape. This design, resembling the nose of a shark, increases wing stability and stall resistance. In modern paragliders, semi-flexible rods made out of plastic or nitinol are used to give extra stability to the profile of the wing. In high-performance paragliders, these rods extend through most of the length of the upper wing.\nThe pilot is supported underneath the wing by a network of suspension lines. These start with two sets of risers made of short () lengths of strong webbing. Each set is attached to the harness by a carabiner, one on each side of the pilot, and each riser of a set is generally attached to lines from only one row of its side of wing. At the end of each riser of the set, there is a small delta maillon with a number (2\u20135) of lines attached, forming a fan. These are typically long, with the end attached to 2\u20134 further lines of around m, which are again joined to a group of smaller, thinner lines. In some cases this is repeated for a fourth cascade.\nThe top of each line is attached to small fabric loops sewn into the structure of the wing, which are generally arranged in rows running span-wise (i.e., side to side). The row of lines nearest the front are known as the A lines, the next row back the B lines, and so on. A typical wing will have A, B, C and D lines, but recently, there has been a tendency to reduce the rows of lines to three, or even two (and experimentally to one), to reduce drag.\nParaglider lines are usually made from UHMW polythene or aramid. Although they look rather slender, these materials are strong and subject to load testing requirements. For example, a single 0.66\u00a0mm-diameter line (about the thinnest used) can have a breaking strength of .\nParaglider wings typically have an area of with a span of and weigh . Combined weight of wing, harness, reserve, instruments, helmet, etc. is around . Ultralight Hike &amp; Fly kits can be lighter than .\nThe glide ratio of paragliders ranges from 9.3 for recreational wings to about 11.3 for modern competition models, reaching in some cases up to 13. For comparison, a typical skydiving parachute will achieve about 3:1 glide. A hang glider ranges from 9.5 for recreational wings to about 16.5 for modern competition models. An idling (gliding) Cessna 152 light aircraft will achieve 9:1. Some sailplanes can achieve a glide ratio of up to 72:1.\nThe speed range of paragliders is typically , from stall speed to maximum speed. Achieving maximum speed requires the use of speedbar, or trimmers. Without these, and without applying brakes, a paraglider is at its trim speed, which is typically and often at the best glide ratio, too. High-performance paragliders meant for competitions may achieve faster accelerated flight, as do speedwings, due to their small size and different profile.\nFor storage and carrying, the wing is usually folded into a stuffsack (bag), which can then be stowed in a large backpack along with the harness. Some modern harnesses include the ability to turn the harness inside out such that it becomes a backpack, saving weight and space.\nParagliders are unique among human-carrying aircraft in being easily portable. The complete equipment packs into a rucksack and can be carried easily on the pilot's back, in a car, or on public transport. In comparison with other air sports, this substantially simplifies travel to a suitable takeoff spot, the selection of a landing place and return travel.\nTandem paragliders, designed to carry the pilot and one passenger, are larger but otherwise similar. They usually fly faster with higher trim speeds, are more resistant to collapse, and have a slightly higher sink rate compared to solo paragliders.\nHarness.\nThe pilot is loosely and comfortably buckled into a harness, which offers support in both the standing and sitting positions. Most harnesses have protectors made out of foam or other materials underneath the seat and behind the back to reduce the impact on failed launches or landings. Modern harnesses are designed to be as comfortable as a lounge chair in the sitting or reclining position. Many harnesses even have an adjustable lumbar support. A reserve parachute is also typically connected to a paragliding harness.\nHarnesses also vary according to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly:\nHarnesses have a substantial influence on the flying characteristics; for instance, acro harnesses lead to more agile handling, which is desirable for flying acrobatics, but may be unsuitable for beginners or XC pilots looking for more stability in flight. While pod harnesses offer more stability and aerodynamic properties, they increase the risk of riser twist, and are hence not suitable for beginners. The standard harness is an open harness, which features a sitting, slightly reclined body position.\nInstruments in paragliding.\nMost pilots use variometers, radios, and, increasingly, GNSS units when they are flying. Since 2003, some pilots are using smart glasses, allowing head up display technologies.\nThe main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the \"core\" of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.\nHumans can sense the acceleration when they first hit a thermal, but cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air. Modern variometers are capable of detecting rates of climb or sink of 1\u00a0cm per second.\nA variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the rate of descent increases) and/or a visual display. It also shows altitude: either above takeoff, above sea level, or (at higher altitudes) flight level.\nRadio communications are used in training, to communicate with other pilots, and to report where and when they intend to land. These radios normally operate on a range of frequencies in different countries\u2014some authorised, some illegal but tolerated locally. Some local authorities (e.g., flight clubs) offer periodic automated weather updates on these frequencies. In rare cases, pilots use radios to talk to airport control towers or air traffic controllers.\nMany pilots carry a cell phone so they can call for pickup should they land away from their intended point of destination.\nGNSS is a necessary accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that way-points have been correctly passed.\nThe recorded GNSS track of a flight can be used to analyze flying technique or can be shared with other pilots. GNSS is also used to determine drift due to the prevailing wind when flying at altitude, providing position information to allow restricted airspace to be avoided and identifying one's location for retrieval teams after landing out in unfamiliar territory.\nGNSS is integrated with some models of variometer. This is not only more convenient, but also allows for a three-dimensional record of the flight. The flight track can be used as proof for record claims, replacing the old method of photo documentation.\nIncreasingly, smart phones are used as the primary means of navigation and flight logging, with several applications available to assist in air navigation. They are also used to co-ordinate tasks in competitive paragliding and facilitate retrieval of pilots returning to their point of launch. External variometers are typically used to assist in accurate altitude information.\nHead up display, have been introduced in 2023 with application that allow pilot wearing smart glasses, to display altitude, speed, and flight time in the field of view during the flight.\nGround handling.\nParaglider ground handling, also known as kiting, is the practice of handling the paraglider on land. The primary purpose of ground handling is to practice the skills necessary for launching and landing. However, ground handling could be considered a fun and challenging sport in and of itself.\nGround handling is considered an essential part of most paragliding wing management training. It needs to be remembered that in any sort of stumble or tumble, the head is at risk and a helmet is therefore always advisable.\nIt is highly recommended that low hour pilots, ground-handling, should be wearing a formal harness with leg and waist straps firmly fitted and fastened. Since 2015 the standard harness has become an inflatable type. This forms a protective cushion when, during flight, air is forced through a check valve and retained in a chamber behind and under the pilot. In ground-handling practice the amount of air passing through the check valve may be very slight. In an accident where the pilot has been lifted and dumped while facing downwind, the protection offered by an inflatable harness is likely to be minimal. The old-fashioned foam type of harness has a special value in that sort of situation.\nLocation.\nThe ideal launch training site for novices with standard wings has the following characteristics:\nAs pilots progress, they may challenge themselves by kiting over and around obstacles, in strong or turbulent wind, and on greater slopes.\nFlying.\nLaunching.\nAs with all aircraft, launching and landing are done into wind. The wing is placed into an airstream, either by running or being pulled, or an existing wind. The wing moves up over the pilot into a position in which it can carry the passenger. The pilot is then lifted from the ground and, after a safety period, can sit down into his harness. Unlike skydivers, paragliders, like hang gliders, do not jump at any time during this process. There are two launching techniques used on higher ground and one assisted launch technique used in flatland areas:\nForward launch.\nIn low winds, the wing is inflated with a forward launch, where the pilot runs forward with the wing behind so that the air pressure generated by the forward movement inflates the wing.\nIt is often easier, because the pilot only has to run forward, but the pilot cannot see his wing until it is above him, where he has to check it in a very short time for correct inflation and untangled lines before the launch.\nReverse launch.\nIn higher winds, a reverse launch is used, with the pilot facing the wing to bring it up into a flying position, then turning around under the wing and running to complete the launch.\nReverse launches have a number of advantages over a forward launch. It is more straightforward to inspect the wing and check if the lines are free as it leaves the ground. In the presence of wind, the pilot can be tugged toward the wing, and facing the wing makes it easier to resist this force and safer in case the pilot slips (as opposed to being dragged backwards). However, the movement pattern is more complex than forward launch, and the pilot has to hold the brakes in a correct way and turn to the correct side so he does not tangle the lines. These launches are normally attempted with a reasonable wind speed, making the ground speed required to pressurise the wing much lower.\nThe launch is initiated by the hands raising the leading edge with the As. As it rises the wing is controlled more by centring the feet than by use of the brakes or Cs. With mid level wings (EN C and D) the wing may try to \"overshoot\" the pilot as it nears the top. This is checked with Cs or brakes. The wing becomes increasingly sensitive to the Cs and brakes as its internal air pressure rises. This is usually felt from increasing lift of the wing applying harness pressure to the seat of the pants. That pressure indicates that the wing is likely to remain stable when the pilot pirouettes to face the wind.\nThe next step in the launch is to bring the wing into the lift zone. There are two techniques for accomplishing this depending on wind conditions. In light wind this is usually done after turning to the front, steering with the feet towards the low wing tip, and applying light brakes in a natural sense to keep the wing horizontal. In stronger wind conditions it is often found to be easier to remain facing downwind while moving slowly and steadily backwards into the wind.\nKnees bent to load the wing, foot adjustments to remain central and minimum use of Cs or Brakes to keep the wing horizontal. Pirouette when the feet are close to lifting. This option has two distinct advantages. a) The pilot can see the wing centre marker (an aid to centring the feet) and, if necessary, b) the pilot can move briskly towards the wing to assist with an emergency deflation.\nWith either method it is essential to check \"traffic\" across the launch face before committing to flight.\nThe A's and C's technique described above is well suited to low-hours pilots, on standard wings, in wind strengths up to 10 knots. It is particularly recommended for kiting. As wind speed increases (above ten knots), especially on steep ridges, the use of the C's introduces the potential to be lifted before the wing is overhead due to the increased angle of attack. That type of premature lift often results in the pilot's weight swinging downwind rapidly, resulting in a frontal tuck (due to excess A line loads). In that situation the pilot commonly drops vertically and injuries are not uncommon. In ridge soaring situations above ten knots it is almost always better to lift the wing with A's only and use the brakes to stop any potential overshoot. The brakes do not usually increase the angle of attack as much C's. As wind strength increases it becomes more important than ever for the pilot to keep the wing loaded by bending the knees and pushing the shoulders forward. Most pilots will find that when their hands are vertically under the brake line pulleys they are able reduce trailing edge drag to the absolute minimum. That is not so easy for most, when the arms are thrust rearwards.\nTowed launch.\nIn flatter countryside, pilots can also be launched with a tow. Once at full height (towing can launch pilots up to altitude), the pilot pulls a release cord, and the towline falls away. This requires separate training, as flying on a winch has quite different characteristics from free flying. There are two major ways to tow: pay-in and pay-out towing. Pay-in towing involves a stationary winch that winds in the towline and thereby pulls the pilot in the air. The distance between winch and pilot at the start is around or more. Pay-out towing involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, that pays out line slower than the speed of the object, thereby pulling the pilot up in the air. In both cases, it is very important to have a gauge indicating line tension to avoid pulling the pilot out of the air. Another form of towing is static line towing. This involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, attached to a paraglider or hang glider with a fixed-length line. This can be very dangerous, because now the forces on the line have to be controlled by the moving object itself, which is almost impossible to do, unless stretchy rope and a pressure/tension meter (dynamometer) is used. Static line towing with stretchy rope and a load cell as a tension meter has been used in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern European countries for over 20 years (under the name \"Malinka\") with about the same safety record as other forms of towing.\nOne more form of towing is hand towing. This is where 1\u20133 people pull a paraglider using a tow rope of up to . The stronger the wind, the fewer people are needed for a successful hand tow. Tows up to have been accomplished, allowing the pilot to get into a lift band of a nearby ridge or row of buildings and ridge-soar in the lift the same way as with a regular foot launch.\nLanding.\nLanding a paraglider, as with all unpowered aircraft which cannot abort a landing, involves some specific techniques and traffic patterns. Paragliding pilots most commonly lose their height by flying a figure 8 over a landing zone until they reach the correct height, then line up into the wind and give the glider full speed. Once the correct height (about a metre above ground) is achieved the pilot will stall the glider in order to land.\nTraffic pattern.\nUnlike during launch, where coordination between multiple pilots is straightforward, landing involves more planning, because more than one pilot might have to land at the same time. Therefore, a specific traffic pattern has been established. Pilots line up into a position above the airfield and to the side of the landing area, which is dependent on the wind direction, where they can lose height (if necessary) by flying circles. From this position, they follow the legs of a flightpath in a rectangular pattern to the landing zone: downwind leg, base leg, and final approach. This allows for synchronization between multiple pilots and reduces the risk of collisions, because a pilot can anticipate what other pilots around him are going to do next.\nTechniques.\nLanding involves lining up for an approach into wind and, just before touching down, flaring the wing to minimise vertical and/or horizontal speed. This consists of gently going from 0% brake at around two metres to 100% brake when touching down on the ground.\nDuring the approach descent, at around four metres before touching ground, some momentary braking (50% for around two seconds) can be applied then released, thus using forward pendular momentum to gain speed for flaring more effectively and approaching the ground with minimal vertical speed.\nIn light winds, some minor running is common. In moderate to medium headwinds, the landings can be without forward speed, or even going backwards with respect to the ground in strong winds. Landing with winds which force the pilot backwards are particularly hazardous as there is a potential to tumble and be dragged. While the wing is vertically above the pilot there is potential for a reduced risk deflation. This involves taking the leading edge lines (As) in each hand at the mallion/riser junction and applying the pilot's full weight with a deep knee bend action. In almost every case the wing's leading edge will fly forward a little and then tuck. It is then likely to collapse and descend upwind of the pilot. On the ground it will be restrained by the pilot's legs.\nLanding in winds which are too strong for the wing is to be avoided wherever possible. During approach to the intended landing site this potential problem is often obvious and there may be opportunities to extend the flight to find a more sheltered landing area. On every landing it is desirable to have the wing remain flyable with a small amount of forward momentum. This makes deflation much more controllable. While the midsection lines (Bs) are vertical there is much less chance of the wing moving downwind fast. The common deflation cue comes from a vigorous tug on the rear risers' lines (Cs or Ds). Promptly rotate to face down wind, maintain pressure on the rear risers and take brisk steps towards the wing as it falls. With practice there is potential for precision enabling safe trouble-free landing.\nFor strong winds during the landing approach, flapping the wing (symmetrical pulsing of brakes) is a common option on final. It reduces the wing's lift performance. The descent rate is increases by the alternate application and release of the brakes about once per second. (The amount of brake applied in each cycle being variable but about 25%.) The system depends on the pilot's wing familiarity. The wing must not become stalled. This should be established with gentle applications in flight, at a safe height, in good conditions and with an observer providing feedback. As a rule the manufacturer has set the safe-brake-travel-range based on average body proportions for pilots in the approved weight range. Making changes to that setting should be undertaken in small increases, with tell-tale marks showing the variations and a test flight to confirm the desired effect. Shortening the brake lines can produce the problematic effect of making the wing sluggish. Lengthening brakes excessively can make it hard to bring the wing to a safe touchdown speed.\nAlternative approach techniques for landing in strong winds include the use of a speed bar and big ears. A speed bar increases wing penetration and adds a small increase in the vertical descent rate. This makes it easier to adjust descent rates during a formal circuit. In an extreme situation it might be advisable to stand on the speed bar, after shifting out of the harness, and stay on it till touchdown and deflation. Big ears are commonly applied during circuit height management. The vertical descent speed is increased and that advantage can be used to bring the glider to an appropriate circuit joining height. Most manufacturers change the operation technique for big ears in advanced models. It is common for Big Ears in C-rated gliders to remain folded in after the control line is released. In those cases the wing can be landed with reasonable safety with big ears deployed. In those wing types it usually takes two or three symmetrical pumps with brakes, over a second or two, to re-inflate the tips. In lower rated wings the Big Ears need the line to remain held to hold the ears in. While they are held-in the wing tends to respond to weight shift slightly better (due to reduced effective area) on the roll axis. They auto re-inflate when the line is released. In general those wings are better suited to the situation where the ears are pulled in simply to get rid of excess height. Full-wing flight should then be resumed during base leg or several seconds before touch down. Wing familiarity is a key ingredient in applying these controls. Pilots should practise in medium conditions in a safe area, at a safe height and with options for landing.\nControl.\nBrakes: controls held in each of the pilot's hands connect to the trailing edge of the left and right sides of the wing. These controls are called brakes and provide the primary and most general means of control in a paraglider. The brakes are used to adjust speed, to steer (in addition to weight shift), and to flare (during landing).\nWeight shift: in addition to manipulating the brakes, a paraglider pilot must also lean in order to steer properly. Such weight shifting can also be used for more limited steering when brake use is unavailable, such as when under \"big ears\" (see below). More advanced control techniques may also involve weight shifting.\nSpeed bar: a kind of foot control called the speed bar (also accelerator) attaches to the paragliding harness and connects to the leading edge of the paraglider wing, usually through a system of at least two pulleys (see animation in margin). This control is used to increase speed and does so by decreasing the wing's angle of attack. This control is necessary because the brakes can only slow the wing from what is called trim speed (no brakes applied). The accelerator is needed to go faster than this.\nMore advanced means of control can be obtained by manipulating the paraglider's risers or lines directly. Most commonly, the lines connecting to the outermost points of the wing's leading edge can be used to induce the wingtips to fold under. The technique, known as \"big ears\", is used to increase the rate of descent (see picture and the full description below). The risers connecting to the rear of the wing can also be manipulated for steering if the brakes have been severed or are otherwise unavailable. For ground-handling purposes, a direct manipulation of these lines can be more effective and offer more control than the brakes. The effect of sudden wind blasts can be countered by directly pulling on the risers and making the wing unflyable, thereby avoiding falls or unintentional takeoffs.\nFast descents.\nProblems with getting down can occur when the lift situation is very good or when the weather changes unexpectedly. There are three possibilities for rapidly reducing altitude in such situations, each of which has benefits and issues to be aware of. The \"big ears\" manoeuvre induces descent rates of 2.5 to 3.5\u00a0m/s, 4\u20136\u00a0m/s with additional speed bar. It is the most controllable of the techniques and the easiest for beginners to learn. The B-line stall induces descent rates of 6\u201310\u00a0m/s. It increases loading on parts of the wing (the pilot's weight is mostly on the B-lines, instead of spread across all the lines). Finally, a spiral dive offers the fastest rate of descent, at 7\u201325\u00a0m/s. It places greater loads on the wing than other techniques do and requires the highest level of skill from the pilot to execute safely.\nPulling on the outer A-lines during non-accelerated, normal flight folds the wing tips inwards, which substantially reduces the glide angle with only a small decrease in forward speed. As the effective wing area is reduced, the wing loading is increased, and it becomes more stable. However, the angle of attack is increased, and the craft is closer to stall speed, but this can be ameliorated by applying the speed bar, which also increases the descent rate. When the lines are released, the wing re-inflates. If necessary, a short pumping on the brakes helps reestablish normal flight. Compared to the other techniques, with big ears, the wing still glides forward, which enables the pilot to leave an area of danger. Even landing this way is possible, e.g., if the pilot has to counter an updraft on a slope.\nIn a B-line stall, the second set of risers from the leading-edge/front (the B-lines) are pulled down independently of the other risers, with the specific lines used to initiate a stall. This puts a spanwise crease in the wing, thereby separating the airflow from the upper surface of the wing. It dramatically reduces the lift produced by the canopy and thus induces a higher rate of descent. This can be a strenuous manoeuvre, because these B-lines have to be held in this position, and the tension of the wing puts an upwards force on these lines. The release of these lines has to be handled carefully not to provoke a too fast forward shooting of the wing, which the pilot then could fall into. This is less popular now as it induces high loads on the internal structure of the wing.\nThe spiral dive is the most rapid form of controlled fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25\u00a0m/s. This manoeuvre halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes on one side and shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this manoeuvre by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.\nSpiral dives put a strong G-force on the wing and glider and must be done carefully and skilfully. The G-forces involved can induce blackouts, and the rotation can produce disorientation. Some high-end gliders have what is called a \"stable spiral problem\". After inducing a spiral and without further pilot input, some wings do not automatically return to normal flight and stay inside their spiral. Serious injury and fatal accidents have occurred when pilots could not exit this manoeuvre and spiralled into the ground.\nThe rate of rotation in a spiral dive can be reduced by using a drogue chute, deployed just before the spiral is induced. This reduces the G forces experienced.\nRidge soaring.\nRidge soaring is a technique that allows lift to be obtained by using the wind directed upwards by a fixed object such as a dune or ridge.\nTo achieve this, pilots fly along the length of a slope feature in the landscape, relying on the lift provided by the air, which is forced up as it passes over the slope. This type of lift is highly dependent on a steady wind within a defined range (the suitable range depends on the performance of the wing and the skill of the pilot). Too little wind, and insufficient lift is available to stay airborne (pilots end up 'scratching' along the slope). With more wind, gliders can fly well above and forward of the slope, but too much wind, and there is a risk of being blown back over the slope. A particular form of ridge soaring is called condo soaring, where pilots soar a row of buildings that form an artificial ridge. This form of soaring is particularly used in flat lands where there are no natural ridges, but there are plenty of man-made building ridges.\nThermal flying.\nWhen the sun warms the ground, the ground will radiate some of its heat to a thin layer of air situated just above it. Air has very poor thermal conductivity and most of the heat transfer in it will be convective \u2013 forming rising columns of hot air, called thermals. If the terrain is not uniform, it will warm some features more than others (such as rock faces or large buildings) and these thermals will tend to always form at the same spot, otherwise they will be more random. Sometimes these may be a simple rising column of air; more often, they are blown sideways in the wind and will break off from the source, with a new thermal forming later.\nOnce a pilot finds a thermal, he begins to fly in a circle, trying to centre the circle on the strongest part of the thermal (the \"core\"), where the air is rising the fastest. Most pilots use a vario-altimeter (\"vario\"), which indicates climb rate with beeps and/or a visual display, to help core in on a thermal.\nOften there is strong sink surrounding thermals, and there is also strong turbulence resulting in wing collapses as a pilot tries to enter a strong thermal. Good thermal flying is a skill that takes time to learn, but a good pilot can often core a thermal all the way to cloud base.\nCross-country flying.\nOnce the skills of using thermals to gain altitude have been mastered, pilots can glide from one thermal to the next to go cross country. Having gained altitude in a thermal, a pilot glides down to the next available thermal.\nPotential thermals can be identified by land features that typically generate thermals or by cumulus clouds, which mark the top of a rising column of warm, humid air as it reaches the dew point and condenses to form a cloud.\nCross-country pilots also need an intimate familiarity with air law, flying regulations, aviation maps indicating restricted airspace, etc.\nIn-flight wing deflation (collapse).\nSince the shape of the wing (airfoil) is formed by the moving air entering and inflating the wing, in turbulent air, part or all of the wing can deflate (collapse). Piloting techniques referred to as active flying will greatly reduce the frequency and severity of deflations or collapses. On modern recreational wings, such deflations will normally recover without pilot intervention. In the event of a severe deflation, correct pilot input will speed recovery from a deflation, but incorrect pilot input may slow the return of the glider to normal flight, so pilot training and practice in correct response to deflations are necessary.\nFor the rare occasions when it is not possible to recover from a deflation (or from other threatening situations such as a spin), most pilots carry a reserve (rescue, emergency) parachute (or even two); however, most pilots never have cause to \"throw\" their reserve. Should a wing deflation occur at low altitude, i.e., shortly after takeoff or just before landing, the wing (paraglider) may not recover its correct structure rapidly enough to prevent an accident, with the pilot often not having enough altitude remaining to deploy a reserve parachute [with the minimum altitude for this being approximately , but typical deployment to stabilization periods using up of altitude] successfully. Different packing methods of the reserve parachute affect its deploying time.\nLow-altitude wing failure can result in serious injury or death due to the subsequent velocity of a ground impact whereas a higher altitude failure may allow more time to regain some degree of control in the descent rate and, critically, deploy the reserve if needed. In-flight wing deflation and other hazards are minimized by flying a suitable glider and choosing appropriate weather conditions and locations for the pilot's skill and experience level.\nAs a competitive sport.\nThere are various disciplines of competitive paragliding:\nIn addition to these organized events it is also possible to participate in various online contests that require participants to upload flight track data to dedicated websites like OLC.\nSafety.\nParagliding, like any adventure sport, is a potentially dangerous activity. In the United States, for example, in 2010 (the last year for which details are available), one paraglider pilot died. This is an equivalent rate of one in 5,000 pilots. In 2019, YouTube personality Grant Thompson of The King Of Random died in a paraglider accident. Over the years 1994\u20132010, an average of seven in every 10,000 active paraglider pilots have been fatally injured, though with a marked improvement in recent years. In France (with over 25,000 registered fliers), two of every 10,000 pilots were fatally injured in 2011 (a rate that is not atypical of the years 2007\u20132011), although around six of every 1,000 pilots were seriously injured (more than two-day hospital stay).\nThe potential for injury can be significantly reduced by training and risk management. The use of proper equipment such as a wing designed for the pilot's size and skill level, as well as a helmet, a reserve parachute, and a cushioned harness also minimize risk. Pilot safety is influenced by an understanding of the site conditions such as air turbulence (rotors), strong thermals, gusty wind, and ground obstacles such as power lines. Sufficient pilot training in wing control and emergency manoeuvres from competent instructors can minimize accidents. Many paragliding accidents are the result of a combination of pilot error and poor flying conditions.\nSIV, short for Simulation d'Incident en Vol (simulation of incident in flight) instruction offers training in managing and preventing unstable and potentially dangerous situations such as collapses, full stalls, and cravattes. These courses are typically led by a specially trained instructor over large bodies of water, with the student usually being instructed via radio. Students will be taught how to induce dangerous situations, and thus learn how to both avoid and remedy them once induced. This course is recommended to pilots who are looking to move to more high performance and less stable wings, which is a natural progression for most pilots. In some countries a SIV course is a basic requirement of initial pilot training. In the event of an unrecoverable manoeuvre resulting in water landing, a rescue boat is typically dispatched to collect the pilot. Other added safety features may include buoyancy aids or secondary reserve parachutes. These courses are not considered essential for novice level flying.\nBefore scheduling a paragliding adventure, verify weather conditions to ensure flight safety. Check the pilot's qualifications, ensuring they hold a P4 or P5 certification, which includes extensive experience and training in emergency procedures. Engage with the pilot beforehand to assess their experience and ensure they are well-rested, as fatigue becomes a risk factor after multiple flights. Inspect the paragliding equipment for wear and tear, focusing on components like the canopy, brake lines, and reserve parachute, which should be regularly maintained. Finally, confirm the operator's licenses and permissions, and practice ground handling skills under guidance before takeoff to enhance safety and control.\nFitness and age.\nParagliding in ordinary circumstances is not especially demanding in terms of strength. It sometimes needs a pilot to walk with equipment to and from a launch site and this occasionally requires assistance from a friend or colleague. Age is more significant in people past their fifties. This especially relates to those with artificial joints. An unexpected or heavy landing can put enormous pressure on the bones which serve as anchors for hips and knee joints. Due to increasing loss of bone density in senior pilots, there is an increased risk that during a bad landing a bone may shatter and this considerably complicates moving to an appropriate treatment centre. Currently surgeons often rate these prosthetic joints as being suitable only for smooth, steady, work loads. But even for those with ordinary knees and hips there is often a stiffness in walking and running which has a negative effect on launching. Pilots who recognise this minor debility usually avoid strong wind launches, which may demand the pilot to move briskly towards the wing during inflation.\nThere are pilots still flying while in their nineties but these are exceptional and they may very well depend on specific assistance. It is important for individuals to consult a doctor following any serious health event. It is especially important to carry, in one's flight pack, an up-to-date list of details relating to medications and major health issues. [?]\nInstruction.\nMost popular paragliding regions have a number of schools, generally registered with and/or organized by national associations. Certification systems vary widely between countries, though around 10 days instruction to basic certification is standard.\nThere are several key components to a paragliding pilot certification instruction program. Initial training for beginning pilots usually begins with some amount of ground school to discuss the basics, including elementary theories of flight as well as basic structure and operation of the paraglider.\nStudents then learn how to control the glider on the ground, practising take-offs and controlling the wing 'overhead'. Low, gentle hills are next where students get their first short flights, flying at very low altitudes, to get used to the handling of the wing over varied terrain. Special winches can be used to tow the glider to low altitude in areas that have no hills readily available.\nAs their skills progress, students move on to steeper/higher hills (or higher winch tows), making longer flights, and learning to turn the glider, control the glider's speed, then moving on to 360\u00b0 turns, spot landings, 'big ears' (used to increase the rate of descent for the paraglider), and other more advanced techniques. Training instructions are often provided to the student via radio, particularly during the first flights.\nA third key component to a complete paragliding instructional program provides substantial background in the key areas of meteorology, aviation law, and general flight area etiquette.\nTo give prospective pilots a chance to determine if they would like to proceed with a full pilot training program, most schools offer tandem flights, in which an experienced instructor pilots the paraglider with the prospective pilot as a passenger. Schools often offer pilot's families and friends the opportunity to fly tandem, and sometimes sell tandem pleasure flights at holiday resorts.\nMost recognised courses lead to a national licence and an internationally recognised International Pilot Proficiency Information/Identification card. The IPPI specifies five stages of paragliding proficiency, from the entry level ParaPro 1 to the most advanced stage 5. Attaining a level of ParaPro 3 typically allows the pilot to fly solo or without instructor supervision.\nWorld records.\nFAI (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale) world records:\nOthers:\nRelated activities.\nSky diving.\nParachutes have the most resemblance with paragliders but the sports are very different. Whereas with sky diving the parachute is a tool to safely return to earth after free fall, the paraglider allows longer flights and the use of thermals.\nHang gliding.\nHang gliding is a close cousin, and hang glider and paraglider launches are often found in proximity to one another. Despite the considerable difference in equipment, the two activities offer similar pleasures, and some pilots are involved in both sports.\nPowered hang glider.\nFoot-launched powered hang gliders are powered by an engine and propeller in pusher configuration. An ordinary hang glider is used for its wing and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground.\nPowered paragliding.\nPowered paragliding is the flying of paragliders with a small engine known as a paramotor attached. Powered paragliding is known as paramotoring and requires extra training alongside regular paragliding training. It is often recommended to become competent in paragliding prior to learning to paramotor in order to know fully what one is doing.\nSpeed flying.\nSpeed flying, or \"speed riding\", is the separate sport of flying paragliders of a reduced size. These wings have increased speed, though they are not normally capable of soaring flight. The sport involves taking off on skis or on foot and swooping rapidly down in close proximity to a slope, even periodically touching it if skis are used. These smaller wings are also sometimes used where wind speeds are too high for a full-sized paraglider, although this is invariably at coastal sites where the wind is laminar and not subject to as much mechanical turbulence as inland sites.\nGliding.\nJust like sailplanes and hang gliders, paragliders use thermals to extend the time in the air. Air speed, glide ratio and flight distances are superior to the ones achieved by paragliders. Paragliders on the other hand are able to also facilitate thermals that are too small (because of the much larger turn radius) or too weak for gliding.\nParagliding can be of local importance as a commercial activity. Paid accompanied tandem flights are available in many mountainous regions, both in the winter and in the summer. In addition, there are many schools offering courses and guides who lead groups of more experienced pilots exploring an area. Finally, there are the manufacturers and the associated repair and after-sales services. Paraglider-like wings also find other uses, for example, in ship propulsion and wind energy exploitation, and are related to some forms of power kite. Kite skiing uses equipment similar to paragliding sails.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on Lake Superior in Minnesota's Arrowhead Region, the city is a hub for cargo shipping. The population was 86,697 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota's fifth-largest city. Duluth forms a metropolitan area with neighboring Superior, Wisconsin, called the Twin Ports. Duluth is south of the Iron Range and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. It is named after Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, the area's first known European explorer.\nDuluth is on the north shore of Lake Superior at the westernmost point of the Great Lakes. It is the largest metropolitan area, the second-largest city, and the largest U.S. city on the lake. Duluth is accessible to the Atlantic Ocean, away, via the Great Lakes Waterway and St. Lawrence Seaway. The Port of Duluth is the world's farthest inland port accessible to oceangoing ships and is the largest and busiest port on the Great Lakes. It is also among the top 20 U.S. ports by tonnage. Common items shipped from Duluth include coal, iron ore, grain, limestone, cement, salt, wood pulp, steel coil, and wind turbine parts.\nDuluth is a popular Midwest tourist destination. The city is home to the Great Lakes Aquarium, a freshwater aquarium. The Aerial Lift Bridge, next to Canal Park, crosses the Duluth Ship Canal into the Duluth\u2013Superior harbor. Minnesota Point, known locally as Park Point, is the world's longest freshwater baymouth bar, stretching . The city is also the starting point for road trips along the North Shore of Lake Superior to Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nNative history.\nThe Ojibwe occupied a historic settlement at \"Onigamiinsing\" (\"at the little portage\"), the portage across Minnesota Point between Lake Superior and western St. Louis Bay, which forms Duluth's harbor. For both the Ojibwe and the Dakota, interaction with Europeans during the contact period revolved around the fur trade and related activities.\nAccording to Ojibwe oral history, Spirit Island, near the Spirit Valley neighborhood, was the \"Sixth Stopping Place\" where the northern and southern branches of the Ojibwe Nation came together and proceeded to their \"Seventh Stopping Place\" near the present city of La Pointe, Wisconsin. The \"Stopping Places\" were places the Native Americans occupied during their westward migration because of their war with the Iroquois and as Europeans overran their territory.\nExploration and fur trade.\nSeveral factors brought fur traders to the Great Lakes in the early 17th century. The fashion for beaver hats in Europe generated demand for pelts. The French trade for beavers in the lower St. Lawrence River led to the depletion of the animals in the region by the late 1630s, after which the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver furs.\n\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers explored the Duluth area, Fond du Lac (Bottom of the Lake), in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where Grand Portage became a major trading center. The French explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the St. Louis River in 1679.\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the North West Company established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, as well as in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the Dakota, and other native tribes. The first post was where Superior, Wisconsin, later developed; known as Fort St. Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockade walls, two houses of each, a shed of , a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Native American peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed.\nIn 1808, German-born John Jacob Astor organized the American Fur Company. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day Fond du Lac on the St. Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with Lake Vermilion to the north and with the Mississippi River to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business around 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade continued until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions changed, and many American areas were getting over-trapped, causing game to decline.\nIn 1832, Henry Schoolcraft visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow based the Song of Hiawatha, his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft's writings.\nNatives signed two Treaties of Fond du Lac with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847; in them, the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa, the United States placed the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation upstream from Duluth near Cloquet, Minnesota.\nPermanent settlement.\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and subsequently relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations. Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of copper mining. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness lands for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a land rush, and led to the development of iron ore mining in the area. The 1854 Ojibwe Land Cession Treaty would force the Ojibwe onto what are now known as the Fond du Lac and Grand Portage Reservations, though some land rights such as hunting and fishing were retained.\nAround the same time, newly constructed channels and locks in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the Twin Cities was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the St. Louis River were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the Panic of 1857, caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 says: \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer. Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.\" The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek. While the brewery \"was not a pecuniary success\", it became the Fitger Brewing Company a few decades later.\nThe opening of the canal at Sault Ste. Marie in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach made Duluth the only port with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Soon, the lumber industry, railroads, and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand; storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a Fourth of July speech, Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years. When Jay Cooke, a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad to create an extension from St. Paul to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to iron ore mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the Fourth of July, 3,500 people were present to celebrate.\nIn the first \"Duluth Minnesotian\" printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited. However, lumber is cheap and shanties can be built. Everyone should bring blankets and come prepared to rough it at first.\nIn 1873, Cooke's empire crumbled, and the stock market crashed, causing Duluth to almost disappear from the map. But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and the completion of the railroads, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce, and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the Mesabi Range, and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio. The trade continued into the 20th century.\n\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\".\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative J. Proctor Knott of Kentucky gave in the U.S. House of Representatives on January 27, 1871. His speech opposing the St. Croix and Superior Land Grant lampooned Western boosterism, portraying Duluth as an Eden in fantastically florid terms. The speech has been reprinted in collections of folklore and humorous speeches and is regarded as a classic. The nearby city of Proctor, Minnesota, is named after Knott.\nDuluth's unofficial sister city, Duluth, Georgia, got its name in 1871 shortly after Knott's speech gained national attention. Prominent Georgia newspaperman and politician Evan Howell had been called upon to make remarks at the dedication of a new railroad line into Howell's Crossing, a village named for his grandfather. There, Howell humorously suggested that the community be called \"Duluth\" instead, and townspeople agreed.\nProctor Knott is sometimes credited with characterizing Duluth as the \"zenith city of the unsalted seas,\" but the honor for that coinage belongs to journalist Thomas Preston Foster, who spoke at a Fourth of July picnic in 1868.\n20th century.\nDuring the early 20th century, Duluth emerged as a significant industrial and shipping center, and was briefly the busiest port in the United States by tonnage. The city flourished economically, with ten newspapers, six banks, and the 11-story Torrey Building symbolizing its urban growth. As of 1905, Duluth was said to be home to the most millionaires per capita in the United States. The arrival of U.S. Steel in 1907 and subsequent development of the Duluth Works plant, which began production in 1915, further stimulated expectations of rapid population growth. Alongside the plant, the company built Morgan Park as a model company town. Numerous manufacturing firms, including the Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company and Marshall Wells Hardware, further diversified the city's industrial base.\nBecause of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century. It became the center of one of the largest Finnish communities in the world outside Finland. For decades, a Finnish-language daily newspaper, \"P\u00e4iv\u00e4lehti,\" was published in the city, named after the former Grand Duchy of Finland's pro-independence liberal paper. The Finnish community of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) members published the widely read labor newspaper \"Industrialisti.\" From 1907 to 1941, the Finnish Socialist Federation and then the IWW operated Work People's College, an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. Immigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth. At one time, Duluth was home to several historic immigrant neighborhoods, including Little Italy. Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth's population, accounting for more than a third of the residents identifying European ancestry.\nIn 1918, Finnish immigrant Olli Kinkkonen was lynched by the Knights of Liberty for refusing military service, a reflection of World War I-era nationalist fervor. In 1920, three African American circus workers\u2014Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie\u2014were lynched by a white mob in the Duluth lynchings after a false accusation of rape. In 1970, journalist Michael Fedo wrote \"The Lynchings in Duluth\", which began to raise awareness of the event. In 2003, the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial was dedicated at the lynching site, and the CJMM Committee continues to promote racial justice and public education in their memory.\nTragedy struck again when the 1918 Cloquet Fire ravaged northeastern Minnesota, including the Duluth area. It remains the deadliest natural disaster in Minnesota history. The fire destroyed numerous rural communities, leaving hundreds dead and thousands homeless. The Duluth Minnesota National Guard unit was deployed to battle the fire and assist survivors. Retired \"Duluth News Tribune\" columnist and journalist Jim Heffernan wrote that his mother \"recalled an overnight vigil watching out the window of their small home on lower Piedmont Avenue with her father, her younger sisters having gone to sleep, ready to be evacuated to the waterfront should the need arise. The fire never made it that far down the hill, but devastated what is now Piedmont Heights, and, of course, a widespread area of Northeastern Minnesota.\" In the fire's aftermath, tens of thousands of people were left injured or homeless; many of the refugees fled into the city for aid and shelter.\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, Duluth continued to grow as an industrial port town, shipping iron ore from the Mesabi Range and supporting a network of grain elevators, mills, and factories. The Aerial Lift Bridge (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and was the United States' first transporter bridge. Only one other like it was ever constructed in the country. Duluth played a critical role in wartime production during both world wars, especially through shipbuilding in Riverside, a neighborhood created to house workers. The population peaked in 1960 at 107,884.\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the Iron Range north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore (taconite) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Duluth was hit hard by the U.S. steel crisis, leading to the closure of the Duluth Works plant in 1981 and other dependent industries, including the cement factory. The resulting economic downturn devastated the city, especially the West Side, and unemployment rose sharply, peaking at 15% by the late 1980s.\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend Interstate 35 through Duluth and up the North Shore, bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered. The Minnesota Department of Transportation then agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels, which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erikson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.\n21st century.\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to tourism. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick, and skywalks and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new Canal Park as a tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\nIn the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to the tourist industry's expansion. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\nA group of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have been rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014, at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred, and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios. Due to the neighborhood's revitalization, many developers are also investing in housing projects in anticipation of further growth.\nDuluth's prominence as a port city gave it an economic advantage in its early years, but as various industries began to wane, new efforts to reclaim areas of the waterfront for public use emerged. Notable among them is the reclamation of the St. Louis River corridor, which runs along the edge of the city's western neighborhoods. Many of these sites, filled with legacy pollutants from industrial use, have been or are in the process of being restored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with several developments, such as Pier B Resort and Hotel, demonstrating the revitalization opportunity of these spaces. The Duluth Waterfront Collective has led other efforts to reclaim waterfront space, including the Highway 61 Revisited concept, which seeks to reimagine the I-35 corridor as it runs through the city's downtown. While the acreage of land using the waterway for port-related purposes has shifted in recent years, the goods shipped through the Duluth\u2013Superior port have changed with the economy. In recent decades, shipments of coal and iron ore have declined while shipments of wind turbine components and multimodal shipping containers have increased.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by Hibbing. Duluth's canal connects Lake Superior to the Duluth\u2013Superior harbor and the Saint Louis River. It is spanned by the Aerial Lift Bridge, which connects Canal Park with Minnesota Point (or \"Park Point\"). Minnesota Point is about long and, when included with adjacent Wisconsin Point, which extends from the city of Superior, Wisconsin, is the largest freshwater baymouth bar in the world at a total of .\nDuluth's topography is dominated by a steep hillside that climbs from Lake Superior to high inland elevations. Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest\", alluding to San Francisco's similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an inclined railroad, the 7th Avenue West Incline Railway, that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The weather station at the lakeside Sky Harbor Airport on Minnesota Point has an elevation of , while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is higher at .\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, making Duluth a primarily southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as Piedmont Heights and Bayview Heights, are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. Skyline Parkway is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the Gary\u2013New Duluth neighborhood near the western end of the city to the Lester Park neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\nA developing part of the city is the Miller Hill Mall area, as well as the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strips \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's Miller Hill area improved movement through the U.S. Highway 53 corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\nGeological history.\nDuluth's geology demonstrates the Midcontinent Rift, formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the Earth's crust thinned, magma rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a -thick sill, primarily of gabbro, which is known as the Duluth Complex.\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of continental glaciers that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the sandstone that filled the axis of the rift valley but encountered more resistance from the igneous rocks forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, water filled the lake as high as above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, Glacial Lake Duluth. The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time, a large number of quarries produced the stone, after which it was sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior brownstone; such stone was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.\nClimate.\nDuluth has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\"), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior. Winters are long, snowy, and very cold, normally seeing maximum temperatures remaining at or below for 100 days (the second-most of any city in the contiguous US behind International Falls), falling to or below on 38 nights, and bringing consistent snow cover from late November to early April. Winter storms that pass south or east of Duluth can often set up easterly or northeasterly flow, leading to occasional upslope lake-effect snow events that bring or more of snow to the city while areas inland receive considerably less. The average annual snowfall is . The lake steams in the winter when moist lake-warmed air at the surface rises and cools, losing some of its moisture-carrying capacity.\nUsing data on the minimum monthly temperature between 1981 and 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a Comparative Climatic Data report. With a minimum average monthly low temperature of and a maximum average monthly low temperature of , Duluth was found to be the fifth-coldest city in the United States.\nSummers are warm, although nights are generally cool, with daytime temperatures averaging in July, with that figure being a few degrees warmer inland. Temperatures reach or exceed on average only two days per year, while the city has officially seen temperatures on only three days, all during the July 1936 heat wave from the Dust Bowl years. The phrase \"cooler by the lake\" can be heard often in weather forecasts during the summer, especially on days when an easterly wind is expected. Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly hilltop and shoreside. Often, this variation manifests itself as snow in higher elevations, whereas rain falls near Lake Superior.\nThe record low temperature in Duluth is , set on January 2, 1885. The record high temperature is , set on July 13, 1936. On average, the first freezing temperature occurs on September 30 and the last on May 14, although a freezing temperature has occurred in August. The average window for measurable (\u2265) snowfall is October 22 through April 26.\n2012 flooding.\nOn June 19\u201320, 2012, Duluth suffered the worst flood in its history, caused by of rain in 30 hours. Combined with its rocky sediments, hard soil, and 43 streams and creeks, the city could not handle the massive rainfall. Mayor Don Ness declared a state of emergency, asking for national assistance. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton declared a state of emergency, sending the National Guard and the Red Cross to assist in the relief efforts. Several sinkholes opened throughout the city, causing massive property damage. Several feet of standing water accumulated in many city alleys and parking lots. Streets were turned into rapids, and many roads split apart due to the heavy flow of water. A portion of West Skyline Parkway tumbled down the hill, isolating a neighborhood. The Saint Louis River, in Duluth's Fond du Lac neighborhood, flooded Highway 23, isolating that neighborhood as well and damaging roadways and bridges.\nThe Lake Superior Zoo flooded in the early hours of June 20; 11 barnyard animals drowned, as did a turkey vulture, a raven, and a snowy owl. The rising waters enabled a polar bear to escape her exhibit, though she was quickly found on zoo grounds, tranquilized, and moved to safety. Two harbor seals escaped the zoo grounds but were later found on Grand Avenue. All three animals were moved to Como Park Zoo in Saint Paul for a temporary but indeterminate amount of time. The polar bear was transferred to the Kansas City Zoo in 2012 as part of the American Zoological Association's (AZA) Species Survival Program breeding recommendation.\n2012 tornado.\nTornadoes are uncommon in Duluth, considering its latitude and location next to the climate-moderating Lake Superior. But on August 9, 2012, at around 11 a.m., a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it a true tornado. It quickly dissipated but soon touched down again on Superior's Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage; the tornado was categorized as an EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. At the time, the National Weather Service reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The \"News Tribune\" reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935:Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds [and] a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2023 American Community Survey, there were 38,843 estimated households in Duluth with an average of 2.15 persons per household.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years, it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota, as well as of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta. The Port of Duluth handles an average of 35 million short tons of cargo and nearly 900 vessel visits each year. 90 percent of the port's vessels are \"Lakers\", ships that ship goods exclusively among the upper four Great Lakes and are too large to transit the Welland Canal. The rest are \"Salties\", ships that can traverse the seaway all the way from the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Twin Ports has attracted several new engineering firms, including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, Enbridge, and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields including Loll Designs and Epicurean, two sister companies that make eco-friendly furniture and kitchen utensils respectively, and microbrewery Bent Paddle. Women's clothing retail chain Maurices is also headquartered in Duluth, as are luggage manufacturers and suppliers Duluth Pack and Frost River. In 1989, the workwear and accessories brand Duluth Trading Company was founded on a barge in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000. Supermarket chain Super One Foods is also based in the Twin Ports, with its headquarters in neighboring Hermantown.\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the University of Minnesota Duluth. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses includes ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and Ecolab.\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic North Shore via Highway 61 and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the Superior National Forest, Voyageurs National Park, Lake Vermilion, and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Tourists also may drive on the North Shore Scenic Drive to Gooseberry Falls State Park, Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of Palisade Head, Isle Royale National Park (reached via ferry), Grand Portage National Monument in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). Thunder Bay, Ontario, can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city. Mayor Don Ness called it \"the single most important volunteer effort in our city's history\". After reforming and restructuring the benefits and a court case that went all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, in 2013 the liability stood at an estimated $191 million. In 2014, Ness announced \"a full solution for the retiree health care issue that once threatened to bankrupt our city\".\nTop employers.\nAccording to the city's 2024 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Duluth's 10 largest employers are:\nAviation.\nSeveral multinational aviation corporations operate near Duluth. Since 1994, the city has been home to the headquarters and main manufacturing facilities of Cirrus Aircraft, a company with nearly 1,600 Duluth employees (as of 2023) building the world's best-selling general aviation aircraft, the SR22, and the world's first single-engine personal jet, the Vision SF50. James Fallows, national correspondent for \"The Atlantic\", said that Cirrus' rapid growth in Duluth over the years \"was a major, major factor in the town's modern emergence\". Former mayor Gary Doty called the arrival of Cirrus in the mid-1990s a \"crucial turning point\" for Duluth and said it was \"the catalyst for more positive attitudes about the city... If that hadn't happened, then we might really have been in a tailspin.\" As of 2024, the company is Duluth's largest manufacturer and third-largest employer. In January 2012, another aircraft manufacturer, Kestrel Aircraft, maker of the K-350 turboprop plane and later known as ONE Aviation, moved to the Twin Ports. In October of that year, AAR Corp opened an aircraft repair and maintenance facility at the Duluth airport. Both companies ceased operations in the region during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn January 2013, the Duluth International Airport opened a new terminal, now named the U.S. Representative James L. Oberstar Terminal after the late Jim Oberstar.\nThe Air National Guard's 148th Fighter Wing is at the Duluth Air National Guard Base and is the city's sixth-largest employer as of 2022. It is one of a handful of National Guard units with an active association which, in the 148th's case, means having the capability to provide training for Air Force pilots. The 179th Fighter Squadron is a unit of the 148th.\nMinnesota's largest airshow, the http://, takes place each year on the grounds of Duluth International Airport.\nArts and culture.\nDuluth hosts a variety of museums and cultural institutions. It is the starting point of the North Shore of Lake Superior scenic route that runs from Duluth, at the southwestern end of the lake, to Thunder Bay and Nipigon in the north and Sault Ste. Marie in the east. The route was already a popular tourist destination after 1855, when the Great Lakes lock system first allowed steamboats onto the lake and eastern tourists began to travel onto Lake Superior for recreational purposes. By the mid-1870s, many excursion boats, coastal steamers, and ferries ran along the North Shore, primarily out of Duluth and Thunder Bay. After docking in Duluth, tourists often canoed or were ferried up the North Shore, staying in hunting and fishing camps and later hotels and small cabins.\nThe Duluth Children's Museum, founded in 1930, is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the U.S. Located in Lincoln Park, it offers interactive exhibits and educational programming, with a collection of over 25,000 artifacts focusing on regional history, including Indigenous and immigrant cultures. Other museums include the Tweed Museum of Art at the University of Minnesota Duluth and the Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum. The Historic Old Central High School, built in 1892 and notable for its 230-foot clock tower modeled after Big Ben, was once home to a local museum. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is an example of Romanesque architecture and was sold to developers in 2022.\nThe Duluth Art Institute, housed in the Duluth Depot downtown, features galleries, studios, and educational programming. The city is also home to the Minnesota Ballet and Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra. In the summer, free concerts are held in Chester Park. The Bayfront Blues Festival is held in early August.

The Playhouse also hosts a respected theater education program.\nSince 2004, Duluth has celebrated Pride with a parade on Labor Day weekend. Since 1998, the city has held the Homegrown Music Festival in the first week of May; it features over 170 local musical acts performing across the city. The Junior Achievement High School ROCKS\u2013Battle of the Bands showcases middle-school and high-school bands from central Minnesota to the Canada\u2013U.S. border and northern Wisconsin at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC) in mid-April. Duluth also hosts the Northeastern Minnesota Book Awards, honoring books about the region.\nAttractions.\nOnce a warehouse district, Canal Park has become a hub of restaurants, shops, and recreation. A walking path offers views of Lake Superior, Park Point's sand dunes, and the Aerial Lift Bridge, which spans the Duluth Ship Canal. The seven-mile Lakewalk passes landmarks like Leif Erikson Park and the Duluth Rose Garden, ending at Bayfront Festival Park, which hosts concerts and events.\nAmong Duluth's most visited attractions is the Great Lakes Aquarium, a freshwater-focused facility showcasing ecosystems such as the Amazon River and Great Lakes Basin. Nearby, the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center features shipwreck artifacts and interactive exhibits, including a replica ship's pilot house. The wreck of the \"Thomas Wilson\", an early-20th-century whaleback ore boat, lies underwater less than outside the Duluth Ship Canal. The , a retired U.S. Steel flagship, now serves as a floating museum.\nThe Lake Superior Railroad Museum, in the Duluth Union Depot, houses a collection of locomotives and rolling stock, including the William Crooks and a rare Yellowstone locomotive. From there, the North Shore Scenic Railroad operates heritage excursions to Two Harbors, Minnesota, during the summer and fall. Other notable historic and cultural sites include the Fitger's Brewery Complex, established in the 19th century and now home to shops, restaurants, and a brewery museum; the Glensheen Historic Estate, a 38-room Jacobean mansion on Lake Superior's shore; and the Lake Superior Zoo, which spans 16 acres and features species from around the world.\nDuluth's natural attractions are numerous. Enger Tower, atop Enger Hill, provides panoramic views of the region. Hawk Ridge, on Skyline Parkway, is a renowned bird-watching site during the autumn raptor migration. Gichi-Ode' Akiing Park, named for the Ojibwe for \"a grand heart place\", includes a memorial to Kechewaishke, whose 1849 petition helped preserve Anishinaabe land in the area.\nEvents.\nThe city hosts several annual events. The Duluth Airshow, Minnesota's largest, brings military and civilian flight teams to Duluth International Airport. The John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, held in January, is one of the longest races in the lower 48 states and serves as a preparatory event for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. In May, the Magic Smelt Parade celebrates the smelt run with music and costume, modeled after New Orleans-style Second Line Parade.\nGrandma's Marathon, founded in 1977, attracts runners from around the world to a lakeside course between Two Harbors and Canal Park; the same route is used for the North Shore Inline Marathon. In November, the Christmas City of the North Parade kicks off the holiday season with marching bands and floats. During November and December, the Bentleyville Tour of Lights transforms Bayfront Festival Park into a walk-through holiday display featuring over five million lights.\nSports.\nDuluth has a varied sports history, including hosting two early National Football League teams: the Duluth Kelleys/Eskimos (1923\u20131925; 1926\u20131927), the latter inspiring the 2008 film \"Leatherheads\". In baseball, the Duluth\u2013Superior Dukes played at Wade Stadium from 1993 to 2002 in the independent Northern League, winning the 1997 championship; an earlier Northern League was also in operation off and on from 1902 to 1971 in the city. In boxing, Horton's Gym (later Jungle Boy Boxing Gym) trained notable Minnesota fighters including Zach \"Jungle Boy\" Walters and Andy Kolle. Duluth also briefly hosted the Duluth-Superior Lumberjacks in the IFL (1999\u20132000), and in 2023, the city was announced as home to the Duluth Harbor Monsters, a team in the newly formed Arena League, beginning play at the DECC Arena in 2024.\nIn hockey, the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's and women's teams earn national acclaim. The men's team, with notable alumni such as Brett Hull and Matt Niskanen, won NCAA national championships in 2011, 2018, and 2019, playing before large crowds at Amsoil Arena, opened in 2010. The women's team has claimed five NCAA titles (2001\u201303, 2008, 2010), with memorable wins including a triple-overtime victory in 2010 and a dramatic double-overtime goal in 2003. The city has also hosted multiple Frozen Four tournaments. In baseball, Duluth supports several amateur teams including the Duluth Xpress, Twin Ports North Stars, and the collegiate summer team Duluth Huskies, who play at Wade Stadium and feature college talent. Local high schools also field competitive teams.\nOther amateur sports are well-represented.

The Park Point Recreation Area near the end of Park Point has a community center, numerous pavilions, a swimming beach, sand volleyball court, picnic tables and grills, and a boat launch. Park Point Pine Forest, at the tip of Park Point, is popular for bird-watching in the spring and fall when shorebirds use the area as a resting point during their migration. A shipping schedule of ships entering the harbor is available, as well as five live cams including a cam of the canal, the lift bridge, and the beach.\nOther parks include historic Lester Park, one of Duluth's most popular parks. Just upstream from where Amity Creek joins the Lester River, a large, deep pool has formed that attracts cliff diving. Amity Creek is the site of The Seven Bridges Road, a four-mile section of Skyline Parkway where it follows Amity Creek from the top of the bluffs down to Lake Superior. The 400-foot drop has resulted in a long cascade of waterfalls.\nDuluth's other parks include Congdon Park, Hartley Park, Chester Park, Bayfront Festival Park, Cascade Park, Enger Park, Lincoln Park, Brewer Park, Fairmount Park, Indian Point Park, Magney\u2013Snively Park, and Fond du Lac Park, as well as some small neighborhood parks and athletic fields.

Hartley Park also has a nature center. Lester Park and Enger Park have public golf courses. Fairmount Park has the Lake Superior Zoo. Jay Cooke State Park is a Minnesota state park about southwest of Duluth. The park is along the Saint Louis River and is one of Minnesota's 10 most visited state parks.\nLeif Erikson Park.\nThe \"Leif Erikson\", a replica Viking ship built in Norway to commemorate the voyage of Norse explorer Leif Erikson to North America in c.\u20091000 CE, was brought to Duluth in 1927 by invitation of Norwegian-American businessman H. H. Borgen. After completing a transatlantic journey, the ship was greeted by large crowds and soon purchased by local resident Emil Olson, who donated it to the city. It was displayed in what became Leif Erikson Park, but decades of exposure and vandalism led to severe deterioration. In 1980, the idea of a ceremonial Viking burning inspired Olson's grandson, Will Borg, to lead a restoration effort. Despite fundraising and partial restorations starting in 1991, progress was slow, and although the ship was declared fully restored in 2015, it remained in storage as of 2022 due to the absence of a proper display structure.\nLeif Erikson Park also includes the Duluth Rose Garden, a six-acre formal English-style garden perched above a highway tunnel along Lake Superior. Featuring over 3,000 rose bushes and 12,000 additional plantings, the garden is known for its labeled varieties, informational signage, and scenic design, including brick paths, an antique horse fountain, and a marble gazebo. The space is a popular site for summer weddings and community gatherings. In 1956, a bronze statue of Leif Erikson by John Karl Daniels was added to the park. The statue was donated by the Norwegian American League and members of the community.\nRecreation.\nDuluth offers numerous outdoor activities, including fishing, hiking, skiing, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, surfing, trail running, and mountain biking.\nThe city features two public golf courses (including Ridgeview Country Club), multiple private clubs, public and private tennis courts, and numerous indoor and outdoor ice rinks, including curling facilities. The University of Minnesota Duluth's Recreational Sports Outdoor Program provides instruction in kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing, sea kayaking, and rock climbing, and organizes events like the St. Louis River Whitewater Rendezvous. Duluth also hosts a 3 segment of the Superior Hiking Trail and the Piedmont mountain biking trail, offering scenic views of the surrounding natural landscape.\nSkiing is popular in the area, particularly at Spirit Mountain, Minnesota's second-highest ski hill at . Nordic skiing is also well supported, with many parks providing groomed trails for skate and classic styles. Chester Bowl, a city-owned ski area, offers extremely affordable lift tickets. Duluth's active sailing and rowing community is centered around local yacht and rowing clubs. The city hosts the biennial Trans Superior Race, one of the world's longest freshwater sailing races at almost , and triennial Tall Ships festivals, which draw hundreds of thousands of spectators.\nSurfing on Lake Superior has grown in popularity, with spots like Park Point, Lester River, and Stoney Point favored by locals when strong northeast winds produce adequate waves. Duluth is also known for Lake Superior agate hunting, particularly along Park Point, where natural forces renew the shoreline annually. The state's official gemstone, agates are found throughout the area's beaches, streams, and gravel cuts, with guidebooks available for enthusiasts.\nGovernment.\nDuluth is in Minnesota's 8th congressional district, represented by Republican Pete Stauber. It has a mayor\u2013council form of government. The mayor is Roger Reinert, who took office in 2024 after defeating incumbent Emily Larson, the city's first female mayor. The Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party has controlled the mayor's office continuously since 1975. Duluth's longest-serving mayor was Samuel F. Snively, serving from 1921 to 1937. He is remembered for his initiatives creating parks and boulevards, such as the Seven Bridges Road and Skyline Parkway.\nThe City Administration makes policy proposals to a nine-member City Council. Duluth's five representational districts are divided into 36 precincts. Each district elects its own councilor. There are also four at-large councilors, representing the entire city. The City Council elects a president who presides over meetings.\nDuluth is the heart of the state's 8th legislative district, represented in the Minnesota Senate by Jen McEwen and in the Minnesota House of Representatives by Liish Kozlowski (District 8B) and Peter Johnson (District 8A)\u2014all members of the Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party, which has long dominated the city's (as well as the state's) politics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Presidential election results 1960\u20132024\nEducation.\nLocal colleges and universities include the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD); the UMD campus includes a medical school. The UMD Bulldogs won the Division I National Hockey Championship in 2011, 2018 and 2019. Other schools include The College of St. Scholastica, Lake Superior College, and Duluth Business University. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior and Northwood Technical College are in nearby Superior, Wisconsin.\nThe Duluth Public Schools school district covers the majority of the municipality, and most public schools are administered by Duluth Public Schools. The schools have open enrollment. ISD 709 (Independent School District number 709) is now undertaking a reconstruction of all area schools under a program called the \"Red Plan.\" The Red Plan's goals are the reconstruction of some older schools (to meet new educational guidelines) and the construction of four new school buildings. The new schools will result in the redistricting of many students. As of 2009, the Red Plan was and is being contested in court by some citizens because of the cost of implementing the plan and because of the choice of construction management contractor.\nOne other school district, Proctor Public School District, covers a small part of southwest Duluth. Several independent and public charter schools also serve Duluth students. The largest is Duluth Edison Charter Schools, a public charter school covering grades K-8. Marshall School, a private college preparatory school founded as Duluth Cathedral in 1904, covers grades 4\u201312. Duluth's Catholic school system, Stella Maris Academy, has four campuses providing Catholic education from early childhood to high school. There are also two Protestant schools, two Montessori schools, and six other charter and private schools.\nDue to its proximity to the Great Lakes, Duluth is the location for the Large Lakes Observatory. The Large Lakes Observatory operates the largest university-owned research vessel in the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron. Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997; sailed from Portland, Maine, up the St. Lawrence Seaway, to Duluth; and converted into a limnological research vessel during the winter of 1997\u201398. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes.\nMedia.\nLocal newspapers include the monthly \"BusinessNorth\" and the twice-weekly \"Duluth News Tribune\". Free newspapers include the \"Transistor\", \"The Zenith\", and \"The Reader Weekly\".\nLocally based, nationally distributed magazines include \"Lake Superior Magazine\" and \"New Moon Magazine\".\nMajor television affiliates serving the area include KBJR-TV and KDLH, WDIO-DT, and KQDS-TV.\nMost commercial radio stations in the Duluth-Superior market are owned by Midwest Communications or Townsquare Media. Townsquare owns the oldest station in the market, WEBC, which signed on June 1, 1924. Midwest owns KQDS-FM, the market's highest-rated station.\nNumerous non-commercial stations can also be heard in the market, including stations affiliated with Wisconsin Public Radio and Minnesota Public Radio.\nInfrastructure.\nPublic transportation.\nThe local bus system is run by the Duluth Transit Authority (DTA), which serves Duluth, Hermantown, Proctor, Rice Lake, and Superior, Wisconsin. The DTA runs a system of buses manufactured by Gillig and Proterra, including new hybrids and battery electric busses. Duluth is also served by Skyline Shuttle, with daily service to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport; Jefferson Lines, with daily service to the Twin Cities; and Indian Trails, with service to Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\nRailways.\nDuluth was connected to Minneapolis by the \"North Star\" passenger train from 1978 to 1985. The North Shore Scenic Railroad operated seasonal excursion trains on its line to Two Harbors. The former Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway, now part of the Canadian National Railway, operates taconite-hauling trains in the area. Duluth is also served by the BNSF Railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Union Pacific Railroad.\nA proposal to restore service between the Twin Cities and the Twin Ports via the Northern Lights Express was first made in 2000. Detailed plans and environmental assessments have since been completed, but the project has yet to be fully funded.\nAir Transport.\nDuluth International Airport (KDLH) serves the city and surrounding region with daily flights to Minneapolis and Chicago. Nearby municipal airports are Duluth Sky Harbor on Minnesota Point and the Richard I. Bong Airport in Superior. Both the Bong Airport and Bong Bridge are named for famed World War II pilot and highest-scoring American World War II air ace Major Richard Ira \"Dick\" Bong, a native of nearby Poplar, Wisconsin.\nHighways.\nThe Duluth area marks the northern endpoint of Interstate Highway 35, which stretches south to Laredo, Texas. U.S. Highways that serve the area are U.S. Highway 53, which stretches from La Crosse, Wisconsin, to International Falls, and U.S. Highway 2, which stretches from Everett, Washington, to St. Ignace, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The southwestern part of the city has Thompson Hill, where travelers entering Duluth on I-35 can see most of Duluth, including the Aerial Lift Bridge and the waterfront. There are two freeway connections from Duluth to Superior. U.S. 2 provides a connection into Superior via the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge; Interstate 535 runs concurrently with U.S. 53 over the John Blatnik Bridge.\nMany state highways serve the area. Highway 23 runs diagonally across Minnesota, indirectly connecting Duluth to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Highway 33 provides a western bypass of Duluth connecting Interstate 35, which comes up from the Twin Cities to U.S. 53, which leads to Iron Range cities and International Falls. Highway 61 provides access to Thunder Bay, Ontario, via the North Shore of Lake Superior. Highway 194 provides a spur route into the city of Duluth known as \"Central Entrance\" and Mesaba Avenue. Wisconsin Highway 13 reaches along Lake Superior's South Shore. Wisconsin Highway 35 runs along Wisconsin's western border for to its southern terminus at the Wisconsin\u2013Illinois border ( north of East Dubuque). Highway 61 and parts of Highways 2 and 53 are segments of the Lake Superior Circle Tour route that follows Lake Superior through Minnesota, Ontario, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\nPort of Duluth\u2013Superior.\nAt the western end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, the Duluth\u2013Superior port is North America's largest and farthest-inland freshwater port. The port handles an average of of cargo and over 1,100 visits each year from domestic and international vessels. With of waterfront, it is one of North America's leading bulk cargo ports and ranks among the top 20 ports in the U.S. Duluth is a major shipping port for taconite pellets, made from concentrated low-grade iron ore and destined for midwestern and eastern steel mills. The arrival schedule of the ships that pass under the bridge is available, and locals and visitors gather to watch them enter the harbor. Despite their size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March.\nTwo types of ships regularly enter the port: the lakers and the salties. The lakers, which comprise over 90% of the port traffic, are the larger cargo ships built specially to sail the Great Lakes, with the largest ones over 1,000 feet long. They are mostly self-unloaders, with a long boom mounted on the upper deck. Their traffic is limited to the Great Lakes because they are too large to fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway. The salties are smaller ships with a maximum size of 740 feet. They typically have sharply cutaway bows as compared to the lakers' vertical ones, as well as a series of cranes rising above their decks. They are small enough to navigate the St. Lawrence Seaway. Other than their size, they can also be identified by their color, often blue, red, or green. The lakers are generally black or rust.\nUtilities.\nDuluth gets electric power from Duluth-based Minnesota Power, a subsidiary of ALLETE, Inc. Minnesota Power produces energy at generation facilities throughout northern Minnesota and a generation plant in North Dakota. The latter supplies electricity into the MP system by the Square Butte HVDC line, which ends near the town. Minnesota Power primarily uses western coal to generate electricity but also has a number of small hydroelectric facilities, the largest of which is the Thomson Dam southwest of Duluth on the Saint Louis River. Because of wind energy demand, Duluth has recently become a port for wind energy parts shipments from overseas and the Midwestern hub for shipments out to various wind energy sites.\nDuluth's water supply is sourced from Lake Superior and treated at the Lakewood Water Treatment Plant. The plant's oldest structure, the Lakewood Pumphouse, was built in 1896 in Romanesque Revival style, replacing older facilities that had been unable to prevent a typhoid epidemic. It was designed by William Patton. A 42-inch original main from 1896, one of two leaving the facility with clean, treated water, is still in use today. The system supplies approximately 100,000 people in Duluth and nearby towns. Throughout its history, Duluth's sewers have overflowed when it rains, causing untreated sewage to flow into Lake Superior and the Saint Louis River. In 2001 alone, the overflow amounted to over .\nFire department.\nAccording to a 2013 report, the city of Duluth was protected by 132 paid, professional firefighters from the Duluth Fire Department that year. The Duluth Fire Department responded to 12,231 fire and emergency medical calls in 2015.\nThe Duluth Fire Department operates out of eight fire stations, under the command of an Assistant Chief, Squad 251. The department also operates a fire apparatus fleet of six engines, one tower ladder, two quints, one heavy-duty rescue, two light medical response vehicles, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units.\nDuluth innovations.\nNotable innovations established in Duluth include:\nSister cities.\nDuluth has five sister cities:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay was loosely based on Whit Masterson's novel \"Badge of Evil\" (1956). The cast included Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff and Marlene Dietrich.\nUniversal-International commissioned the film adaptation of the novel in April 1956. Albert Zugsmith was selected as producer, who then hired television writer Paul Monash to write the script. Heston was brought on board to star in January 1957 and suggested that Welles direct the project. Welles was hired to direct and star, as well as re-write the script. Filming started the next month and wrapped in April. During the film's post-production, creative differences between Welles and Universal executives arose and Welles was forced off the film. Subsequently, Universal-International revised the film's editing style to be more conventional and ordered re-shoots to be made in November 1957. In response to the new version, Welles wrote a 58-page memo in which he elaborately outlined his creative vision for the film and asked that his version be restored.\nInitially dismissed by film critics, \"Touch of Evil\" found popularity among European audiences and won top awards at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival. During the 1970s, its reputation was rehabilitated and it is now widely regarded as one of Welles's best motion pictures and one of the last and best of the classic-era noir films. In 1998, Walter Murch re-edited \"Touch of Evil\" according to Welles's original vision, as outlined in his memo.\nIn 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nAlong the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, a time bomb placed inside a vehicle explodes, killing two people. Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas, who is honeymooning in town with his new American wife Susie, takes an interest in the investigation, which is being conducted by veteran police captain Hank Quinlan and his devoted, admiring, fanatically loyal assistant, Pete Menzies. Quinlan is a recovering alcoholic and an anti-Mexican bigot. He injured his leg long ago, and now walks with a prosthetic \"game\" leg and a cane. He implicates Sanchez, a young Mexican man secretly married to the victim's daughter. During the interrogation at Sanchez's apartment, Menzies finds two sticks of dynamite in a shoe-box in the bathroom. Vargas, who had accidentally knocked over the shoe-box a few minutes earlier and found it empty, accuses Quinlan of planting the dynamite, and begins to suspect that many of his previous convictions were similarly tainted. Quinlan angrily dismisses Vargas's allegation. Vargas learns that Quinlan had recently purchased dynamite and presents proof of this to Adair, the District Attorney, who resists investigating further.\n\"Uncle\" Joe Grandi, the acting leader of a crime family Vargas has been investigating, makes common cause with Quinlan against Vargas, and plies Quinlan with bourbon whiskey, causing him to break his sobriety. Grandi orders his family to capture and inject Susie with heroin, and while she is unconscious, he and Quinlan lock her in a hotel room. Quinlan then murders Grandi and leaves the body there with Susie; however, drunk and exhausted, he carelessly also leaves his cane in the room with them. When Susie wakes up and sees the body, she screams for help, and gets arrested on suspicion of the murder, which infuriates Vargas. Searching the room, Menzies finds Quinlan's cane, and realizes that Quinlan is the real killer.\nVargas, reviewing Quinlan's past successes, confirms his suspicion that Quinlan has planted evidence in many of the cases. He confronts Menzies, who sadly agrees to work with him to expose Quinlan, by wearing a wire and getting a confession.\nQuinlan hears an echo from Vargas' recording device, and realizes that Menzies is betraying him. He shoots and mortally wounds Menzies. He then aims his gun at Vargas, but the dying Menzies shoots Quinlan before he can fire. Susie is exonerated and reunited with Vargas. As Quinlan dies, it is revealed that Sanchez has confessed to the original bombing.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Charlton Heston as Ramon Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn March 1956, the mystery novel \"Badge of Evil\" was released to generally favorable reviews and its sales were brisk, with two printings in hardcover. Edward Muhl, the head of production of Universal-International, believed the novel had cinematic possibilities and arranged to purchase the film rights through the literary agency Curtis Brown. By April 1956, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that the film rights had been acquired and that Albert Zugsmith (known as the \"King of the Bs\") had been tapped as producer. Zugsmith then assigned television writer Paul Monash to write the script adaptation within four weeks. Zugsmith then read Monash's script, but did not care for it and temporarily halted any further development on the project. By December 1956, Zugsmith had received a memo from Universal executive Mel Tucker inquiring about the development of \"Badge of Evil\" and suggested the possibility of casting Charlton Heston as the lead.\nBy January 1957, having just finished promoting \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), Heston had received the script and considered it good enough. The actor contacted Universal to ask who they had considered to direct. They told him that they did not know, but Orson Welles was lined up as Hank Quinlan. Heston then replied, \"Why not him direct, too. He's pretty good\" to which the studio responded \"We'll get back to you.\" Universal studio head executives Ernest Nims and Jim Pratt\u2014both of whom had worked with Welles on \"The Stranger\" (1946)\u2014lobbied for Welles to direct again. Based on Pratt's suggestion, Universal-International offered Welles $125,000 for the job to act, direct, and based on his choosing, to rewrite the script. On January 11, it was officially announced that Welles had signed with Muhl to star in and direct \"Badge of Evil\".\nWelles had previously starred in \"Man in the Shadow\" (1957), which Zugsmith produced. According to Zugsmith, on the last day of shooting, Welles, who was impressed with Zugsmith's writing abilities, expressed that he was interested in directing a picture for him. Zugsmith offered Welles a pile of scripts, of which he requested the worst one. Welles was then handed Monash's script for \"Badge of Evil\" to which he asked, \"Can I have two weeks to write it?\" Zugsmith replied, \"You can have it.\"\nWriting.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt started with rehearsals. We rehearsed two weeks prior to shooting, which was unusual. We rewrote most of the dialogue, all of us, which was also unusual, and Mr. Welles always wanted our input. It was a collective effort, and there was such a surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel the pulse growing as we rehearsed. You felt you were inventing something as you went along. Mr. Welles wanted to seize every moment. He didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.\n\u2014Janet Leigh, recalling how Welles asked for input from the actors in the cast\nFor his screenplay draft, Welles made numerous changes along with smaller changes to better tighten the script. His two main contributions dealt with his thematic element of American racism and his decision to shift narrative points of view. He shifted the location setting from San Diego to the Mexico\u2013United States border near Tijuana. Welles renamed the protagonist from Mitch Holt to Miguel Vargas, stating he made the character a Mexican \"for political reasons. I wanted to show how Tijuana and the border towns are corrupted by all sorts of mish-mash, publicity more or less about American relations\". Welles's shooting script was finished by February 5, 1957. Heston stated that Welles re-wrote the script in ten days.\nCasting.\nWelles selected Janet Leigh for the role of Susan Vargas. Before her agent had notified her of the casting, Welles contacted Leigh via telegram stating how delighted he was to work with her on \"Badge of Evil\". She contacted her agent, and accepted the part. Dennis Weaver was asked to audition as the night manager after Welles had watched him as Chester Goode on \"Gunsmoke\". He was instructed to improvise. Meanwhile, Zugsmith had met Joanna Cook Moore at a party, and was determined that she was right for the role as Marcia Linnekar. Welles rounded out the supporting cast with Akim Tamiroff, whom he previously cast in \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955), while Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, and Keenan Wynn agreed to appear in the film for union pay scale and without screen credit. Zugsmith also insisted that his friend Zsa Zsa Gabor be given a cameo in the film. Ultimately, all actors were paid over union scale and given screen credit.\nHaving known Mercedes McCambridge since her time at Mercury Theatre, Welles called her and requested she arrive at the set. Leigh and the actors dressed as \"greasy-looking hoodlums\" stood around waiting for Welles to start filming. Welles had McCambridge's hair cut and applied black shoe polish over her newly trim hair and eyebrows. According to her memoir: \"They brought a black leather jacket from somewhere, and I was 'ready.' Orson said he wanted a heavy, coarse Mexican accent. I said, 'You've got it!'\"\nJoseph Calleia was cast as Quinlan's longtime partner Pete Menzies, giving Welles an opportunity to work with an actor he had long admired. \"What an actor\u2014Joseph Calleia\", said Welles:\nI fell in love with him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York ... a very well-staged melodrama which was an enormous hit for about a year\u2014it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies\u2014little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor\u2014this dynamo going on.\n\"Even among these performers, one man's sincerity stands out,\" wrote George E. Turner, film historian and editor of \"The American Cinematographer\". \"Joseph Calleia, a veteran actor from Malta, makes Menzies the most realistic and touching character in the film. ... His agony is the true touchstone of the film.\"\nFilming.\nThe film was shot in Venice, California from February 18, 1957, to April 2, 1957. The location had been suggested by Aldous Huxley to Welles, who informed him the town had decayed significantly. Welles, cinematographer Russell Metty, and the art directors drove there, and upon viewing the city's Bridge of Sighs, Welles decided to revise the ending to incorporate it. Sometime during the early months of filming, Zugsmith retitled the film to \"Touch of Evil\", which Welles later criticized calling it \"silly.\"\nAs when he worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland, Welles and Metty devised a distinctive visual style for \"Touch of Evil\"\u2014incorporating deep focus, off-kilter and low-angle shots (to emphasize the girth of Quinlan), and other stylistic touches that furthered the visual style of film noir. Most notable among the stylistic flourishes in the film is an opening crane shot that runs almost three-and-a-half minutes, which has frequently been commented on by film scholars.\nHeston's autobiography states that the scene with Vargas and Schwartz in the convertible marks the first time that a scene with dialogue was shot in a moving car, rather than a stationary one in front of a projection screen. However, there is an earlier example of such a scene in \"Gun Crazy\" (1950).\nPost-production.\nAs was typical, Welles himself worked on the film's editing, paired initially with Edward Curtiss. According to Zugsmith, the two had creative differences, and Curtiss was replaced with Virgil Vogel. During June 1957, Welles flew out to New York to appear on \"The Steve Allen Show\". In his absence, studio executives had scheduled a screening of the rough cut. Informed of this by Vogel, Welles was angered, resulting in Universal post-production head Ernest Nims cancelling the screening. At this point, Vogel agreed to step down, and Nims appointed Aaron Stell, another Universal staff editor, to finish the film. When Welles returned to Hollywood, Nims instructed him to stay out of the editing room and let Stell work alone. Having been locked out, Welles went to Mexico City in late June 1957 to begin shooting his next film, \"Don Quixote\".\nOn his own, Stell constantly changed the editing sequence, providing different interpretations of multiple scenes in which he altered the continuity. Throughout the editing process, Stell was never satisfied, and at the end of his tenure, he stated he had grown \"ill, depressed and unhappy with the studio's impatience.\" In July 1957, Stell's cut was screened to the executives, most of whom were left unimpressed. According to Nims, Welles \"had really messed up those first five reels...He was making those quick cuts\u2014in the middle of a scene you cut to another scene, and then come back and finish the scene, and then cut to the last half of the other scene.\"\nHoping to make the continuity editing more conventional, Muhl appointed Nims to re-edit the film. A month later, Nims's cut was shown to Welles, who remained diplomatic but was astonished at the newly altered cut. Welles wrote a memorandum as a critique of Nim's revisions, and shortly after, he left for Louisiana to appear in Martin Ritt's \"The Long, Hot Summer\" (1958). By November 1957, Universal removed about fifteen minutes from the film, and hired Harry Keller to film some expository scenes intended to make the plot easier to follow.\nOut of loyalty to Welles, Heston and Leigh initially refused to film the re-shoots. A week later, Heston's agents informed him that he was contractually obligated to film re-shoots if necessary. For the re-shoots, Clifford Stine had replaced Metty as the film's cinematographer while new dialogue had been written by Franklin Coen, a staff scriptwriter for Universal. Several new scenes were filmed including four scenes between Vargas and his wife, a love scene in the car, and a scene where Menzies explains about Quinlan's leg. Another scene was shot in which Quinlan's car meets Vargas's en route to the motel, in which an uncredited actor doubles for Welles. On November 19, re-shoots under Keller were completed. Heston further reflected in his journal: \"I have done worse work in the movies than this day's retakes, but I don't remember feeling worse...I was able to talk them out of one change I felt was a mistake.\"\nOn December 5, 1957, having been screened a new cut, Welles presented a 58-page memorandum addressed to Muhl, detailing what he thought needed to be done to make the film work. In response, Muhl stated his changes would be implemented, but also requested that Welles attend a dubbing session. Welles refused.\nRelease.\nInitial release and reception.\n\"Touch of Evil\" was given a sneak preview at a theater in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles on January 31, 1958. This version of the film ran 108 minutes, and was not well received. Heston wrote in his journal that \"I'm afraid it's simply not a good picture. It has the brilliance that made each day's rushes look so exciting, of course. Indeed, there's hardly a dull shot in the film. But it doesn't hold together as a story.\" In February 1958, \"Touch of Evil\" was attached in a double bill with \"The Female Animal\", starring Hedy Lamarr, which was also produced by Albert Zugsmith and directed by Harry Keller. The two films even had the same cameraman, Russell Metty. This general version ran only 94 minutes.\nContemporary reviews.\nHoward Thompson of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"...while good versus evil remains the text, the lasting impression of this film is effect rather than substance, hence its real worth.\" He complimented the film's direction noting that \"Mr. Welles' is an obvious but brilliant bag of tricks. Using a superlative camera (manned by Russell Metty) like a black-snake whip, he lashes the action right into the spectator's eye.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote \"As usual, Welles has placed mood above content. But what mood! \"Touch of Evil\" is underkeyed, underlighted and undermonitored (for sound), but with the assistance of Russell Metty's marvelous mobile camera it charges ahead like the pure cinema it so often succeeds in being, complete with built-in stocks.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" felt that Welles \"has peopled the story with odd characterizations and, in an apparent effort to get away from routine picture-making, has made dramatic use of unusual photographic angles, shadows and lighting. This makes for an arty approach but it seems to lessen the dramatic impact of the story. The acting is very good, and a number of the individual scenes are tense and exciting.\"\n\"Variety\" felt that \"Welles establishes his creative talent with pomp, but unfortunately the circumstances of the story suffer. There is insufficient orientation and far too little exposition, with the result that much of the action is confusing and difficult to relate to the plot...Welles' script contains some hard-hitting dialogue; his use of low-key lighting with Russell is effective, and Russell Metty's photography is fluid and impressive; and Henry Mancini's music is poignant. But \"Touch of Evil\" proves it takes more than good scenes to make a good picture.\" Dorothy Masters, reviewing for the \"New York Daily News\", gave the film three stars out of four noting that the \"Welles touch is manifest in a taut screen play, suspenseful presentation, stark backgrounds, off-beat camera angles and a weird assortment of characters. The production is advantage and are ably supported by the rest of the cast.\"\nAccolades.\nAlthough Universal Pictures did its best to prevent \"Touch of Evil\" from being selected for the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival\u2014part of the Expo 58 world's fair\u2014the film received its European premiere and Welles was invited to attend. To his astonishment, Welles collected the two top awards. \"Touch of Evil\" would also receive the International Critics Prize, and Welles was recognized for his body of work.\nCritical re-evaluation.\nIn 1998, Roger Ebert added \"Touch of Evil\" to his Great Movies list. He praised the lead and supporting actors and argued that the cinematography was \"not simply showing off\" but rather was used to add depth to the complex plot by showing interpersonal connections and \"trapping [the characters] in the same shots\". Ebert also speculated Welles's role was semi-autobiographical, describing his Quinlan character as nursing old feuds and demonstrating an obsessive desire for control that arguably parallels Welles's life and career. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" stated that although the restored film was virtually the same, he noted the film's plot is more coherent and that \"due to the pristine new print, Welles' technical virtuosity and ingenious use of locations have never been more evident, and the entire picture plays more smoothly.\" Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote \"\"Touch of Evil\" is a savvy starter because Welles' astonishing cinematic invention and his persuasive presence as star are prime noir attractions. The look, a deftly arranged climate of odd shadows and angles, neon lighting and flawlessly choreographed action scenes, keeps interest piqued through a contrived plot and mannered acting.\" Pauline Kael lauded the film: \"... this marvellously garish thriller has something, but not very much, to do with drugs and police corruption in a border town. What it really has to do with is love of the film medium, and if Welles can't resist the candy of shadows and angles and baroque decor, he turns it into stronger fare than most directors' solemn meat and potatoes. It's a terrific entertainment.\"\nMichael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" positively wrote the film was \"close to the pinnacle of film noir\" thanks to \"[w]izardly moving camera shots, nightmarish angles and incredibly florid, amusing performances\". Kenneth Turan, reviewing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", summarized the 1998 re-cut: \"Photographed by Russell Metty, \"Touch of Evil\" is one of the standard-bearers for the kind of eye-catching, bravura camera work Welles favored. Expressionistic in the extreme, filled with shadows, angles and cinematic flourishes, the film raises the usual brooding nightmare ambience of film noir to a level few other pictures have attempted.\" In 2012, critic Manohla Dargis listed \"Touch of Evil\" as one of her ten favourite films of all time on 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll list.\nEddie Muller writing about this late noir: \"\"Touch of Evil\" is noir as a three-ring circus. There are high-wire acts (the dazzling moving camera shot that opens the film), sleight-of-hand tricks (the single-take interrogation of Manolo Sanchez), outrageous clowns (Akim Tamiroff and Dennis Weaver), scary animal acts (the Grandi boys' torture of Susie), and clever disguises (Joseph Cotton, Mercedes McCambridge, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Marlene Dietrich all have masquerade cameos). Welles capably plays both ringleader and elephant.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 95% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Artistically innovative and emotionally gripping, Orson Welles' classic noir is a visual treat, as well as a dark, sinister thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 99 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nIn 1998, \"Time Out\" magazine conducted a poll and the film was voted 57th greatest film of all time. In 2000, the film was ranked at No. 55 in \"The Village Voice\"'s 100 Greatest Films list. \"Touch of Evil\" was placed No. 64 on American Film Institute's \"100 Years, 100 Thrills\" list in 2001.\nIn the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" Greatest Films of All Time 2012 poll, the film was placed No. 26 and No. 57 by the directors and the critics respectively. In 2015, the film ranked 51st on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\nHenry Mancini's soundtrack album, released by Challenge Records in 1958, was ranked at number 405 in \"Uncut\"'s 2025 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of the 1950s\"; contributor Peter Watts noted how Mancini's \"opulent and evocative\" music \"introduced a theme of pulsating Afro-Cuban percussion, swinging Mexican rhythms and jump blues alongside Mancini's trademark strut.\"\nRestorations.\n1976 release.\nRobert Epstein, a UCLA film studies professor, had requested a film print for a screening in his class in the early 1970s. Inside the Universal archives, he discovered a 108-minute print of \"Touch of Evil\". It was publicly screened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as part of \"The 50 Great American Films\" on December 15, 1973. The American Film Institute, recognizing the historical value of the discovery, had submitted a duplicated negative to the Library of Congress for preservation in June 1975. A 16\u00a0mm re-release provided through United World Films, Universal Pictures' non-theatrical distribution arm, was also discussed. Subsequently, it was screened at the Paris Film Festival, which was followed with a wide theatrical re-release by Universal Pictures that recognized an increased interest among film fans in Welles's works.\nJonathan Rosenbaum published an article in the film magazine \"Sight &amp; Sound\" in 1975, claiming that, except for a few minor details, the version was \"apparently identical to Welles' final cut,\" and described it as the \"definitive version\". Joseph McBride, in a letter to \"Sight &amp; Sound\", issued a correction, identifying the cut as the \"preview\" version.\n1998 release.\nIn 1998, Walter Murch, working from all available material, re-edited the film based on the Welles memo, with Rick Schmidlin who produced the re-edit and with the help of Bob O'Neil, Universal's director of film restoration and Bill Varney, Universal's Vice President of Sound Operations, participating in the restoration. As Welles's rough cut no longer exists, no true \"director's cut\" is possible but Murch was able to assemble a version incorporating most of the existing material, omitting some of the Keller scenes (though some were retained, either because they had replaced Welles's lost scenes and were necessary to the plot or because Welles had approved of their inclusion). Some of Welles's complaints concerned subtle sound and editing choices and Murch re-edited the material accordingly. Notable changes include the removal of the credits and Henry Mancini's music from the opening sequence, cross-cutting between the main story and Janet Leigh's subplot and the removal of Harry Keller's hotel lobby scene. Rick Schmidlin produced the 1998 edit, which had a limited but successful theatrical release (again by Universal) and was subsequently made available on DVD. The DVD includes an on-screen reproduction of the 58-page memo.\nOriginally scheduled to be premiered at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival with Janet Leigh, Walter Murch and Rick Schmidlin attending, the screening was canceled at the eleventh hour after threats of litigation from Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles. Her suit against Universal, for not consulting her or obtaining her consent prior to the reworking of \"Touch of Evil\", was settled out of court. Welles later said she had only asked Universal to inform her on what was being done and when she was ignored, she told the Cannes Festival that the restoration was not sanctioned by the Welles Estate,\nI saw it later and it was wonderful...I thought they did an amazing job, and it was very well done. It was what he wanted and it made much more sense than that chopped up nightmare there was before. It was fine and it was his. If they had told me that from the very beginning, none of that would have happened.\nThe 1998 re-edit received awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics.\nHome media.\nThe home media release history of \"Touch of Evil\" is summarized in the following table. The film was shot in the fullscreen Academy ratio with Welles reportedly composing his shots primarily with the newer 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio in mind, which Universal applied to all its new films using a hard matte. Universal preserved Academy ratio prints of the film for later broadcast on television. Both formats of the film have been released to home media.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2024, the city's population is estimated at 1,185,977, making it the fourteenth most populous Brazilian city and the third most populous in S\u00e3o Paulo state. The city's metropolitan area encompasses twenty municipalities with a total population of 3,491,150 people.\nEtymology.\nCampinas means \"grass fields\" in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation.\nCampinas' official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the phoenix, because it was practically reborn after a devastating epidemic of yellow fever in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city's inhabitants.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme. It was initially a simple outpost on the way to Minas Gerais and Goi\u00e1s serving the \"Bandeirantes\" who were in search of precious minerals and Indian slaves. In the first half of the 19th century, Campinas became a growing population center, with many coffee, cotton and sugarcane farms.\nThe construction of a railway linking the city of S\u00e3o Paulo to Santos' seaport, in 1867, was very important for its growth. In the second half of the 19th century, with the abolition of slavery, farming and industrialization attracted many foreign immigrants to replace the lost manpower, mainly from Italy.\nCoffee became an important export and the city became wealthy. In consequence, a large service sector was established to serve the growing population, and in the first decades of the 20th century, Campinas could already boast of an opera house, theaters, banks, movie theaters, radio stations, a philharmonic orchestra, two newspapers (\"Correio Popular\" and \"Di\u00e1rio do Povo\"), a good public education system (with the Escola Normal de Campinas and the Col\u00e9gio Culto \u00e0 Ci\u00eancia), and hospitals, such as the Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia (a charity for poor people).\nAnd the Casa de Sa\u00fade de Campinas (for the Italian community, formerly known as \"Circolo Italiani Uniti\"), and the most important Brazilian research center in agricultural sciences, the Instituto Agron\u00f4mico de Campinas, which was founded by Emperor Pedro II. Finally, the construction of the first Brazilian highway in 1938, between Campinas and S\u00e3o Paulo, the Anhanguera Highway, was a turning point in the integration of Campinas into the rest of the state.\nCampinas was the birthplace of opera composer Carlos Gomes (1836\u00a0\u2014 1896) and of the President of the Republic Campos Salles (1841\u00a0\u2014 1913). It was home for 49 years to H\u00e9rcules Florence, reputed as one of the early inventors of photography, photocopying and the mimeograph.\nGeography.\nThe area of the city, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, is ; of this is the urban area and remaining constitute greater Campinas. It is located at 22\u00b054\u203221\u2033S, 47\u00b003\u203239\u2033W and is at a distance of northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo. Its neighboring cities are Paul\u00ednia, Jaguari\u00fana and Pedreira, north; Morungaba, Itatiba and Valinhos in the east; Itupeva, Indaiatuba and Monte Mor, south, and Hortol\u00e2ndia in the west.\nEcology.\nMost of the original vegetation of the city was largely eliminated. Like 13 other municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city is subject to some environmental stress, and Campinas is considered one of the areas liable to flooding and silting; it now has less than 5% of vegetation cover in total area.\nTrying to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being conducted and planned, such as building corridors, and the regulation of the Management Plan of Environmental Preservation Area (APA) in Campinas. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of riparian forests located along the banks of the Atibaia river, which has a high level of pollution. Today, Campinas houses the area of relevant ecological interest (ARIE) Mata de Santa Genebra, , established in 1985 by the city of Campinas' Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Pedro de Oliveira and regulated by the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Institute (IBAMA). This is the now second-largest urban forest of Brazil, behind only the Tijuca Forest, in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe city also has smaller urban forest groves and reserve parks, such as the Bosque dos Jequitibas (installed in 1881), the Bosque dos Italianos (transl. Italian's Grove), the Bosque dos Alem\u00e3es (transl. German's Grove), Guarant\u00e3's Park, as well as the larger Parque Portugal (Taquaral Lagoon, transl. Park and Lagoon of Bamboos), \"Dom Bosco\" Ecological Park and Monsenhor \"Em\u00edlio Jos\u00e9 Salim\" Ecological Park.\nClimate.\nThe city has a tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\" in K\u00f6ppen scheme). It was humid subtropical (\"Cwa\" type in the K\u00f6ppen classification) before the current climatic table (1981-2010 period).\nWinters are generally dry and mild (rarely too cold), and summers rainy with warm to hot temperatures. The warmest month is February, with an average temperature of 24\u00a0\u00b0C, an average maximum of 29.1\u00a0\u00b0C and average minimum of 19.0\u00a0\u00b0C. The coldest month, July, sees respective temperatures of 17.8\u00a0\u00b0C, and 24.2\u00a0\u00b0C and 11.4\u00a0\u00b0C average maximum and minimum.

In January, the rainiest month, the average is 280.3\u00a0mm. In recent years, however, the hot, dry days during the winter have been increasingly frequent, often surpassing 30\u00a0\u00b0C, especially between July and September. In August 2010, for example, the rainfall in Campinas was only 0\u00a0mm. During the dry season and long dry spells in the middle of the rainy season are also common records of fires in the hills and thickets, especially in rural areas of the city, which contributes to deforestation and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.\nThe lowest temperature recorded in the city was \u22121.5\u00a0\u00b0C on June 25, 1918. The highest temperature was 39.0\u00a0\u00b0C, observed on 17 November 1985. The highest cumulative rainfall recorded in 24 hours in the city between June 1988 and October 2008 was 143.4\u00a0mm in 25 days May 2005. Between 1890 and 2004 there were 41 occurrences of frost in Campinas. The most recent was on July 18, 2000, when the minimum temperature reached 2.2\u00a0\u00b0C. There are also occasional episodes of strong winds, with gusts exceeding 100\u00a0km / h, and training records were made in the city day May 4, 2001 and March 9, 2008.\nThe wet season is from mid-October to mid-April, with heavier rains particularly in December, January, February and early March, and the dry season is from mid-May to mid-September. Average rainfall is 24.3\u00a0mm in August and 267.8\u00a0mm in January. Average humidity ranges from 37% (August) to 56% (January).\nIn the region around Campinas near the state of Minas Gerais there are a number of cities which enjoy an even milder mountain climate, such as Serra Negra, Socorro, Lind\u00f3ia and \u00c1guas de Lindoia, where several water spas are located.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;According to the 2022 Census, as of August 2022, Campinas had a population of 1,139,047 and a population density of 1.433,54 (inhabitants / km \u00b2).

The airport serves as the main hub for Azul Brazilian Airlines, transporting 11.8 million passengers in 2022. It also operates the second-largest cargo terminal in Brazil. It is one of the fastest-growing airports in the country, and since it was turned over to the private sector in 2012, a number of improvements and innovations have been implemented through the Viracopos Brazil Airports concession.\nA second facility, Campo dos Amarais Airport located from downtown Campinas, is dedicated to general aviation.\nCampinas public transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Campinas, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 77 min. 21% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 52% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.9\u00a0km, while 16% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nEducation.\nPortuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.\nMedia.\nThree daily newspapers are published in Campinas, all owned by media company Rede Anhang\u00fcera de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o: Correio Popular, Di\u00e1rio do Povo and Not\u00edcia J\u00e1 (a tabloid). Several other local newspapers with weekly or monthly circulation are also published. Several magazines are also published in Campinas, the largest one being \"Metr\u00f3pole\", which circulates on Sundays as a supplement to \"Correio Popular\".\nThe city has also a large number of radio stations as well as several local TV stations, including \"TV Universidades\" and \"Fenix TV\" (both not-for-profit), distributed by Net Campinas, the local cable distributor.\nhttp:// was the first city in Brazil, outside the capitals of Brazilian states, which received the transmission in digital signal for TV, by EPTV, an affiliate of Rede Globo, on October 3, 2008. It currently has the second TV station that also broadcasts the signal by TVB, now an affiliate of Rede Record, since February 2011 (before SBT, when it began on May 8, 2010).\nIn telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telef\u00f4nica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es de S\u00e3o Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telef\u00f3nica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nCampinas is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCooperative agreements.\nCampinas signed Cooperation Protocol with:\nDomestic cooperation.\nCampinas cooperates with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63515", "revid": "3961268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63515", "title": "Viracopos International Airport", "text": "The Viracopos/Campinas International Airport () (sometimes referred to as S\u00e3o Paulo/Campinas or S\u00e3o Paulo/Viracopos) is an international airport serving the municipality of Campinas, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nOn 6 January 1987, the airport name was officially normalised to its present form. It is named after the neighbourhood where it is located. It is operated by Aeroportos Brasil.\nHistory.\nThe IATA airport code of Viracopos is VCP and the specific city code of Campinas is CPQ. Sometimes both codes are used as one although there is a distinction between them in airline reservation systems: VCP, together with CGH (Congonhas) and GRU (Guarulhos), is part of the multiple airport system set around the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (code SAO). An airline that files services with the code VCP has flights displayed when passengers or travel agents request service from S\u00e3o Paulo, whereas flights filed with the code CPQ are displayed as service from Campinas, not S\u00e3o Paulo. A similar example is New York City (NYC), in which the airport codes LGA (LaGuardia Airport), JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport), and EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) are used for the same city, although Newark is located in a different city and state.\nThere are two versions of the origin of the name \"Viracopos\", which means \"turn (or overturn) glasses\" in Portuguese and can be metaphorically understood as drinking a large amount of an alcoholic beverage at once. According to the first version, in the beginning of the 20th century, during an annual fair, there was a misunderstanding between the parish priest and the residents of the neighborhood. This resulted in excessive drinking and quarrels, in which the festival booths were torn down, or overturned, during the confusion. The name \"Viracopos\" was later used by the priest in sermons to refer to the event. Another version says that, on the site of the present airport, previously there had been a bar where herders had regularly met to exchange views and drink (\"turn glasses\"). So \"Viracopos\" was first the name of the district and later of the airport.\nThe origin of the Viracopos Airport can be traced to a simple airfield near Campinas built during the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1946, shortly after World War II, the first runway was paved. In the following years, the airport began to take shape, with the construction of the first hangar in 1948 and the terminal in 1950. During the 1950s, it started being used by cargo companies. In 1960, it was improved with a 3,240\u00a0m runway, long enough to accommodate the first generation of intercontinental jet planes such as the Boeing 707, de Havilland Comet, Vickers VC10, Convair 990, and Douglas DC-8, and the airport was officially inaugurated on 19 October 1960, same day where it also received its first international flight. Furthermore, Viracopos Airport served (and still serves) as an alternate airport for Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o International Airport and S\u00e3o Paulo airports particularly because it rarely closes due to bad weather conditions (an average of only 5 days per year).\nAfter 1960, Viracopos became the primary international airport for S\u00e3o Paulo, because the runway of S\u00e3o Paulo-Congonhas Airport was too short to accommodate intercontinental jet planes. In practice, however, the distance of nearly 100\u00a0km from Viracopos to S\u00e3o Paulo made it very inconvenient for passengers and airlines. As a result, direct international passenger service was limited, because most international passengers simply opted to fly instead to Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o International Airport and then connect to Congonhas Airport, which is located very close to downtown. At that time, Viracopos even appeared on the Guinness Book of Records as the furthest airport from the city it allegedly served.\nThe airport's title as the main international airport of S\u00e3o Paulo ended in 1985 with the opening of S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, and Viracopos entered into a decade of stagnation, with all international and most domestic flights transferred to Guarulhos and Congonhas.\nHowever, recognizing the strategic importance of Viracopos for the economy, Infraero, the airport administrator in 1995, started to implement a master plan of renovations aiming at the building of a new airport, focusing its efforts on the segment of cargo transportation. The first phase was completed in the first half of 2004, when the airport received new passenger departure and arrival lounges, public areas, commercial concessions and a new cargo terminal. The second phase of the passenger terminal expansion project was completed in 2005 and a new control tower was built, storage and processing facilities for the cargo terminal expanded, and the passenger terminal was entirely revamped. A third phase of expansion, which would build a second runway by 2013, was projected. However, since the airport was conceded in 2012, the deadline for the new runway was postponed until 2018.\nBeing the second busiest cargo airport in Brazil, Viracopos has 77,000 square meters (646,000 square feet) of cargo terminals, 1,700 square meters (18,300 square feet) for animal cargo, and 1,480 cubic meters (52,200 square feet) of refrigerated space. As a major import/export hub, Viracopos enjoys 'express lanes' for courier traffic which are exceptionally quick and unbureaucratic by Brazilian standards.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, passenger traffic grew from 1.02 million in 2008 to 7.5 million in 2011. The airport can handle 7 million passengers/year. The number of flights offered has increased dramatically since Azul Brazilian Airlines made Viracopos its main hub.\nIn August 2009, the previous operator Infraero unveiled a R$2,814 million (US$1,482.6 million; \u20ac1,038.8 million) investment plan to upgrade Viracopos International Airport, focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The investment intended to provide a new runway, a new passenger terminal, and a new train route, with its main goal being to alleviate the air-traffic concentrated at Guarulhos International Airport.\nHowever, due to legal and bureaucratic issues, the Infraero original plan never occurred. Since the concession to Consortium Aeroportos Brasil, a new investment program focusing particularly on the construction of a new terminal was announced. The phase 1 of the new passenger terminal opened in May 2015.\nResponding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Viracopos was considered to be requiring attention, operating between 70% and 85% of its capacity.\nFollowing a decision made on 26 April 2011 by the Federal Government for private companies being granted concessions to operate some Infraero airports, on 6 February 2012, the administration of the airport was conceded, for 30 years, to the Consortium Aeroportos Brasil composed of the Brazilian Triunfo, an Investments and Funds Society (45%), UTC Engenharia e Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, an Engineering and Investments Society (45%), and the French Aeroports Egis Avia (10%). Infraero, the state-run organization, remains with 49% of the shares of the company incorporated for the administration.\nThe facility encompasses 1,766 hectares (4,364 acres) of airport property and contains one 3,240m runway.\nStatistics.\nFollowing is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2012) and Aeroportos Brasil (2013-2023) reports:\nAccess.\nThe airport is located northwest of the state capital city of S\u00e3o Paulo and southwest of downtown Campinas, adjacent to the Bandeirantes-Anhanguera highway complex, which connects the capital city to the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo state.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Regarded as one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood history, she was noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic, sardonic characters and was known for her performances in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies, although her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, was the first person to accrue ten Academy Award nominations (and one write-in) for acting, and was the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. In 1999, Davis was placed second on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema, behind Katharine Hepburn.\nAfter appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early films for Universal Studios were unsuccessful. She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and had her critical breakthrough playing a vulgar waitress in \"Of Human Bondage\" (1934). Contentiously, she was not among the three nominees for the Academy Award for Best Actress that year, and she won it the following year for her performance in \"Dangerous\" (1935). In 1936, due to poor film offers, she attempted to free herself from her contract, and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies. She was praised for her role in \"Marked Woman\" (1937) and won a second Academy Award for her portrayal of a strong-willed 1850s Southern belle in \"Jezebel\" (1938), the first of five consecutive years in which she received a Best Actress nomination; the others for \"Dark Victory\" (1939), \"The Letter\" (1940), \"The Little Foxes\" (1941), and \"Now, Voyager\" (1942).\nA period of decline in the late 1940s was redeemed with her role as a fading Broadway star in \"All About Eve\" (1950), which has often been cited as her best performance. She received Best Actress nominations for this film and for \"The Star\" (1952), but her career struggled over the rest of the decade. Her last nomination came for her role as the psychotic former child star Jane Hudson in the psychological horror film \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962). In the latter stage of her career, Davis played character parts in films like \"Death on the Nile\" (1978) and shifted her focus to roles in television. She led the miniseries \"The Dark Secret of Harvest Home\" (1978), won an Emmy Award for \"\" (1979), and was nominated for her performances in \"White Mama\" (1980) and \"Little Gloria... Happy at Last\" (1982). Her last complete cinematic part was in the drama \"The Whales of August\" (1987).\nDavis was known for her forceful and intense style of acting and her physical transformations. She gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and confrontations with studio executives, film directors, and co-stars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style, and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated. Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and three times divorced, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer, with more than 100 film, television, and theater roles to her credit.\nLife and career.\n1908\u20131929: Childhood and early acting career.\nRuth Elizabeth Davis, known from early childhood as \"Betty\", was born on April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Harlow Morrell Davis (1885\u20131938), a law student from Augusta, Maine, and subsequently a patent attorney, and Ruth Augusta (n\u00e9e Fav\u00f3r; 1885\u20131961), from Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. Davis's younger sister was Barbara Harriet (1909\u20131979).\nIn 1915, after Davis's parents separated, Davis and her sister Barbara attended a spartan boarding school named Crestalban in Lanesborough, Massachusetts, for three years. \nIn the fall of 1921, her mother, Ruth Davis, moved to New York City, using her children's tuition money to enroll in the Clarence White School of Photography, with an apartment on 144th Street at Broadway. She then worked as a portrait photographer.\nThe young Betty Davis later changed the spelling of her first name to Bette after Bette Fischer, a character in Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's \"La Cousine Bette\". During their time in New York, Davis became a Girl Scout where she became a patrol leader. Her patrol won a competitive dress parade for Lou Hoover at Madison Square Garden.\nDavis attended Cushing Academy, a boarding school in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, where she met her future husband, Harmon O. Nelson, known as Ham. In 1926, a then 18-year-old Davis saw a production of Henrik Ibsen's \"The Wild Duck\" with Blanche Yurka and Peg Entwistle. Davis later recalled, \"The reason I wanted to go into theater was because of an actress named Peg Entwistle.\" Bette Davis interviewed with Eva Le Gallienne to be a student at her 14th Street theater. However, she felt Davis was not serious enough to attend her school, and described her attitude as \"insincere\" and \"frivolous\".\nDavis auditioned for George Cukor's stock theater company in Rochester, New York. Though he was not very impressed, he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment \u2013 a one-week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play \"Broadway\". Ed Sikov sources Davis's first professional role to a 1929 production by the Provincetown Players of Virgil Geddes' play \"The Earth Between\"; however, the production was postponed by a year. In 1929, Davis was chosen by Blanche Yurka to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play in \"The Wild Duck\". After performing in Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston, she made her Broadway debut in 1929 in \"Broken Dishes\" and followed it with \"Solid South\".\n1930\u20131936: Early years in Hollywood.\nAfter appearing on Broadway in New York, the 22-year-old Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930 to screen test for Universal Studios. She was inspired to pursue a career as a film actress after seeing Mary Pickford in \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\". Davis and her mother traveled by train to Hollywood. She later recounted her surprise that no-one from the studio was there to meet her. In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw no-one who \"looked like an actress\". Davis failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. \nIn a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, \"I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men... They all had to lie on top of me and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die.\" A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film \"A House Divided\". Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the film director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, \"What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?\".\nCarl Laemmle, the head of Universal Studios, considered terminating Davis's employment, but cinematographer Karl Freund told him she had \"lovely eyes\" and would be suitable for \"Bad Sister\" (1931), in which she subsequently made her film debut. Her nervousness was compounded when she overheard the chief of production, Carl Laemmle, Jr., comment to another executive that she had \"about as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville\", one of the film's male co-stars. The film was not a success, and her next role in \"Seed\" (1931) was too brief to attract attention.\nUniversal Studios renewed her contract for three months, and she appeared in a small role in \"Waterloo Bridge\" (1931), before being lent to Columbia Pictures for \"The Menace\", and to Capital Films for \"Hell's House\" (all 1932). After one year, and six unsuccessful films, Laemmle elected not to renew her contract.\nDavis was preparing to return to New York when actor George Arliss chose Davis for the lead female role in the Warner Bros. picture \"The Man Who Played God\" (1932). For the rest of her life, Davis credited him with helping her achieve her \"break\" in Hollywood. \"The Saturday Evening Post\" wrote, \"She is not only beautiful, but she bubbles with charm\", and compared her to Constance Bennett and Olive Borden. Warner Bros. signed her to a five-year contract, and she remained with the studio for the next 18 years.\nDavis's first marriage was to Harmon Oscar Nelson on August 18, 1932, in Yuma, Arizona. Their marriage was scrutinized by the press; his $100 a week earnings ($ per week in 2024 dollars) compared unfavorably with Davis's reported $1,000 a week income ($ per week in 2024 dollars). Davis addressed the issue in an interview, pointing out that many Hollywood wives earned more than their husbands, but the situation proved difficult for Nelson, who refused to allow Davis to purchase a house until he could afford to pay for it himself. Nelson was able to enforce his wishes because, at the time, the husband had the management and control of the community property, which included the wife's earnings, and the wife could not obtain credit without her husband's consent. Davis had two abortions during the marriage, each at Nelson's insistence.\nDavis played Helen Bauer in the 1933 pre-Code drama \"Ex-Lady\" alongside Gene Raymond. However, the film was overshadowed by fellow actress Joan Crawford's divorce from her first husband, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., leading to its failure at the box office. Though Crawford had no malicious intent toward Davis, Davis was nonetheless angered by this turn of events, which led her to resent Crawford and began a lifelong feud between the two actresses.\nAfter more than 20 film roles, she had her critical breakthrough playing the role of the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio production of \"Of Human Bondage\" (1934), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel. It earned Davis her first major critical acclaim, although, contentiously, she was not among the three nominees for the Academy Award for Best Actress that year. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed, his attitude changed, and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. \nThe film's director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom. \"I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts.\" Davis insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, \"The last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are not pretty, and I intended to be convincing-looking.\"\nThe film was a success, and Davis's characterization earned praise from critics, with \"Life\" writing that she gave \"probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress\". Davis anticipated that her reception would encourage Warner Bros. to cast her in more important roles, and was disappointed when Jack L. Warner refused to lend her to Columbia Studios to appear in \"It Happened One Night\", and instead cast her in the melodrama \"Housewife\". When Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for \"Of Human Bondage\", \"The Hollywood Citizen News\" questioned the omission, and Norma Shearer, herself a nominee, joined a campaign to have Davis nominated. This prompted an announcement from the Academy president, Howard Estabrook, who said that under the circumstances, \"any voter...may write on the ballot his or her personal choice for the winners\", thus allowing, for the only time in the Academy's history, the consideration of a candidate not officially nominated for an award. The uproar led, however, to a change in academy voting procedures the following year, wherein nominations were determined by votes from all eligible members of a particular branch, rather than by a smaller committee, with results independently tabulated by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. The next year, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" became the only film to win a write-in Oscar, for Best Cinematography.\nThe next year, her performance as a down-and-out troubled actress in \"Dangerous\" (1935) received very good reviews and landed Davis her first Best Actress nomination and win. E. Arnot Robertson wrote in \"Picture Post\" that, \"I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet\". \"The New York Times\" hailed her as \"becoming one of the most interesting of our screen actresses\". She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, but commented that it was belated recognition for \"Of Human Bondage\", calling the award a \"consolation prize\". For the rest of her life, Davis maintained that she gave the statue its familiar name of \"Oscar\" because its posterior resembled that of her husband, whose middle name was Oscar, although, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences officially makes reference to another story.\nDavis had not expected to win the award, so she had worn only a plain dress. At the 8th Academy Awards, where she received the award, fellow attendee Joan Crawford said to her, \"Dear Bette! What a lovely frock.\" She had attended with her second husband, Franchot Tone, whom Davis had been in love with, but Crawford had married in 1935. Both of these events led to more contention between the two actresses, who had already clashed in 1933. Later on, when they shared dressing rooms near to each other, Crawford tried to make a truce with Davis by sending her gifts, all of which Davis returned.\nIn her next film, \"The Petrified Forest\" (1936), Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart.\nWarner Bros' legal case against Bette Davis.\nIn the spring of 1936, Davis asked Warner Bros. to loan her out to RKO to make \"Mary of Scotland\". Warner Bros. refused and assigned Davis two films that were written specifically for her: \"God's Country and the Woman\", and \"Mountain Justice\". However, as \"God's Country and the Woman\" was going into production, Davis refused to work, and demanded a salary increase on her contract with Warner Bros. At the time, Davis was earning $1,250 per week. Jack Warner offered Davis an increased salary of $2,250 per week, which Davis refused. Davis's agent, Mike Levee, said: \"She's a very stubborn young lady. I asked her how much she wanted, and she said $3,500 a week, plus all radio rights and permission to make outside pictures. I told her, 'Whoa, that's too much!'\"\nMeanwhile, due to Davis's refusal to continue with \"God's Country and the Woman\", Warner Bros. was incurring excessive production costs because the film was being made in Technicolor, and the Technicolor cameras were rented. In late June, the studio put Davis on suspension for refusal to work, and replaced her in the film with Beverly Roberts.\nDuring negotiations with Warner Bros. regarding her salary and signing Davis for the female lead in \"Danton\", Davis abruptly traveled to England with her husband, Harmon Nelson, on a \"vacation\". However, in England, Davis signed a contract with British film production company Toplitz, to make the film \"I'll Take the Low Road\" in England with Maurice Chevalier for a $50,000 salary.\nOn September 9, 1936, Warner Brothers filed a legal injunction against Davis in England which forbade her from appearing in film productions without their consent. While on a shopping spree in Paris, Davis publicly declared to the press that she intended to defy Warner Bros' legal injunction and make the film in England. \nOn October 14, 1936, the British court held a hearing regarding the studio's injunction against Davis. Mr Justice Branson issued his decision on October 19, ruling in favor of Warner Bros. Justice Branson dismissed Davis's representative's claims that she was an \"underpaid slave\" held under a \"life sentence\", and ruled that Davis was in breach of her contract to Warner \"for no discoverable reason except that she wanted more money\".\nDavis was ordered to pay Warner Bros. $80,000 in restitution, and was also ordered to pay the studio's legal fees for filing the injunction in England. The British press offered little support to Davis, calling her overpaid and ungrateful.\n1937\u20131941: Success with Warner Bros..\nIn 1937, Davis starred with Humphrey Bogart in \"Marked Woman\", a contemporary gangster drama inspired by the case of Lucky Luciano, and a film regarded as one of the most important in her early career. She was awarded the Volpi Cup at the 1937 Venice Film Festival for her performance.\nDavis's portrayal of a strong-willed 1850s Southern belle in \"Jezebel\" (1938) won her a second Academy Award for Best Actress. This was the first of five consecutive years in which she received the Best Actress nomination. During production, Davis entered a relationship with director William Wyler. She later described him as the \"love of my life\", and said that making the film with him was \"the time in my life of my most perfect happiness\". The film was a success.\nThis led to speculation in the press that she would be chosen to play Scarlett O'Hara, a similar character, in \"Gone with the Wind\". Davis expressed her desire to play Scarlett, and while David O. Selznick was conducting a search for the actress to play the role, a radio poll named her as the audience favorite. Warner offered her services to Selznick as part of a deal that also included Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, but Selznick did not consider Davis as suitable, and rejected the offer. Davis, on the other hand, did not want Flynn cast as Rhett Butler. Newcomer Vivien Leigh was cast as Scarlett O'Hara, de Havilland landed a role as Melanie, and both of them were nominated for the Oscars, with Leigh winning.\n\"Jezebel\" marked the beginning of the most successful phase of Davis's career, and over the next few years, she was listed in the annual Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money-Making Stars, which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the U.S. for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.\nIn contrast to Davis's success, her husband Ham Nelson had failed to establish a career for himself, and their relationship faltered. In 1938, Nelson obtained evidence that Davis was engaged in a sexual relationship with Howard Hughes, and subsequently filed for divorce, citing Davis's \"cruel and inhuman manner\". He also claimed she read books and her film manuscripts too often. By this time they had been living distant lives, as Davis's career often kept her preoccupied. \"I was married to Ham only in name...When we were together, there was nothing left between us,\" biographer David Thomson quoted her saying. \"Any happy days we had had were in our memories almost entirely before we married. The terrible distance when we were together was harder to bear than when we were apart. We no longer communicated with each other at all. And our sex life had disappeared, a woman who's been with just one man for a long time is practically a virgin again.\" Nelson remarried in 1946 and died in 1975.\nNevertheless, Davis had wanted desperately for the marriage to work out and was devastated when it failed. She was emotional during the making of her next film, \"Dark Victory\" (1939), and considered abandoning it until the producer Hal B. Wallis convinced her to channel her despair into her acting. The film was among the high-grossing films of the year, and the role of Judith Traherne, a spirited heiress suffering from a malignant brain tumor, brought her an Academy Award nomination. In later years, Davis cited this performance as her personal favorite. \"Dark Victory\" featured Ronald Reagan and Humphrey Bogart in supporting roles.\nDavis appeared in three other box-office hits in 1939: \"The Old Maid\" with Miriam Hopkins, \"Juarez\" with Paul Muni, and \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" with Errol Flynn. The last was her first color film, and her only color film made during the height of her career. To play the elderly Elizabeth I of England, Davis shaved her hairline and eyebrows. During filming, Davis was visited on the set by the actor Charles Laughton. She commented that she had a \"nerve\" playing a woman in her 60s, to which Laughton replied: \"Never not dare to hang yourself. That's the only way you grow in your profession. You must continually attempt things that you think are beyond you, or you get into a complete rut.\" Recalling the episode many years later, Davis remarked that Laughton's advice had influenced her throughout her career.\nBy this time, Davis was Warner Bros.' most profitable star, and she was given the most important of their female leading roles. Her image was considered with more care; although she continued to play character roles, she was often filmed in close-ups that emphasized her distinctive eyes. \"All This, and Heaven Too\" (1940) was the most financially successful film of Davis's career to that point.\n\"The Letter\" (1940) was considered \"one of the best pictures of the year\" by \"The Hollywood Reporter\", and Davis won admiration for her portrayal of an adulterous killer, a role originated onstage by Katharine Cornell. During this time, she was in a relationship with her former co-star George Brent, who proposed marriage. Davis refused, as she had met Arthur Farnsworth, a New England innkeeper, and Vermont dentist's son. Davis and Farnsworth were married at Home Ranch, in Rimrock, Arizona, in December 1940, her second marriage.\nIn January 1941, Davis became the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences but antagonized the committee members with her brash manner and radical proposals. Davis rejected the idea of her being just \"a figurehead only\". Faced with the disapproval and resistance of the committee, Davis resigned and was succeeded by her predecessor Walter Wanger.\nDavis starred in three movies in 1941, the first being \"The Great Lie\", with George Brent. It was a refreshingly different role for Davis as she played a kind, sympathetic character. William Wyler also directed Davis for the third time in Lillian Hellman's \"The Little Foxes\" (1941), but they clashed over the character of Regina Giddens, a role originally played on Broadway by Tallulah Bankhead (Davis had portrayed in film a role initiated by Bankhead on the stage once before\u00a0\u2013 in \"Dark Victory\"). Wyler encouraged Davis to emulate Bankhead's interpretation of the role, but Davis wanted to make the role her own. She received another Academy Award nomination for her performance, and never worked with Wyler again.\n1942\u20131944: War years.\nIn 1943, Davis told an interviewer that she had molded her film career on her motto, \"I love tragedy,\" and ironically, until Pearl Harbor, she had been recognized as the American favorite of Japanese moviegoers\u2014because to them, she \"represented the admirable principle of sad self-sacrifice.\"\nIn 1942, numerous Hollywood entertainment industry members joined forces to form the Hollywood Canteen. Davis and John Garfield were the driving force who were credited with founding the canteen, along with the aid of 42 unions and guilds in the industry, plus thousands of celebrity volunteers from the Hollywood Victory Committee and beyond. The Canteen offered food, dancing and entertainment for servicemen and was staffed by members of the entertainment industry. Davis served as Canteen president through the end of the war. \nIn 1983, Davis received the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal from the Department of Defense for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.\nShe appeared as herself in the film \"Hollywood Canteen\" (1944), which used the canteen as the setting for a fictional story. Warner Bros. donated 40% of proceeds from the film to both the Hollywood Canteen and the Stage Door Canteen in Manhattan.\nDavis showed little interest for the role of repressed spinster Charlotte Vale in the drama film \"Now, Voyager\" (1942), until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the better known of her \"women's pictures\". In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he stares into Davis's eyes, and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film \"a dignity not fully warranted by the script\". She received her seventh Oscar nomination for \"Now, Voyager\". That same year, she was also cast against type opposite Monty Woolley in the hit comedy \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" (1942).\nDuring the early 1940s, several of Davis's film choices were influenced by the war, such as \"Watch on the Rhine\" (1943), by Lillian Hellman, and \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" (1943), a lighthearted all-star musical cavalcade. Davis performed a novelty song, \"They're Either Too Young or Too Old.\" \"Old Acquaintance\" (1943) reunited her with Miriam Hopkins in a story of two old friends who deal with the tensions created when one of them becomes a successful novelist. Davis felt that Hopkins tried to upstage her throughout the film. Director Vincent Sherman recalled the intense competition and animosity between the two actresses, and Davis often joked that she held back nothing in a scene in which she was required to shake Hopkins in a fit of anger.\nIn August 1943, Davis' husband, Arthur Farnsworth, collapsed while walking along a Hollywood street and died two days later. An autopsy revealed that his fall had been caused by a skull fracture he had suffered two weeks earlier having accidentally fallen down a flight of stairs. A finding of accidental death was reached. Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944), but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth's death, persuaded her to continue. Although she had gained a reputation for being forthright and demanding, her behavior during filming of \"Mr. Skeffington\" was said to be erratic and out of character. She alienated Vincent Sherman by refusing to film certain scenes and insisting that some sets be rebuilt. She improvised dialogue, which made the writer Julius Epstein rewrite scenes at her whim. Davis later explained her actions with the observation \"When I was most unhappy, I lashed out rather than whined.\" Some reviewers criticized Davis for the excess of her performance; James Agee wrote that she \"demonstrates the horrors of egocentricity on a marathonic scale\". Despite these reviews, \"Mr. Skeffington\" was another box-office hit and earned Davis another Academy Award nomination.\n1945\u20131949: Career setbacks.\nIn 1945, Davis married artist William Grant Sherry, her third husband, who also worked as a masseur. She had been drawn to him because he claimed he had never heard of her and so was not intimidated by her.\nThe same year, Davis made \"The Corn Is Green\" (1945), based on the play by Emlyn Williams. Davis played Miss Moffat, an English teacher who saves a young Welsh miner (John Dall) from a life in the coal pits by offering him education. The part had been played in the theater by Ethel Barrymore (who was 61 at the play's premiere), but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. Davis disagreed, and insisted on playing the part as written, and wore a gray wig and padding under her clothes, to create a dowdy appearance. The critic E. Arnot Robertson observed:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Only Bette Davis...could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the chief character's interest in the young miner. She concluded that \"the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving\" kept the focus on the teacher's \"sheer joy in imparting knowledge\". The film was well received by critics, and made a profit of $2.2 million.\nHer next film, \"A Stolen Life\" (1946), was the only film that Davis made with her own production company, BD Productions. Davis played dual roles as twins. The film received poor reviews, and was described by Bosley Crowther as \"a distressingly empty piece\"; but, with a profit of $2.5 million, it was one of her biggest box office successes. Her next film was \"Deception\" (1946), the first of her films to lose money.\nIn 1947, at the age of 39, Davis gave birth to daughter Barbara Davis Sherry (known as B.D.), and later wrote in her memoir that she became absorbed in motherhood and considered ending her career. As she continued making films, however, her relationship with her daughter B.D. began to deteriorate, and her popularity with audiences steadily declined.\nIn 1948, Davis was cast in the melodrama \"Winter Meeting\". Although she initially was enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for \"softer\" lighting to be used to disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique \"on the sets of Ruth Chatterton and Kay Francis, and I knew what they meant\". To add to her disappointment, she was not confident in the abilities of her leading man \u2013 James Davis in his first major screen role. She disagreed with changes made to the script because of censorship restrictions, and found that many of the aspects of the role that initially appealed to her had been cut. The film was described by Bosley Crowther as \"interminable\", and he noted that \"of all the miserable dilemmas in which Miss Davis has been involved...this one is probably the worst\". It failed at the box office, and the studio lost nearly $1 million.\nWhile making \"June Bride\" (1948), Davis clashed with co-star Robert Montgomery, later describing him as \"a male Miriam Hopkins...an excellent actor, but addicted to scene-stealing\". The film marked her first comedy in several years, and earned her some positive reviews, but it was not particularly popular with audiences, and returned only a small profit.\nDespite the lackluster box-office receipts from her more recent films, in 1949, she negotiated a four-film contract with Warner Bros. that paid $10,285 per week and made her the highest-paid woman in the United States. However, Jack Warner had refused to allow her script approval, and cast her in \"Beyond the Forest\" (1949). Davis reportedly loathed the script and begged Warner to recast the role, but he refused. After the film was completed, her request to be released from her contract was honored.\nThe reviews of the film were scathing. Dorothy Manners, writing for the \"Los Angeles Examiner\", described the film as \"an unfortunate finale to her brilliant career\". Hedda Hopper wrote: \"If Bette had deliberately set out to wreck her career, she could not have picked a more appropriate vehicle.\" The film contained the line \"What a dump!\", which became closely associated with Davis after it was referenced in Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", and impersonators began to use it in their acts. Arthur Blake was a famous female impersonator of the post World-War II era who was particularly known for his performances as Bette Davis; notably impersonating her in the 1952 film \"Diplomatic Courier\".\n1949\u20131960: Starting a freelance career.\nDavis filmed \"The Story of a Divorce\" (released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1951 as \"Payment on Demand\"). She played a Broadway star in \"All About Eve\" (1950), which earned her another Oscar nomination and won her the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. Davis read the script, described it as the best she had ever read, and accepted the role. Within days, she joined the cast in San Francisco to begin filming. During production, she established what became a lifelong friendship with her co-star Anne Baxter and a romantic relationship with her leading man Gary Merrill, which led to marriage. The film's director Joseph L. Mankiewicz later remarked: \"Bette was letter perfect. She was syllable-perfect. The director's dream: the prepared actress.\"\nCritics responded positively to Davis's performance, and several of her lines became well-known, particularly \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\". She was again nominated for an Academy Award, and critics such as Gene Ringgold described her Margo as her \"all-time best performance\". Pauline Kael wrote that much of Mankiewicz's vision of \"the theater\" was \"nonsense\", but commended Davis, writing \"[the film is] saved by one performance that is the real thing: Bette Davis is at her most instinctive and assured. Her actress \u2013 vain, scared, a woman who goes too far in her reactions and emotions \u2013 makes the whole thing come alive.\" \nDavis won a Best Actress award from the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award. She also received the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award as Best Actress, having been named by them as the Worst Actress of 1949 for \"Beyond the Forest\". During this time, she was invited to leave her hand prints in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nOn July 3, 1950, Davis's divorce from William Sherry was finalized. On July 28, she married Gary Merrill, her fourth and final husband. With Sherry's consent, Merrill adopted B.D., Davis's daughter with Sherry. In January 1951, Davis and Merrill adopted a five-day-old baby girl they named Margot Mosher Merrill (born January 6, 1951 - died May 5, 2022), after the character Margo Channing. \nIn 1952, they adopted a baby boy, Michael, born February 5, 1952. Davis and Merrill lived with their three children on an estate on the coast of Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Davis and Merrill also stayed at Homewood Inn in Yarmouth, Maine, for six months. After semi-retirement in the mid-1950s, Davis again starred in several movies during her time in Maine, including \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), in which she again played Queen Elizabeth I.\nThe family traveled to England, where Davis and Merrill starred in the murder-mystery film \"Another Man's Poison\" (1951). When it received lukewarm reviews and failed at the box office, Hollywood columnists wrote that Davis's comeback had petered out, and an Academy Award nomination for \"The Star\" (1952) did not halt her decline at the box office. In it, she played a character who many thought took to be a parody of Davis's rival Joan Crawford.\nIn 1952, Davis appeared in the Broadway revue \"Two's Company\", directed by Jules Dassin. She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; she never had been a musical performer, and her limited theater experience had been more than 20 years earlier. She was also severely ill and was operated on for osteomyelitis of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain-damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth. Though Davis tried to care for Margot, she eventually placed her daughter in an institution around the age of 3. Davis and Merrill began arguing frequently, and B.D. later recalled episodes of alcohol abuse and domestic violence.\nFew of Davis's films of the 1950s were successful, and many of her performances were condemned by critics. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote of mannerisms \"that you'd expect to find in a nightclub impersonation of [Davis]\", while the London critic Richard Winninger wrote\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Miss Davis, with more say than most stars as to what films she makes, seems to have lapsed into egoism. The criterion for her choice of film would appear to be that nothing must compete with the full display of each facet of the Davis art. Only bad films are good enough for her.\nHer films of this period included \"Storm Center\" (1956) and \"The Catered Affair\" (1956). As her career declined, her marriage continued to deteriorate until she filed for divorce in 1960. The following year, her mother died. During the same time, she tried television, appearing in three episodes of the popular NBC Western \"Wagon Train\" as three different characters in 1959 and 1961; her first appearance on TV had been February 25, 1956, on \"General Electric Theatre\".\nIn 1960, Davis, a registered Democrat, appeared at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where she met future President John F. Kennedy, whom she greatly admired. Outside of acting and politics, Davis was an active and practicing Episcopalian.\n1961\u20131970: Renewed success.\nIn 1961, Davis opened in the Broadway production \"The Night of the Iguana\" to mostly mediocre reviews, and left the production after four months due to \"chronic illness\". She then joined Glenn Ford and Hope Lange for the Frank Capra film \"Pocketful of Miracles\" (1961), a remake of Capra's 1933 film, \"Lady for a Day\", based on a story by Damon Runyon. Exhibitors protested her star billing as they considered it would negatively impact the box office performance and, despite the appearance of Ford, the film failed at the box office.\nHer last Oscar nomination was for the Grand Guignol horror film \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962), which also starred Joan Crawford. Crawford showed interest in the script and considered Davis for the part of the demented former child star Baby Jane Hudson. Davis believed it could appeal to the same audience that had recently made Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" (1960) a success. She negotiated a deal that would pay her 10 percent of the worldwide gross profits in addition to her salary, along with the conditions that she play Jane, and that Crawford was not sleeping in the same bed as the director, Robert Aldrich. The film became one of the year's big successes.\nDavis and Crawford played two aging sisters, one a former child star (Davis) and the other an accomplished film actress (Crawford) who were forced by circumstance to share a decaying Hollywood mansion. Aldrich explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers. Regardless of their personal feelings toward one another, Davis and Crawford spoke highly of each other's acting talent. Crawford said Davis was a \"fascinating actress\", but they never became friends as they only worked on that one film together and had few opportunities outside that association. Davis also said Crawford was a good, professional actress. Despite the alleged \"feud,\" Crawford heavily promoted Davis's performance. Crawford told reporter Wayne Allen, \"I'll predict here and now that Miss Davis will win an Oscar for it.\" \nHowever, on set, the two actresses constantly argued, and called Aldrich nightly to complain about one another. Davis reportedly called Crawford obscene words while she was within earshot. They also physically attacked each other: in a scene where Jane drags Blanche (Crawford's character), Crawford made herself as heavy as possible to make the scene agonizing for Davis, who was struggling with back problems. In another scene where Jane beats Blanche, Davis hit Crawford as hard as she could. At the 35th Academy Awards, where Davis was nominated for her last Academy Award for Best Actress, actress Anne Bancroft won instead, for \"The Miracle Worker\". As Bancroft was absent from the ceremony, Crawford accepted the Oscar in her place, while Davis looked on in horror. Crawford had arranged this, persuading several actresses who could not to attend to allow her to collect their award should they win, likely to slight Davis. Davis and Crawford were later attached to star in \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964), but Crawford later quit production, owing it to an illness. However, the real reason was to avoid Davis. She was replaced by Olivia de Havilland, a close friend of Davis. Their alleged feud was eventually turned into the 2017 limited series \"Feud\" by Ryan Murphy.\nDavis also received her only BAFTA nomination for this performance. Crawford did as well, but both lost to Patricia Neal. Daughter Barbara (credited as B.D. Merrill) played a small role in the film, and when she and Davis visited the Cannes Film Festival to promote it, Barbara met Jeremy Hyman, an executive for Seven Arts Productions. After a short courtship, she married Hyman at the age of 16, with Davis's permission. They had two sons and were married until Hyman's death in 2017.\nIn October 1962, it was announced that four episodes of the CBS-TV series \"Perry Mason\" would feature special guest stars who would cover for Raymond Burr during his convalescence from surgery. A \"Perry Mason\" fan, Davis was the first of the guest stars. \"The Case of Constant Doyle\" began filming on December 12, 1962, and aired January 31, 1963.\nIn 1962, Davis appeared as Celia Miller on the TV western \"The Virginian\" in the episode titled \"The Accomplice.\"\nIn September 1962, Davis placed an advertisement in \"Variety\" under the heading of \"Situations wanted \u2013 women artists\", which read: \"Mother of three \u2013 10, 11, &amp; 15 \u2013 divorcee. American. Thirty years' experience as an actress in Motion Pictures. Mobile still, and more affable than rumor would have it. Wants steady employment in Hollywood. (Has had Broadway.)\" Davis said that she intended it as a joke, and she sustained her comeback over the course of several years.\n\"Dead Ringer\" (1964) was a crime drama in which she played twin sisters. The film was an American adaptation of the Mexican film \"La Otra\", starring Dolores del R\u00edo. \"Where Love Has Gone\" (1964) was a romantic drama based on a Harold Robbins novel. Davis played the mother of Susan Hayward, but filming was hampered by heated arguments between Davis and Hayward.\n\"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964) was Robert Aldrich's follow-up to \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\". Aldrich planned to reunite Davis and Crawford, but the latter withdrew allegedly due to illness soon after filming began. She was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. The film was a considerable success, and brought renewed attention to its veteran cast, which included Joseph Cotten, Mary Astor, Agnes Moorehead, and Cecil Kellaway.\nThe following year, Davis was cast as the lead in an Aaron Spelling sitcom, \"The Decorator\". A pilot episode was filmed, but was not shown, and the project was terminated. By the end of the decade, Davis had appeared in the British films \"The Nanny\" (1965), \"The Anniversary\" (1968), and \"Connecting Rooms\" (1970), none of which were reviewed well, and her career again stalled.\n1971\u20131983: Later career.\nIn the early 1970s, Davis was invited to appear in New York City in a stage presentation titled \"Great Ladies of the American Cinema\". Over five successive nights, a different female star discussed her career, and answered questions from the audience; Myrna Loy, Rosalind Russell, Lana Turner, Sylvia Sidney, and Joan Crawford were the other participants. Davis was well-received, and was invited to tour Australia with the similarly themed \"Bette Davis in Person and on Film\"; its success allowed her to take the production to the United Kingdom.\nIn 1972, Davis played the lead role in two television films that were each intended as pilots for upcoming series for ABC and NBC, \"Madame Sin\", with Robert Wagner, and \"The Judge and Jake Wyler\", with Doug McClure and Joan Van Ark, but in each case, the network decided against producing a series.\nShe appeared in the stage production \"Miss Moffat\", a musical adaptation of her film \"The Corn Is Green\", but after the show was panned by the Philadelphia critics during its pre-Broadway run, she cited a back injury, and abandoned the show, which closed immediately.\nShe played supporting roles in Luigi Comencini's \"Lo Scopone scientifico\" (1972) with Joseph Cotten and Italian actors Alberto Sordi and Silvana Mangano; \"Burnt Offerings\" (1976), a Dan Curtis film, for which she won the award for Best Supporting Actress at the Saturn Awards; and \"The Disappearance of Aimee\" (1976); but she clashed with Karen Black and Faye Dunaway, the stars of the two latter productions, because she felt that neither extended her an appropriate degree of respect and that their behavior on the film sets was unprofessional.\nIn 1977, Davis became the first woman to receive the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award. The televised event included comments from several of Davis's colleagues, including William Wyler, who joked that given the chance, Davis would still like to re-film a scene from \"The Letter\" to which Davis nodded. Jane Fonda, Henry Fonda, Natalie Wood, and Olivia de Havilland were among the performers who paid tribute, with de Havilland commenting that Davis \"got the roles I always wanted\". That same year, Davis's lifelong rival Joan Crawford died. Davis reportedly stated, \"You should never say bad things about the dead; you should only say good\u2026 Joan Crawford is dead. Good.\" \nFollowing the telecast, she found herself in demand again, often having to choose between several offers. She accepted roles in the television miniseries \"The Dark Secret of Harvest Home\" (1978) and the theatrical film \"Death on the Nile\" (1978), an Agatha Christie murder mystery. The bulk of her remaining work was for television. She won an Emmy Award for \"\" (1979) with Gena Rowlands, and was nominated for her performances in \"White Mama\" (1980) and \"Little Gloria...Happy at Last\" (1982). She also played supporting roles in the Disney films \"Return from Witch Mountain\" (1978) and \"The Watcher in the Woods\" (1980).\nDavis's name became well known to a younger audience when Kim Carnes's song \"Bette Davis Eyes\" (written by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon) became a worldwide hit and the best-selling record of 1981 in the U.S., where it stayed at number one on the music charts for more than two months. Davis's grandson was impressed that she was the subject of a hit song and Davis considered it a compliment, writing to both Carnes and the songwriters, and accepting the gift of gold and platinum records from Carnes, and hanging them on her wall.\nShe continued acting for television, appearing in \"Family Reunion\" (1981) with her grandson J. Ashley Hyman, \"A Piano for Mrs. Cimino\" (1982), for which she won the Best Actress Award at The Monte Carlo Television Festival, and \"Right of Way\" (1983) with James Stewart. In 1983, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.\n1983\u20131985: Illness and \"My Mother's Keeper\".\nHer career went through several periods of eclipse, but despite a long period of ill health she continued acting in film and on television until shortly before her death from breast cancer in 1989. She admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships.\nIn 1983, after filming the pilot episode for the television series \"Hotel\", Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Within two weeks of her surgery, she had four strokes which caused paralysis in the left side of her face and in her left arm, and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant Kathryn Sermak gained partial recovery from the paralysis. Even late in life, Davis smoked 100 cigarettes per day.\n\"My Mother's Keeper\".\nIn 1978, Davis's longtime rival Joan Crawford's daughter Christina published a memoir titled \"Mommie Dearest\". Davis defended Crawford, saying, \"I was not Miss Crawford's biggest fan but, wisecracks to the contrary, I did and still do respect her talent. What she did not deserve was that detestable book written by her daughter.\" She then went on to express the horror she would feel if her daughter, B. D. Hyman, did something like that to her.\nDuring this time, her relationship with Hyman deteriorated when Hyman became a born-again Christian and attempted to persuade Davis to follow suit. With her health stable, she traveled to England to film the Agatha Christie mystery \"Murder with Mirrors\" (1985). Upon her return, she learned that Hyman had published \"My Mother's Keeper\", in which she chronicled a difficult mother-daughter relationship and depicted scenes of Davis's overbearing and drunken behavior.\nSeveral of Davis's friends commented that Hyman's depiction of events was not accurate; one said, \"So much of the book is out of context\". Mike Wallace re-broadcast a \"60 Minutes\" interview he had filmed with Hyman a few years earlier in which she commended Davis on her skills as a mother and said that she had adopted many of Davis's principles in raising her own children.\nCritics of Hyman noted that Davis financially supported the Hyman family for several years and had recently saved them from losing their house. Despite the acrimony of their divorce years earlier, Gary Merrill also defended Davis. Interviewed by CNN, Merrill said that Hyman was motivated by \"cruelty and greed\". Davis's adopted son Michael Merrill ended contact with Hyman, and refused to speak to her again, as did Davis, who disinherited her.\nIn her second memoir \"This 'n That\" (1987), Davis wrote: \"I am still recovering from the fact that a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences.\" Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as Hyman, and described her actions as \"a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given\". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, \"If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success.\"\n1986\u20131989: Final works and awards.\nDavis appeared in the television film \"As Summers Die\" (1986), and in Lindsay Anderson's film \"The Whales of August\" (1987), in which she played the blind sister of Lillian Gish. Though in poor health at the time, Davis memorized her own and everyone else's lines as she always had. The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing: \"Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a windowpane, snarling, staggering, twitching \u2013 a symphony of misfired synapses.\" Davis became an honoree of the Kennedy Center Honors for her contribution to films in 1987.\nHer last performance was the title role in Larry Cohen's \"Wicked Stepmother\" (1989). By this time, her health was failing, and after disagreements with Cohen, she walked off the set. The script was rewritten to place more emphasis on Barbara Carrera's character, and the reworked version was released after Davis's death.\nAfter abandoning \"Wicked Stepmother\", and with no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman's \"The Turn of the Century\", and worked with him on adapting the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows, and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King, and David Letterman, discussing her career, but refusing to discuss her daughter. Her appearances were popular; Lindsay Anderson observed that the public enjoyed seeing her behaving \"so bitchy\": \"I always disliked that because she was encouraged to behave badly. And I'd always hear her described by that awful word, feisty.\"\nDuring 1988 and 1989, Davis was honored for her career achievements, receiving the Legion of Honor from France, the Campione d'Italia from Italy, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center Lifetime Achievement Award. She appeared on British television in a special broadcast from the South Bank Centre, discussing film and her career.\nDeath and will.\nDavis collapsed during the American Cinema Awards ceremony in 1989 and later discovered that her cancer had returned. She recovered sufficiently to travel to Spain, where she was honored at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival. During her visit, her health rapidly deteriorated. Too weak to make the long journey back to the U.S., she traveled to France, where she died of metastasized breast cancer on October 6, 1989, at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Davis was 81 years old. A memorial tribute was held by invitation only at Burbank Studio's stage 18, where a work light was turned on signaling the end of production.\nA private funeral was held on October 12, 1989, held at First Christian Church of North Hollywood. Following the funeral, she was entombed in the Davis family sarcophagus at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, alongside her mother Ruthie and sister Bobby, with her name in larger letters. On her tombstone is written: \"She did it the hard way\", an epitaph that she mentioned in her memoir \"Mother Goddam\" as having been suggested to her by Joseph L. Mankiewicz shortly after they had filmed \"All About Eve\".\nHer estate was valued between $600,000 and $1,000,000 at the time of her death. She left about half of the estate to her adopted son, Michael Merrill, and the other half to her assistant and close friend, Kathryn Sermack. Her adopted daughter Margot Merrill and daughter B. D. Hyman (along with Hyman's two sons) were excluded from her will. Davis and Hyman had been estranged ever since the latter published \"My Mother's Keeper\" in 1985. Margot died in 2022.\nReception and legacy.\nRoles and performances.\nAs early as 1936, Graham Greene summarized Davis: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even the most inconsiderable film...seemed temporarily better than they were because of that precise, nervy voice, the pale ash-blond hair, the popping, neurotic eyes, a kind of corrupt and phosphorescent prettiness... I would rather watch Miss Davis than any number of competent pictures.\nPauline Kael notes that Davis made herself lovable and famous by turning herself into \"a caricature of a harpy.\"\nIn 1964, Jack Warner spoke of the \"magic quality that transformed this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist\", and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career without the benefit of beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her early films, and that she became tough by necessity. \"Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star\", she said, \"[but] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film.\" During the making of \"All About Eve\" (1950), Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as \"a horse's ass...forty feet wide, and thirty feet high\", that is all the audience \"would see or care about\". \nWhile lauded for her achievements, Davis and her films were sometimes derided. Pauline Kael described \"Now, Voyager\" (1942) as a \"shlock classic\", and by the mid-1940s, her sometimes mannered and histrionic performances had become the subject of caricature. Edwin Schallert, for the \"Los Angeles Times\", praised Davis's performance in \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944), while observing, \"The mimics will have more fun than a box of monkeys imitating Miss Davis\". Dorothy Manners, at the \"Los Angeles Examiner\", said of her performance in the poorly received \"Beyond the Forest\" (1949): \"No night club caricaturist has ever turned in such a cruel imitation of the Davis mannerisms as Bette turns on herself in this one.\" \"Time\" magazine noted that Davis was compulsively watchable, even while criticizing her acting technique, summarizing her performance in \"Dead Ringer\" (1964) with the observation, \"Her acting, as always, isn't really acting: It's shameless showing off. But just try to look away!\"\nHer film choices were often unconventional: Davis sought roles as manipulators and killers in an era when actresses usually preferred to play sympathetic characters, and she excelled in them. She favored authenticity over glamour, and was willing to change her own appearance if it suited the character.\nAs she entered old age, Davis was acknowledged for her achievements. John Springer, who had arranged her speaking tours of the early 1970s, wrote that despite the accomplishments of many of her contemporaries, Davis was \"the star of the thirties and into the forties\", achieving notability for the variety of her characterizations and her ability to assert herself, even when her material was mediocre. Individual performances continued to receive praise; in 1987, Bill Collins analyzed \"The Letter\" (1940), and described her performance as \"a brilliant, subtle achievement\", and wrote: \"Bette Davis makes Leslie Crosbie one of the most extraordinary females in movies.\" \nIn a 2000 review for \"All About Eve\" (1950), Roger Ebert noted: \"Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style; so, even her excesses are realistic.\" In 2006, \"Premiere\" magazine ranked her portrayal of Margo Channing in the film as fifth on their list of 100 Greatest Performances of All Time, commenting: \"There is something deliciously audacious about her gleeful willingness to play such unattractive emotions as jealousy, bitterness, and neediness.\" While reviewing \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962) in 2008, Ebert asserted that, \"No one who has seen the film will ever forget her.\"\nIn 1977, Davis became the first woman to be honored with the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 1999, the American Film Institute published its list of the \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars\", which was the result of a film-industry poll to determine the \"50 Greatest American Screen Legends\" in order to raise public awareness and appreciation of classic film. Of the 25 actresses listed, Davis was ranked at number two, behind Katharine Hepburn.\nMemorials.\nA few months before her death in 1989, Davis was one of several actors featured on the cover of \"Life\" magazine. In a film retrospective that celebrated the films and stars of 1939, \"Life\" concluded that Davis was the most significant actress of her era, and highlighted \"Dark Victory\" (1939) as one of the more important films of the year. Her death made front-page news throughout the world as the \"close of yet another chapter of the Golden Age of Hollywood\". Angela Lansbury summarized the feeling of those of the Hollywood community who attended her memorial service, commenting, after a sample from Davis's films was screened, that they had witnessed \"an extraordinary legacy of acting in the twentieth century by a real master of the craft\" that should provide \"encouragement and illustration to future generations of aspiring actors\".\nThe United States Postal Service honored Davis with a commemorative postage stamp in 2008, marking the 100th anniversary of her birth. The stamp features an image of her in the role of Margo Channing in \"All About Eve\". The First Day of Issue celebration took place September 18, 2008, at Boston University, which houses an extensive Davis archive. Featured speakers included her son Michael Merrill and Lauren Bacall. In 1997, the executors of her estate, Merrill and Kathryn Sermak, her former assistant, established The Bette Davis Foundation, which awards college scholarships to promising actors and actresses.\nIn 2017, Sermak published the memoir \"Miss D &amp; Me: Life With the Invincible Bette Davis\", a book Davis had requested Sermak to write, detailing their years spent together.\nAcademy Awards.\nDavis established several Oscar milestones. Among them, she became the first person to earn five consecutive Academy Award nominations for acting, all in the Best Actress category (1938\u20131942). Her record has only been matched by one other performer, Greer Garson, who also earned five consecutive nominations in the Best Actress category (1941\u20131945), including three years when both these actresses were nominated.\nIn 1962, Bette Davis became the first person to secure 10 Academy Award nominations for acting. One could argue her 10th nomination was in 1952, and her 11th in 1962, as her write-in nomination for \"Of Human Bondage\" remains a source of contention. She came in 3rd in the voting, ahead of official nominee Grace Moore. Since then, only three people have surpassed this figure\u2014Meryl Streep (with 21 nominations and three wins), Katharine Hepburn (12 nominations and 4 wins), and Jack Nicholson (12 nominations and 3 wins)\u2014while Laurence Olivier matched her (10 nominations and 1 win).\nSteven Spielberg purchased Davis's Oscars for \"Dangerous\" (1935) and \"Jezebel\" (1938), when they were offered for auction for $207,500 and $578,000, respectively, and returned them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fonda's work spans several genres and over six decades of film and television. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award as well as nominations for a Grammy Award and two Tony Awards. Fonda also received the Honorary Palme d'Or in 2007, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2014, the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in 2017, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2021, and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2025.\nBorn to socialite Frances Ford Seymour and actor Henry Fonda, she made her screen debut in the romantic comedy \"Tall Story\" (1960). She rose to prominence acting in the comedies \"Cat Ballou\" (1965), \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967), and \"Barbarella\" (1968). Fonda established herself as a dramatic actress, winning two Academy Awards for Best Actress for her roles as a prostitute in the thriller \"Klute\" (1971) and the woman in love with a Vietnam War veteran in the drama \"Coming Home\" (1978). She was Oscar-nominated for \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969), \"Julia\" (1977), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"On Golden Pond\" (1981), and \"The Morning After\" (1986). After a 15 year hiatus, she returned to acting in \"Monster-in-Law\" (2005), \"Youth\" (2015), and \"Our Souls at Night\" (2017).\nOn stage, Fonda made her Broadway debut in the play \"There Was a Little Girl\" (1960), for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. In 2009, she returned to Broadway for the play \"33 Variations\" (2009), earning a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination. For her work on television, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for the television film \"The Dollmaker\" (1984). She also was Emmy-nominated for her roles in \"The Newsroom\" (2012\u20132014) and \"Grace and Frankie\" (2015\u20132022).\nFonda was a political activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War. She was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi, during which she gained the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\". Fonda protested the Iraq War along with violence against women, and she describes herself as a feminist and environmental activist. Fonda has co-founded the Hollywood Women's Political Committee in 1984 and the Women's Media Center in 2005. Fonda is also known for her exercise videos, starting with \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" (1982), which became the highest-selling pre-recorded video cassette of its time.\nEarly life and education.\nJane Seymour Fonda was born via caesarean section on December 21, 1937, at Doctors Hospital in Yorkville, Manhattan in New York City. Her parents were Canadian-born socialite Frances Ford Seymour and American actor Henry Fonda. According to her father, the surname Fonda came from an Italian ancestor who immigrated to the Netherlands in the 1500s. There, he intermarried; the resultant family began to use Dutch given names, with Jane's first Fonda ancestor reaching New York in 1650. Fonda also has English, French, and Scottish ancestry. She was named for the third wife of Henry VIII, Jane Seymour, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side, and because of whom, until she was in fourth grade, Fonda said she was called \"Lady\" (as in Lady Jane). Her brother, Peter Fonda, was also an actor, and her maternal half-sister is Frances de Villers Brokaw (also known as \"Pan\"), whose daughter is Pilar Corrias, the owner of the Pilar Corrias Gallery in London.\nIn 1950, when Fonda was 12, her mother died by suicide while undergoing treatment at Craig House psychiatric hospital in Beacon, New York. Later that year, Henry Fonda married socialite Susan Blanchard, 23 years his junior; this marriage ended in divorce. Aged 15, Jane taught dance at Fire Island Pines, New York. Fonda attended Greenwich Academy in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York; and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Before her acting career, she was a model and appeared twice on the cover of \"Vogue\".\nFonda became interested in the arts in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of \"The Country Girl\" at the Omaha Community Playhouse. After dropping out of Vassar, she went to Paris for six months to study art. Upon returning to the US, in 1958, she met Lee Strasberg; the meeting changed the course of her life. Fonda said, \"I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father \u2013 who had to say so \u2013 told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!\"\nCareer.\n1959\u20131969: Early roles and breakthrough.\nFonda's stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with \"Tall Story\", in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. \"Period of Adjustment\" and \"Walk on the Wild Side\" followed in 1962. In \"Walk on the Wild Side\", Fonda played a prostitute and earned a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1963, she starred in \"Sunday in New York\". \"Newsday\" called her \"the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses\". However, she also had detractors \u2013 in the same year, the \"Harvard Lampoon\" named her the \"Year's Worst Actress\" for \"The Chapman Report\". Her next two pictures, \"Joy House\" and \"Circle of Love\" (both 1964), were made in France; with the latter, Fonda became one of the first American film stars to appear nude in a foreign movie. She was offered the coveted role of Lara in \"Doctor Zhivago\", but turned it down because she didn't want to go on location for nine months.\nFonda's career breakthrough came with \"Cat Ballou\" (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm-turned-outlaw. This comedy Western received five Oscar nominations, with Lee Marvin winning best actor, and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to bankable stardom. The following year, she had a starring role in \"The Chase\" opposite Robert Redford, in their first film together, with two-time Oscar winner Marlon Brando. The film received some positive reviews, but Fonda's performance was noticed by \"Variety\" magazine: \"Jane Fonda, as Redford's wife and the mistress of wealthy oilman James Fox, makes the most of the biggest female role.\" She returned to France to make \"The Game Is Over\" (1966), often described as her sexiest film, and appeared in the August 1966 issue of \"Playboy\", in paparazzi shots taken on the set. Fonda immediately sued the magazine for publishing them without her consent. After this came the comedies \"Any Wednesday\" (1966), opposite Jason Robards and Dean Jones, and \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1967), again co-starring Redford.\nIn 1968, she played the title role in the science fiction spoof \"Barbarella\", which established her status as a sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969) won her critical acclaim and marked a significant turning point in her career; \"Variety\" wrote, \"Fonda, as the unremittingly cynical loser, the tough and bruised babe of the Dust Bowl, gives a dramatic performance that gives the film a personal focus and an emotionally gripping power.\" In addition, renowned film critic Pauline Kael, in her \"New Yorker\" review of the film, noted of Fonda: \"[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind 'vulgar' roles to assure us she's not really like that. Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\" For her performance, she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and earned her first Academy Awards nomination for Best Actress. Fonda was very selective by the end of the decade, turning down lead roles in \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\".\n1970\u20131979: Widespread success and acclaim.\nIn the seventies, Fonda enjoyed her most critically acclaimed period as an actress despite some setbacks for her ongoing activism. According to writer and critic Hilton Als, her performances starting with \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation.\nFonda won her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1971, playing a high-priced call girl, the gamine Bree Daniels, in Alan J. Pakula's neo-noir psychological thriller \"Klute\". Prior to shooting, Fonda spent time interviewing several prostitutes and madams. Years later, Fonda discovered that \"there was like a marriage, a melding of souls between this character and me, this woman that I didn't think I could play because I didn't think I was call girl material. It didn't matter.\" Upon its release, \"Klute\" was both a critical and commercial success, and Fonda's performance earned her widespread recognition. Pauline Kael wrote:\nAs an actress, [Fonda] has a special kind of smartness that takes the form of speed; she's always a little ahead of everybody, and this quicker beat \u2013 this quicker responsiveness \u2013 makes her more exciting to watch. This quality works to great advantage in her full-scale, definitive portrait of a call girl in \"Klute\". It's a good, big role for her, and she disappears into Bree, the call girl, so totally that her performance is very pure \u2013 unadorned by \"acting\". She never stands outside Bree, she gives herself over to the role, and yet she isn't lost in it\u2014she's fully in control, and her means are extraordinarily economical. She has somehow got to a plane of acting at which even the closest closeup never reveals a false thought and, seen on the movie streets a block away, she's Bree, not Jane Fonda, walking toward us. There isn't another young dramatic actress in American films who can touch her.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" also praised Fonda's performance, even suggesting that the film should have been titled \"Bree\" after her character: \"What is it about Jane Fonda that makes her such a fascinating actress to watch? She has a sort of nervous intensity that keeps her so firmly locked into a film character that the character actually seems distracted by things that come up in the movie.\" During the 1971\u20131972 awards season, Fonda dominated the Best Actress category at almost every major awards ceremony; in addition to her Oscar win, she received her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, her first National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and her second New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\nBetween \"Klute\" in 1971 and \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success. She appeared in \"A Doll's House\" (1973), \"Steelyard Blues\" and \"The Blue Bird\" (1976). In the first, some critics felt Fonda was miscast, but her work as Nora Helmer drew praise, and a review in \"The New York Times\" opined, \"Though the Losey film is ferociously flawed, I recommend it for Jane Fonda's performance. Beforehand, it seemed fair to wonder if she could personify someone from the past; her voice, inflections, and ways of moving have always seemed totally contemporary. But once again she proves herself to be one of our finest actresses, and she's at home in the 1870s, a creature of that period as much as of ours.\" From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: \"I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.\" However, in her 2005 autobiography, \"My Life So Far\", she rejected such simplification. \"The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.\" She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJane Fonda did an extraordinary job with her part. She is a splendid actress with a strong analytical mind which sometimes gets in her way, and with an incredible technique and control of emotion; she can cry at will, on cue, mere drops or buckets, as the scene demands ... I thought Jane well deserved the Oscar she should have got.\n \u2014Fred Zinnemanndirector of \"Julia\" (1977)\nIn 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside Yves Montand in \"Tout Va Bien\", directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. The two directors then made \"Letter to Jane\", in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda. At the time, while in Rome, she joined a feminist march on March 8 and gave a brief speech of support for the Italian women's rights.\nThrough her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" is generally considered her \"comeback\" picture. Critical reaction was mixed, but Fonda's comic performance was praised; Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" remarked, \"I never have trouble remembering that Miss Fonda is a fine dramatic actress but I'm surprised all over again every time I see her do comedy with the mixture of comic intelligence and abandon she shows here.\" Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in \"Julia\", receiving positive reviews from critics. Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" described her performance as \"edgy, persuasive and intriguingly tensed-up,\" commenting further, \"Irritable, intent and agonizingly self-conscious, Fonda suggests the internal conflicts gnawing at a talented woman who craves the self-assurance, resolve and wisdom she sees in figures like Julia and Hammett.\" For her performance, Fonda won her first BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, and received her third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nDuring this period, Fonda decided that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down \"An Unmarried Woman\" because she felt the part was not relevant. In 1978, Fonda was at a career peak after she won her second Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Sally Hyde, a conflicted adulteress in \"Coming Home\", the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life. Upon its release, the film emerged as a major commercial success with audiences and received positive reviews from critics; Ebert noted that her Sally Hyde was \"the kind of character you somehow wouldn't expect the outspoken, intelligent Fonda to play,\" and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"San Diego Reader\" felt that Fonda was \"a marvel to watch; what fascinates and involves me in her performance are the conscientious effort and thought that seem to go into every line reading and gesture, as if the question of what a captain's wife and former cheerleader was like became a source of endless curiosity and discovery for her.\" Her performance also earned her a third Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama as well, making this her second consecutive win. Also in 1978, she reunited with Alan J. Pakula to star in his post-modern Western drama \"Comes a Horseman\" as a hard-bitten rancher, and later took on a supporting role in \"California Suite\", where she played a Manhattan workaholic and divorcee. \"Variety\" noted that she \"demonstrates yet another aspect of her amazing range\" and \"Time Out New York\" remarked that she gave \"another performance of unnerving sureness\".\nShe won her second BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with \"The China Syndrome\", about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. Cast alongside Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas, in one of his early roles, Fonda played a clever, ambitious television news reporter. Vincent Canby, writing for \"The New York Times\", singled out Fonda's performance for praise: \"The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star's role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film. She keeps getting better and better.\" This role also earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. The same year, she starred in the western adventure-romance film \"The Electric Horseman\" with her frequent co-star, Robert Redford. Although the film received mixed reviews, \"The Electric Horseman\" was a box office success, grossing nearly $62\u00a0million domestically. By the late 1970s, \"Motion Picture Herald\" ranked Fonda as Hollywood's most bankable actress.\n1980\u20131991: Established star, \"Workout\" series, and film hiatus.\nIn 1980, Fonda starred in \"9 to 5\" with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film was a huge critical and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play \"On Golden Pond\", specifically for her father and her. The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas; they eventually became the first father-daughter duo to earn Oscar nominations (Jane earned her first Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination) for their roles in the same film. \"On Golden Pond\", which also starred four-time Oscar winner Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later. Both films grossed over $100 million domestically.\nFonda continued to appear in feature films throughout the 1980s, winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of a Kentucky mountain woman in \"The Dollmaker\" (1984), and starring in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in \"Agnes of God\" (1985). The following year, she played an alcoholic actress and murder suspect in the 1986 thriller \"The Morning After\", opposite Jeff Bridges. In preparation for her role, Fonda modeled the character on the starlet Gail Russell, who, at 36, was found dead in her apartment, among empty liquor bottles. Writing for \"The New Yorker\", Pauline Kael commended Fonda for giving \"a raucous-voiced, down-in-the-dirty performance that has some of the charge of her Bree in \"Klute\", back in 1971\". For her performance, she was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress. She ended the decade by appearing in \"Old Gringo\".\nFor many years Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after fracturing her foot while filming \"The China Syndrome\", she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The \"Leni Workout\" became the \"Jane Fonda Workout\", which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled \"Jane Fonda's Workout\", inspired by her best-selling book, \"Jane Fonda's Workout Book\". \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were directed by Sidney Galanty, who produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17\u00a0million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.\nOn May 3, 1983, she entered into a non-exclusive agreement with movie production distributor Columbia Pictures, whereas she would star in or produce projects under her own banner Jayne Development Corporation, and she would develop offices at The Burbank Studios, and the company immediately started after her previous office she co-founded with Bruce Gilbert, IPC Films shuttered down. On June 25, 1985, she renamed her production company, Fonda Films, because she felt the original name would sound like a real estate company. In 1990, she starred in the romantic drama \"Stanley &amp; Iris\" (1990) with Robert De Niro, which was her last film for 15 years. The film did not fare well at the box office. Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, Fonda's performance as the widowed Iris was praised by Vincent Canby, who stated, \"Fonda's increasingly rich resources as an actress are evident in abundance here. They even overcome one's awareness that just beneath Iris's frumpy clothes, there is a firm, perfectly molded body that has become a multi-million-dollar industry.\" In 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda retired from the film industry.\n2005\u20132014: Return to acting and Broadway.\nIn 2005, she returned to the screen with the box office success \"Monster-in-Law\", starring opposite Jennifer Lopez. Two years later, Fonda starred in the Garry Marshall-directed drama \"Georgia Rule\" alongside Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan. \"Georgia Rule\" was panned by critics, but A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" felt the film belonged to Fonda and co-star Lohan, before writing, \"Ms. Fonda's straight back and piercing eyes, the righteous jaw line she inherited from her father and a reputation for humorlessness all serve her well here, but it is her warmth and comic timing that make Georgia more than a provincial scold.\" In 2009, Fonda returned to Broadway for the first time since 1963, playing Katherine Brandt in Mois\u00e9s Kaufman's \"33 Variations\". In a mixed review, Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" praised Fonda's \"layered crispness\" and her \"aura of beleaguered briskness that flirts poignantly with the ghost of her spiky, confrontational screen presence as a young woman. For those who grew up enthralled with Ms. Fonda's screen image, it's hard not to respond to her performance here, on some level, as a personal memento mori.\" The role earned her a Tony nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.\nFonda played a leading role in the 2011 drama \"All Together\", which was her first film in French since \"Tout Va Bien\" in 1972. The same year she starred alongside Catherine Keener in \"Peace, Love and Misunderstanding\", playing a hippie grandmother. In 2012, Fonda began a recurring role as Leona Lansing, CEO of a major media company, in HBO's original political drama \"The Newsroom\". Her role continued throughout the show's three seasons, and Fonda received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\nIn 2013, Fonda had a small role in the Lee Daniels directed racial drama \"The Butler\" inspired by the life and career of White House butler Eugene Allen. Fonda portrayed First Lady Nancy Reagan opposite Alan Rickman as United States President Ronald Reagan. Fonda stated that despite her political differences with Nancy she had no difficulty playing the role saying, \"I am an actor, and I have no intention of allowing the political differences between us to color my portrayal of her. I will not be disrespectful.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote in his review, \"the best cameo...comes from Jane Fonda, who is very good indeed as a gracious Nancy Reagan.\" Katey Rich of \"The Guardian\" agreed writing, \"Fonda eerily transforms herself into Nancy Reagan\". She had more film work the following year, appearing in the comedies \"Better Living Through Chemistry\" and \"This is Where I Leave You\". She voiced Maxine Lombard in the season 26 episode \"Opposites A-Frack\". a character on \"The Simpsons\". She played an acting diva in Paolo Sorrentino's \"Youth\" in 2015, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award nomination. She also appeared in \"Fathers and Daughters\" (2015) with Russell Crowe.\n2015\u2013present: \"Grace and Frankie\" and other roles.\nFonda appeared as the co-lead in the Netflix series \"Grace and Frankie\". She and Lily Tomlin played aging women whose husbands reveal they are in love with one another. Filming on the first season was completed in November 2014, and the show premiered online on May 8, 2015. The series concluded in 2022 after running for 7 seasons.\nIn 2016, Fonda voiced Shuriki in \"Elena and the Secret of Avalor\". In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Fonda and others told the stories of the people killed there.\nFonda starred in her fourth collaboration with Robert Redford in the 2017 romantic drama film \"Our Souls at Night\". The film and Fonda's performance received critical acclaim upon release. In 2018, she starred opposite Diane Keaton, Mary Steenburgen, and Candice Bergen in the romantic comedy film \"Book Club\". Although opened to mixed reviews, the film was a major box office success grossing $93.4\u00a0million against a $10\u00a0million budget, despite releasing the same day as \"Deadpool 2\". Fonda is the subject of an HBO original documentary entitled \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\", directed by the documentarian Susan Lacy. Receiving rave reviews, it covers Fonda's life from childhood through her acting career and political activism and then to the present day. It premiered on HBO on September 24, 2018.\nFonda filmed the seventh and final season of \"Grace and Frankie\" in 2021, finishing production in November. The first four episodes premiered August 14, 2021, with the final 12 released on Netflix on April 29, 2022. Fonda appeared in the second installment of Amazon Prime Video's \"Yearly Departed\", alongside the host Yvonne Orji, and fellow eulogy givers Chelsea Peretti, Megan Stalter, Dulc\u00e9 Sloan, Aparna Nancherla, and X Mayo. It premiered on December 23, 2021.\nFonda joined the cast of the 2023 film \"80 for Brady\", which pairs her with veteran actresses Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno, and Sally Field. It also stars former NFL quarterback, Tom Brady. She and Tomlin headline Paul Weitz's black comedy \"Moving On\", co-starring Malcolm McDowell and Richard Roundtree. Her third project for 2023 is \"\", which she made in Italy.\nPolitical activism.\nDuring the 1960s, Fonda engaged in political activism in support of the Civil Rights Movement, and in opposition to the Vietnam War. Fonda's visits to France brought her into contact with leftist French intellectuals who were opposed to war, an experience that she later characterized as \"small-c communism\". Along with other celebrities, she supported the Occupation of Alcatraz Island by members of the American Indian Movement in 1969, which was intended to call attention to the failures of the government with regard to treaty rights and the movement for greater Indigenous sovereignty.\nShe supported Huey Newton and the Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating: \"Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.\" She called the Black Panthers \"our revolutionary vanguard ... we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.\" She has been involved in the feminist movement since the 1970s and dovetails her activism in support of civil rights.\nFonda and Barbra Streisand joined with ten other women in the entertainment industry of Greater Los Angeles to establish the Hollywood Women's Political Committee (HWPC) in 1984. The committee's initial goal was to assist in the presidential campaign of Walter Mondale and his running mate Geraldine Ferraro. The Mondale\u2013Ferraro ticket failed against incumbents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, but HWPC retrenched itself with a list of New Left political goals, and helped to turn the Senate Democratic in 1986. In 1992, HWPC helped to elect a record-breaking number of women legislators, an achievement called the Year of the Woman. Described by observers as carrying forward the same political goals as Fonda and Streisand, HWPC continued its activism through political setbacks of 1994 and 1996, finally dissolving in 1997. During their run, the HWPC was called \"the single most-powerful entertainment group\" in politics.\nOpposition to the Vietnam War.\nOn May 4, 1970, Fonda appeared before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, to speak on G.I. rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomfiting silence until Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage, drunk. He challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? In her autobiography, Fonda revisited the incident: \"I was shocked by the news and felt like a fool.\" On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president Ferrel Heady. The protesters called themselves \"They Shoot Students, Don't They?\" \u2013 a reference to Fonda's recently released film, \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\", which had just been screened in Albuquerque.\nIn the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW and was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator. That fall, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by \"The New York Times\", Fonda was a \"major patron\" of the VVAW. For example, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit Fonda filed against \"Playboy\" in 1966, the February 1971 issue contained a full-page ad in support of the VVAW, and as a result \"the VVAW was transformed into one of the most important actors in the antiwar movement\".\nIn 1971, Fonda, with Fred Gardner and Donald Sutherland formed the FTA tour (\"Free The Army\", a play on the troop expression \"Fuck The Army\"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to Bob Hope's USO tour. The tour, described as \"political vaudeville\" by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, aiming to establish a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (\"F.T.A.\") which contained strong, frank criticism of the war by servicemembers; it was released in 1972.\nVisit to Hanoi.\nBetween 1965 and 1972, almost 300 Americans \u2013 mostly civil rights activists, teachers, and pastors \u2013 traveled to North Vietnam to see firsthand the war situation with the Vietnamese, believing that the news media in the United States predominantly provided a U.S. viewpoint. American travelers to North Vietnam were routinely harassed upon their return home. Fonda visited Vietnam in July 1972, traveling to Hanoi to witness the bombing damage to the dikes. After touring and photographing dike systems in North Vietnam, she said the United States had been intentionally targeting the dike system along the Red River. Sweden's ambassador to Vietnam likewise observed the bomb damage to the dikes and described it as \"methodic\". Other journalists reported that the attacks were \"aimed at the whole system of dikes\". Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, said he believed the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that, if the U.S. Air Force were \"truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way\". Due to the publicity surrounding Fonda's visit, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assessed aerial photography of the North Vietnamese dike system in a secret 1972 report, arriving at two conclusions: First, that the North Vietnamese dike system was incredibly robust, meaning it would be costly to attack and easy to repair. They noted that \"A crew of less than 50 men with wheelbarrows and hand tools probably could repair in one day the largest crater observed.\" Second, they found that \"all the damaged sections of dikes are close to valid military-related targets\", and not in areas that would cause the most damage to the dike system. Thus the CIA argued that \"A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system.\" French geographer Yves Lacoste published an analysis in 1973 which concluded the dike system was intentionally targeted in the eastern region of the delta, with bombs consistently targeting the most vulnerable concave sections, and resulted in critical sub-surface damage which left them vulnerable to failure in subsequent flooding.\nFonda was photographed seated on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun; the photo outraged a number of Americans, and earned her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane\". In her 2005 autobiography, she wrote that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery; she had been horrified at the implications of the pictures. In a 2011 entry on her official website, Fonda explained:\nIt happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit\u00a0... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return\u00a0... I memorized a song called 'D\u1eady m\u00e0 \u0111i' [\"Get up and go\"], written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me\u00a0... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed\u00a0... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen\u00a0... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever\u00a0... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.\nFonda made radio broadcasts on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, describing her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories that had been bombed, and denouncing U.S. military policy. During the course of her visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda said that those making such claims were \"hypocrites and liars and pawns\", adding about the prisoners she visited, \"These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.\" In addition, Fonda told \"The New York Times\" in 1973, \"I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture\u00a0... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie.\" Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent rumors that prisoners had been coerced into meeting with Fonda by the North Vietnamese with torture, which were repeated widely, and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have denied the rumors, and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these allegations to be false\u2014the persons named had never met Fonda.\nIn 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign, which continued to mobilize antiwar activists in the US after the 1973 Paris Peace Agreement, until 1975 when the United States withdrew from Vietnam. Because of her tour of North Vietnam during wartime and the subsequent rumors, resentment against her persists among some veterans and serving U.S. military. For example, when a U.S. Naval Academy plebe ritually shouted out \"Goodnight, Jane Fonda!\", the entire company of midshipmen plebes replied \"Goodnight, bitch!\" This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's \"Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures\". In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, \"My Life So Far\". He told reporters that he \"consider[ed] it a debt of honor\", adding \"she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did.\" Fonda refused to press charges. When Los Angeles County tried to name April 30 as \"Jane Fonda Day\" for her environmental work in 2024, it was met with immediate backlash from the region's large Vietnamese American community because it fell on the same day as what the diaspora call Black April, the day when Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces; the day was later moved to April 8 instead to avoid further controversy with the county stating that April 30 was originally chosen because it was the scheduled day the county met to commemorate people.\nRegrets.\nIn a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:\nI would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. ... I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.\nIn a \"60 Minutes\" interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a \"betrayal\" of American forces and of the \"country that gave me privilege\". Fonda said, \"The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.\" She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: \"There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for.\" Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: \"Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.\"\nSubject of government surveillance.\nIn 2013, it was revealed that Fonda was one of approximately 1,600 Americans whose communications between 1967 and 1973 were monitored by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as part of Project MINARET, a program that some NSA officials have described as \"disreputable if not downright illegal\". Fonda's communications, as well as those of her husband, Tom Hayden, were intercepted by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Under the UKUSA Agreement, intercepted data on Americans were sent to the U.S. government.\n1970 arrest.\nOn November 2, 1970, Fonda was arrested by authorities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking. Her luggage was searched when she re-entered the United States after participating in an anti-war college speaking tour in Canada, and several small baggies containing pills were seized. Although Fonda protested that the pills were harmless vitamins, she was booked by police and then released on bond. Fonda alleged that the arresting officer told her he was acting on direct orders from the Nixon White House. As she wrote in 2009, \"I told them what [the vitamins] were but they said they were getting orders from the White House. I think they hoped this 'scandal' would cause the college speeches to be canceled and ruin my respectability.\" After lab tests confirmed the pills were vitamins, the charges were dropped with little media attention.\nFonda's mugshot from the arrest, in which she raises her fist in a sign of solidarity, has since become a widely published image of the actress. It was used as the poster image for the 2018 HBO documentary on Fonda, \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts\", with a giant billboard sporting the image erected in Times Square in September 2018. In 2017, she began selling merchandise with her mugshot image to benefit the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power &amp; Potential.\nFeminist causes.\nIn a 2017 interview with Brie Larson, published by \"People\" magazine, Fonda stated, \"One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right.\" She said, \"I've been raped, I've been sexually abused as a child and I've been fired because I wouldn't sleep with my boss.\" She said, \"I always thought it was my fault; that I didn't do or say the right thing. I know young girls who've been raped and didn't even know it was rape. They think, 'It must have been because I said 'no' the wrong way.'\"\nThrough her work, Fonda said she wants to help abuse victims \"realize that [rape and abuse] is not our fault\". Fonda said that her difficult past led her to become such a passionate activist for women's rights. The actress is an active supporter of the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health, which aims to help prevent teen pregnancy. She said she was \"brought up with the disease to please\" in her early life. Fonda revealed in 2014 that her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, was recurrently sexually abused as young as eight, and this may have led to her suicide when Jane was 12.\nFonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including V-Day, of which she is an honorary chairperson, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit \"The Vagina Monologues\". She was at the first summit in 2002, bringing together founder Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from genital mutilation.\nIn 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta to help prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development. On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials in helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city. In 2004, she also served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of \"The Vagina Monologues\". In the days before the September 17, 2006, Swedish elections, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.\nIn \"My Life So Far\", Fonda stated that she considers patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were \"anti-male\". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she \"still loves men\", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.\nIn April 2016, Fonda said that while she was 'glad' that Bernie Sanders was running, she predicted Hillary Clinton would become the first female president, whose supposed win Fonda believed would result in a \"violent backlash.\" Clinton did not become president and got defeated by Republican Party's nominee businessman Donald Trump in the general election later that year. Fonda went on to say that we need to \"help men understand why they are so threatened \u2013 and change the way we view masculinity\". In March 2020, Fonda endorsed Sanders for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 election, calling him the \"climate candidate.\"\nWomen's Media Center.\nIn 2005, along with Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, she cofounded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves on the board of the organization. Based in Los Angeles, she has lived all over the world, including six years in France and 20 in Atlanta.\nLGBTQ+ support.\nFonda has publicly shown her support of the LGBTQ+ community many times throughout her career. In August 2021, Fonda, the cast of \"Grace and Frankie\", and other advocates joined to support a fundraiser hosted by the Los Angeles LGBT Center to help members of the LGBTQ+ community during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFonda spoke out as an LGBTQ+ ally long before it was common. She appeared in a video of a 1979 interview during the White Night Riots in San Francisco after the assassination of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician in California. During the interview she was asked if the gay community was still being discriminated against, to which she replied that they \"are culturally, psychologically, economically, politically\" being discriminated against. Fonda was then asked if the gay community has used her as an advocate and she replied that she hopes they will use her, though she stressed that \"they are a very powerful movement, they don't need me, but they like me (and) they know by working together we can be stronger than either entity is by itself.\"\nNative Americans.\nFonda went to Seattle in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by Bernie Whitebear. The group had occupied part of the grounds of Fort Lawton, which was in the process of being surplussed by the United States Army and turned into a park. The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local urban Indian population, protesting that \"Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs.\" The endeavor succeeded and the Daybreak Star Cultural Center was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.\nIn addition to environmental reasons, Fonda has been a critic of oil pipelines because of their being built without consent on Native American tribal land. In 2017, Fonda responded to American President Donald Trump's mandate to resume construction of the controversial North Dakota Pipelines by saying that Trump \"does this illegally because he has not gotten consent from the tribes through whose countries this goes\" and pointing out that \"the U.S. has agreed to treaties that require them to get the consent of the people who are affected, the indigenous people who live there.\"\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nIn December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp.\nIn September 2009, she was one of more than 1,500 signatories to a letter protesting the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival's spotlight on Tel Aviv. The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of \"the Israeli propaganda machine\" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.\nFonda, in \"The Huffington Post\", said she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it \"was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers.\" She continued, writing \"the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\" Fonda emphasized that she, \"in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.\" Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to \"The Huffington Post\" rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as \"a strong supporter and friend of Israel\".\nOpposition to the Iraq War.\nFonda argued that the Iraq War would turn people all over the world against America, and asserted that a global hatred of America would result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda planned an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.\nIn September 2005, Fonda was scheduled to join British politician and anti-war activist George Galloway at two stops on his U.S. book tour\u2014Chicago, and Madison, Wisconsin. She canceled her appearances at the last minute, citing instructions from her doctors to avoid travel following recent hip surgery. On January 27, 2007, Fonda participated in an anti-war rally and march held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., declaring that \"silence is no longer an option\". She spoke at an anti-war rally earlier that day at the Navy Memorial, where members of the organization Free Republic picketed in a counter protest.\nFonda and Kerry.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against John Kerry, a former VVAW leader, who was then the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie called Kerry a \"Jane Fonda Democrat\". Kerry's opponents also circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, though they sat several rows apart. A faked composite photograph, which gave a false impression that the two had shared a speaker's platform, was also circulated.\nEnvironmentalism.\nIn 2015, Fonda expressed disapproval of President Barack Obama's permitting of Arctic drilling (Petroleum exploration in the Arctic) at the Sundance Film Festival. In July, she marched in a Toronto protest called the \"March for Jobs, Justice, and Climate\", which was organized by dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and environmental activists, including Canadian author Naomi Klein. The march aimed to show businesses and politicians alike that climate change is inherently linked to issues that may seem unrelated.\nIn addition to issues of civil rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau \"talked so beautifully of needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people ... and yet he has betrayed every one of the things he committed to in Paris.\"\nSince at least 2019, she has been a supporter of global environmental organizations including GreenFaith and 350.org. She spoke at the Fire Drill Fridays protest in Washington, D.C. wherein protestors condemned expansion of the fossil fuel industry.\nIn October 2019, Fonda was arrested three times in consecutive weeks protesting climate change outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. She was arrested with members of the group Oil Change International on October 11, with \"Grace and Frankie\" co-star Sam Waterston on October 18, and with actor Ted Danson on October 25. On November 1, Fonda was arrested for the fourth consecutive Friday; also arrested were Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette. On December 5, 2019, Fonda explained her position in a \"New York Times\" op-ed. In March 2022, Fonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate PAC, a political action committee with the purpose of ousting politicians supporting the fossil fuel industry.\nIn September 2023, she participated in New York City's March to End Fossil Fuels. In 2024, she was a featured guest at 350.org's Food &amp; Water Watch event.\nArtificial intelligence.\nIn September 2024, Fonda joined over 125 actors, directors, and musicians in signing an open letter urging Governor Gavin Newsom to sign SB 1047, a Californian AI safety bill that would, amongst other things, hold companies training the largest AI models liable if their models cause mass casualties or over $500 million in damages. The letter, also signed by figures such as Alec Baldwin, Pedro Pascal and Kelly Rowland, said that the \"Grave threats from AI used to be the stuff of science fiction, but not anymore,\" and that AI companies should implement \"reasonable safeguards\" against those risks.\nOther activities.\nWriting.\nOn April 5, 2005, Random House published Fonda's autobiography \"My Life So Far\". The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third \"act\" will be her most significant, partly because of her commitment to Christianity, and that it will determine the things for which she will be remembered.\nFonda's autobiography was well received by book critics and noted to be \"as beguiling and as maddening as Jane Fonda herself\" in its review in \"The Washington Post\", calling her a \"beautiful bundle of contradictions\". \"The New York Times\" called the book \"achingly poignant\".\nIn January 2009, Fonda began chronicling her return to Broadway in a blog with posts about topics ranging from her Pilates class to fears and excitement about her new play. She uses Twitter and has a Facebook page. In 2011, Fonda published a new book: \"Prime Time: Love, health, sex, fitness, friendship, spirit \u2013 making the most of all of your life\". It offers stories from her own life as well as from the lives of others, giving her perspective on how to better live what she calls \"the critical years from 45 and 50, and especially from 60 and beyond\". On September 8, 2020, HarperCollins published Fonda's book, \"What Can I Do?: The Truth About Climate Change and How to Fix It\".\nPhilanthropy.\nFonda's charitable works have focused on youth and education, adolescent reproductive health, environment, human services, and the arts. Fonda marketed her highly successful line of exercise videos and books in order to fund the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a California lobbying organization she founded with her second husband Tom Hayden in 1978. Fonda has established the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential (GCAPP) in the mid-1990s and the Fonda Family Foundation in the late 1990s. In the mid-2000s, Fonda founded the Jane Fonda Foundation in 2004 with one million dollars of her own money as a charitable corporation with herself as president, chair, director, and secretary; Fonda contributes 10 hours each week on its behalf. In 2017, she began selling merchandise featuring her 1970 arrest mugshot on her website, the proceeds of which benefit GCAPP.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and relationships.\nFonda writes in her autobiography that she lost her virginity at age 18 to actor James Franciscus. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, she dated automobile racing manager Giovanni Volpi, producers Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sainz de Vicu\u00f1a and Sandy Whitelaw as well as actors Warren Beatty, Peter Mann, Christian Marquand and William Wellman Jr. During this time, she often bearded for closeted homosexuals, including dancer Timmy Everett, theater director Andreas Voutsinas and actor Earl Holliman.\nFonda and her first husband, French film director Roger Vadim, became an item in December 1963 and married on August 14, 1965, at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. The couple had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim, born on September 28, 1968, in Boulogne-Billancourt and named after actress and activist Vanessa Redgrave. Separation reports surfaced in March 1970, which Fonda's spokesman called \"totally untrue\", though by mid-1972 she was conceding: \"We're separated. Not legally, just separated. We're friends.\" In the early 1970s, Fonda had affairs with political organizer Fred Gardner and \"Klute\" co-star Donald Sutherland.\nOn January 19, 1973, three days after obtaining a divorce from Vadim in Santo Domingo, Fonda married activist Tom Hayden in a free-form ceremony at her home in Laurel Canyon. She had become involved with Hayden the previous summer and was three months pregnant when they married. Their son, Troy O'Donovan Garity, was born on July 7, 1973, in Los Angeles and was given his paternal grandmother's maiden name, as the names \"Fonda and Hayden carried too much baggage.\" Fonda and Hayden named their son for Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Tr\u1ed7i, the Viet Cong member who had attempted to assassinate US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Hayden chose O'Donovan as the middle name after Irish revolutionary Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. In 1982, Fonda and Hayden unofficially adopted an African-American teenager, Mary Luana Williams (known as Lulu), whose parents were Black Panthers. Fonda and Hayden separated over the Christmas holiday of 1988 and divorced on June 10, 1990, in Santa Monica. In 1989, while estranged from Hayden, Fonda had a seven-month relationship with soccer player Lorenzo Caccialanza. She was linked with actor Rob Lowe that same year.\nFonda married her third husband, cable television tycoon and CNN founder Ted Turner, on December 21, 1991, at a ranch near Capps, Florida, about 20 miles east of Tallahassee. The pair separated in 2000 and divorced on May 22, 2001, in Atlanta. Seven years of celibacy followed, then from 2007 to 2008 Fonda was the companion of widower and management consultant Lynden Gillis. In mid-2009, Fonda began a relationship with record producer Richard Perry. It ended in January 2017. That December, when asked what she had learned about love, Fonda told \"Entertainment Tonight\": \"Nothing. I'm not cut out for it!\"\nIn a 2018 interview, Fonda stated that up to age 62, she always felt she had to seek the validation of men in order to prove to herself that she had value as a person, something she attributes to her mother's early death leaving her without a female role model. As a consequence, she attached herself to \"alpha males\", some of whom reinforced her feelings of inadequacy, despite her professional success. Fonda said that she came to see that attitude as a failing of the men in her life: \"Some men have a hard time realizing that the woman they're married to is strong and smart and they have to diminish that, because it makes them feel diminished. Too bad we have defined masculinity in such a way that it's so easily shamed.\" In 2018 she said, \"I'm not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago. I'm 80; I've closed up shop down there.\"\nFaith and activism.\nFonda grew up atheist but turned to Christianity in the early 2000s. She describes her beliefs as being \"outside of established religion\" with a more feminist slant and views God as something that \"lives within each of us as Spirit (or soul)\". Fonda once refused to say \"Jesus Christ\" in \"Grace and Frankie\" and the script was changed. She practices zazen and yoga.\nHealth.\nAs a child, Fonda suffered from a poor self-image and lacked confidence in her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. About that, Fonda said:\nI was raised in the '50s. I was taught by my father [actor Henry Fonda] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.In another interview with Oprah Winfrey, Fonda confessed, after years of struggling with her self-image, \"It took me a long long time to realize we're not meant to be perfect, we're meant to be whole.\" In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia, which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour, who died by suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said,\nIt was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout ... I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.\nFonda was diagnosed with breast cancer and osteoporosis in her later years. She underwent a lumpectomy in November 2010 and recovered. In April 2019, Fonda revealed she had a cancerous growth removed from her lower lip the previous year and pre-melanoma growths removed from her skin. In 2022, Fonda was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and that began chemotherapy treatments, expected to last six months. On December 15, 2022, Fonda stated that her cancer was in remission and that her chemotherapy would be discontinued.\nActing credits and accolades.\nIn 1962, Fonda was given the honorary title of \"Miss Army Recruiting\" by the Pentagon. In 1981, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award. In 1994, the United Nations Population Fund made Fonda a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2004, she was awarded the Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century award as one of Seven Who Change Their Worlds. In 2007, Fonda was awarded an Honorary Palme d'Or by Cannes Film Festival President Gilles Jacob for career achievement. Only three others had received such an award \u2013 Jeanne Moreau, Alain Resnais, and G\u00e9rard Oury.\nIn December 2008, Fonda was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. In November and December 2009, she received the National German Sustainability Award and New York Women's Agenda Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also selected as the 42nd recipient (2014) of the AFI Life Achievement Award. In 2017, she received a Goldene Kamera lifetime achievement award. In 2021, she received a Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. In 2025, she received a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nShe was one of fifteen women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of British \"Vogue\", by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. In 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and in the following year she was on the list of the BBC's 100 Women. In September 2023, Fonda received the John Steinbeck \u201cIn the Souls of the People\u201d Award.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at much greater risk of colorectal cancer and small bowel cancer.\nAlthough the precise causes of Crohn's disease (CD) are unknown, it is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental, immune, and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system defends the gastrointestinal tract, possibly targeting microbial antigens. Although Crohn's is an immune-related disease, it does not seem to be an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state.\nAbout half of the overall risk is related to genetics, with more than 70 genes involved. Tobacco smokers are three times as likely to develop Crohn's disease as non-smokers. Crohn's disease is often triggered after a gastroenteritis episode. Other conditions with similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome and Beh\u00e7et's disease.\nThere is no known cure for Crohn's disease. Treatment options are intended to help with symptoms, maintain remission, and prevent relapse. In those newly diagnosed, a corticosteroid may be used for a brief period of time to improve symptoms rapidly, alongside another medication such as either methotrexate or a thiopurine to prevent recurrence. Cessation of smoking is recommended for people with Crohn's disease. One in five people with the disease is admitted to the hospital each year, and half of those with the disease will require surgery at some time during a ten-year period. Surgery is kept to a minimum whenever possible, but it is sometimes essential for treating abscesses, certain bowel obstructions, and cancers. Checking for bowel cancer via colonoscopy is recommended every 1-3 years, starting eight years after the disease has begun.\nCrohn's disease affects about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America; it is less common in Asia and Africa. It has historically been more common in the developed world. Rates have, however, been increasing, particularly in the developing world, since the 1970s. Inflammatory bowel disease resulted in 47,400 deaths in 2015, and those with Crohn's disease have a slightly reduced life expectancy. Onset of Crohn's disease tends to start in adolescence and young adulthood, though it can occur at any age. Males and females are affected roughly equally.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName controversy.\nThe disease was named after gastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who in 1932, together with Leon Ginzburg (1898\u20131988) and Gordon D. Oppenheimer (1900\u20131974) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of people with inflammation of the terminal ileum of the small intestine, the area most commonly affected by the illness. The decision to name the disease after Crohn remains controversial. While Crohn, in his memoir, describes his original investigation of the disease, Ginzburg provided strong evidence of how he and Oppenheimer were the first to study the disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nGastrointestinal.\nMany people with Crohn's disease have symptoms for years before the diagnosis. The usual onset is in the teens and twenties, but can occur at any age. People with Crohn's disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare-ups and remission.\nPerianal.\nPerianal discomfort may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the anus may be suggestive of inflammation of the anus, or perianal complications such as anal fissures, fistulae, or abscesses around the anal area. Perianal skin tags are also common in Crohn's disease, and may appear with or without the presence of colorectal polyps.\nIntestines.\nThe intestines, especially the colon and terminal ileum, are the areas of the body affected most commonly. Abdominal pain is a common initial symptom of Crohn's disease, especially in the lower right abdomen. Flatulence, bloating, and abdominal distension are additional symptoms and may also add to the intestinal discomfort. Pain is often accompanied by non-bloody diarrhea, however in some cases the diarrhea can be bloody. Inflammation in different areas of the intestinal tract can affect the quality of the feces. Ileitis typically results in large-volume, watery feces, while colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of greater frequency. Fecal consistency may range from solid to watery. In severe cases, an individual may have more than 20 bowel movements per day, and may need to awaken at night to defecate. Visible bleeding in the feces is less common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, but is not unusual. Bloody bowel movements are usually intermittent, and may be bright red, dark maroon, or even black in color. The color of bloody stool depends on the location of the bleed. In severe Crohn's colitis, bleeding may be copious.\nStomach and esophagus.\nThe stomach is rarely the sole or predominant site of Crohn's disease. To date, there are only a few documented case reports of adults with isolated gastric Crohn's disease and no reports in the pediatric population. Isolated stomach involvement is very unusual presentation accounting for less than 0.07% of all gastrointestinal Crohn's disease. However, the esophagus and stomach are increasingly understood to be affected in people with intestinal Crohn's disease. Recent studies suggest upper GI involvement occurs in 13-16% of cases, typically presenting after distal symptoms. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms may include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful swallowing (odynophagia), upper abdominal pain, and vomiting.\nOropharynx (mouth).\nThe mouth may be affected by recurrent canker sores (aphthous ulcers). Recurrent aphthous ulcers are common; however, it is not clear whether this is due to Crohn's disease or simply that they are common in the general population. Other findings may include diffuse or nodular swelling of the mouth, a cobblestone appearance inside the mouth, granulomatous ulcers, or pyostomatitis vegetans. Medications that are commonly prescribed to treat Crohn's disease, such as anti-inflammatory and sulfa-containing drugs, may cause lichenoid drug reactions in the mouth. Fungal infection such as candidiasis is also common due to the immunosuppression required in the treatment of the disease. Signs of anemia such as pallor and angular cheilitis or glossitis are also common due to nutritional malabsorption.\nPeople with Crohn's disease are also susceptible to angular stomatitis, an inflammation of the corners of the mouth, and pyostomatitis vegetans.\nSystemic.\nLike many other chronic, inflammatory diseases, Crohn's disease can cause a variety of systemic symptoms. Among children, growth failure is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on inability to maintain growth. As it may manifest at the time of the growth spurt in puberty, as many as 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of growth. Fever may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5\u00a0\u00b0C (101.3\u00a0\u00b0F) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an abscess. Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss, usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn's disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite. People with extensive small intestine disease may also have malabsorption of carbohydrates or lipids, which can further exacerbate weight loss.\nExtraintestinal.\nCrohn's disease can affect many organ systems beyond the gastrointestinal tract.\nVisual.\nInflammation of the interior portion of the eye, known as uveitis, can cause blurred vision and eye pain, especially when exposed to light (photophobia). Uveitis can lead to loss of vision if untreated.\nInflammation may also involve the white part of the eye (sclera) or the overlying connective tissue (episclera), which causes conditions called scleritis and episcleritis, respectively.\nOther very rare ophthalmological manifestations include: conjunctivitis, glaucoma, and retinal vascular disease.\nThe pathophysiology of ocular inflammation in people with Crohn's disease is complex and remains uncertain. The association between inflammatory conditions of the eye and Crohn's disease is due to many people with Crohn's disease having genetic markers such as HLA-B07, HLA-B27 and HLA-DRB1*0103. Additionally, cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 which are produced in the bowel enter the circulatory system and travel to the eyes to trigger inflammation.\nGallbladder and liver.\nCrohn's disease that affects the ileum may result in an increased risk of gallstones. This is due to a decrease in bile acid resorption in the ileum, resulting in bile excretion in the stool. As a result, the cholesterol/bile ratio increases in the gallbladder, resulting in an increased risk for gallstones. Although the association is greater in the context of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease may also be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis, a type of inflammation of the bile ducts. Specifically, 0.96% of people with Crohn's disease also have primary sclerosing cholangitis.\nLiver involvement of Crohn's disease can include cirrhosis and steatosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NAFLD) are relatively common and can slowly progress to end-stage liver disease. NAFLD sensitizes the liver to injury and increases the risk of developing acute or chronic liver failure following another liver injury.\nOther rare hepatobiliary manifestations of Crohn's disease include: cholangiocarcinoma, granulomatous hepatitis, cholelithiasis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic abscess, and pericholangitis.\nRenal and urological.\nNephrolithiasis, obstructive uropathy, and fistulization of the urinary tract directly result from the underlying disease process. Nephrolithiasis is due to calcium oxalate or uric acid stones. Calcium oxalate stones due to hyperoxaluria are typically associated with either distal ileal Crohn's disease or ileal resection. Oxalate absorption increases in the presence of unabsorbed fatty acids in the colon. The fatty acids compete with oxalate to bind calcium, displacing the oxalate, which can then be absorbed as unbound sodium oxalate across colonocytes and excreted into the urine. Because sodium oxalate is only absorbed in the colon, calcium oxalate stones form only in people with an intact colon. People with an ileostomy are prone to formation of uric acid stones because of frequent dehydration. The sudden onset of severe abdominal, back, or flank pain in patients with IBD, particularly if different from the usual discomfort, should lead to inclusion of a renal stone in the differential diagnosis.\nUrological manifestations in people with IBD may include ureteral calculi, enterovesical fistula, perivesical infection, perinephric abscess, and obstructive uropathy with hydronephrosis. Ureteral compression is associated with retroperitoneal extension of the phlegmonous inflammatory process involving the terminal ileum and cecum, and may result in hydronephrosis severe enough to cause hypertension.\nImmune complex glomerulonephritis presenting with proteinuria and hematuria has been described in children and adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Diagnosis is by renal biopsy, and treatment parallels the underlying IBD.\nAmyloidosis (see endocrinological involvement) secondary to Crohn's disease has been described and is known to affect the kidneys.\nPancreatic.\nPancreatitis may be associated with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The most common cause is iatrogenic and involves sensitivity to medications used to treat IBD, including sulfasalazine, mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine. Pancreatitis may present as symptomatic or more commonly asymptomatic disease in adults with IBD.\nCardiovascular and circulatory.\nChildren and adults with IBD have been rarely (&lt;1%) reported developing pleuropericarditis either at initial presentation or during active or quiescent disease. The pathogenesis of pleuropericarditis is unknown, although certain medications (e.g., sulfasalazine and mesalamine derivatives) have been implicated in some cases. The clinical presentation may include chest pain, dyspnea, or in severe cases pericardial tamponade requiring rapid drainage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been used as therapy, although this should be weighed against the hypothetical risk of exacerbating the underlying IBD.\nIn rare cases, cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, and myocarditis have been described.\nCrohn's disease also increases the risk of blood clots; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of deep venous thrombosis, while difficulty breathing may be a result of pulmonary embolism.\nRespiratory.\nLaryngeal involvement in inflammatory bowel disease is extremely rare. Only 12 cases of laryngeal involvement in Crohn's disease have been reported as of 2019[ [update]]. Moreover, only one case of laryngeal manifestations in ulcerative colitis has been reported as of the same date. Nine people complained of difficulty in breathing due to edema and ulceration from the larynx to the hypopharynx. Hoarseness, sore throat, and odynophagia are other symptoms of laryngeal involvement of Crohn's disease.\nConsidering extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease, those involving the lung are relatively rare. However, there is a wide array of lung manifestations, ranging from subclinical alterations, airway diseases and lung parenchymal diseases to pleural diseases and drug-related diseases. The most frequent manifestation is bronchial inflammation and suppuration with or without bronchiectasis. There are a number of mechanisms by which the lungs may become involved in Crohn's disease. These include the same embryological origin of the lung and gastrointestinal tract by ancestral intestine, similar immune systems in the pulmonary and intestinal mucosa, the presence of circulating immune complexes and auto-antibodies, and the adverse pulmonary effects of some drugs. A complete list of known pulmonary manifestations include: fibrosing alveolitis, pulmonary vasculitis, apical fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheal stenosis, granulomatous lung disease, and abnormal pulmonary function.\nMusculoskeletal.\nCrohn's disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloarthropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (arthritis) or muscle insertions (enthesitis). The arthritis in Crohn's disease can be divided into two types. The first type affects larger weight-bearing joints such as the knee (most common), hips, shoulders, wrists, or elbows. The second type symmetrically involves five or more of the small joints of the hands and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to ankylosing spondylitis if the entire spine is involved, or simply sacroiliitis if only the sacroiliac joint is involved.\nCrohn's disease increases the risk of osteoporosis or thinning of the bones. Individuals with osteoporosis are at increased risk of bone fractures.\nDermatological.\nCrohn's disease may also involve the skin, blood, and endocrine system. Erythema nodosum is the most common type of skin problem, occurring in around 8% of people with Crohn's disease, producing raised, tender red nodules usually appearing on the shins. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is characterized by septal panniculitis.\nPyoderma gangrenosum is a less common skin problem, occurring in under 2%, and is typically a painful ulcerating nodule.\nClubbing, a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may also be a result of Crohn's disease.\nOther very rare dermatological manifestations include: pyostomatitis vegetans, erythema multiforme, epidermolysis bullosa acquista (described in a case report), and metastatic Crohn's disease (the spread of Crohn's inflammation to the skin). It is unknown if Sweet's syndrome is connected to Crohn's disease.\nNeurological.\nCrohn's disease can also cause neurological complications (reportedly in up to 15% of cases). The most common of these are seizures, stroke, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, headache, and depression.\nCentral and peripheral neurological disorders are described in people with IBD and include peripheral neuropathies, myopathies, focal central nervous system defects, convulsions, confusional episodes, meningitis, syncope, optic neuritis, and sensorineural loss. Autoimmune mechanisms are proposed for involvement with IBD. Nutritional deficiencies associated with neurological manifestations, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, should be investigated. Spinal abscess has been reported in both a child and an adult with initial complaints of severe back pain due to extension of a psoas abscess from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space.\nPsychiatric and psychological.\nCrohn's disease is linked to many psychological disorders, including depression and anxiety, denial of one's disease, the need for dependence or dependent behaviors, feeling overwhelmed, and having a poor self-image.\nMany studies have found that people with IBD report a higher frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders than the general population; most studies confirm that women with IBD are more likely than men to develop affective disorders and show that up to 65% of them may have depression and anxiety disorder.\nEndocrinological or hematological.\nLeukocytosis and thrombocytopenia are usually due to immunosuppressant treatments or sulfasalazine. Plasma erythropoietin levels often are lower in patients with IBD than expected, in conjunction with severe anemia. Anemia caused by iron deficiency is often a direct result of intestinal bleeding due to inflammation and interference with iron transport caused by inflammatory mediators. \nThrombocytosis and thromboembolic events resulting from a hypercoagulable state in people with IBD can lead to pulmonary embolism or thrombosis elsewhere in the body. Thrombosis has been reported in 1.8% of people with ulcerative colitis and 3.1% of people with Crohn's disease. Thromboembolism and thrombosis are less frequently reported among children, with three people with ulcerative colitis and one with Crohn's disease described in case reports.\nIn rare cases, hypercoagulation disorders and portal vein thrombosis have been described.\nMalnutrition symptoms.\nPeople with Crohn's disease may develop anemia due to vitamin B12, folate, iron deficiency, or due to anemia of chronic disease. The most common is iron deficiency anemia from chronic blood loss, reduced dietary intake, and persistent inflammation leading to increased hepcidin levels, restricting iron absorption in the duodenum. As Crohn's disease most commonly affects the terminal ileum where the vitamin B12/intrinsic factor complex is absorbed, B12 deficiency may be seen. This is particularly common after one has had a surgical procedure to remove the ileum. Involvement of the duodenum and jejunum can impair the absorption of many other nutrients including folate. People with Crohn's often also have issues with small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome, which can produce micronutrient deficiencies.\nComplications.\nIntestinal damage.\nCrohn's disease can lead to several mechanical complications within the intestines, including obstruction, fistulae, and abscesses. Obstruction typically occurs from strictures or adhesions that narrow the lumen, blocking the passage of the intestinal contents. A fistula can develop between two loops of bowel, between the bowel and bladder, between the bowel and vagina, and between the bowel and skin. Abscesses are walled-off concentrations of infection, which can occur in the abdomen or in the perianal area. Crohn's is responsible for 10% of vesicoenteric fistulae, and is the most common cause of ileovesical fistulae.\nSymptoms caused by intestinal stenosis, or the tightening and narrowing of the bowel, are also common in Crohn's disease. Abdominal pain is often most severe in areas of the bowel with stenosis. Persistent vomiting and nausea may indicate stenosis from small bowel obstruction or disease involving the stomach, pylorus, or duodenum.\nIntestinal granulomas are a walled-off portions of the intestine by macrophages in order to isolate infections. Granuloma formation is more often seen in younger people, and mainly in the severe, active penetrating disease. Granuloma is considered the hallmark of microscopic diagnosis in Crohn's disease, but granulomas can be detected in only 21\u201360% of people with Crohn's disease.\nCancer.\nCrohn's disease also increases the risk of cancer in the area of inflammation. For example, individuals with Crohn's disease involving the small bowel are at higher risk for small intestinal cancer. Similarly, people with Crohn's colitis have a relative risk of 5.6 for developing colon cancer. Screening for colon cancer with colonoscopy is recommended for anyone who has had Crohn's colitis for at least eight years.\nSome studies suggest there is a role for chemoprotection in the prevention of colorectal cancer in Crohn's involving the colon; two agents have been suggested, folate and mesalamine preparations. Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat this disease may promote the development of extra-intestinal cancers.\nSome cancers, such as acute myelocytic leukaemia have been described in cases of Crohn's disease. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare, lethal disease generally seen in young males with inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-\u03b1 Inhibitor treatments (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, and etanercept) are thought to be the cause of this rare disease.\nMajor complications.\nMajor complications of Crohn's disease include bowel obstruction, abscesses, free perforation, and hemorrhage, which in rare cases may be fatal.\nOther complications.\nIndividuals with Crohn's disease are at risk of malnutrition for many reasons, including decreased food intake and malabsorption. The risk increases following resection of the small bowel. Such individuals may require oral supplements to increase their caloric intake, or in severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Most people with moderate or severe Crohn's disease are referred to a dietitian for assistance with nutrition.\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by excessive proliferation of colonic bacterial species in the small bowel. Potential causes of SIBO include fistulae, strictures, or motility disturbances. Hence, people with Crohn's disease are especially predisposed to develop SIBO. As a result, people with Crohn's disease may experience malabsorption and report symptoms such as weight loss, watery diarrhea, meteorism, flatulence, and abdominal pain, mimicking acute flare.\nPregnancy.\nCrohn's disease can be problematic during pregnancy, and some medications can cause adverse outcomes for the fetus or mother. Consultation with an obstetrician and gastroenterologist about Crohn's disease and all medications facilitates preventive measures. In some cases, remission occurs during pregnancy. Certain medications can also lower sperm count or otherwise adversely affect a man's fertility.\nOstomy-related complications.\nCommon complications of an ostomy (a common surgery in Crohn's disease) are: mucosal edema, peristomal dermatitis, retraction, ostomy prolapse, mucosal/skin detachment, hematoma, necrosis, parastomal hernia, and stenosis.\nEtiology.\nThe etiology, or cause, of Crohn's disease is unknown. There are three main hypotheses concerning the primary mechanism of Crohn's disease. In autoimmune diseases, antibodies and T lymphocytes are the primary mode of inflammation. These cells and bodies are part of the adaptive immune system, or the part of the immune system that learns to fight foreign bodies when first identified. However, auto-antibodies that are diagnostic of Crohn's disease have not been reported. Autoinflammatory diseases are diseases where the innate immune system, or the immune system we are genetically coded with, is designed to attack our own cells. Crohn's disease likely has involvement of both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The other hypothesis is a form of immune deficiency. \nAutoinflammatory theory.\nCrohn's disease can be described as a multifactorial autoinflammatory disease. The etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease is still unknown, but a loss of immune regulation can be implicated in the onset of the disease. People with Crohn's disease have more frequent NOD2 gene mutations than the background population, making those mutations a risk factor. In contrast, a person with Blau's disease and a NOD2 mutation is likely to have the syndrome directly from that mutation, in addition to the mutation making them more susceptible to Crohn's. This pathogenesis of Crohn's disease allows it to be placed in the group of autoinflammatory syndromes.\nSome examples of how the innate immune system affects bowel inflammation have been described. A meta-analysis of Crohn's disease genome-wide association studies revealed 71 distinct Crohn's disease-susceptibility loci. Interestingly, three very important Crohn's disease-susceptibility genes (the intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor, NOD2; the autophagy-related 16-like 1, ATG16L1 and the immunity-related GTPase M, IRGM) are involved in innate immune responses against gut microbiota, while one (the X-box binding protein 1) is involved in regulation of the [adaptive] immune pathway via MHC class II, resulting in autoinflammatory inflammation. Studies have also found that increased ILC3 can overexpress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II. MHC class II can induce CD4+ T cell apoptosis, thus avoiding the T cell response to normal bowel micro bacteria. Further studies of people with IBD compared with people without IBD found that the expression of MHC II by ILC3 was significantly reduced in people with IBD, thus causing an immune reaction against intestinal cells or normal bowel bacteria and damaging the intestines. This can also make the intestines more susceptible to environmental factors, such as food or bacteria.\nThe thinking is that because Crohn's disease has strong innate immune system involvement and has NOD2 mutations as a predisposition, Crohn's disease is more likely an autoinflammatory disease than an autoimmune disease.\nImmunodeficiency theory.\nA substantial body of data has emerged in recent years to suggest that the primary defect in Crohn's disease is actually one of relative immunodeficiency. This view has been bolstered recently by novel immunological and clinical studies that have confirmed gross aberrations in this early response, consistent with subsequent genetic studies that have highlighted molecules important for innate immune function. The suggestion therefore is that Crohn's pathogenesis actually results from partial immunodeficiency, a theory that coincides with the frequent recognition of a virtually identical, non-infectious inflammatory bowel disease arising in people with congenital monogenic disorders impairing phagocyte function.\nRisk factors.\nWhile the exact cause or causes are unknown, Crohn's disease seems to be due to a combination of environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Crohn's is the first genetically complex disease in which the relationship between genetic risk factors and the immune system is understood in considerable detail. Each individual risk mutation makes a small contribution to the overall risk of Crohn's (approximately 1:200). The genetic data, and direct assessment of immunity, indicates a malfunction in the innate immune system. In this view, the chronic inflammation of Crohn's is caused when the adaptive immune system tries to compensate for a deficient innate immune system.\nGenetics.\nCrohn's has a genetic component. Because of this, siblings of known people with Crohn's are 30 times more likely to develop Crohn's than the general population.\nThe first mutation found to be associated with Crohn's was a frameshift in the NOD2 gene (also known as the CARD15 gene), followed by the discovery of point mutations. Over 30 genes have been associated with Crohn's; a biological function is known for most of them. For example, one association is with mutations in the XBP1 gene, which is involved in the unfolded protein response pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum. The gene variants of NOD2/CARD15 seem to be related with small-bowel involvement. Other well documented genes which increase the risk of developing Crohn's disease are ATG16L1, IL23R, IRGM, and SLC11A1.\nThere is considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infections. Genome-wide association studies have shown that Crohn's disease is genetically linked to coeliac disease.\nCrohn's has been linked to the gene LRRK2 with one variant potentially increasing the risk of developing the disease by 70%, while another lowers it by 25%. The gene is responsible for making a protein, which collects and eliminates waste product in cells, and is also associated with Parkinson's disease.\nImmune system.\nThere was a prevailing view that Crohn's disease is a primary T cell autoimmune disorder; however, a newer theory (published in 2008) hypothesizes that Crohn's results from an impaired innate immunity. The later hypothesis describes impaired cytokine secretion by macrophages, which contributes to impaired innate immunity and leads to a sustained microbial-induced inflammatory response in the colon, where the bacterial load is high. Another theory is that the inflammation of Crohn's was caused by an overactive Th1 and Th17 cytokine response.\nIn 2007, the ATG16L1 gene was implicated in Crohn's disease, which may induce autophagy and hinder the body's ability to attack invasive bacteria. Another study theorized that the human immune system traditionally evolved with the presence of parasites inside the body and that the lack thereof due to modern hygiene standards has weakened the immune system. Test subjects were reintroduced to harmless parasites, with positive responses.\nMicrobes.\nIt is hypothesized that maintenance of commensal microorganism growth in the GI tract is dysregulated, either as a result or cause of immune dysregulation.\nThere is an apparent connection between Crohn's disease, \"Mycobacterium\", other pathogenic bacteria, and genetic markers. For instance, the genetic predisposition to Crohn's disease overlaps with susceptibility to leprosy, a mycobacterial disease. A number of studies have suggested a causal role for \"Mycobacterium avium\" subspecies \"paratuberculosis\" (MAP), which causes a similar disease, Johne's disease, in cattle. In many individuals, genetic factors predispose individuals to \"Mycobacterium avium\" subsp.\" paratuberculosis\" infection. This bacterium may produce certain compounds containing mannose, which may protect both itself and various other bacteria from phagocytosis, thereby possibly causing a variety of secondary infections.\nOther studies have linked Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) to the disease. \nThe \"cold-chain\" hypothesis is that psychrotrophic bacteria such as \"Yersinia\" and \"Listeria\" species contribute to the disease. A statistical correlation was found between the advent of the use of refrigeration in the United States and various parts of Europe and the rise of the disease.\nThere is also a tentative association between \"Candida\" colonization and Crohn's disease.\nStill, these relationships between specific pathogens and Crohn's disease remain unclear.\nEnvironmental factors.\nThe increased incidence of Crohn's disease in the industrialized world indicates an environmental component. Crohn's is associated with an increased intake of animal protein, milk protein, and an increased ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.\nThose who consume vegetable proteins appear to have a lower incidence of Crohn's disease. Consumption of fish protein has no association.\nSmoking increases the risk of the return of active disease (flares). The introduction of hormonal contraception in the United States in the 1960s is associated with a dramatic increase in incidence, and one hypothesis is that these drugs work on the digestive system in ways similar to smoking. Isotretinoin is associated with Crohn's.\nAlthough stress is sometimes claimed to exacerbate Crohn's disease, there is no concrete evidence to support such claim. Still, it is well known that immune function is related to stress. Dietary microparticles, such as those found in toothpaste, have been studied as they produce effects on immunity, but they were not consumed in greater amounts in people with Crohn's. The use of doxycycline has also been associated with increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases. In one large retrospective study, participants who were prescribed doxycycline for their acne had a 2.25-fold greater risk of developing Crohn's disease.\nPathophysiology.\nDuring a colonoscopy, biopsies of the colon are often taken to confirm the diagnosis. Certain characteristic features of the pathology seen point toward Crohn's disease. Common features include a transmural pattern of inflammation, meaning the inflammation may span the entire depth of the intestinal wall. Granulomas, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show \"caseation\", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as tuberculosis. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal villi, atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type (metaplasia). One example of such metaplasia, \"Paneth cell metaplasia\", involves the development of Paneth cells (typically found in the small intestine and a key regulator of intestinal microbiota) in other parts of the gastrointestinal system.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of Crohn's disease can sometimes be challenging, and many tests are often required to assist the physician in making the diagnosis. Even with a full battery of tests, it may not be possible to diagnose Crohn's with complete certainty; a colonoscopy is approximately 70% effective in diagnosing the disease, with further tests being less effective. Disease in the small bowel is particularly difficult to diagnose, as a traditional colonoscopy allows access to only the colon and lower portions of the small intestines; introduction of the capsule endoscopy aids in endoscopic diagnosis. Intestinal ultrasound should be considered an early step in the diagnosis and follow-up of people with Crohn's disease even in people with a proximal small bowel localization of the disease. Giant (multinucleate) cells, a common finding in the lesions of Crohn's disease, are less common in the lesions of lichen nitidus.\nClassification.\nCrohn's disease is one type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It typically manifests in the gastrointestinal tract and can be categorized by the specific tract region affected.\nGastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine, called the jejunum. The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. However, individuals affected by the disease rarely fall outside these three classifications, with presentations in other areas.\nCrohn's disease may also be categorized by the behavior of the disease as it progresses. These categorizations formalized in the Vienna classification of the disease. There are three categories of disease presentation in Crohn's disease: stricturing, penetrating, and inflammatory. Stricturing disease causes narrowing of the bowel that may lead to bowel obstruction or changes in the caliber of the feces. Penetrating disease creates abnormal passageways (fistulae) between the bowel and other structures, such as the skin. Inflammatory disease (or nonstricturing, nonpenetrating disease) causes inflammation without causing strictures or fistulae.\nEndoscopy.\nA colonoscopy is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the terminal ileum, identifying the pattern of disease involvement. On occasion, the colonoscope can travel past the terminal ileum, but it varies from person to person. During the procedure, the gastroenterologist can also perform a biopsy, taking small samples of tissue for laboratory analysis, which may help confirm a diagnosis. As 30% of Crohn's disease involves only the ileum, cannulation of the terminal ileum is required in making the diagnosis. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum, but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata. The utility of capsule endoscopy for this, however, is still uncertain. A 2025 clinical guideline indicated that video capsule endoscopy is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of people with small bowel Crohn's disease.\nRadiologic tests.\nA small bowel follow-through may suggest the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and is useful when the disease involves only the small intestine. Because colonoscopy and gastroscopy allow direct visualization of only the terminal ileum and beginning of the duodenum, they cannot be used to evaluate the remainder of the small intestine. As a result, a barium follow-through X-ray, wherein barium sulfate suspension is ingested and fluoroscopic images of the bowel are taken over time, is useful for looking for inflammation and narrowing of the small bowel. Barium enemas, in which barium is inserted into the rectum and fluoroscopy is used to image the bowel, are rarely used in the work-up of Crohn's disease due to the advent of colonoscopy. They remain useful for identifying anatomical abnormalities when strictures of the colon are too small for a colonoscope to pass through, or in the detection of colonic fistulae (in this case contrast should be performed with iodate substances).\nCT and MRI scans are useful for evaluating the small bowel with enteroclysis protocols. They are also useful for looking for intra-abdominal complications of Crohn's disease, such as abscesses, small bowel obstructions, or fistulae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another option for imaging the small bowel as well as looking for complications, though it is more expensive and less readily available. MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging and high-resolution imaging are more sensitive in detecting ulceration and inflammation compared to CT.\nPediatrics considerations.\nImaging in pediatric Crohn's disease requires careful consideration to minimize radiation exposure while ensuring accurate diagnosis and monitoring. Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) is favored over Computed Tomography Enterography (CTE) due to its lack of ionizing radiation and superior soft tissue contrast. MRE effectively assesses bowel wall thickening, inflammation, and complications such as strictures or fistulas. However, it demands longer scan times and patient cooperation, which can be challenging for younger children.\nUltrasound (US), particularly contrast-enhanced ultrasound, serves as a valuable, radiation-free alternative for evaluating bowel wall thickness, vascularity, and inflammatory changes. It is especially useful for initial assessments and ongoing disease monitoring, though its effectiveness can be operator-dependent.\nIn urgent situations where rapid imaging is necessary to evaluate severe disease complications, such as bowel perforation or abscess formation, CTE may be utilized despite its associated radiation exposure.\nRegular imaging follow-ups should be guided by clinical symptoms and biomarkers to minimize unnecessary scans. Emerging imaging techniques continue to improve the safety and efficacy of pediatric Crohn's disease evaluation.\nBlood tests.\nA complete blood count may reveal anemia, which commonly is caused by blood loss leading to iron deficiency or by vitamin B12 deficiency, usually caused by ileal disease impairing vitamin B12 absorption. Rarely autoimmune hemolysis may occur. Ferritin levels help assess if iron deficiency is contributing to the anemia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein help assess the degree of inflammation, which is important as ferritin can also be raised in inflammation.\nOther causes of anemia include medication used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, like azathioprine, which can lead to cytopenia, and sulfasalazine, which can also result in folate deficiency. Testing for \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) has been evaluated to identify inflammatory diseases of the intestine and to differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, increasing amounts and levels of serological antibodies such as ASCA, antilaminaribioside [Glc(\u03b21,3)Glb(\u03b2); ALCA], antichitobioside [GlcNAc(\u03b21,4)GlcNAc(\u03b2); ACCA], antimannobioside [Man(\u03b11,3)Man(\u03b1)AMCA], antiLaminarin [(Glc(\u03b21,3))3n(Glc(\u03b21,6))n; anti-L] and antichitin [GlcNAc(\u03b21,4)n; anti-C] associate with disease behavior and surgery, and may aid in the prognosis of Crohn's disease.\nLow serum levels of vitamin D are associated with Crohn's disease. Further studies are required to determine the significance of this association.\nComparison with ulcerative colitis.\nThe most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nOther conditions with similar symptoms as Crohn's disease includes intestinal tuberculosis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, ulcerative colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease. Irritable bowel syndrome is excluded when there are inflammatory changes. Celiac disease cannot be excluded if specific antibodies (anti-transglutaminase antibodies) are negative, nor in the absence of intestinal villi atrophy.\nManagement.\nThere is no cure for Crohn's disease and remission may not be possible or prolonged if achieved. In cases where remission is possible, relapse can be prevented and symptoms controlled with medication, lifestyle and dietary changes, changes to eating habits (eating smaller amounts more often), reduction of stress, moderate activity, and exercise. Surgery is generally contraindicated and has not been shown to prevent relapse. Adequately controlled, Crohn's disease may not significantly restrict daily living. Treatment for Crohn's disease involves first treating the acute problem and its symptoms, then maintaining remission of the disease.\nLifestyle changes.\nCertain lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms, including dietary adjustments, elemental diet, proper hydration, and smoking cessation. Some reviews underlined the importance to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence, even if little is known about the impact of diets on these people.\nDiets that include higher levels of fiber and fruit are associated with reduced risk, while diets rich in total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, meat, and omega-6 fatty acids may increase the risk of Crohn's. Maintaining a balanced diet with proper portion control can help manage symptoms of the disease. Eating small meals frequently instead of big meals may also help with a low appetite. A food diary may help with identifying foods that trigger symptoms. Despite the recognized importance of dietary fiber for intestinal health, some people should follow a low residue diet to control acute symptoms especially if foods high in insoluble fiber cause symptoms, e.g., due to obstruction or irritation of the bowel. Some find relief in eliminating casein (a protein found in cow's milk) and gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye and barley) from their diets. They may have specific dietary intolerances (not allergies), for example, lactose. Fatigue can be helped with regular exercise, a healthy diet, and enough sleep, and for those with malabsorption of vitamin B12 due to disease or surgical resection of the terminal ileum, cobalamin injections. Smoking may worsen symptoms and the course of the disease, and stopping is recommended. Alcohol consumption can also worsen symptoms, and moderation or cessation is advised.\nMany patients with Crohn's disease tend to follow restrictive diets to control symptoms. Usually lactose-free diets is the most common diet followed by patients with Crohn's disease (17.4% vs 11.6% controls), followed by Gluten-free diet (13.4% CD vs 9.3% in controls). Low-FODMAP diet adoption is usually minimal. Fibre avoidance is higher in patients with Crohn's disease (52%) compared to controls (5%).\nMedication.\nAcute treatment uses medications to treat any infection (normally antibiotics) and to reduce inflammation (normally corticosteroids). When symptoms are in remission, treatment enters maintenance, intending to avoid the recurrence of symptoms. Prolonged use of corticosteroids has significant side-effects; as a result, they are, in general, not used for long-term treatment. Alternatives include aminosalicylates alone, though only a minority can maintain the treatment, and many require immunosuppressive drugs. It has also been suggested that antibiotics change the enteric flora, and their continuous use may pose the risk of overgrowth with pathogens such as \"Clostridioides difficile\".\nMedications used to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) formulations, prednisone, immunomodulators such as azathioprine (given as the prodrug for 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate, and anti-TNF therapies and monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, natalizumab,risankizumab-rzaa, and upadacitinib Hydrocortisone should be used in severe attacks of Crohn's disease. Biological therapies are medications used to avoid long-term steroid use, decrease inflammation, and treat people who have fistulas with abscesses. The monoclonal antibody ustekinumab appears to be a safe treatment option, and may help people with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease. The long term safety and effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatment is not known. The monoclonal antibody briakinumab is not effective for people with active Crohn's disease and it is no longer being manufactured.\nThe gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routine monitoring for this.\nImmunosuppressant therapies, infection risks and vaccinations.\nMany people affected by Crohn's disease need immunosuppressant therapies, which are known to be associated with a higher risk of contracting opportunistic infectious diseases and of pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions such as cervical high-grade dysplasia and cancer.\nMany of these potentially harmful diseases, such as Hepatitis B, Influenza, herpes zoster virus, pneumococcal pneumonia, or human papilloma virus, can be prevented by vaccines.\nCompared to the rest of the population, people affected by IBD are known to be at higher risk of contracting some vaccine-preventable diseases such as the flu and pneumonia.\nNevertheless, despite the increased risk of infections, vaccination rates in people with IBD are known to be suboptimal and may also be lower than vaccination rates in the general population.\nSurgery.\nCrohn's cannot be cured by surgery, as the disease eventually recurs, though it is used in the case of partial or full blockage of the intestine. Surgery may also be required for complications such as obstructions, fistulas, or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs. After the first surgery, Crohn's usually comes back at the site where the diseased intestine was removed and the healthy ends were rejoined; it can also come back in other locations. After a resection, scar tissue builds up, which can cause strictures, which form when the intestines become too small to allow excrement to pass through easily, which can lead to a blockage. After the first resection, another resection may be necessary within five years. For people with an obstruction due to a stricture, two options for treatment are strictureplasty and resection of that portion of the bowel. There is no statistical significance between strictureplasty alone versus strictureplasty and resection in cases of duodenal involvement. In these cases, re-operation rates were 31% and 27%, respectively, indicating that strictureplasty is a safe and effective treatment for selected people with duodenal involvement.\nPostsurgical recurrence of Crohn's disease is relatively common. Crohn's lesions are nearly always found at the site of the resected bowel. The join (or anastomosis) after surgery may be inspected, usually during a colonoscopy, and disease activity graded. The \"Rutgeerts score\" is an endoscopic scoring system for postoperative disease recurrence in Crohn's disease. Postsurgical remission per the Rutgeerts score is graded as i0; while mild postsurgical recurrences are graded i1 and i2, and moderate to severe recurrences are graded i3 and i4. Fewer lesions result in a lower grade. Based on the score, treatment plans can be designed to give the patient the best chance of managing the recurrence of the disease.\nShort bowel syndrome (SBS, also short gut syndrome or simply short gut) is caused by the surgical removal of part of the small intestine. It usually develops in those people who have had half or more of their small intestines removed. Diarrhea is the main symptom, but others may include weight loss, cramping, bloating, and heartburn. Short bowel syndrome is treated with changes in diet, intravenous feeding, vitamin and mineral supplements, and treatment with medications. In some cases of SBS, intestinal transplant surgery may be considered; though the number of transplant centres offering this procedure is quite small and it comes with a high risk due to the chance of infection and rejection of the transplanted intestine.\nBile acid diarrhea is another complication following surgery for Crohn's disease in which the terminal ileum has been removed. This leads to the development of excessive watery diarrhea. It is usually thought to be due to an inability of the ileum to reabsorb bile acids after resection of the terminal ileum and was the first type of bile acid malabsorption recognized.\nMicrobiome modification.\nThe use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behaviour of the gastrointestinal microbiome has been researched to understand whether it may help to improve remission rates in people with Crohn's disease. However, only two controlled trials were available in 2020, with no clear overall evidence of higher remission nor lower adverse effects, in people with Crohn's disease receiving probiotic supplementation.\nMental health.\nCrohn's may result in anxiety or mood disorders, especially in young people who may have stunted growth or embarrassment from fecal incontinence. Counselling as well as antidepressant or anxiolytic medication may help some people manage.\nAs of 2017[ [update]] there is a small amount of research looking at mindfulness-based therapies, hypnotherapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy. A meta analysis of interventions to improve mood (including talking therapy, antidepressants, and exercise) in people with inflammatory bowel disease found that they reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin. Psychological therapies reduced inflammation more than antidepressants or exercise.\nAlternative medicine.\nIt is common for people with Crohn's disease to try complementary or alternative therapy. These include diets, probiotics, fish oil, and other herbal and nutritional supplements. A 2006 survey in Germany found that about half of people with IBD used some form of alternative medicine, with the most common being homeopathy, and a study in France found that about 30% used alternative medicine.\nPrognosis.\nCrohn's disease is a chronic condition for which there is no known cure. It is characterised by periods of improvement followed by episodes when symptoms flare up. With treatment, most people achieve a healthy weight, and the mortality rate for the disease is relatively low. It can vary from being benign to very severe, and people with CD could experience just one episode or have continuous symptoms. It usually reoccurs, although some people can remain disease-free for years or decades. Up to 80% of people with Crohn's disease are hospitalized at some point during the course of their disease, with the highest rate occurring in the first year after diagnosis. Most people diagnosed with Crohn's require surgery for complications or symptoms of the disease within their lifetime, although the rate associated with this is decreasing with better access to modern treatments. Most people with Crohn's live a normal lifespan. However, Crohn's disease is associated with a small increase in risk of small bowel and colorectal carcinoma (bowel cancer).\nEpidemiology.\nThe percentage of people with Crohn's disease has been determined in Norway and the United States and is similar at 6 to 7.1:100,000. The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America cites this number as approx 149:100,000; NIH cites 28 to 199 per 100,000. Crohn's disease is more common in northern countries, and with higher rates still in the northern areas of these countries. The incidence of Crohn's disease is thought to be similar in Europe but lower in Asia and Africa. It also has a higher incidence in Ashkenazi Jews and smokers.\nCrohn's disease begins most commonly in people in their teens and 20s, and people in their 50s through to their 70s. It is rarely diagnosed in early childhood. It usually affects female children more severely than males. However, only slightly more women than men have Crohn's disease. Parents, siblings or children of people with Crohn's disease are 3 to 20 times more likely to develop the disease. Twin studies find that if one has the disease there is a 55% chance the other will too.\nThe incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing in Europe and in newly industrialised countries. For example, in Brazil, there has been an annual increase of 11% in the incidence of Crohn's disease since 1990.\nHistory.\nInflammatory bowel diseases were described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682\u20131771) and by Scottish physician Thomas Kennedy Dalziel in 1913.\n\"Ileitis terminalis\" was first described by Polish surgeon Antoni Le\u015bniowski in 1904, although it was not conclusively distinguished from intestinal tuberculosis. In Poland, it is still called Le\u015bniowski-Crohn's disease (). Burrill Bernard Crohn, an American gastroenterologist at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, described fourteen cases in 1932, and submitted them to the American Medical Association under the rubric of \"Terminal ileitis: A new clinical entity\". Later that year, he, along with colleagues Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer, published the case series \"Regional ileitis: a pathologic and clinical entity\". However, due to the precedence of Crohn's name in the alphabet, it later became known in the worldwide literature as Crohn's disease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She has received numerous accolades throughout her career spanning over five decades, including an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award as well as nominations for four British Academy Film Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award. For her contributions to the film industry, Spacek was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.\nAfter attending the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, Spacek made her feature film debut in Michael Ritchie's \"Prime Cut\" (1972). Her performance in Terrence Malick's neo-noir crime drama film \"Badlands\" (1973), earned her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. Spacek's breakthrough came when she played the abused teen misfit title character with telekinetic powers in Brian De Palma's supernatural horror film \"Carrie\" (1976), which earned her first of six nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She then starred in Robert Altman's psychological drama film \"3 Women\" (1977). Spacek's complex performance as country music star Loretta Lynn in Michael Apted's biographical musical film \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" (1980), in which she portrayed Lynn from the age of about 13 to near middle age and did her own singing, earned her an Academy Award as well as a Golden Globe Award. She received four more Academy Award nominations for her roles in \"Missing\" (1982), \"The River\" (1984), \"Crimes of the Heart\" (1986), and \"In the Bedroom\" (2001). Spacek won a Golden Globe Award for the latter. Her other notable films include \"Raggedy Man\" (1981), \"'night, Mother\" (1986), \"The Long Walk Home\" (1990), \"JFK\" (1991), \"Affliction\" (1997), \"The Straight Story\" (1999), \"Nine Lives\" (2005), \"North Country\" (2005), \"Get Low\" (2010), \"The Help\" (2011), \"The Old Man &amp; the Gun\" (2018), and \"Sam &amp; Kate\" (2022).\nIn television, Spacek received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her role in the Western film \"The Good Old Boys\" (1995). She was later Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her work in the drama film \"Last Call\" (2002) and the HBO series \"Big Love\" (2010\u20132011), respectively. Spacek played matriarch Sally Rayburn in the Netflix series \"Bloodline\" (2015\u20132017), Ruth Deaver in the Hulu series \"Castle Rock\" (2018), and Ellen Bergman in the Amazon Prime Video series \"Homecoming\" (2018). Her other notable television work include the films \"The Migrants\" (1974), \"A Place for Annie\" (1994), \"If These Walls Could Talk\" (1996), \"Midwives\" (2001) and \"Pictures of Hollis Woods\" (2007), and the series \"Night Sky\" (2022).\nSpacek has also ventured into the music industry. In 1968, under the stage name Rainbo, she recorded her debut single \"John You Went Too Far This Time\". When sales sputtered, Spacek was dropped by her record label. She later recorded vocals for the soundtrack album to \"Coal Miner's Daughter\", which peaked at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart and garnered her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Spacek subsequently released her debut studio album, \"Hangin' Up My Heart\" (1983).\nEarly life and education.\nMary Elizabeth Spacek was born on Christmas Day 1949, in Quitman, Texas, the daughter of Virginia Frances (n\u00e9e Spilman, 1917\u20131981) and Edwin Arnold Spacek Sr., a Wood County agricultural agent in Quitman. Her father was of three quarters Czech (Moravian) and one quarter Sudeten-German ancestry; her paternal grandparents were Mary (n\u00e9e Cervenka) and Arnold A. Spacek (who served as mayor of Granger, Texas in Williamson County). Rip Torn was her first cousin; his mother Thelma Torn (n\u00e9e Spacek) was an elder sister of Sissy's father Edwin. Spacek's mother, who was of English and Irish descent, was from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\nAt the age of six, Spacek performed on stage for the first time in a local talent show. Although her birth name was Mary Elizabeth, she was always called Sissy by her brothers, which led to her nickname, Sissy, derived from 'sister' and a common Southern/Texas nickname. She attended Quitman High School.\nSpacek was greatly affected by the 1967 death of her 19-year-old brother Robbie from leukemia, which she has called \"the defining event of my whole life.\" She has said the tragedy made her fearless in her acting career: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I think it made me brave. Once you experience something like that, you've experienced the ultimate tragedy. And if you can continue, nothing else frightens you. That's what I meant about it being rocket fuel\u2014I was fearless in a way. Maybe it gave more depth to my work because I had already experienced something profound and life-changing.\"\u2014\u200a\nSpacek initially aspired to a singing career. In 1968, under the stage name Rainbo, she recorded a single, \"John You Went Too Far This Time\", the lyrics of which chided John Lennon for his and Yoko Ono's nude album cover for \"Two Virgins\". When sales of her music sputtered, Spacek was dropped by her record label. She switched her focus to acting, enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.\nCareer.\n1970s: Early work and rise to prominence.\nSpacek worked as a photographic model (represented by Ford Models) and as an extra at Andy Warhol's Factory. With the help of her cousin, actor Rip Torn, she enrolled in Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and later the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.\nSpacek's first credited film role was in the action crime thriller \"Prime Cut\" (1972), in which she played Poppy, a girl sold into sexual slavery. The film led to a guest role in the television series \"The Waltons\" (1973), which she played twice. Spacek received international attention for her breakthrough role in Terrence Malick's neo-noir crime drama film \"Badlands\" (1973); she played Holly, the film's narrator and 15-year-old girlfriend of serial killer Kit (Martin Sheen). Spacek has described \"Badlands\" as the \"most incredible\" experience of her career. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"cool, sometimes brilliant, always ferociously American film\", and wrote \"Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our time.\" On the set of \"Badlands\", Spacek met art director Jack Fisk, whom she married in 1974. She worked as the set dresser for Brian De Palma's film \"Phantom of the Paradise\" (1974).\nSpacek's most prominent early role came in De Palma's supernatural horror film \"Carrie\" (1976), playing Carrie White, a shy, troubled high school senior with telekinetic powers. Spacek had to work hard to persuade De Palma to cast her in the role. After rubbing Vaseline in her hair and donning an old sailor dress her mother had made for her as a child, she turned up at the audition with the odds against her, but won the part. Spacek's performance was critically acclaimed and led to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" wrote: \"Though few actresses have distinguished themselves in gothics, Sissy Spacek, who is onscreen almost continuously, gives a classic chameleon performance. She shifts back and forth and sideways: a nasal, whining child; a chaste young beauty at the prom; and then a second transformation when her destructive impulses burst out and age her. Spacek uses her freckled pallor and whitish eyelashes to suggest a squashed, groggy girl who could go in any direction; at times, she seems unborn\u2013a fetus. I don't see how this performance could be any better; she's touching, like Elizabeth Hartman in one of her victim roles, but she's also unearthly\u2014a changeling.\"\nAfter \"Carrie\"'s success, Spacek played the role of housekeeper Linda Murray in Alan Rudolph's drama musical romance film \"Welcome to L.A.\" (1976) and cemented her reputation in independent film with her performance as Pinky Rose in Robert Altman's psychological drama \"3 Women\" (1977). A review in \"The New York Times\" said, \"In this film Miss Spacek added a new dimension of eeriness to the waif she played so effectively in \"Carrie\".\" Altman was deeply impressed by her performance: \"She's remarkable, one of the top actresses I've ever worked with. Her resources are like a deep well.\" De Palma said: \"[Spacek is] a phantom. She has this mysterious way of slipping into a part, letting it take over her. She's got a wider range than any young actress I know.\" Spacek helped finance \"Eraserhead\" (1977), David Lynch's directorial debut, and is thanked in the film's credits.\n1980s: Continued acclaim and music.\nSpacek began the 1980s with an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Michael Apted's biographical musical \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" (1980), in which she portrayed country music star Loretta Lynn, who personally selected her for the role. In addition to the Oscar, she also won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, National Society of Film Critics Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Both Spacek and Beverly D'Angelo, who played Patsy Cline, sang their characters' vocals themselves in the film. Roger Ebert credited the film's success to \"the performance by Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn. With the same sort of magical chemistry she's shown before, when she played the high school kid in \"Carrie,\" Spacek at 29 has the ability to appear to be almost any age on screen. Here, she ages from about 14 to somewhere in her 30s, always looks the age, and never seems to be wearing makeup.\" Andrew Sarris of \"The Village Voice\" wrote: \"Sissy Spacek\u2014yes, I'm flabbergasted\u2014is simple and faithful as Lynn. Spacek's face is no more of an actor's instrument than it ever was, but given a human being to play, given a director concerned with acting, she makes that woman exist. She sings the songs herself, nicely, and she has mastered the Appalachian accent.\" Spacek also was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the film's soundtrack album. She followed this with her own country album, \"Hangin' Up My Heart\" (1983); spawning one hit single, \"Lonely but Only for You,\" a song written by K. T. Oslin, which reached No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart.\nIn John Byrum's romantic drama film \"Heart Beat\" (1980), Spacek portrayed Carolyn Cassady, who\u2014under the influence of Jack Kerouac (John Heard) and Neal Cassady (Nick Nolte)\u2014slips into a combination of drudgery and debauchery. Spacek was so adamant about getting the role that she pored through over 4,000 pages of research to prepare for her character. Byrum and producer Ed Pressman took her to dinner to advise her that she did not have the role. Spacek was so distraught at the news that she shattered a glass of wine in her hand. After that, Pressman walked up to her with a piece of shattered glass and told her she had the role. He said that Spacek breaking the glass clinched the deal, and they believed she ultimately would best suit the part. The film was released on April 25, 1980, to mixed reviews. Ebert called Spacek's performance \"wonderfully played\", and her scenes with Heard and Nolte \"almost poetic\".\nIn 1982, Spacek starred alongside Jack Lemmon in Costa-Gavras's biographical thriller drama film \"Missing\" (based on the book \"The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice\" by Thomas Hauser). She co-starred with Mel Gibson in Mark Rydell's drama film \"The River\" (1984), and with Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange in Bruce Beresford's black comedy drama film \"Crimes of the Heart\" (1986). Spacek was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for all these roles, and won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for the latter. Other performances of the decade included star turns in husband Jack Fisk's directorial debut \"Raggedy Man\" (1981) and Tom Moore's drama film \"'night, Mother\" (1986), alongside Anne Bancroft. Spacek showed a lighter side by voicing the brain in Carl Reiner's science fiction black comedy film \"The Man with Two Brains\" (1983), starring Steve Martin.\n1990s: Supporting roles.\nSpacek had a supporting role as the wife of Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) in Oliver Stone's epic political thriller film \"JFK\" (1991) and made a number of comedies and television films. She played Verena Talbo in Charles Matthau's comedy drama film \"The Grass Harp\" (1995), which reunited her with both Lemmon and Piper Laurie. Spacek lent a supporting role as the waitress Margie Fogg in Paul Schrader's neo-noir crime drama film \"Affliction\" (1997). She also played Rose Straight in David Lynch's biographical road drama film \"The Straight Story\" (1999) and the mother of Brendan Fraser's character in Hugh Wilson's romantic comedy fantasy adventure film \"Blast from the Past\" (1999).\n2000s: Television and professional expansion.\nSpacek began the 2000s with critical acclaim for her performance as Ruth Fowler, a grieving mother consumed by revenge, in Todd Field's drama film \"In the Bedroom\", which was released in 2001. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said of her work in the film: \"Ms. Spacek's performance is as devastating as it is unflashy. With the slight tightening of her neck muscles and a downward twitch of her mouth, she conveys her character's relentlessness, then balances it with enough sweetness to make Ruth seem entirely human. It is one of Ms. Spacek's greatest performances.\" She earned a sixth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, which established her as the eighth and most recent actress to be nominated for at least six leading role Oscars. She additionally won the New York Film Critics Circle Award and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, as well as the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead, among others.&lt;ref name=\"Golden Globes 2002 / A night for the Aussies / 'Beautiful Mind,' 'Moulin Rouge,' cable TV take top Golden Globes\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Spacek starred in Jay Russell's romantic fantasy drama film \"Tuck Everlasting\" (2002). That same year, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her portrayal of Zelda Fitzgerald in the Showtime film \"Last Call\" (2002).\nSpacek played unfaithful wife Ruth in Rodrigo Garc\u00eda's drama film \"Nine Lives\" (2005) and a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease in the television film \"Pictures of Hollis Woods\" (2007). She played a supporting role in Seth Gordon's comedy film \"Four Christmases\" (2008) and the lead role in the drama film \"Lake City\" (2008). Spacek appeared in the HBO series \"Big Love\" for a multi-episode arc as a powerful Washington, D.C. lobbyist and earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. She narrated the 2005 audiobook of Stephen King's 1974 novel \"Carrie\". In 2006, Spacek narrated Harper Lee's novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1960), which sold over 30 million copies. \n2010s: Memoir and return to film.\nSpacek was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. That same year, Spacek appeared in Tate Taylor's period drama film \"The Help\", whose ensemble cast, including Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain and Allison Janney, received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\nIn 2012, Spacek published her memoir, \"My Extraordinary Ordinary Life\", with co-author Maryanne Vollers. \"The Washington Post\"'s Jen Chaney called it \"refreshingly down-to-earth\" and \"beautifully written\", adding that Spacek's description of her childhood is so \"evocative that one can almost taste the sour stalks of goatweed she chewed on steamy summer afternoons.\" Jay Stafford of \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" wrote that, unlike other actors' autobiographies, Spacek's \"benefits from good writing and remarkable frankness.\" Margaret Moser of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote that Spacek's memoir is \"as easy to read as it is a pleasure to digest.\" \"Biographile\"'s \"Kirkus Reviews\" was less appreciative, calling it \"an average memoir\" and \"overly detailed\" while criticizing its lack of \"narrative arc\", but complimented Spacek for being \"truly down-to-earth.\" \"Kirkus\" added that \"the book is 'ordinary' and does not have enough drama to engage readers not directly interested in Spacek and her work\" and is \"for diehard movie buffs and Spacek fans only.\"\nSpacek became the first actor to appear in a film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in each of the four most recent decades. Each film was released near the beginning of its decade: \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" (1980), \"Missing\" (1982), \"JFK\" (1991), \"In the Bedroom\" (2001) and \"The Help\" (2011). Spacek appeared in the crime drama film \"Deadfall\" (2012). She also co-starred with Robert Redford in his next-to-last role before his retirement in David Lowery's biographical crime film \"The Old Man &amp; the Gun\" (2018), which received largely positive reviews from critics. Spacek also had starring roles in a variety of television series in the late 2010s. She played matriarch Sally Rayburn in the Netflix series \"Bloodline\", which aired from 2015 to 2017; Ruth Deaver in the Hulu series \"Castle Rock\" (2018), which intertwines characters and themes from King's fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine; and Ellen Bergman, the mother of Julia Roberts's character, in the Amazon Prime Video series \"Homecoming\" (2018). \n2020s work.\nSpacek co-starred alongside Dustin Hoffman in Darren Le Gallo's directorial debut \"Sam &amp; Kate\" (2022). That same year, she acted in the Amazon Prime Video series \"Night Sky\", acting opposite J. K. Simmons. Despite positive reviews, the series was cancelled after its first season.\nPersonal life.\nSpacek married production designer and art director Jack Fisk in 1974, after they met on the set of \"Badlands\". They have two daughters: Schuyler Fisk, who was born on July 8, 1982, and Madison Fisk, who was born on September 21, 1988. Schuyler has followed in her mother's footsteps as both an actress and a singer. Spacek and her family moved to a farm near Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1982.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63525", "revid": "1304874435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63525", "title": "Tiltrotor", "text": "Aircraft type\nA tiltrotor is a rotorcraft that generates lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors (sometimes called \"proprotors\") mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing. Almost all tiltrotors use a transverse rotor design, with a few exceptions that use other multirotor layouts.\nTiltrotor design combines the VTOL capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, generating lift the way a normal helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. In this mode the rotors provide thrust as a propeller, and the airfoil of the fixed wings takes over providing the lift via the forward motion of the entire aircraft. Since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion (e.g. with root-tip twist) and it avoids a helicopter's issues of retreating blade stall, the tiltrotor can achieve higher cruise speeds and takeoff weights than helicopters.\nA tiltrotor aircraft differs from a tiltwing in that only the rotor pivots rather than the entire wing. This method trades off efficiency in vertical flight for efficiency in STOL/STOVL operations.\nHistory.\nThe first work in the direction of a tilt-rotor (French \"Convertible\") seems to have originated ca. 1902 by the French-Swiss brothers Henri and Armand Dufaux, for which they got a patent in February 1904, and made their work public in April 1905.\nConcrete ideas of constructing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft using helicopter-like rotors were pushed further in the 1930s. The first design resembling modern tiltrotors was patented by George Lehberger in May 1930, but he did not further develop the concept. In World War II, Weserflug in Germany came up with the concept of their P.1003/1 around 1938, which was tilting to the top with part of the wings but not the full wings, so it may be in between tilt-rotor and tilt-planes. Shortly after a German prototype, the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, was developed starting in 1942, which was tilting to the ground, but never flew. Platt and LePage patented the PL-16, the first American tiltrotor aircraft. However, the company shut down in August 1946 due to lack of capital.\nTwo prototypes which made it to flight were the one-seat Transcendental Model 1-G and two seat Transcendental Model 2, each powered by a single reciprocating engine. Development started on the Model 1-G in 1947, though it did not fly until 1954. The Model 1-G flew for about a year until a crash in Chesapeake Bay on July 20, 1955, destroying the prototype aircraft but not seriously injuring the pilot. The Model 2 was developed and flew shortly afterwards, but the US Air Force withdrew funding in favor of the Bell XV-3 and it did not fly much beyond hover tests. The Transcendental 1-G is the first tiltrotor aircraft to have flown and accomplished most of a helicopter to aircraft transition in flight (to within 10 degrees of true horizontal aircraft flight).\nBuilt in 1953, the experimental Bell XV-3 flew until 1966, proving the fundamental soundness of the tiltrotor concept and gathering data about technical improvements needed for future designs.\nA related technology development is the tiltwing. Although two designs, the Canadair CL-84 Dynavert and the LTV XC-142, were technical successes, neither entered production due to other issues. Tiltrotors generally have better hover efficiency than tiltwings, but less than helicopters.\nIn 1968, Westland Aircraft displayed their own designs\u2014a small experimental craft (We 01C) and a 68-seater transport We 028\u2014at the SBAC Farnborough Airshow. In 1972, with funding from NASA and the U.S. Army, Bell Helicopter Textron started development of the XV-15, a twin-engine tiltrotor research aircraft. Two aircraft were built to prove the tiltrotor design and explore the operational flight envelope for military and civil applications.\nIn 1981, using experience gained from the XV-3 and XV-15, Bell and Boeing Helicopters began developing the V-22 Osprey, a twin-turboshaft military tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps. Bell teamed with Boeing in developing a commercial tiltrotor, but Boeing went out in 1998 and Agusta came in for the Bell/Agusta BA609. This aircraft was redesignated as the AW609 following the transfer of full ownership to AgustaWestland in 2011. Bell has also developed a tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the TR918 Eagle Eye.\nRussia has had a few tiltrotor projects, mostly unmanned such as the Mil Mi-30, and has started another in 2015.\nAround 2005\u20132010, Bell and Boeing teamed up again to perform a conceptual study of a larger Quad TiltRotor (QTR) for the US Army's Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) program. The QTR is a larger, four rotor version of the V-22 with two tandem wings sets of fixed wings and four tilting rotors.\nIn January 2013, the FAA defined US tiltrotor noise rules to comply with ICAO rules. A noise certification will cost $588,000, same as for a large helicopter.\nAgustaWestland says they have free-flown a manned electric tiltrotor in 2013 called Project Zero, with its rotors inside the wingspan.\nIn 2013, Bell Helicopter CEO John Garrison responded to Boeing's taking a different airframe partner for the US Army's future lift requirements by indicating that Bell would take the lead itself in developing the Bell V-280 Valor, with Lockheed Martin.\nIn 2014, the Clean Sky 2 program (by the European Union and industry) awarded AgustaWestland and its partners $328 million to develop a \"next-generation civil tiltrotor\" design for the offshore market, with Critical Design Review near the end of 2016. The goals are tilting wing sections, 11 metric tons Maximum takeoff weight, seating for 19 to 22 passengers, first flight in 2021, a cruise speed of 300 knots, a top speed of 330 knots, a ceiling of 25,000 feet, and a range of 500 nautical miles.\nTechnical considerations.\nControls.\nIn vertical flight, the tiltrotor uses controls very similar to a transverse or tandem-rotor helicopter. Yaw is controlled by tilting its rotors in opposite directions. Roll is provided through differential power or thrust. Pitch is provided through rotor blades cyclic-, or nacelle, tilt. Vertical motion is controlled with conventional rotor blade pitch and either a conventional helicopter collective control lever (as in the Bell/Agusta BA609) or a unique control similar to a fixed-wing engine control called a thrust control lever (TCL) (as in the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey).\nSpeed and payload issues.\nThe tiltrotor's advantage is significantly greater speed than a helicopter. In a helicopter the maximum forward speed is defined by the turn speed of the rotor; at some point the helicopter will be moving forward at the same speed as the spinning of the backwards-moving side of the rotor, so that side of the rotor sees zero or negative airspeed, and begins to stall. This limits modern helicopters to cruise speeds of about 150 knots / 277\u00a0km/h. However, with the tiltrotor this problem is avoided, because the proprotors are perpendicular to the motion in the high-speed portions of the flight regime (and thus not subject to this reverse flow condition), so the tiltrotor has relatively high maximum speed\u2014over 300\u00a0knots / 560\u00a0km/h has been demonstrated in the two types of tiltrotors flown so far, and cruise speeds of 250\u00a0knots / 460\u00a0km/h are achieved.\nThis speed is achieved somewhat at the expense of payload. As a result of this reduced payload, some estimate that a tiltrotor does not exceed the transport efficiency (speed times payload) of a helicopter, while others conclude the opposite. Additionally, the tiltrotor propulsion system is more complex than a conventional helicopter due to the large, articulated nacelles and the added wing; however, the improved cruise efficiency and speed improvement over helicopters is significant in certain uses. Speed and, more importantly, the benefit to overall response time is the principal virtue sought by the military forces that are using the tiltrotor. Tiltrotors are inherently less noisy in forward flight (airplane mode) than helicopters. This, combined with their increased speed, is expected to improve their utility in populated areas for commercial uses and reduce the threat of detection for military uses. Tiltrotors, however, are typically as loud as equally sized helicopters in hovering flight. Noise simulations for a 90-passenger tiltrotor indicate lower cruise noise inside the cabin than a Bombardier Dash 8 airplane, although low-frequency vibrations may be higher.\nTiltrotors also provide substantially greater cruise altitude capability than helicopters. Tiltrotors can easily reach 6,000\u00a0m / 20,000\u00a0ft or more whereas helicopters typically do not exceed 3,000\u00a0m / 10,000\u00a0ft altitude. This feature will mean that some uses that have been commonly considered only for fixed-wing aircraft can now be supported with tiltrotors without need of a runway. A drawback however is that a tiltrotor suffers considerably reduced payload when taking off from high altitude.\nMono tiltrotor.\nA mono tiltrotor aircraft uses a tiltable rotating propeller, or \"coaxial proprotor\", for lift and propulsion. For vertical flight the proprotor is angled to direct its thrust downwards, providing lift. In this mode of operation the craft is essentially identical to a helicopter. As the craft gains speed, the coaxial proprotor is slowly tilted forward, with the blades eventually becoming perpendicular to the ground. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the wing's greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve its high speed. In this mode, the craft is essentially a turboprop aircraft. A mono tiltrotor aircraft is different from a conventional tiltrotor in which the proprotors are mounted to the wing tips, in that the \"coaxial proprotor\" is mounted to the aircraft's fuselage. As a result of this structural efficiency, a mono tiltrotor exceeds the transport efficiency (speed times payload) of both a helicopter and a conventional tiltrotor. One design study concluded that if the mono tiltrotor could be technically realized, it would be half the size, one-third the weight, and nearly twice as fast as a helicopter.\nIn vertical flight, the mono tiltrotor uses controls very similar to a coaxial helicopter, such as the Kamov Ka-50. Yaw is controlled for instance by increasing the lift on the upper proprotor while decreasing the lift on the lower proprotor. Roll and pitch are provided through rotor cyclic. Vertical motion is controlled with conventional rotor blade blade pitch.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63526", "revid": "46242311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63526", "title": "Coeliac disease", "text": "Autoimmune disorder that results in a reaction to gluten\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nCoeliac disease (Commonwealth English) or celiac disease (American English) is a chronic autoimmune disease, mainly affecting the small intestine, and is caused by the consumption of gluten. Coeliac disease causes a wide range of symptoms and complications that can affect multiple organs outside of the gastrointestinal tract.\nThe symptoms of coeliac disease can be divided into two subtypes, classic and non-classic. The classic form of the disease can affect any age group, but is usually diagnosed in early childhood and causes symptoms of malabsorption such as weight loss, diarrhoea, and stunted growth. Non-classic coeliac disease is more commonly seen in adults and is characterized by vague abdominal symptoms and complications in organs outside of the gastrointestinal tract, such as bone disease, anemia, and other consequences of nutritional deficiencies.\nCoeliac disease is caused by an abnormal immune system response to gluten, found in wheat and other grains such as barley and rye. When an individual with a genetic predisposition to coeliac disease consumes gluten, it triggers an inflammatory response in the small intestine, damaging the intestinal lining, leading to malabsorption. The development of coeliac disease is believed to be influenced by other environmental factors, such as infections.\nDiagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies, helped by specific genetic testing. Diagnosis is not always straightforward. About 10% of the time, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative, and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi. People may have severe symptoms and they may be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved. As a result of screening, the diagnosis is increasingly being made in people who have no symptoms. Evidence regarding the effects of screening, however, is as of 2017, insufficient to determine its usefulness. While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins, it is distinct from wheat allergy, which is much rarer.\nThe only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestinal lining (mucous membrane), improves symptoms, and reduces the risk of developing complications in most people. If untreated, it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma, and a slightly increased risk of early death. Rates vary between different regions of the world, from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40, with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. It is estimated that 80% of cases remain undiagnosed, usually because of minimal or absent gastrointestinal complaints and lack of knowledge of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nCoeliac disease causes a wide range of symptoms and complications that can involve several different organs. The presentation of coeliac disease can be classified as classic, non-classic, and subclinical. Classic coeliac disease is commonly seen in young children, but can affect any age group, and is characterized by malabsorption manifesting as diarrhoea, weight loss, and failure to thrive. Non-classic coeliac disease is seen more often in adults and symptoms primarily manifest outside of the intestine (extraintestinal). Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are, in fact, not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. After starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.\nGastrointestinal.\nDiarrhoea that is characteristic of coeliac disease is chronic, sometimes pale, of large volume, and abnormally foul in odor. Other symptoms of coeliac disease include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating with abdominal distension, and mouth ulcers. As the bowels become more damaged, lactose intolerance can develop. Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), only later to be recognised as coeliac disease.\nExtraintestinal manifestations.\nCoeliac disease is a systemic disorder, meaning it affects the entire body. Although many common symptoms of the disease are related to the gastrointestinal tract, those with coeliac disease may also experience symptoms and complications in other organs, known as extraintestinal manifestations. These manifestations may be related to malabsorption or systemic inflammation. Common extraintestinal manifestations of coeliac disease include headaches, fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, and joint pain.\nThe changes in the bowel reduce its ability to absorb nutrients, minerals, and vitamins:\nMiscellaneous.\nCoeliac disease has been linked with many conditions. In many cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition.\nCoeliac disease is associated with several other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune disorders: diabetes mellitus type 1, hypothyroidism, primary biliary cholangitis, microscopic colitis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.\nComplications.\nCoeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel (enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma or other non-Hodgkin lymphomas) within the first year of diagnosis. Whether a gluten-free diet brings this risk back to baseline is unclear. Long-standing and untreated disease can rarely lead to other complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis (ulcer formation of the small bowel).\nCauses.\nCoeliac disease is caused by an inflammatory reaction to gliadins and glutenins (gluten proteins) found in wheat and to similar proteins found in the crops of the tribe Triticeae (which includes other common grains such as barley and rye) and to the tribe Aveneae (oats). Wheat subspecies (such as spelt, durum, and Kamut) and wheat hybrids (such as triticale) also cause symptoms of coeliac disease.\nA small number of people with coeliac disease react to oats. Sensitivity to oats in coeliac disease may be due to cross-contamination of oats and other foods with gluten, differences between gluten content, immunoreactivity, and genetic variability seen between oat cultivars or dietary intolerance to oats. Most people with coeliac disease do not have adverse reactions to uncontaminated or 'pure' oats, however clinical guidelines differ on whether those with coeliac disease should consume oats.\nOther cereals such as maize, millet, sorghum, teff, rice, and wild rice are safe for people with coeliac disease to consume, as well as non-cereals such as amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat. Noncereal carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not trigger symptoms.\nRisk modifiers.\nEnvironmental factors such as infections, geographic latitude, birth weight, antibiotic use, intestinal microbiota, socioeconomic status, hygiene, breastfeeding, and the timing of introduction of gluten into an infant's diet are theorized to contribute to the development of coeliac disease in genetically predisposed individuals. The consumption of gluten and timing of introduction in a baby's life does not appear to increase the risk of coeliac disease, however in those who are genetically predisposed to coeliac disease, large amounts of gluten early in life, may increase the risk of developing coeliac disease.\nMechanism.\nCoeliac disease appears to be multifactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person.\nAlmost all people (90%) with coeliac disease have either the variant HLA-DQ2 allele or (less commonly) the HLA-DQ8 allele. However, about 40% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles. This suggests that additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles.\nGenetics.\nThe vast majority of people with coeliac have one of two types (out of seven) of the HLA-DQ protein. HLA-DQ is part of the MHC class II antigen-presenting receptor (also called the human leukocyte antigen) system and is used by the immune system to distinguish between the body\u2019s own cells and others. The two subunits of the HLA-DQ protein are encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, located on the short arm of chromosome 6.\nThere are seven HLA-DQ variants (DQ2 and DQ4\u2013DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac disease have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in the risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process.\nMost people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 haplotype called DQ2.5. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene alleles, DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201, which encode the two subunits, DQ \u03b15 and DQ \u03b22. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from \"both\" parents; the latter are especially at risk of coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications. The frequency of coeliac disease haplotypes can vary by geography.\nSome individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans), and these individuals are at similar risk of coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6. Among those with coeliac disease who do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 2-5% have the DQ2.2 isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.\nOther genetic factors have been repeatedly reported in coeliac disease; however, involvement in the disease has variable geographic recognition. Only the HLA-DQ loci show a consistent involvement over the global population. Many of the loci detected have been found in association with other autoimmune diseases.\nThe prevalence of the HLA-DQ2 genotype and gluten consumption has increased over time. Since untreated coeliac disease can cause serious health problems and affect fertility, it would be expected that HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 would become less common. The opposite is true\u2014they are most common in areas where gluten-rich foods have been eaten for thousands of years. The HLA-DQ2 gene may have been genetically favoured in the past because it helps protect against tooth decay.\nProlamins.\nMost of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are prolamins. These are storage proteins rich in proline (\"prol-\") and glutamine (\"-amin\") that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to proteases and peptidases of the gut. Prolamins are found in cereal grains with different grains having different but related prolamins: wheat (gliadin), barley (hordein), rye (secalin) and oats (avenin).\nMembrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of the immune response: the innate response and the adaptive (T-helper cell-mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from \u03b1-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of interleukin-15. This innate response to gliadin results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals.\nThe response to the 33mer occurs in most coeliacs who have a DQ2 isoform. This peptide, when altered by intestinal transglutaminase, has a high density of overlapping T-cell epitopes. This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind, and stay bound to, peptide when recognised by T-cells.\nTissue transglutaminase.\nTissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively. These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.\nDeamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction that is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg. This results in the formation of new epitopes believed to trigger the primary immune response by which the autoantibodies against tTg develop.\nStored biopsies from people with suspected coeliac disease have revealed that autoantibody deposits in the subclinical coeliacs are detected prior to clinical disease.\nVillous atrophy and malabsorption.\nThe inflammatory process, mediated by T cells, leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel's mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food.\nAlternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve the release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31\u201343/49).\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of coeliac disease is often complicated by the variety in symptoms, overlap with other disorders, and lack of awareness in medical professionals, leading to a delay in the diagnosis being made. A diagnosis may take more than a decade after symptoms develop, and most people with coeliac disease remain undiagnosed. Delays in diagnosis can reduce quality of life, use more medical resources and increase risk of complications associated with the disease.\nCoeliac disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, blood tests, and biopsies of the small intestine. To make an accurate diagnosis, an individual must be consuming gluten, as the reliability of biopsies and blood tests reduces if a person is on a gluten-free diet. In those who have already reduced their gluten intake, reintroducing gluten (gluten challenge) may be required to reach an accurate diagnosis. Within months of eliminating gluten from one's diet, antibodies associated with coeliac disease decrease, meaning that gluten has to be reintroduced several weeks before diagnostic testing.\nBlood tests.\nCurrent medical guidelines recommend testing tissue transglutaminase 2 immunoglobulin A (TTG IgA) in those with suspected coeliac disease. Because IgA deficiency is more common in those with coeliac disease, guidelines recommend testing for IgA deficiency as a part of the diagnostic workup for coeliac disease. If an individual with IgA deficiency is getting tested for coeliac disease, immunoglobulin G (IgG) based tests such as deamidated gliadin peptide IgG (DGP IgG) or endomysial antibody (EMA) can be used instead of IgA-based tests. Antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and antireticulin antibodies (ARA) were historically used to test for coeliac disease, however due to the development of more accurate tests, they are no longer recommended. Due to the risk of false positive or negative serological tests and the consequences of leaving coeliac disease untreated or introducing unnecessary dietary restrictions in the case of a false positive, biopsies are used to confirm the diagnosis regardless of blood tests.\nTG2 IgA has a high sensitivity (92.8%) and specificity (97.9%), is cost-efficient and widely available, making it the first choice for serological tests in the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Despite this, performance of the TG2 IgA test differs between labs and no formal standardisation between assays exists. The severity of small intestine damage generally correlates with the levels of TG2 IgA found in the blood, meaning that the sensitivity is lower in people who have less damage to their intestines.\nEMA has a lower sensitivity, but its specificity is near 100%. Because of the high specificity, EMA can be used to confirm coeliac disease in those who have borderline TG2 IgA levels. EMA testing is costly, hard to interpret and vulnerable to interobserver and inter-site variability.\nDGP IgG is used to evaluate coeliac disease in those with IgA-deficiency. Coeliac disease is more common in those with IgA-deficiency, so medical guidelines recommend that people being tested for coeliac disease are also tested for IgA-deficiency. Because IgA-based tests are unreliable in those with IgA deficiency, IgG-based tests are used instead. These include EMA IgG, DGP IgG, and TTG IgA, which are less accurate than IgA testing.\nA 2020 guideline by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) suggests biopsy can be avoided in children who have symptoms of coeliac disease, TTG IgA levels ten times higher than normal, and a positive EMA antibody. However there is not enough evidence to suggest that a nonbiopsy approach can be used in adults.\nGenetic testing is not needed to diagnose coeliac disease, but is sometimes used to clarify discrepancies between blood tests and histology. In those who have already started a gluten-free diet, HLA testing can help to determine whether a gluten challenge should be performed.\nEndoscopy.\nAn upper endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum (beyond the duodenal bulb) or jejunum is performed to obtain multiple samples from the duodenum. Not all areas may be equally affected; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue, the result would be a false negative. Even in the same bioptic fragment, different degrees of\ndamage may be present.\nMost people with coeliac disease have a small intestine that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined. Endoscopic features of coeliac disease include scalloping of the small bowel folds (\"pictured\"), fissures, a mosaic pattern to the mucosa, prominence of the submucosa blood vessels, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.\nCapsule endoscopy (CE) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease and may be used as an alternative to endoscopy in those who cannot or do not want one.\nPathology.\nThe Marsh-Oberhuber classification is commonly used to assess the pathological changes seen in coeliac disease. Marsh originally described three different stages of coeliac disease lesions in 1992. These three stages were updated in 1999 by Oberhuber to further classify stage three. The Marsh classification is based on three histological features: intraepithelial lymphocytes count above 25/100 enterocytes (intraepithelial lymphocytosis), elongated crypts of Lieberkuhn (crypt hyperplasia), and shortening or absence of villi (villous atrophy). As these features can be seen in other disorders, they are not diagnostic for coeliac disease without serological or clinical indications. Current guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on a gluten free diet.\nGluten challenge.\nCurrently, gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. A gluten challenge involves consuming over 10 grams of gluten a day for three months or until an individual tests positive for TG2 IgA. Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example, in people with positive HLA genetic testing who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet. Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 6 years and during pubertal growth. \nDifferential diagnosis.\nThe histopathological features associated with coeliac disease can arise from other conditions as well. Differential diagnosis of negative coeliac blood tests and villous atrophy or increased inter-epithelial lymphocytes includes tropical sprue, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, lactose intolerance, lymphoma, Crohn\u2019s disease, Helicobacter pylori, drug-induced enteropathy (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, olmesartan, colchicinenon, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and proton pump inhibitors), whipple disease, Giardiasis, radiation enteritis, tuberculosis, Zollinger\u2013Ellison syndrome, collagenous sprue, common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, HIV enteropathy, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and gastrinoma with acid hypersecretion. If the histological changes improve with a gluten free diet despite negative coeliac disease blood tests a diagnosis of seronegative coeliac disease may be made.\nPositive blood tests for coeliac disease with a lack of changes in the bowels can be caused by errors in collecting blood for the test, recent infections, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Potential coeliac disease, formerly known as \"latent coeliac disease\" is diagnosed when there is positive coeliac blood tests, positive HLA genetic testing, and a lack of villous atrophy.\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a functional disorder that causes intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms in response to gluten. The symptoms of NCGS are often similiar to those seen in coeliac disease, however they tend to have a more rapid onset and offset when compared to coeliac disease. The diagnosis of NCGS is made based on the exclusion of coeliac disease and wheat allergy, and a resolution of symptoms after adhering to a gluten free diet.\nScreening.\nThere is debate as to the benefits of widespread screening measures for coeliac disease. In 2017, the United States Preventive Services Task Force published a report found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding screening for coeliac disease in those without symptoms. Due to the lack of evidence that screening for coeliac disease in those without symptoms, clinical guidelines advise testing people based on symptoms and selective screening for certain populations at a higher risk of developing coeliac disease. \nTreatment.\nDiet.\nCurrently, the only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Current guidelines recommend regular follow up doctors appointments, monitoring the disease activity, preventative care and consultation with a dietitian. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestines heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility. Compliance to a strict gluten-free diet is difficult for the patient, but evidence has accumulated that a strict gluten-free diet can result in resolution of diarrhoea, weight gain, and normalization of nutrient malabsorption, with normalization of biopsies in 6 months to 2 years on a gluten-free diet.\nDietitians advise which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to eat a balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans. Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods. Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch. \nThe term \"gluten-free\" is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence. The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A recent systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10\u00a0mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done. Regulation of the label \"gluten-free\" varies. In the European Union, the European Commission issued regulations in 2009 limiting the use of \"gluten-free\" labels for food products to those with less than 20\u00a0mg/kg of gluten, and \"very low gluten\" labels for those with less than 100\u00a0mg/kg. In the United States, the FDA issued regulations in 2013 limiting the use of \"gluten-free\" labels for food products to those with less than 20\u00a0ppmof gluten. The international Codex Alimentarius standard allows for 20\u00a0ppm of gluten in so-called \"gluten-free\" foods.\nA gluten-free diet improves healthcare-related quality of life, and strict adherence to the diet gives more benefit than incomplete adherence. Nevertheless, a gluten-free diet does not completely normalise the quality of life.\nVaccination.\nEven though it is unclear if coeliac patients have a generally increased risk of infectious diseases, they should generally be encouraged to receive all common vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) as the general population. Moreover, some pathogens could be harmful to coeliac patients. According to the European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD), coeliac disease can be associated with hyposplenism or functional asplenia, which could result in impaired immunity to encapsulated bacteria, with an increased risk of such infections. So patients who are known to be hyposplenic should be offered at least the pneumococcal vaccine. However, the ESsCD states that it is not clear whether vaccination with the conjugated vaccine is preferable in this setting and whether additional vaccination against Haemophilus, meningococcus, and influenza should be considered if not previously given.\nRefractory disease.\nLess than 1% of affected people have refractory disease, which means that they have persistent villous atrophy on a gluten-free diet despite the lack of gluten exposure for more than 12 months. Nevertheless, inadvertent exposure to gluten is the main cause of persistent villous atrophy, and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of refractory disease is made. People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors. Also, a lack of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of intestinal recuperation. If alternative causes of villous atrophy have been eliminated, steroids or immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine) may be considered.\nRefractory coeliac disease should not be confused with the persistence of symptoms despite gluten withdrawal caused by transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage, which generally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten-free diet, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol malabsorption, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and microscopic colitis among others.\nRefractory coeliac disease can be divided into types I and II. A 2023 study compared patients with type I and type II. Refractory coeliac disease type I more frequently exhibits diarrhoea, anaemia, hypoalbuminemia, parenteral nutrition need, ulcerative jejuno-ileitis, and extended small intestinal atrophy. Among patients with refractory coeliac disease type II, it is more common for lymphoma to develop. Among these patients, atrophy extension was the only parameter correlated with hypoalbuminemia and mortality.\nEpidemiology.\nIn most countries, between 1 in 50 and 1 in 200 people have coeliac disease. Rates vary in different regions of the world; coeliac disease is less common in places where gluten-containing crops are rarely eaten, and in parts of east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where populations rarely carry the HLA-DQ genes that predispose to the disease. The risk of developing coeliac disease is higher in those who have a first degree relative with the disease, a less dramatic increase in risk is also seen second degree relatives.\nDiagnoses of coeliac disease have increased dramatically in recent decades due to increased awareness of the disease and availability of blood testing. However, the disease is still thought to be underdiagnosed, with an estimated 70% of people with coeliac undiagnosed and untreated. Undiagnosed cases are more common in poorer areas, and in countries which do not regularly test at-risk people. \nWhile coeliac disease can arise at any age, most people develop the disease before age 10. Roughly 20 percent of individuals with coeliac disease are diagnosed after 60 years of age. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men; though some of that may be due to differences in diagnostic practice \u2013 men with gastrointestinal symptoms are less likely to receive a biopsy than women. Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease, include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease, including both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).\nHistory.\nThe term \"coeliac\" comes from Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 () 'abdominal' and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an Ancient Greek description of the disease by Aretaeus of Cappadocia.\nHumans first started to cultivate grains in the Neolithic period (beginning about 9500\u00a0BCE) in the Fertile Crescent in Western Asia, and, likely, coeliac disease did not occur before this time. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body.\nA 15th-century medical prescription from Mamluk Cairo, attributed to Shams al-Din ibn al-'Afif, the personal physician to Sultan Barsbay and director of the Qalawun complex hospital, describes a treatment for symptoms consistent with coeliac disease. Found in Fustat and now held in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, the remedy combines herbs and plant waters for patients intolerant to wheat.\nAretaeus of Cappadocia's \"C\u0153liac Affection\" gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble, and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous, and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming \"a copious draught of cold water.\"\nThe paediatrician Samuel Gee gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: \"If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet.\" Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit, and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child \"who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch mussels daily.\" However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.\nChristian Archibald Herter, an American physician, wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease, which he called \"intestinal infantilism\". He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate. The eponym \"Gee-Herter disease\" was sometimes used to acknowledge both contributions. Sidney V. Haas, an American paediatrician, reported positive effects of a diet of bananas in 1924. This diet remained in vogue until the actual cause of coeliac disease was determined.\nWhile a role for carbohydrates had been suspected, the link with wheat was not made until the 1940s by the Dutch paediatrician Willem Karel Dicke. It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the Dutch famine of 1944\u20131945 (during which flour was scarce) may have contributed to his discovery. Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by coeliac disease from greater than 35% to essentially zero. He also reported that once wheat was again available after the conflict, the mortality rate soared to previous levels. The link with the gluten component of wheat was made in 1952 by a team from Birmingham, England. Villous atrophy was described by British physician John W. Paulley in 1954 on samples taken at surgery. This paved the way for biopsy samples taken by endoscopy.\nThroughout the 1960s, other features of coeliac disease were elucidated. Its hereditary character was recognised in 1965. In 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity.\nSociety and culture.\nMay has been designated as \"Coeliac Awareness Month\" by several coeliac organisations.\nChristian churches and the Eucharist.\nSpeaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a Eucharist in which a wafer or small piece of sacramental bread from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram. Small communion wafers typically contain 2-5 mg of gliadin if they are not a gluten-free variety, and many people with coeliac disease report altering their religious practices because of coeliac symptoms caused by these wafers.\nMany Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the United Methodist, Christian Reformed, Episcopal, Anglican and Lutheran Churches. Catholics may receive from the chalice alone, or ask for gluten-reduced hosts; gluten-free ones however are not considered still to be wheat bread, and hence are invalid matter.\nRoman Catholic position.\nRoman Catholic doctrine states that for a valid Eucharist, the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat. Low-gluten hosts meet all of the Catholic Church's requirements, but they are not entirely gluten-free. Requests to use rice wafers have been denied. In 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, \"Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm.\"\nBy 2004, extremely low-gluten Church-approved hosts had become available in the United States, Italy and Australia. As of 2017, the Vatican still outlawed the use of gluten-free bread for Holy Communion.\nPassover.\nThe Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat Matzah, which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye. In addition, many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, including rice, are avoided altogether on Passover by Ashkenazi Jews. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. Potato starch is the primary starch used to replace the grains.\nSpelling.\n\"Coeliac disease\" is the preferred spelling in Commonwealth English, while \"celiac disease\" is typically used in North American English.\nResearch directions.\nThe search for environmental factors that could be responsible for genetically susceptible people becoming intolerant to gluten has resulted in increasing research activity looking at gastrointestinal infections. Research published in April 2017 suggests that an often-symptomless infection by a common strain of reovirus can increase sensitivity to foods such as gluten.\nVarious treatment approaches are being studied, including some that would reduce the need for dieting. All are still under development and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while. Three main approaches have been proposed: gluten detoxification, modulation of the intestinal permeability, and modulation of the immune response.\nAlternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of enzymes (prolyl endopeptidase and a barley glutamine-specific cysteine endopeptidase (EP-B2)) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the duodenum. Latiglutenase (IMGX003) is a biotherapeutic digestive enzyme therapy currently being trialled that aims to degrade gluten proteins and aid gluten digestion. It was shown to mitigate intestinal mucosal damage and reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms in phase 2 clinical trials and is scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.\nOther potential approaches to pharmacotherapy include the inhibition of zonulin, an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system. Other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.\nAttempts to modulate the immune response concerning coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing; one agent (CCX282-B) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial based on small-intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the recipient of numerous accolades, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor, and is considered one of the screen's great character stars who played cultured villains during the Golden Age of Hollywood.\nThe son of a stage actor, Rains began acting on stage in his native London in the 1900s. He became a leading thespian on the West End, and an acting teacher at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He moved to the United States in the late 1920s and became a successful Broadway star, before making his American film debut as Dr. Jack Griffin in \"The Invisible Man\" (1933). He went on to play prominent roles in such big screen production as \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"The Wolf Man\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" (1942), \"Kings Row\" (1942), \"Phantom of the Opera\" (1943) and \"Notorious\" (1946). \nIn 1951, he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in \"Darkness at Noon\". He continued to work as a prominent character actor in films, notably as Mr. Dryden in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) and his final role in the Biblical epic \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965). \nIn 1960, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry. Richard Chamberlain described him as \"one of the finest actors of the 20th century,\" while Bette Davis considered him one of her favorite co-stars.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 at 26 Tregothnan Road in Clapham, London. His parents were Emily Eliza (n\u00e9e Cox) and stage actor Frederick William Rains. He lived in the slums of London. Rains was one of twelve children, of whom all but four died while still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. Rains grew up with a Cockney accent and a speech impediment.\nBecause his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. There he observed actors as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at age 10 in the play \"Sweet Nell of Old Drury\" at the Haymarket Theatre, so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a call boy (telling actors when they were due on stage) at His Majesty's Theatre and later a prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts.\nEarly career and military service.\nRains moved to the United States in 1912 owing to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres. However, at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he returned to England and was commissioned into the British Army's London Scottish regiment, alongside fellow actors Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, Herbert Marshall and Cedric Hardwicke. In November 1916, Rains was involved in a gas attack at Vimy, which resulted in his permanently losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye as well as suffering vocal cord damage. He never returned to combat but continued to serve with the Transport Workers Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment, in which he was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant on 9 May 1917. In March 1918, he was promoted to temporary captain, the rank he held at the end of the war. On 8 October 1918 he was appointed as adjutant, and continued to serve in that role until March 1919.\nAfter his return to civilian life, Rains remained in England and continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, the founder of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor, he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the elocution books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practising every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father's voice, said, \"The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary Mid-Atlantic accent. It was 'his' voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in.\" Soon after changing his accent, he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At age 29, he made his film debut, playing the role of Clarkis in his only silent film, the British film \"Build Thy House\" (1920).\nDuring his early years, Rains taught at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA). John Gielgud and Charles Laughton were among his students.\nCareer.\nIn London theatre, he achieved success in the title role of John Drinkwater's play \"Ulysses S. Grant\", the follow-up to the same playwright's \"Abraham Lincoln\". Rains portrayed Faulkland in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Rivals\", presented at London's Lyric Theatre in 1925. He returned to New York City in 1927 and appeared in nearly 20 Broadway roles, in plays which included George Bernard Shaw's \"The Apple Cart\" and dramatisations of \"The Constant Nymph\" and Pearl S. Buck's novel \"The Good Earth\" (as a Chinese farmer).\nAlthough he had played the single supporting role in the silent, \"Build Thy House\" (1920), Rains came relatively late to film acting. While working for the Theatre Guild, he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932) for a New York representative of RKO was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of James Whale's \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) after his screen test and unique voice were inadvertently overheard from the next room. His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of Carl Laemmle, who controlled Universal Pictures at the time, and had been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role. According to Rains' daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the rushes of the day's filming \"because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again.\"\nRains signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. on 27 November 1935, with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over seven years. He played the villainous role of Prince John in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). Roddy McDowall once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains only smiled \"an enigmatic smile.\" Rains later revealed to his daughter that he had enjoyed playing the prince as a homosexual, by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film's co-director Michael Curtiz with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or \"what not to do in front of a camera.\" On loan to Columbia Pictures, he portrayed a corrupt but honourable U.S. senator in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For Warner Bros., he played Dr. Alexander Tower, who commits murder-suicide to spare his daughter a life of insanity in \"Kings Row\" (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Louis Renault in \"Casablanca\" (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the title character in Universal's remake of \"Phantom of the Opera\" (1943).\nIn her 1987 memoir, \"This 'N That\", Bette Davis stated that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in \"Juarez\"; \"Now, Voyager\"; \"Mr. Skeffington\"; and \"Deception\") was her favorite co-star. Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed Julius Caesar in a large-budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945), filmed in Britain. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked Gabriel Pascal, the film's director and producer. Rains followed it with Alfred Hitchcock's \"Notorious\" (1946) as a refugee Nazi agent opposite Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Back in Britain, he appeared in David Lean's \"The Passionate Friends\" (1949).\nHis only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of Robert Browning's \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\", with Van Johnson as the Piper. The NBC colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into syndication after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.\nRains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series. He played the ventriloquist Fabian on \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" Season 1 Episode 20 \"And So Died Riabouchinska\" which aired on February 10, 1956, and again, in 1957, Season 2 Episode 24 in \"The cream of the jest\" as a failing drunk actor. He ventured into science fiction for Irwin Allen's \"The Lost World\" (1960) and Antonio Margheriti's \"Battle of the Worlds\" (1961). Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) and King Herod in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965), his last film. In CBS's \"Rawhide\", he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode \"Incident of Judgement Day\" (1963).\nHe additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some Bible stories for children on Capitol Records, and reciting Richard Strauss's setting for narrator and piano of Tennyson's poem \"Enoch Arden\", with the piano solos performed by Glenn Gould. He starred in \"The Jeffersonian Heritage\", a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.\nReception.\nJessica Rains remembered her father's work ethic:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was interested in the process (of film). He loved acting. When he came to California to do a film, I had to \"hear him his lines\" as he drove me to school every morning, . He knew everybody's part. He knew the whole script before he came out (to film). I don't think many people did that.\nBette Davis in an interview with Dick Cavett said about Rains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well, of course he petrified me. The first time I played with him was in Carlotta (\"Juarez\"), and I had to make an entrance [into] the King of France's domain for a rehearsal, and he's playing the King of France (N.B. The character is actually the Emperor of the French Napoleon III) in rehearsal. As all of us \"other era people,\" we don't just run through lines and say \"turn the camera\", we rehearse beforehand...Anyway Claude and I couldn't, and he was the King of France who loathed Carlotta, and I was a kid and petrified of Mr. Rains, so I thought he hated \"me\". I didn't know he was playing the character. I thought, he thinks I just stink! What am I going to do? Eventually we worked together quite a lot and became really great friends, really great friends.\nDavis later went on to describe him: \"Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant.\" She also praised his performances: \"He was marvelous in \"Deception\" and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn't terribly good, but he was so marvelous in the restaurant scene where he's talking about all the food...brilliant, and of course in \"Mr. Skeffington\" he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant.\"\nRichard Chamberlain worked with Rains in what would be his second-to-last film, \"Twilight of Honor\". In 2009, Chamberlain recorded a tribute to the actor when Rains was featured as Turner Classic Movies' Star of the Month:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Claude Rains has to be considered one of the finest actors of the 20th century. As soon as you hear that marvelous, unmistakable voice of honey mixed with gravel, he becomes instantly recognizable. And that scornful right eyebrow which could freeze an adversary faster than and more effectively than any physical threat. He stood at a mere 5\u20326\u2033, yet his enormous talent and immense stage presence made him a giant among his colleagues. During a stage and film career that spanned six decades, Rains encompassed some of the most memorable and exciting characters ever created by an actor. Villains were a Rains specialty, particularly those of a suave and sarcastic nature; and yet when the role called for it, Rains could be remarkably moving and even add a touch of pathos without losing any of his effectiveness.\nIn \"Twilight of Honor\" Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain's character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was in his seventies then and in failing health, yet he was charming and totally professional on the set. It was clear to us that he loved practicing his craft; he dazzled us all. Claude was an extremely private man\u2014he never discussed his humble beginnings, his six marriages. But get him into a conversation about acting, and he opened up with delightful anecdotes and fascinating stories about his long life as a thespian.\nOne day on the set I mentioned to him that \"Notorious\" was one of my favorite films, and Claude related with amusement the filming of a particular scene with Ingrid Bergman. Rains was a very small man and Bergman was quite tall, so in order to shoot them in close-up together (in the key scene) the resourceful Alfred Hitchcock had a ramp installed, so as Rains approaches Bergman on camera he appears taller than his co-star. Claude found this ramp business a bit embarrassing and very funny.\nI got another taste of Claude's witty nature shooting a scene in his [next-to-last] film, in which he had a long piece of dialogue. Generally he had no problem remembering his lines despite getting along in years. However, there was one particularly long scene shot late at night where he was having a lot of trouble with the dialogue, and kept making excuses. And finally he paused and said with a sheepish look \"Alibi Ike, good old Alibi Ike\" (\"Alibi Ike\" being an expression based on a 1935 film of the same name, in which the lead character has a penchant for making up excuses). Of course in the finished film he played the scene flawlessly, as he always did. Claude Rains: truly a class act, on and off screen.\nMany years after Rains had gone to Hollywood and become a well-known film actor, John Gielgud commented, tongue-in-cheek:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was somebody who taught me a very great deal at drama school, and I am certainly grateful to him for his kindness and consideration. His name was Claude Rains. I don't know whatever happened to him. I think he failed, and had to go to America.\nGielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on Bette Davis: \"A number of clips from many of her most successful films were shown and I was particularly delighted, when, as soon as Claude Rains appeared in the close-up of one of the clips, the whole audience burst into a great wave of applause.\"\nBette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud said that he once wrote that \"The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures,\" and that he later added, \"but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage's loss was the cinema's gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I'm so glad of that.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nRains became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1939.\nHe married six times and divorced five times: Isabel Jeans (1913-1915), Marie Hemingway (1920-1920), Beatrix Thomson (1924-1935), Frances Propper (1935-1956), and Agi Jambor (1959-1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death in December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.\nIn 1941, Rains acquired the Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in West Bradford Township, Pennsylvania. Rains spent his final years in Sandwich, New Hampshire.\nA chronic alcoholic, Rains died from cirrhosis of the liver, having an abdominal hemorrhage in Laconia on 30May 1967, aged 77. He was buried at the Red Hill Cemetery in Moultonborough, New Hampshire.\nIn 2010, many of Rains' personal effects were put into an auction at Heritage Auctions, including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters, photographs and volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained his press cuttings and reviews from his career. In 2011, the ivory military uniform and medals he wore as Captain Renault in \"Casablanca\" auctioned when noted actress and film historian Debbie Reynolds sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the 1970 MGM auction.\nTheatre credits.\nRains starred in multiple plays and productions over the course of his career, playing a variety of leading and supporting parts. As his film career began to flourish, he found less time to perform in the theatre in both England and America.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63528", "revid": "49599614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63528", "title": "Inflorescence", "text": "Botanical term for a cluster of flowers\nIn botany, an inflorescence is a group or cluster of flowers arranged on a plant's stem that is composed of a main branch or a system of branches. An inflorescence is categorized on the basis of the arrangement of flowers on a main axis (peduncle) and by the timing of its flowering (determinate and indeterminate).\nMorphologically, an inflorescence is the modified part of the shoot of seed plants where flowers are formed on the axis of a plant. The modifications can involve the length and the nature of the internodes and the phyllotaxis, as well as variations in the proportions, compressions, swellings, adnations, connations and reduction of main and secondary axes.\nOne can also define an inflorescence as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral characteristics.\nInflorescences are described by many different characteristics including how the flowers are arranged on the peduncle, the blooming order of the flowers, and how different clusters of flowers are grouped within it. These terms are general representations as plants in nature can have a combination of types. Because flowers facilitate plant reproduction, inflorescence characteristics are largely a result of natural selection.\nThe stem holding the whole inflorescence is called a peduncle. The main axis (also referred to as major stem) above the peduncle bearing the flowers or secondary branches is called the rachis. The stalk of each flower in the inflorescence is called a pedicel. A flower that is not part of an inflorescence is called a solitary flower and its stalk is also referred to as a peduncle. Any flower in an inflorescence may be referred to as a floret, especially when the individual flowers are particularly small and borne in a tight cluster, such as in a pseudanthium. The fruiting stage of an inflorescence is known as an infructescence. Inflorescences may be simple (single) or complex (panicle). The rachis may be one of several types, including single, composite, umbel, spike or raceme. \nIn some species the flowers develop directly from the main stem or woody trunk, rather than from the plant's main shoot. This is called cauliflory and is found across a number of plant families. An extreme version of this is flagelliflory where long, whip-like branches grow from the main trunk to the ground and even below it. Inflorescences form directly on these branches.\nTerminal flower.\nPlant organs can grow according to two different schemes, namely monopodial or racemose and sympodial or cymose. In inflorescences these two different growth patterns are called indeterminate and determinate respectively, and indicate whether a terminal flower is formed and where flowering starts within the inflorescence.\nIndeterminate and determinate inflorescences are sometimes referred to as open and closed inflorescences respectively. The indeterminate patterning of flowers is derived from determinate flowers. It is suggested that indeterminate flowers have a common mechanism that prevents terminal flower growth. Based on phylogenetic analyses, this mechanism arose independently multiple times in different species.\nIn an indeterminate inflorescence there is no true terminal flower and the stem usually has a rudimentary end. In many cases the last true flower formed by the terminal bud (subterminal flower) straightens up, appearing to be a terminal flower. Often a vestige of the terminal bud may be noticed higher on the stem.\nIn determinate inflorescences the terminal flower is usually the first to mature (precursive development), while the others tend to mature starting from the base of the stem. This pattern is called acropetal maturation. When flowers start to mature from the top of the stem, maturation is basipetal, whereas when the central mature first, maturation is divergent.\nPhyllotaxis.\nAs with leaves, flowers can be arranged on the stem according to many different patterns. See 'Phyllotaxis' for in-depth descriptions.\nSimilarly arrangement of leaf in bud is called Ptyxis.\nWhen a single or a cluster of flower(s) is located at the axil of a peduncle, the location of the bract in relation to the stem holding the flower(s) is indicated by the use of different terms and may be a useful diagnostic indicator.\nTypical placement of bracts include:\nMetatopic placement of bracts include:\nOrganization.\nThere is no general consensus in defining the different inflorescences. The following is based on Focko Weberling's \"Morphologie der Bl\u00fcten und der Bl\u00fctenst\u00e4nde\" (Stuttgart, 1981). The main groups of inflorescences are distinguished by branching. Within these groups, the most important characteristics are the intersection of the axes and different variations of the model. They may contain many flowers (pluriflor) or a few (pauciflor). Inflorescences can be simple or compound.\nSimple inflorescences.\nIndeterminate or racemose.\nIndeterminate simple inflorescences are generally called racemose . The main kind of racemose inflorescence is the raceme (, from classical Latin \"racemus\", cluster of grapes). The other kind of racemose inflorescences can all be derived from this one by dilation, compression, swelling or reduction of the different axes. Some passage forms between the obvious ones are commonly admitted.\nDeterminate or cymose.\nDeterminate simple inflorescences are generally called cymose. The main kind of cymose inflorescence is the cyme (pronounced ), from the Latin \"cyma\" in the sense 'cabbage sprout', from Greek \"kuma\" 'anything swollen'). Cymes are further divided according to this scheme:\nA cyme can also be so compressed that it looks like an umbel. Strictly speaking this kind of inflorescence could be called umbelliform cyme, although it is normally called simply 'umbel'.\nAnother kind of definite simple inflorescence is the raceme-like cyme or botryoid; that is as a raceme with a terminal flower and is usually improperly called 'raceme'.\nA reduced raceme or cyme that grows in the axil of a bract is called a fascicle. A verticillaster is a fascicle with the structure of a dichasium; it is common among the Lamiaceae. Many verticillasters with reduced bracts can form a spicate (spike-like) inflorescence that is commonly called a spike.\nCompound inflorescences.\nSimple inflorescences are the basis for compound inflorescences or synflorescences. The single flowers are there replaced by a simple inflorescence, which can be both a racemose or a cymose one. Compound inflorescences are composed of branched stems and can involve complicated arrangements that are difficult to trace back to the main branch.\nA kind of compound inflorescence is the double inflorescence, in which the basic structure is repeated in the place of single florets. For example, a double raceme is a raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by other simple racemes; the same structure can be repeated to form triple or more complex structures.\nCompound raceme inflorescences can either end with a final raceme (homoeothetic), or not (heterothetic). A compound raceme is often called a panicle. This definition is very different from that given by Weberling.\nCompound umbels are umbels in which the single flowers are replaced by many smaller umbels called umbellets. The stem attaching the side umbellets to the main stem is called a ray.\nThe most common kind of definite compound inflorescence is the panicle (of Webeling, or 'panicle-like cyme'). A panicle is a definite inflorescence that is increasingly more strongly and irregularly branched from the top to the bottom and where each branching has a terminal flower.\nThe so-called cymose corymb is similar to a racemose corymb but has a panicle-like structure. Another type of panicle is the anthela. An anthela is a cymose corymb with the lateral flowers higher than the central ones.\nA raceme in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is called a (indefinite) thyrse. The secondary cymes can be of any of the different types of dichasia and monochasia. A botryoid in which the single flowers are replaced by cymes is a definite thyrse or thyrsoid. Thyrses are often confusingly called panicles.\nOther combinations are possible. For example, heads or umbels may be arranged in a corymb or a panicle.\nOther.\nThe family Asteraceae is characterised by a highly specialised head technically called a calathid (but usually referred to as 'capitulum' or 'head'). The family Poaceae has a peculiar inflorescence of small spikes (spikelets) organised in panicles or spikes that are usually simply and improperly referred to as spike and panicle. The genus \"Ficus\" (Moraceae) has an inflorescence called a hypanthodium, which bears numerous flowers on the inside of a convex or involuted compound receptacle. The genus \"Euphorbia\" has cyathia (sing. \"cyathium\"), usually organised in umbels.\nSome species have inflorescences reduced to composite flowers or pseudanthia, in which case it is difficult to differentiate between inflorescences and single flowers.\nDevelopment and patterning.\nDevelopment.\nGenetic basis.\nGenes that shape inflorescence development have been studied at great length in \"Arabidopsis\". \"LEAFY\" (LFY) is a gene that promotes floral meristem identity, regulating inflorescence development in \"Arabidopsis.\" Any alterations in timing of LFY expression can cause formation of different inflorescences in the plant. Genes similar in function to LFY include \"APETALA1\" (AP1). Mutations in LFY, AP1, and similar promoting genes can cause conversion of flowers into shoots. In contrast to LEAFY, genes like \"terminal flower\" (TFL) support the activity of an inhibitor that prevents flowers from growing on the inflorescence apex (flower primordium initiation), maintaining inflorescence meristem identity. Both types of genes help shape flower development in accordance with the ABC model of flower development. Studies have been recently conducted or are ongoing for homologs of these genes in other flower species.\nEnvironmental influences.\nInflorescence-feeding insect herbivores shape inflorescences by reducing lifetime fitness (how much flowering occurs), seed production by the inflorescences, and plant density, among other traits. In the absence of these herbivores, inflorescences usually produce more flower heads and seeds. Temperature can also variably shape inflorescence development. High temperatures can impair the proper development of flower buds or delay bud development in certain species, while in others an increase in temperature can hasten inflorescence development.\nMeristems and inflorescence architecture.\nThe shift from the vegetative to reproductive phase of a flower involves the development of an inflorescence meristem that generates floral meristems. Plant inflorescence architecture depends on which meristems becomes flowers and which become shoots. Consequently, genes that regulate floral meristem identity play major roles in determining inflorescence architecture because their expression domain will direct where the plant's flowers are formed.\nOn a larger scale, inflorescence architecture affects quality and quantity of offspring from selfing and outcrossing, as the architecture can influence pollination success. For example, \"Asclepias\" inflorescences have been shown to have an upper size limit, shaped by self-pollination levels due to crosses between inflorescences on the same plant or between flowers on the same inflorescence. In \"Aesculus sylvatica\", it has been shown that the most common inflorescence sizes are correlated with the highest fruit production as well.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63531", "revid": "18174831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63531", "title": "Ulcerative colitis", "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease that causes ulcers in the colon\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with the other type being Crohn's disease. It is a long-term condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The primary symptoms of active disease are abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood (hematochezia). Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur. Often, symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares. Complications may include abnormal dilation of the colon (megacolon), inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer.\nThe cause of UC is unknown. Theories involve immune system dysfunction, genetics, changes in the normal gut bacteria, and environmental factors. Rates tend to be higher in the developed world with some proposing this to be the result of less exposure to intestinal infections, or to a Western diet and lifestyle. The removal of the appendix at an early age may be protective. Diagnosis is typically by colonoscopy, a type of endoscopy, with tissue biopsies.\nSeveral medications are used to treat symptoms and bring about and maintain remission, including aminosalicylates such as mesalazine or sulfasalazine, steroids, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, and biologic therapy. Removal of the colon by surgery may be necessary if the disease is severe, does not respond to treatment, or if complications such as colon cancer develop. Removal of the colon and rectum generally cures the condition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nGastrointestinal.\nPeople with ulcerative colitis usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset that persists for an extended period (weeks). It is estimated that 90% of people experience rectal bleeding (of varying severity), 90% experience watery or loose stools with increased stool frequency (diarrhea), and 75\u201390% of people experience bowel urgency. Additional symptoms may include fecal incontinence, mucous rectal discharge, and nocturnal defecations. With proctitis (inflammation of the rectum), people with UC may experience urgency or rectal tenesmus, which is the urgent desire to evacuate the bowels but with the passage of little stool. Tenesmus may be misinterpreted as constipation, due to the urge to defecate despite a small volume of stool passage. Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain may be more prominent features in severe disease. The severity of abdominal pain with UC varies from mild discomfort to very painful bowel movements and abdominal cramping. High frequency of bowel movements, weight loss, nausea, fatigue, and fever are also common during disease flares. Chronic bleeding from the GI tract, chronic inflammation, and iron deficiency often leads to anemia, which can affect quality of life.\nThe clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process. Up to 15% of individuals may have severe disease upon initial onset of symptoms. A substantial proportion (up to 45%) of people with a history of UC without any ongoing symptoms (clinical remission) have objective evidence of ongoing inflammation. Ulcerative colitis is associated with a generalized inflammatory process that can affect many parts of the body. Sometimes, these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease.\nExtent of involvement.\nIn contrast to Crohn's disease, which can affect areas of the gastrointestinal tract outside of the colon, ulcerative colitis is usually confined to the colon. Inflammation in ulcerative colitis is usually continuous, typically involving the rectum, with involvement extending proximally (to sigmoid colon, ascending colon, etc.). In contrast, inflammation with Crohn's disease is often patchy, with so-called \"skip lesions\" (intermittent regions of inflamed bowel).\nThe disease is classified by the extent of involvement, depending on how far the disease extends: proctitis (rectal inflammation), left sided colitis (inflammation extending to the descending colon), and extensive colitis (inflammation proximal to the descending colon). Proctosigmoiditis describes inflammation of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Pancolitis describes involvement of the entire colon, extending from the rectum to the cecum. While usually associated with Crohn's disease, ileitis (inflammation of the ileum) also occurs in UC. About 17% of individuals with UC have ileitis. Ileitis more commonly occurs in the setting of pancolitis (occurring in 20% of cases of pancolitis), and tends to correlate with the activity of colitis. This so-called \"backwash ileitis\" can occur in 10\u201320% of people with pancolitis and is believed to be of little clinical significance.\nSeverity of disease.\nIn addition to the extent of involvement, UC is also characterized by the severity of the disease. Severity of disease is defined by symptoms, objective markers of inflammation (endoscopic findings, blood tests), disease course, and the impact of the disease on day-to-day life. Most patients are categorized through endoscopy and fecal calprotectin levels. Indicators of low risk for future complications in mild and moderate UC include the following parameters: exhibiting less than 6 stools daily and a lack of fever/weight loss. Other indicators include lack of extraintestinal symptoms, low levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and fecal calprotectin, and later age of diagnosis (over 40 years). Mild disease correlates with fewer than four stools daily; in addition, mild urgency and rectal bleeding may occur intermittently. Mild disease lacks systemic signs of toxicity (e.g., fever, chills, weight changes) and exhibits normal levels of the serum inflammatory markers ESR and CRP.\nModerate to severe disease is characterized by more than six stools daily, frequent bloody stools, and urgency. Moderate abdominal pain, low-grade fever, , and anemia may develop. ESR and CRP are usually elevated.\nThe Mayo Score, which combines clinical symptoms (stool frequency and amount of rectal bleeding) with endoscopic findings and a physician's assessment of disease severity, is often used clinically to classify UC as mild, moderate, or severe.\nAcute-Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC) is a severe form that presents acutely and with severe symptoms. This fulminant type is associated with severe symptoms (usually diarrhea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain) and is usually associated with systemic symptoms including fever. It is associated with a high mortality rate as compared to milder forms of UC, with a 3-month and 12 month mortality rate of 0.84% and 1% respectively. People with fulminant UC may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon represents a medical emergency, one often treated surgically. If the serous membrane is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue, which has a 50% mortality rate in people with UC. Other complications include hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism, and secondary infections of the colon including \"C. difficile\" or cytomegalovirus colitis.\nUlcerative colitis may improve and enter remission.\nExtraintestinal manifestations and complications.\nUC is characterized by immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation, which may result in symptoms and complications outside the colon. Commonly affected organs include: eyes, joints, skin, and liver. The frequency of such extraintestinal manifestations has been reported as between 6 and 47%.\nUC may affect the mouth. About 8% of individuals with UC develop oral manifestations. The two most common oral manifestations are aphthous stomatitis and angular cheilitis. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by ulcers in the mouth, which are benign, noncontagious, and often recurrent. Angular chelitis is characterized by redness at the corners of the mouth, which may include painful sores or breaks in the skin. Very rarely, benign pustules may occur in the mouth (pyostomatitis vegetans).\nUC may affect the eyes, manifesting in scleritis, iritis, and conjunctivitis. Patients may be asymptomatic or experience redness, burning, or itching in the eyes. Inflammation may occur in the interior portion of the eye, leading to uveitis and iritis. Uveitis can cause blurred vision and eye pain, especially when exposed to light (photophobia). Untreated, uveitis can lead to permanent vision loss. Inflammation may also involve the white part of the eye (sclera) or the overlying connective tissue (episclera), causing conditions called scleritis and episcleritis. Ulcerative colitis is most commonly associated with uveitis and episcleritis.\nUC may cause several joint manifestations, including a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative arthritis, which may affect few large joints (oligoarthritis), the vertebra (ankylosing spondylitis) or several small joints of the hands and feet (peripheral arthritis). Often the insertion site where muscle attaches to bone (entheses) becomes inflamed (enthesitis). Inflammation may affect the sacroiliac joint (sacroiliitis). It is estimated that around 50% of IBD patients suffer from migratory arthritis. Synovitis, or inflammation of the synovial fluid surrounding a joint, can occur for months and recur in later times, but usually does not erode the joint. The symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, swelling, and effusion, and often lead to significant morbidity. Ankylosing spondylitis and sacroilitis usually occur independently of bowel disease activity in UC.\nUlcerative colitis may affect the skin. The most common type of skin manifestation, erythema nodosum, presents in up to 3% of UC patients. It develops as raised, tender red nodules usually appearing on the outer areas of the arms or legs, especially in the anterior tibial area (shins). The nodules have diameters that measure approximately 1\u20135\u00a0cm. Erythema nodosum is due to inflammation of the underlying subcutaneous tissue (panniculitis), and biopsy will display focal panniculitis (although it is often unnecessary in diagnosis). In contrast to joint-related manifestations, erythema nodosum often occurs alongside intestinal disease. Thus, treatment of UC can often lead to the resolution of skin nodules.\nAnother skin condition associated with UC is pyoderma gangrenosum, which presents as deep skin ulcerations. Pyoderma gangrenosum is seen in about 1% of patients with UC and its formation is usually independent of bowel inflammation. Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by painful lesions or nodules that become ulcers which progressively grow. The ulcers are often filled with sterile pus-like material. In some cases, pyoderma gangrenosum may require injection with corticosteroids. Treatment may also involve inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that promotes cell survival.\nOther associations determined between the skin and ulcerative colitis include a skin condition known as hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). This condition represents a chronic process in which follicles become occluded, leading to recurring inflammation of nodules and abscesses and even fistulas tunnels in the skin that drain fluid.\nUlcerative colitis may affect the circulatory and endocrine systems. UC increases the risk of blood clots in both arteries and veins; painful swelling of the lower legs can be a sign of deep venous thrombosis, while difficulty breathing may be a result of pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs). The risk of blood clots is about threefold higher in individuals with IBD. The risk of venous thromboembolism is high in ulcerative colitis due to hypercoagulability from inflammation, especially with active or extensive disease. Additional risk factors may include surgery, hospitalization, pregnancy, the use of corticosteroids and tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor.\nOsteoporosis may occur related to systemic inflammation or prolonged steroid use in the treatment of UC, which increases the risk of bone fractures. Clubbing, a deformity of the ends of the fingers, may occur. Amyloidosis may occur, especially with severe and poorly controlled disease, which usually presents with protein in the urine (proteinuria) and nephritic syndrome.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis.\nUlcerative colitis (UC) has a significant association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. Up to 70\u201390% of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have ulcerative colitis. As many as 5% of people with UC may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis. PSC is more common in men, and often begins between 30 and 40 years of age. It can present asymptomatically or exhibit symptoms of itchiness (pruritis) and fatigue. Other symptoms include systemic signs such as fever and night sweats. Such symptoms are often associated with a bacterial episodic version of PSC. Upon physical exam, one may discern enlarged liver contours (hepatomegaly) or enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) as well as areas of excoriation. Yellow coloring of the skin, or jaundice, may also be present due to an excess of bile byproduct buildup (bilirubin) from the biliary tract.\nIn diagnosis, lab results often reveal a pattern indicative of biliary disease (cholestatic pattern). This is often displayed by markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and milder or no elevation in liver enzyme levels. Results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) may show bile ducts with thicker walls, areas of dilation or narrowing. However, some patients with UC and PSC have inflammation that has significantly affected only ramified intrahepatic bile ducts of smaller diameter, also known as \"small ducts\", which are not visualized by ERC.\nIn some cases, primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs several years before the bowel symptoms of ulcerative colitis develop. PSC does not parallel the onset, extent, duration, or activity of the colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis. In addition, colectomy does not have an impact on the course of primary sclerosing cholangitis in individuals with UC. PSC is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). PSC is a progressive condition and may result in cirrhosis of the liver. No specific therapy has been proven to affect the long-term course of PSC.\nCauses.\nUlcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cells infiltrating the colon. No direct causes for UC are known, but factors such as genetics, environment, and an overactive immune system play a role. UC is associated with comorbidities that produce symptoms in many areas of the body outside the digestive system.\nGenetic factors.\nA genetic component to the cause of UC can be hypothesized based on aggregation of UC in families, variation of prevalence between different ethnicities, genetic markers and linkages. In addition, the identical twin concordance rate is 10%, whereas the dizygotic twin concordance rate is only 3%. Between 8 and 14% of people with ulcerative colitis have a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, people with a first-degree relative with UC have a four-fold increase in their risk of developing the disease.\nTwelve regions of the genome may be linked to UC, including, in the order of their discovery, chromosomes 16, 12, 6, 14, 5, 19, 1, and 3, but none of these loci has been consistently shown to be at fault, suggesting that the disorder is influenced by multiple genes. For example, chromosome band 1p36 is one such region thought to be linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Some of the putative regions encode transporter proteins such as OCTN1 and OCTN2. Other potential regions involve cell scaffolding proteins such as the MAGUK family. Human leukocyte antigen associations may even be at work. In fact, this linkage on chromosome 6 may be the most convincing and consistent of the genetic candidates.\nMultiple autoimmune disorders are associated with ulcerative colitis, including celiac disease, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, episcleritis, and scleritis. Ulcerative colitis is also associated with acute intermittent porphyria.\nEnvironmental factors.\nMany hypotheses have been raised for environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, including diet, breastfeeding, and medications. Breastfeeding may have a protective effect on the development of ulcerative colitis. One study of isotretinoin found a small increase in the rate of UC.\nAs the colon is exposed to many dietary substances which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, research does not show a link between diet and the development of ulcerative colitis. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the number of people affected by ulcerative colitis. High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Other identified dietary factors that may influence the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the cause of ulcerative colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur-restricted diets have been investigated in people with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with DuPont, three epidemiologists conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes, one of which was ulcerative colitis.\nAlternative theories.\nLevels of sulfate-reducing bacteria tend to be higher in persons with ulcerative colitis, which could indicate higher levels of hydrogen sulfide in the intestine. An alternative theory suggests that the symptoms of the disease may be caused by the toxic effects of the hydrogen sulfide on the cells lining the intestine.\nInfection by \"Mycobacterium avium\", subspecies \"paratuberculosis\", has been proposed as the ultimate cause of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nPathophysiology.\nAn increased amount of colonic sulfate-reducing bacteria has been observed in some people with ulcerative colitis, resulting in higher concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. Human colonic mucosa is maintained by the colonic epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria (see intestinal mucosal barrier). The short-chain fatty acid \"n\"-butyrate gets oxidized through the beta oxidation pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that \"n\"-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the protective effect of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the hydrogen cyanide from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the non-toxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway. An unrelated study suggested that the sulfur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for people in remission.\nOther proposed mechanisms driving the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis involve an abnormal immune response to the normal gut microbiota. This involves abnormal activity of antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and macrophages. Normally, dendritic cells and macrophages patrol the intestinal epithelium and phagocytose (engulf and destroy) pathogenic microorganisms and present parts of the microorganism as antigens to T-cells to stimulate differentiation and activation of the T-cells. However, in ulcerative colitis, aberrant activity of dendritic cells and macrophages results in them phagocytosing bacteria of the normal gut microbiome. After ingesting the microbiome bacterium, the APCs release the cytokine TNF\u03b1, which stimulates inflammatory signaling and recruits inflammatory cells to the intestines, leading to the inflammation that is characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The TNF inhibitors, including infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, are used to inhibit this step during the treatment of ulcerative colitis. After phagocytosing the microbe, the APCs then enter the mesenteric lymph nodes where they present antigens to naive T-cells while also releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 which lead to T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 T-cells. IL-12 and IL-23 signaling is blocked by the biologic ustekinumab and IL-23 is blocked by guselkumab, mirikizumab and risankizumab, medications that are used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. From the mesenteric lymph node, the T-cells then enter the intestinal lymphatic venule, which provides transport to the intestinal epithelium, where they mediate further inflammation characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The T-cells exit the lymphatic venule via the adhesion protein mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1, the ulcerative colitis biologic treatment vedolizumab inhibits T-cell migration out of the lymphatic venules by blocking binding to MAdCAM-1. While the medications ozanimod and etrasimod inhibit the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor to prevent T-cell migration into the efferent lymphatic venules. Once the mature Th1 and Th17 T-cells exit the efferent lymphatic venule, they travel to the intestinal mucosa and cause further inflammation. T-cell mediated inflammation is thought to be driven by the JAK-STAT intracellular T-cell signaling pathway, leading to the transcription, translation and release of inflammatory cytokines. This T-cell JAK-STAT signaling is inhibited by the medications tofacitinib, filgotinib, and upadacitinib, which are used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.\nDiagnosis.\nThe initial diagnostic workup for ulcerative colitis consists of a complete history and physical examination, assessment of signs and symptoms, laboratory tests and endoscopy. Severe UC can exhibit high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), decreased albumin (a protein produced by the liver), and various changes in electrolytes. As discussed previously, UC patients often also display elevated alkaline phosphatase. Inflammation in the intestine may also cause higher levels of fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin.\nSpecific testing may include the following:\nAlthough ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease.\nThe simple clinical colitis activity index was created in 1998 and is used to assess the severity of symptoms.\nEndoscopic.\nThe best test for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains endoscopy, which is the examination of the internal surface of the bowel using a flexible camera. Initially, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be completed to establish the diagnosis. The physician may elect to limit the extent of the initial exam if severe colitis is encountered to minimize the risk of perforation of the colon. However, a complete colonoscopy with entry into the terminal ileum should be performed to rule out Crohn's disease and assess the extent and severity of the disease. Endoscopic findings in ulcerative colitis include: erythema (redness of the mucosa), friability of the mucosa, superficial ulceration, and loss of the vascular appearance of the colon. When present, ulcerations may be confluent. Pseudopolyps may be observed.\nUlcerative colitis is usually continuous from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis (rectal inflammation) to left-sided colitis (extending to the descending colon) to extensive colitis (extending proximal to the descending colon).\nHistologic.\nBiopsies of the mucosa are taken during endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Histologic findings in ulcerative colitis include: distortion of crypt architecture, crypt abscesses, and inflammatory cells in the mucosa (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes). Unlike the transmural inflammation seen in Crohn's disease, the inflammation of ulcerative colitis is limited to the mucosa.\nLaboratory tests.\nBlood and stool tests serve primarily to assess disease severity, level of inflammation, and rule out causes of infectious colitis. All individuals with suspected ulcerative colitis should have stool testing to rule out infection.\nA complete blood count may demonstrate anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytosis. Anemia may be caused by inflammation or bleeding. Chronic blood loss may lead to iron deficiency as a cause for anemia, particularly microcytic anemia (small red blood cells), which can be evaluated with a serum ferritin, iron, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation. Anemia may be due to a complication of treatment from azathioprine, which can cause low blood counts, or sulfasalazine, which can result in folate deficiency. Thiopurine metabolites (from azathioprine) and a folate level can help.\nUC may cause high levels of inflammation throughout the body, which may be quantified with serum inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ESR. However, elevated inflammatory markers are not specific for UC, and elevations are commonly seen in other conditions, including infection. In addition, inflammatory markers are not uniformly elevated in people with ulcerative colitis. Twenty five percent of individuals with confirmed inflammation on endoscopic evaluation have a normal CRP level. Serum albumin may also be low related to inflammation, in addition to loss of protein in the GI tract associated with bleeding and colitis. Low serum levels of vitamin D are associated with UC, although the significance of this finding is unclear.\nSpecific antibody markers may be elevated in ulcerative colitis. Specifically, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are found in 70 percent of cases of UC. Antibodies against \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" may be present, but are more often positive in Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. However, due to the poor accuracy of these serologic tests, they are not helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of possible inflammatory bowel disease.\nSeveral stool tests may help quantify the extent of inflammation present in the colon and rectum. Fecal calprotectin is elevated in inflammatory conditions affecting the colon, and is useful in distinguishing irritable bowel syndrome (noninflammatory) from a flare in inflammatory bowel disease. Fecal calprotectin is 88% sensitive and 79% specific for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. If the fecal calprotectin is low, the likelihood of inflammatory bowel disease is less than 1 percent. Lactoferrin is an additional nonspecific marker of intestinal inflammation.\nImaging.\nOverall, imaging tests, such as x-ray or CT scan, may help assess for complications of ulcerative colitis, such as perforation or toxic megacolon. Bowel ultrasound (US) is a cost-effective, well-tolerated, non-invasive, and readily available tool for the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including UC, in clinical practice. Some studies demonstrated that bowel ultrasound is an accurate tool for assessing disease activity in people with ulcerative colitis. Imaging is otherwise of limited use in diagnosing ulcerative colitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to diagnose underlying PSC.\nAbdominal X-ray is often the test of choice and may display nonspecific findings in cases of mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. In circumstances of severe UC, radiographic findings may include thickening of the mucosa, often termed \"thumbprinting\", which indicates swelling due to fluid displacement (edema). Other findings may include colonic dilation and stool buildup, evidencing constipation.\nSimilar to X-ray, in mild ulcerative colitis, double contrast barium enema often shows nonspecific findings. Conversely, barium enema may display small buildups of barium in microulcerations. Severe UC can be characterized by various polyps, colonic shortening, loss of haustrae (the small bulging pouches in the colon), and narrowing of the colon. It is important to note that barium enema should not be conducted in patients exhibiting very severe symptoms, as this may slow or stop stool passage through the colon, causing ileus and toxic megacolon.\nOther imaging techniques include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both may depict colonic wall thickening but have decreased ability to find early signs of wall changes when compared to barium enema. In cases of severe ulcerative colitis, however, they often exhibit equivalent ability to detect colonic changes.\nDoppler ultrasound is the last imaging modality that may be used. Similar to the imaging methods mentioned earlier, this may show some thickened bowel wall layers. In severe cases, this may show thickening in all bowel wall layers (transmural thickness).\nDifferential diagnosis.\nSeveral conditions may present similarly to ulcerative colitis and should be excluded. Such conditions include: Crohn's disease, infectious colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, and irritable bowel syndrome. Alternative causes of colitis should be considered, such as ischemic colitis (inadequate blood flow to the colon), radiation colitis (if prior exposure to radiation therapy), or chemical colitis. Pseudomembranous colitis may occur due to \"Clostridioides difficile\" infection following administration of antibiotics. \"Entamoeba histolytica\" is a protozoan parasite that causes intestinal inflammation. A few cases have been misdiagnosed as UC with poor outcomes occurring due to the use of corticosteroids.\nThe most common disease that mimics the symptoms of ulcerative colitis is Crohn's disease, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases since their courses and treatments may differ. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to distinguish, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis. Crohn's disease can be distinguished from ulcerative colitis in several ways. Characteristics that indicate Crohn's include evidence of disease around the anus (perianal disease). This includes anal fissures and abscesses as well as fistulas, which are abnormal connections between various bodily structures.\nInfectious colitis is another condition that may present similarly to ulcerative colitis. Endoscopic findings are also often similar. One can discern whether a patient has infectious colitis by employing tissue cultures and stool studies. Biopsy of the colon is another beneficial test, but it is more invasive.\nOther forms of colitis that may present similarly include radiation and diversion colitis. Radiation colitis occurs after irradiation and often affects the rectum or sigmoid colon, similar to ulcerative colitis. Upon histology, radiation colitis may indicate eosinophilic infiltrates, abnormal epithelial cells, or fibrosis. Diversion colitis, on the other hand, occurs after portions of bowel loops have been removed. This condition often shows increased growth of lymphoid tissue on histology.\nIn patients who have undergone transplantation, graft versus host disease may also be a differential diagnosis. This response to transplantation often causes prolonged diarrhea if the colon is affected. Typical symptoms also include a rash. Involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract may lead to difficulty swallowing or ulceration. Upon histology, Graft-versus-host disease may present with crypt cell necrosis and breakdown products within the crypts themselves.\nManagement.\nStandard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse. The concept of inducing and maintaining remission is crucial. The medications used to induce and maintain remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing remission, which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the colon's lining, and then longer-term treatment to maintain remission and prevent complications.\nFor acute stages of the disease, a low fiber diet may be recommended.\nMedication.\nThe first-line maintenance medication for ulcerative colitis in remission is mesalazine (also known as mesalamine or 5-ASA). For patients with active disease limited to the left colon (descending colon) or proctitis, mesalazine is also the first-line agent, and a combination of suppositories and oral mesalazine may be tried. Adding corticosteroids such as prednisone is also common in active disease, especially if remission is not achieved through mesalazine monotherapy, but they are not used in long-term treatment as their risks then outweigh their benefits. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, or risankizumab are given in severe disease or if a patient cannot achieve remission with mesalazine and corticosteroids. Guselkumab, mirikizumab, and risankizumab are monoclonal antibodies that target the p19 subunit of IL-23 and are approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. As an alternative to mesalazine, one of its prodrugs such as sulfasalazine may be chosen for treatment of active disease or maintenance therapy, but the prodrugs have greater potential for serious side effects and have not been demonstrated to be superior to mesalazine in large trials.\nA formulation of budesonide was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. In 2018, tofacitinib was approved for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in the United States, the first oral medication indicated for long term use in this condition. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Cyclosporine is effective for severe UC and tacrolimus has also shown benefits. Etrasimod was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2023.\nAminosalicylates.\nSulfasalazine has been a major agent in the therapy of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis for over 50 years. In 1977, it was shown that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine/mesalamine) was the therapeutically active component in sulfasalazine. Many 5-ASA drugs have been developed to deliver the active compound to the large intestine to maintain therapeutic efficacy but with reduction of the side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine. Oral 5-ASA drugs are particularly effective in inducing and maintaining remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Rectal suppository, foam, or liquid enema formulations of 5-ASA are used for colitis affecting the rectum, sigmoid, or descending colon, and are effective, especially when combined with oral treatment.\nBiologics.\nBiologic treatments such as the TNF inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are commonly used to treat people with UC who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Tofacitinib and vedolizumab can also produce good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Biologics may be used early in treatment (step down approach), or after other treatments have failed to induce remission (step up approach); the strategy should be individualized.\nUnlike aminosalicylates, biologics can cause serious side effects such as an increased risk of developing extra-intestinal cancers, heart failure; and weakening of the immune system, resulting in a decreased ability of the immune system to clear infections and reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis. For this reason, people on these treatments are closely monitored and are often tested for hepatitis and tuberculosis annually.\nEtrasimod, a once-daily oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that selectively activates S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4, and 5 with no detectable activity on S1P 2 or 3, is in development for treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and was shown in 2 randomized trials to be effective and well tolerated as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\nNicotine.\nUnlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis has a lesser chance of affecting smokers than non-smokers. In select individuals with a history of previous tobacco use, resuming low dose smoking may improve signs and symptoms of active ulcerative colitis, but it is not recommended due to the overwhelmingly negative health effects of tobacco. Studies using a transdermal nicotine patch have shown clinical and histological improvement. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in the United Kingdom, 48.6% of people with UC who used the nicotine patch, in conjunction with their standard treatment, showed complete resolution of symptoms. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial conducted in the United States showed that 39% of people who used the patch showed significant improvement, versus 9% of those given a placebo. However, nicotine therapy is generally not recommended due to side effects and inconsistent results.\nIron supplementation.\nThe gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on the severity of the anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because people respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as people eventually respond, and many will tolerate the side effects.\nAnticholinergics.\nAnticholinergic drugs, more specifically muscarinic antagonists, are sometimes used to treat abdominal cramps in connection with ulcerative colitis through their calming effect on colonic peristalsis (reducing both amplitude and frequency) and intestinal tone. Some medical authorities suggest over-the-counter anticholinergic drugs as potential helpful treatments for abdominal cramping in mild ulcerative colitis. However, their use is contraindicated especially in moderate to severe disease states because of the potential for anticholinergic treatment to induce toxic megacolon in patients with colonic inflammation. Toxic megacolon is a state in which the colon is abnormally distended, and may in severe or untreated cases lead to colonic perforation, sepsis, and death.\nImmunosuppressant therapies, infection risks, and vaccinations.\nMany patients affected by ulcerative colitis need immunosuppressant therapies, which may be associated with a higher risk of contracting opportunistic infectious diseases.\nMany of these potentially harmful diseases, such as Hepatitis B, Influenza, chickenpox, herpes zoster virus, pneumococcal pneumonia, or human papilloma virus, can be prevented by vaccines. Each drug used in the treatment of IBD should be classified according to the degree of immunosuppression induced in the patient. Several guidelines suggest investigating patients' vaccination status before starting any treatment and performing vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases when required. \nCompared to the rest of the population, patients affected by IBD are known to be at higher risk of contracting some vaccine-preventable diseases. Patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitor showed higher risk of Shingles. Nevertheless, despite the increased risk of infections, vaccination rates in IBD patients are known to be suboptimal and may also be lower than vaccination rates in the general population.\nSurgery.\nUnlike in Crohn's disease, the gastrointestinal aspects of ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine, though extraintestinal symptoms may persist. This procedure is necessary in the event of: exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for people with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. People with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve their quality of life.\nThe removal of the entire large intestine, known as a proctocolectomy, results in a permanent ileostomy, where a stoma is created by pulling the terminal ileum through the abdomen. Intestinal contents are emptied into a removable ostomy bag which is secured around the stoma using adhesive.\nAnother surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). This is a two- or three-step procedure. In a three-step procedure, the first surgery is a sub-total colectomy, in which the large bowel is removed, but the rectum remains in situ, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The second step is a proctectomy and formation of the ileal pouch (commonly known as a \"j-pouch\"). This involves removing the large majority of the remaining rectal stump and creating a new \"rectum\" by fashioning the end of the small intestine into a pouch and attaching it to the anus. After this procedure, a new type of ileostomy is created (known as a loop ileostomy) to allow the anastomoses to heal. The final surgery is a take-down procedure where the ileostomy is reversed, and there is no longer a need for an ostomy bag. When done in two steps, a proctocolectomy \u2013 removing both the colon and rectum \u2013 is performed alongside the pouch formation and loop ileostomy. The final step is the same take-down surgery as in the three-step procedure. Time taken between each step can vary, but typically a six- to twelve-month interval is recommended between the first two steps, and a minimum of two to three months is required between the formation of the pouch and the ileostomy take-down.\nWhile the ileal pouch procedure removes the need for an ostomy bag, it does not restore normal bowel function. In the months following the final operation, patients typically experience 8\u201315 bowel movements a day. Over time this number decreases, with many patients reporting 4\u20136 bowel movements after one year post-op. While many patients have success with this procedure, there are a number of known complications. Pouchitis, inflammation of the ileal pouch resulting in symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis, is relatively common. Pouchitis can be acute, remitting, or chronic however treatment using antibiotics, steroids, or biologics can be highly effective. Other complications include fistulas, abscesses, and pouch failure. Depending on the severity of the condition, pouch revision surgery may need to be performed. In some cased the pouch may need to be de-functioned or removed and an ileostomy recreated.\nThe risk of cancer arising from an ileal pouch anal anastomosis is low. However, annual surveillance with pouchoscopy may be considered in individuals with risk factors for dysplasia, such as a history of dysplasia or colorectal cancer, a history of PSC, refractory pouchitis, and severely inflamed atrophic pouch mucosa.\nBacterial recolonization.\nIn several randomized clinical trials, probiotics have demonstrated the potential to be helpful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Specific types of probiotics, such as \"Escherichia coli\" Nissle have been shown to induce remission in some people for up to a year.\nA Cochrane review of controlled trials using various probiotics found low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission. People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects. Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5\u2010aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.\nIt is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse in people with stable disease activity, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy.\nFecal microbiota transplant involves the infusion of human probiotics through fecal enemas. Ulcerative colitis typically requires a more prolonged bacteriotherapy treatment than \"Clostridioides difficile\" infection does to be successful, possibly due to the time needed to heal the ulcerated epithelium. The response of ulcerative colitis is potentially very favorable, with one study reporting 67.7% of people experiencing complete remission. Other studies found a benefit from using fecal microbiota transplantation.\nAlternative medicine.\nA variety of alternative medicine therapies have been used for ulcerative colitis, with inconsistent results. Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in conjunction with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with quiescent ulcerative colitis. The effect of curcumin therapy alone on quiescent ulcerative colitis is unknown.\nTreatments using cannabis or cannabis oil are uncertain. So far, studies have not determined its effectiveness and safety.\nAbdominal pain management.\nMany interventions have been considered to manage abdominal pain in people with ulcerative colitis, including low-FODMAP diet, relaxation training, yoga, kefir diet, and stellate ganglion block treatment. It is unclear whether any of these are safe or effective at improving pain or reducing anxiety and depression.\nNutrition.\nDiet can play a role in the symptoms of patients with ulcerative colitis.\nThe most avoided foods and drinks by patients are spicy foods, dairy products, alcohol, fruits, vegetables, and carbonated beverages; these foods are mainly avoided during remission and to prevent relapse. In some cases, especially during the flare period, the dietary restrictions of these patients can be very severe and can lead to a compromised nutritional state. Some patients tend to eliminate gluten spontaneously, despite not having a definite diagnosis of coeliac disease, because they believe that gluten can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms.\nMany patients with ulcerative colitis tend to follow restrictive diets to control symptoms. Usually lactose-free diets is the most common diet followed by patients with ulcerative colitis (21.3%% vs 11.6% controls), followed by gluten-free diet (23.4% vs 9.3% in controls). Low-FODMAP diet adoption is usually minimal. Fibre avoidance is higher in patients with Crohn's disease (45%) compared to controls (5%).\nMental health.\nMany studies found that patients with IBD reported a higher frequency of depressive and anxiety disorders than the general population, and most studies confirm that women with IBD are more likely than men to develop affective disorders and show that up to 65% of them may have depression disorder and anxiety disorder.\nA meta-analysis of interventions to improve mood (including talking therapy, antidepressants, and exercise) in people with inflammatory bowel disease found that they reduced inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin. Psychological therapies reduced inflammation more than antidepressants or exercise.\nPrognosis.\nPoor prognostic factors include: age &lt; 40 years upon diagnosis, extensive colitis, severe colitis on endoscopy, prior hospitalization, elevated CRP, and low serum albumin.\nProgression or remission.\nPeople with ulcerative colitis usually have an intermittent course, with periods of disease inactivity alternating with \"flares\" of disease. People with proctitis or left-sided colitis usually have a more benign course: only 15% progress proximally with their disease, and up to 20% can have sustained remission in the absence of any therapy. A subset of people experience a course of disease that progresses rapidly. In these cases, there is usually a failure to respond to medication, and surgery is often performed within the first few years of disease onset. People with more extensive disease are less likely to sustain remission, but the rate of remission is independent of the severity of the disease. Several risk factors are associated with eventual need for colectomy, including: prior hospitalization for UC, extensive colitis, need for systemic steroids, young age at diagnosis, low serum albumin, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP &amp; ESR), and severe inflammation seen during colonoscopy. Surgical removal of the large intestine is necessary in some cases.\nColorectal cancer.\nThe risk of colorectal cancer is significantly increased in people with ulcerative colitis after ten years if involvement is beyond the splenic flexure. People with backwash ileitis might have an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma. Those people with only proctitis usually have no increased risk. It is recommended that people have screening colonoscopies with random biopsies to look for dysplasia after eight years of disease activity, at one to two year intervals.\nMortality.\nPeople with ulcerative colitis are at similar or perhaps slightly increased overall risk of death compared with the background population. However, the distribution of causes-of-death differs from the general population. Specific risk factors may predict worse outcomes and a higher risk of mortality in people with ulcerative colitis, including \"C. difficile\" infection and cytomegalovirus infection (due to reactivation).\nEpidemiology.\nThe first description of ulcerative colitis occurred around the 1850s, and it has become more common since the 1950s. Together with Crohn's disease, about 11.2 million people were affected as of 2015[ [update]], and about one million were affected in the United States as of 2012. Each year, ulcerative colitis newly occurs in 1\u201320 per 100,000 people (incidence), and there are a total of 5\u2013500 per 100,000 with the disease (prevalence). \nIn 2015, a worldwide total of 47,400 people died due to inflammatory bowel disease (UC and Crohn's disease). The peak onset is between 30 and 40 years of age, with a second peak of onset occurring in the 6th decade of life. Ulcerative colitis is equally common among men and women. With appropriate treatment the risk of death appears similar to that of the general population.\nThe geographic distribution of UC and Crohn's disease is similar worldwide, with the highest number of new cases a year of UC found in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The disease is more common in North America and Europe than other regions. In general, higher rates are seen in northern locations compared to southern locations in Europe and the United States. UC is more common in western Europe compared with eastern Europe. Worldwide, the prevalence of UC varies from 2 to 299 per 100,000 people.\nAs with Crohn's disease, the rates of UC are greater among Ashkenazi Jews and decreases progressively in other persons of Jewish descent, non-Jewish Caucasians, Africans, Hispanics, and Asians. Appendectomy prior to age 20 for appendicitis and current tobacco use are protective against development of UC. However, former tobacco use is associated with a higher risk of developing the disease.\nUnited States.\nAs of 2004[ [update]], the number of new cases of UC in the United States was between 2.2 and 14.3 per 100,000 per year. The number of people affected in the United States in 2004 was between 37 and 246 per 100,000.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, between 1998 and 2000, the number of new cases per year was 12.9 per 100,000 population, or 4,500 new cases. The number of people affected was estimated to be 211 per 100,000 or 104,000.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, 10 per 100,000 people develop the condition a year, while the number of people affected is 243 per 100,000. Approximately 146,000 people in the United Kingdom have been diagnosed with UC.\nHistory.\nThe term ulcerative colitis was first used by Samuel Wilks in 1859. The term entered general medical vocabulary afterwards in 1888 with William Hale-White publishing a report of various cases of \"ulcerative colitis\".\nUC was the first subtype of IBD to be identified.\nResearch.\nHelminthic therapy using the whipworm \"Trichuris suis\" has been shown in a randomized control trial from Iowa to show benefit in people with ulcerative colitis. The therapy tests the hygiene hypothesis, which argues that the absence of helminths in the colons of people in the developed world may lead to inflammation. Both helminthic therapy and fecal microbiota transplant induce a characteristic Th2 white cell response in the diseased areas, which was unexpected given that ulcerative colitis was thought to involve Th2 overproduction.\nAlicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.\nGram-positive bacteria present in the lumen may be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis.\nA series of drugs in development looks to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel in the inflammation signaling cascade known as KCa3.1. In a preclinical study in rats and mice, inhibition of KCa3.1 disrupted the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 and decreased colon inflammation as effectively as sulfasalazine.\nNeutrophil extracellular traps and the resulting degradation of the extracellular matrix have been reported in the colon mucosa in ulcerative colitis patients in clinical remission, indicating the involvement of the innate immune system in the etiology.\nFexofenadine, an antihistamine used in the treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by the involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.\nThere is evidence that etrolizumab is effective for ulcerative colitis, with phase 3 trials underway as of 2016. Etrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the \u03b27 subunit of integrins \u03b14\u03b27 and \u03b1E\u03b27, ultimately blocking migration and retention of leukocytes in the intestinal mucosa. As of early 2022, Roche halted clinical trials for the use of etrolizumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.\nA type of leukocyte apheresis, known as granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, still requires large-scale trials to determine whether or not it is effective. Results from small trials have been tentatively positive.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is made from aged stockfish (air-dried whitefish), or dried and salted cod. The fish takes a gelatinous texture after being rehydrated for days prior to eating.\nLutefisk is prepared as a seafood dish of several Nordic countries. It is traditionally part of the Christmas feasts Norwegian julebord, Swedish julbord, and Finnish joulup\u00f6yt\u00e4.\nOrigin.\nPreserved fish provided protein for generations in a part of the world with a strong fishing tradition. It is not known when people first started treating dried fish with lye. The reason was probably that the lack of major salt deposits in the area favored the drying process for the preservation of whitefish, a process known for millennia.\nStockfish is very nutrient-rich and was consumed domestically, although it was during the boom in the stockfish trade in the late Middle Ages that it became accessible throughout Scandinavia as well as the rest of Europe. Higher-quality stockfish would be soaked in water, then boiled and eaten with melted butter. Lower-quality fish would be harder and require longer boiling, using more fuel; it has been suggested that adding ash from beech or birch to the boiling water would break down the protein chains and speed up the process. The introduction of lye in the preparation process might therefore have been incidental.\nPreparation.\nThe first step in preserving is soaking the fish for five to six days, with the water changed daily. The saturated lutefisk is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days. The fish swells during this soaking, and its protein content decreases by more than 50 percent, producing a jelly-like consistency.\nWhen this treatment is finished, the fish is saturated with lye and inedible, with a pH of 11\u201312.\nTo make the fish edible, a final treatment of another four to six days of soaking in cold water changed daily is needed. The lutefisk is then ready to be cooked.\nCooking.\nAfter the preparation, the lutefisk is saturated with water and must therefore be cooked extremely carefully so that it does not fall to pieces.\nTo create a firm consistency in lutefisk, it is common to spread a layer of salt over the fish about half an hour before it is cooked, to leach some of the water out of the fish meat. The salt must be rinsed off before cooking.\nLutefisk does not need additional water for cooking; it is sufficient to place it in a pan, salt it, seal the lid tightly, and let it steam on a very low heat for 20\u201325 minutes. An alternative is to wrap it in aluminium foil and bake at 225\u00a0\u00b0C (435\u00a0\u00b0F) for 40\u201350 minutes. Another option is to parboil lutefisk, wrapped in cheesecloth, until tender. Lutefisk can also be boiled in water, or cooked in a microwave oven. The typical microwave cooking time for a whole fish, supplied as a package of two sides, is 8 to 10 minutes at high power in a covered dish, depending upon oven power.\nEating.\nLutefisk is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, mashed green peas, melted butter and small pieces of fried bacon.\nIn Norway, Sweden and Finland, lutefisk is a part of the Christmas tradition and is mostly eaten with boiled potatoes, green peas and white sauce. Regional variations include a sprinkle of freshly ground allspice or black pepper and the addition of coarsely ground mustard in the white sauce (in Scania). In parts of J\u00e4mtland it is served on flatbread with whey cheese.\nIn the United States, lutefisk is often served with a variety of side dishes, including bacon, peas, pea stew, potatoes, lefse, gravy, mashed rutabaga, white sauce, melted or clarified butter, syrup, and geitost, or \"old\" cheese (gammelost). It is sometimes eaten with meatballs, which is not traditional in Scandinavia. Side dishes vary greatly from family to family and region to region, and can be a source of jovial contention when eaters of different traditions of lutefisk dine together.\nThe taste of well-prepared lutefisk is very mild, and the white sauce is often spiced with pepper or other strong-tasting spices. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, this method (seasoned with allspice) is common among Swedish-Americans, while Norwegian-Americans often prefer to eat it unseasoned with melted butter or cream sauce.\nModern consumption.\nLutefisk as a Christmas season meal has gained attention in Norway over the past 20 years. The Norwegian Seafood Export Council indicated sales of lutefisk to restaurants and catering companies in Norway increased by 72% between 2005 and 2008. A 2005 survey found 20% of Norwegians ate lutefisk during the Christmas holiday season, although only 3% would consider it for their Christmas dinner.\nMadison, Minnesota, US has dubbed itself the \"lutefisk capital of the world\" as well as claiming the largest per capita consumption of lutefisk in Minnesota. St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota serves lutefisk during their Christmas Festival concerts.\nLutefisk is eaten in Canada, which has a relatively large population of Scandinavian heritage particularly in the traditionally agricultural, western inland provinces. As of 2016, there were about 463,000 Norwegian Canadians, 350,000 Swedish Canadians, 207,000 Danish Canadians and 143,000 Finnish Canadians. Organizations such as the Sons of Norway hold annual lutefisk dinners. Lutefisk is sometimes available in specialty stores and supermarkets where there are large Scandinavian populations. Kingman, Alberta proclaims itself on its greeting sign to be the \"Lutefisk capital of Alberta.\"\nFolklore.\nAn article in \"Smithsonian\" magazine quotes some oft-rendered tall tales regarding the origins of the dish:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; A legend has it that Viking fishermen hung their cod to dry on tall birch racks. When some neighboring Vikings attacked, they burned the racks of fish, but a rainstorm blew in from the North Sea, dousing the fire. The remaining fish soaked in a puddle of rainwater and birch ash for months before some hungry Vikings discovered the cod, reconstituted it and had a feast.\nJokes and humor about lutefisk have been cited as prevalent among Scandinavian-Americans, such as \"I have tried lutefisk twice, once going down, and another time coming back up.\"\nThe Season 3 \"King of the Hill\" episode \"Revenge of the Lutefisk\" features a plot where a new minister, Karen Stroup (Mary Tyler Moore), brings a dish of lutefisk to church to share a \"Minnesotan tradition\" in Texas. Bobby Hill secretly eats all the lutefisk, then has bad diarrhea in the church bathroom the next morning. To hide the smell, he lights a match and tosses the match in the garbage, thus accidentally burning the church down, which Stroup perceives as arson and a hate crime.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for playing graceful, noble, and dignified women in period and war dramas, she quickly rose to popularity during the Golden Age of Hollywood. A top-star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM), Garson was among the most popular stars of the 1940s, becoming one of the highest paid actresses in the United States and Britain. From 1942 to 1946, Garson was consistently ranked by the \"Motion Picture Herald\" as one of America\u2019s top box-office draws. \nOriginally a stage and television actress in her native England, Garson signed a film contract in 1937 with Louis B. Mayer, the then-president of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). She found early critical success with her debut film, \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1939), which earned her her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Following career-elevating performances in the romantic comedy \"Remember?\" (1939) and the period drama \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1940), Garson starred in a string of commercial and critical successes that earned her a record five consecutive Academy Award nominations for \"Blossoms in the Dust\" (1941), \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), \"Madame Curie\" (1943), \"Mrs. Parkington\" (1944), and \"The Valley of Decision\" (1945). She won once for \"Mrs. Miniver\", the highest grossing film of 1942. \nBy the late 1940s, Garson\u2019s career had begun to decline, though she remained somewhat prominent in film. Her successes during this period include the romantic drama \"Adventure\" (1946), the romantic comedy \"Julia Misbehaves\" (1948), and the Shakespeare adaptation of \"Julius Caesar\" (1953). She made a brief comeback in 1960 for portraying first lady Eleanor Roosevelt in the film \"Sunrise at Campobello,\" for which she earned her final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She made sporadic appearances in film until her death in 1996. \nGarson received numerous accolades throughout her career. She garnered seven Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, the fourth most-nominated woman, and received a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960, and in 1993, Queen Elizabeth II recognised Garson's achievements by investing her as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nEarly life.\nGreer Garson was born on 29 September 1904 in Manor Park, East Ham (then in Essex, now part of Greater London), the only child of Nancy Sophia \"Nina\" (n\u00e9e Greer; 1880\u20131958) and George Garson (1865\u20131906), a commercial clerk in a London importing business. Her father was born in London to Scottish parents, and her mother was born at Drumalore (usually spelled as \"Drumalure\" or \"Drumaloor\"), a townland near Belturbet in County Cavan, Ireland. The name Greer is a contraction of MacGregor, another family name.\nHer maternal grandfather, David Greer (c. 1848\u20131913; from Kilrea, County Londonderry), was an RIC sergeant later stationed in Castlewellan, County Down. In the 1870s or 1880s, he became a land steward to the wealthy Annesley family, who built the town of Castlewellan. While there, he lived in a large detached house named Clairemount, which was built on the lower part of what was known as Pig Street, locally known as the Back Way, near Shilliday's builder's yard. It was erroneously reported Greer Garson was born there (\"The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia\" gives her place of birth as County Down, and her year of birth as 1908).\nGarson read French and 18th-century literature at King's College London and did her postgraduate studies at the University of Grenoble. While aspiring to be an actress, she was appointed head of the research library of LINTAS in the marketing department of Lever Brothers. Her co-worker there, George Sanders, wrote in his autobiography that it was Garson who suggested he start a career in acting.\nCareer.\nGarson's early professional appearances were on stage, starting at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in January 1932, when she was age 27. She appeared on television during its earliest years (the late 1930s), most notably starring in a 30-minute production of an excerpt of \"Twelfth Night\" in May 1937, with Dorothy Black. These live transmissions were part of the BBC's pioneering television service from Alexandra Palace, and this is the first known instance of a Shakespeare play performed on television. In 1936, she appeared in the West End in Charles Bennett's play \"Page From a Diary\", and No\u00ebl Coward's play \"Mademoiselle\".\nLouis B. Mayer discovered Garson while he was in London looking for new talent. Garson was signed to a contract with MGM in late 1937. The actress suffered a back injury during her first 18 months at MGM while waiting for a role Mayer deemed worthy of her, and she nearly was cut from her contract.\nShe began work on \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\", her first film, in late 1938, and she received her first Oscar nomination for the role. She received critical acclaim the next year for her role as Elizabeth Bennet in the 1940 film \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nGarson starred with Joan Crawford in \"When Ladies Meet\", a 1941 poorly received and sanitized re-make of a pre-Code 1933 film of the same name, which had starred Ann Harding and Myrna Loy. The same year, she became a major box-office star with the sentimental Technicolor drama \"Blossoms in the Dust\", which brought her the first of five consecutive Best Actress Oscar nominations, tying Bette Davis's record from 1938 to 1942, which still stands.\nGarson starred in two Oscar-nominated films in 1942: \"Mrs. Miniver\" and \"Random Harvest\". She won Best Actress for her performance as a strong British wife and mother protecting the homefront during the Second World War in \"Mrs. Miniver\", which co-starred Walter Pidgeon. The \"Guinness Book of World Records\" credited her with the longest Oscar acceptance speech, at five minutes and 30 seconds, after which the Academy Awards instituted a time limit. Garson held this record until it was surpassed by Adrien Brody's speech at the 97th Academy Awards, eighty-two years later.\nIn \"Random Harvest\" she co-starred with Ronald Colman. The drama received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Colman and Best Picture. The American Film Institute ranked it #36 on its list of 100 Greatest Love Stories of All Time, and it was one of Garson's favorite films.\nGarson also received Oscar nominations for her performances in the films \"Madame Curie\" (1943), \"Mrs. Parkington\" (1944), and \"The Valley of Decision\" (1945). She frequently co-starred with Walter Pidgeon, ultimately making eight pictures with him: \"Blossoms in the Dust\" (1941), \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), \"Madame Curie\", \"Mrs. Parkington\", \"Julia Misbehaves\" (1948), \"That Forsyte Woman\" (1949), \"The Miniver Story\" (1950), and \"Scandal at Scourie\" (1953).\nGarson starred with Clark Gable after his return from war service in \"Adventure\" (1945). The film was advertised with the catch-phrase \"Gable's back, and Garson's got him!\" Gable argued for \"He Put the Arson in Garson\"; she countered with \"She Put the Able in Gable!\"; thereafter, the safer catchphrase was selected.\nShe injured her back again while filming \"Desire Me\" in Monterey on 26 April 1946 when a wave knocked her and co-star Richard Hart from the rocks where they were rehearsing. A local fisherman and a film extra rescued Garson from the surf and potential undertow. She was bruised and in shock, and she required by doctors to rest for several days. The injury to her back required several surgeries over the coming years.\nGarson's popularity declined somewhat in the late 1940s, but she remained a prominent film star until the mid-1950s. In 1951, she became a naturalised citizen of the United States. She made only a few films after her MGM contract expired in 1954. In 1958, she received a warm reception on Broadway in \"Auntie Mame\", replacing Rosalind Russell, who had gone back to Hollywood to make the film version. In 1960, Garson received her seventh and final Oscar nomination for \"Sunrise at Campobello\", playing Eleanor Roosevelt.\nGreer was a special guest on an episode of the TV series \"Father Knows Best\", playing herself. On 4 October 1956, Garson appeared with Reginald Gardiner as the first two guest stars of the series in the premiere of \"The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford\". She appeared as a mystery guest on \"What's My Line\" on 25 October 1953 and again on 6 April 1958 to promote her appearance on stage in \"Auntie Mame\". She also served as a panelist rather than a guest on the \"What's My Line\" episode that aired on 12 May 1957.\nShe returned to MGM for a role in \"The Singing Nun\" (1966), starring Debbie Reynolds. Her last film appearance was in the 1967 Walt Disney feature \"The Happiest Millionaire\", and she made infrequent television appearances afterward. In 1968, she narrated the children's television special \"The Little Drummer Boy\". Her final role for television was in a 1982 episode of \"The Love Boat\".\nPersonal life.\nGarson was married three times. Her first marriage, on 28 September 1933, was to Edward Alec Abbot Snelson (1904\u20131992), later Sir Edward, a British civil servant who became a noted judge and expert in Indian affairs. After a honeymoon in Germany, he returned to his appointment at Nagpur, a town in central India, and she chose to return to her mother and the theatre in Britain. Snelson reportedly grieved at losing her and would watch multiple screenings of any film of hers that played in Nagpur. The marriage was not formally dissolved until 1943.\nHer second marriage, on 24 July 1943, was to Richard Ney (1916\u20132004), a young actor who had played her son in \"Mrs. Miniver\". The relationship was under constant scrutiny owing to their 12-year age difference. MGM claimed that Garson was merely three years older than Ney and tried to portray them as a happy couple, but the marriage was troubled. They divorced in 1947, after several attempts at reconciliation. Ney eventually became a stock-market analyst, financial consultant, and author.\nHer third marriage in 1949 was to E.E. \"Buddy\" Fogelson (1900\u20131987), a millionaire oilman and horse breeder. In 1967, the couple retired to their Forked Lightning Ranch in New Mexico. They purchased the US Hall of Fame champion Thoroughbred Ack Ack from the estate of Harry F. Guggenheim in 1971, and were successful as breeders. They also maintained a home in Dallas, where Garson funded the Greer Garson Theatre at Southern Methodist University. She founded a permanent endowment for the Fogelson Honors Forum at Texas Christian University (TCU), Buddy Fogelson's alma mater, in nearby Fort Worth.\nIn 1951, Garson became a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States. She was a registered Republican, and in 1966, she was asked to run for Congress on the Republican ticket against Democrat Earle Cabell but declined. She was a devout Presbyterian.\nDuring her later years, Garson was recognised for her philanthropy and civic leadership. She donated several million dollars for the construction of the Greer Garson Theatre at both the Santa Fe University of Art and Design and at Southern Methodist University's Meadows School of the Arts on three conditions: 1) the stages be circular 2) the premiere production be \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and 3) they have large ladies' rooms.\nDeath.\nGarson lived her final years in a penthouse suite at the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, where she died from heart failure on 6 April 1996. She was 91. She is interred beside her husband in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas.\nHonours.\nGarson received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University in 1991.\nIn 1993, Queen Elizabeth II recognised Garson's achievements by investing her as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\nGarson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960 located at 1651 Vine Street in Los Angeles.\nAwards and nominations.\nGarson won an Academy Award out of 7 nominations for Best Actress, including the most consecutive nominations, from 1941 to 1945, tied with Bette Davis.\nGarson was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain. Consequently it is classified as a non-polar, aliphatic \u03b1-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as ) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as ). It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesized metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG).\nThe -isomer of alanine (left-handed) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. -alanine is second only to -leucine in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. The right-handed form, -alanine, occurs in peptides in some bacterial cell walls (in peptidoglycan) and in some peptide antibiotics, and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte.\nHistory and etymology.\nAlanine was first synthesized in 1850 when Adolph Strecker combined acetaldehyde and ammonia with hydrogen cyanide. The amino acid was named \"Alanin\" in German, in reference to aldehyde, with the interfix \"-an-\" for ease of pronunciation, the German ending \"-in\" used in chemical compounds being analogous to English \"-ine\".\nStructure.\nAlanine is an aliphatic amino acid, because the side-chain connected to the \u03b1-carbon atom is a methyl group (-CH3). Alanine is the simplest \u03b1-amino acid after glycine. The methyl side-chain of alanine is non-reactive and is therefore hardly ever directly involved in protein function. Alanine is a nonessential amino acid, meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats.\nSources.\nBiosynthesis.\nAlanine can be synthesized from pyruvate and branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine.\nAlanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate, a two-step process. In the first step, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine, consuming one reducing equivalent. Because transamination reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate is present in all cells, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle.\nChemical synthesis.\n-Alanine is produced industrially by decarboxylation of -aspartate by the action of aspartate 4-decarboxylase. Fermentation routes to -alanine are complicated by alanine racemase.\nRacemic alanine can be prepared by the condensation of acetaldehyde with ammonium chloride in the presence of sodium cyanide by the Strecker reaction,\nor by the ammonolysis of 2-bromopropanoic acid. \nDegradation.\nAlanine is broken down by oxidative deamination, the inverse reaction of the reductive amination reaction described above, catalyzed by the same enzymes. The direction of the process is largely controlled by the relative concentration of the substrates and products of the reactions involved.\nAlanine world hypothesis.\nAlanine is one of the twenty canonical \u03b1-amino acids used as building blocks (monomers) for the ribosome-mediated biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is believed to be one of the earliest amino acids to be included in the genetic code standard repertoire. \nOn the basis of this fact the \"alanine world\" hypothesis was proposed. This hypothesis explains the evolutionary choice of amino acids in the repertoire of the genetic code from a chemical point of view. In this model the selection of monomers (i.e. amino acids) for ribosomal protein synthesis is rather limited to those alanine derivatives that are suitable for building \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet secondary structural elements. Dominant secondary structures in life as we know it are \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets and most canonical amino acids can be regarded as chemical derivatives of alanine. Therefore, most canonical amino acids in proteins can be exchanged with alanine by point mutations while the secondary structure remains intact. The fact that alanine mimics the secondary structure preferences of the majority of the encoded amino acids is practically exploited in alanine scanning mutagenesis. In addition, classical X-ray crystallography often employs the polyalanine-backbone model to determine three-dimensional structures of proteins using molecular replacement\u2014a model-based phasing method.\nPhysiological function.\nGlucose\u2013alanine cycle.\nIn mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose\u2013alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and \u03b1-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and is broken down by glutamate dehydrogenase into \u03b1-ketoglutarate and ammonium, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea which is excreted through the kidneys.\nThe glucose\u2013alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from muscle and safely transported to the liver. Once there, pyruvate is used to regenerate glucose, after which the glucose returns to muscle to be metabolized for energy: this moves the energetic burden of gluconeogenesis to the liver instead of the muscle, and all available ATP in the muscle can be devoted to muscle contraction. It is a catabolic pathway, and relies upon protein breakdown in the muscle tissue. Whether and to what extent it occurs in non-mammals is unclear.\nLink to diabetes.\nAlterations in the alanine cycle that increase the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are linked to the development of type II diabetes.\nChemical properties.\nAlanine is useful in loss of function experiments with respect to phosphorylation. Some techniques involve creating a library of genes, each of which has a point mutation at a different position in the area of interest, sometimes even every position in the whole gene: this is called \"scanning mutagenesis\". The simplest method, and the first to have been used, is so-called alanine scanning, where every position in turn is mutated to alanine.\nHydrogenation of alanine gives the amino alcohol alaninol, which is a useful chiral building block.\nFree radical.\nThe deamination of an alanine molecule produces the free radical CH3C\u2022HCO2\u2212. Deamination can be induced in solid or aqueous alanine by radiation that causes homolytic cleavage of the carbon\u2013nitrogen bond.\nThis property of alanine is used in dosimetric measurements in radiotherapy. When normal alanine is irradiated, the radiation causes certain alanine molecules to become free radicals, and, as these radicals are stable, the free radical content can later be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in order to find out how much radiation the alanine was exposed to. This is considered to be a biologically relevant measure of the amount of radiation damage that living tissue would suffer under the same radiation exposure. Radiotherapy treatment plans can be delivered in test mode to alanine pellets, which can then be measured to check that the intended pattern of radiation dose is correctly delivered by the treatment system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The -isomer of aspartic acid is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins. \n-aspartic acid is one of two -amino acids commonly found in mammals. Apart from a few rare exceptions, -aspartic acid is not used for protein synthesis but is incorporated into some peptides and plays a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator.\nLike all other amino acids, aspartic acid contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its \u03b1-amino group is in the protonated \u2013NH form under physiological conditions, while its \u03b1-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, \u2212COO\u2212. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed. It is encoded by the codons GAU and GAC.\nIn proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form asx turns or asx motifs, which frequently occur at the N-termini of alpha helices.\nAspartic acid, like glutamic acid, is classified as an acidic amino acid, with a pKa of 3.9; however, in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment, and could be as high as 14.\nThe one-letter code D for aspartate was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic aspar\"D\"ic acid.\nDiscovery.\nAspartic acid was first discovered in 1827 by Auguste-Arthur Plisson and \u00c9tienne-Ossian Henry by hydrolysis of asparagine, which had been isolated from asparagus juice in 1806. Their original method used lead hydroxide, but various other acids or bases are now more commonly used instead.\nForms and nomenclature.\nThere are two forms or enantiomers of aspartic acid. The name \"aspartic acid\" can refer to either enantiomer or a mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, \"-aspartic acid\", is directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, \"-aspartic acid\" are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will produce both forms, \"-aspartic acid\", known as a racemic mixture.\nSynthesis.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn the human body, aspartate is most frequently synthesized through the transamination of oxaloacetate. The biosynthesis of aspartate is facilitated by an aminotransferase enzyme: the transfer of an amine group from another molecule such as alanine or glutamine yields aspartate and an alpha-keto acid.\nChemical synthesis.\nIndustrially, aspartate is produced by amination of fumarate catalyzed by L-aspartate ammonia-lyase.\nRacemic aspartic acid can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate,\n(C6H4(CO)2NC(CO2Et)2).\nMetabolism.\nIn plants and microorganisms, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including four that are essential for humans: methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and lysine. The conversion of aspartate to these other amino acids begins with reduction of aspartate to its semialdehyde, O2CCH(NH2)CH2CHO. Asparagine is derived from aspartate via transamidation:\n\u2212O2CCH(NH2)CH2CO2\u2212 + \"G\"C(O)NH3+ \u2192 O2CCH(NH2)CH2CONH3+ + \"G\"C(O)O\nOther biochemical roles.\nAspartate has many other biochemical roles. It is a metabolite in the urea cycle and participates in gluconeogenesis. It carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and oxaloacetate, which is the oxidized (dehydrogenated) derivative of malic acid. Aspartate donates one nitrogen atom in the biosynthesis of inosine, the precursor to the purine bases. In addition, aspartic acid acts as a hydrogen acceptor in a chain of ATP synthase. Dietary L-aspartic acid has been shown to act as an inhibitor of Beta-glucuronidase, which serves to regulate enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and bile acids.\nNeurotransmitter.\nAspartate (the conjugate base of aspartic acid) stimulates NMDA receptors, though not as strongly as the amino acid neurotransmitter L-glutamate does. Aspartate is the \"A\" in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor).\nApplications &amp; market.\nIn 2014, the global market for aspartic acid was or about $117 million annually. The three largest market segments include the U.S., Western Europe, and China. Current applications include biodegradable polymers (polyaspartic acid), low calorie sweeteners (aspartame), scale and corrosion inhibitors, and resins.\nSuperabsorbent polymers.\nOne area of aspartic acid market growth is biodegradable superabsorbent polymers (SAP), and hydrogels. Around 75% of superabsorbent polymers are used in disposable diapers and an additional 20% is used for adult incontinence and feminine hygiene products. Polyaspartic acid, the polymerization product of aspartic acid, is a biodegradable substitute to polyacrylate.\nAdditional uses.\nIn addition to SAP, aspartic acid has applications in the fertilizer industry, where polyaspartate improves water retention and nitrogen uptake.\nSources.\nDietary sources.\nAspartic acid is not an essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates in humans, and does not need to be present in the diet. In eukaryotic cells, roughly 1 in 20 amino acids incorporated into a protein is an aspartic acid, and accordingly almost any source of dietary protein will include aspartic acid. Additionally, aspartic acid is found in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a non-essential nutrient for humans, meaning that the human body can synthesize enough for its use. It is also the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons.\nIts molecular formula is C5H9NO4. Glutamic acid exists in two optically isomeric forms; the dextrorotatory L-form is usually obtained by hydrolysis of gluten or from the waste waters of beet-sugar manufacture or by fermentation. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC\u2212CH(NH2)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COOH, with two carboxyl groups \u2212COOH and one amino group \u2212NH2. However, in the solid state and mildly acidic water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH3+)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG.\nThe acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH3+)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COO\u2212. This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation. This anion creates the savory \"umami\" flavor of foods and is found in glutamate flavorings such as monosodium glutamate (MSG). In Europe, it is classified as food additive E620. In highly alkaline solutions the doubly negative anion \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH2)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COO\u2212 prevails. The radical corresponding to glutamate is called glutamyl.\nThe one-letter symbol E for glutamate was assigned as the letter following D for aspartate, as glutamate is larger by one methylene \u2013CH2\u2013 group.\nChemistry.\nIonization.\nWhen glutamic acid is dissolved in water, the amino group (\u2212NH2) may gain a proton (H+), and/or the carboxyl groups may lose protons, depending on the acidity of the medium.\nIn sufficiently acidic environments, both carboxyl groups are protonated and the molecule becomes a cation with a single positive charge, HOOC\u2212CH(NH3+)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COOH.\nAt pH values between about 2.5 and 4.1, the carboxylic acid closer to the amine generally loses a proton, and the acid becomes the neutral zwitterion \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH3+)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COOH. This is also the form of the compound in the crystalline solid state. The change in protonation state is gradual; the two forms are in equal concentrations at pH 2.10.\nAt even higher pH, the other carboxylic acid group loses its proton and the acid exists almost entirely as the glutamate anion \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH3+)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COO\u2212, with a single negative charge overall. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 4.07. This form with both carboxylates lacking protons is dominant in the physiological pH range (7.35\u20137.45).\nAt even higher pH, the amino group loses the extra proton, and the prevalent species is the doubly-negative anion \u2212OOC\u2212CH(NH2)\u2212(CH2)2\u2212COO\u2212. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 9.47.\nOptical isomerism.\nGlutamic acid is chiral; two mirror-image enantiomers exist: d(\u2212), and l(+). The l form is more widely occurring in nature, but the d form occurs in some special contexts, such as the bacterial capsule and cell walls of the bacteria (which produce it from the l form with the enzyme glutamate racemase) and the liver of mammals.\nHistory.\nAlthough they occur naturally in many foods, the flavor contributions made by glutamic acid and other amino acids were only scientifically identified early in the 20th century. The substance was discovered and identified in the year 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. In 1908, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda of the Tokyo Imperial University identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of kombu broth as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced the novel flavor he detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor umami. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate.\nSynthesis.\nIndustrial synthesis.\nGlutamic acid is produced on the largest scale of any amino acid, with an estimated annual production of about 1.5 million tons in 2006. Chemical synthesis was supplanted by the aerobic fermentation of sugars and ammonia in the 1950s, with the organism \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\" (also known as \"Brevibacterium flavum\") being the most widely used for production. Isolation and purification can be achieved by concentration and crystallization; it is also widely available as its hydrochloride salt.\nFunction and uses.\nMetabolism.\nGlutamate is a key compound in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is transamination, in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an \u03b1-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a transaminase. The reaction can be generalised as such:\n R1-amino acid + R2-\u03b1-ketoacid \u21cc R1-\u03b1-ketoacid + R2-amino acid\nA very common \u03b1-keto acid is \u03b1-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Transamination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting \u03b1-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows:\n alanine + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc pyruvate + glutamate\n aspartate + \u03b1-ketoglutarate \u21cc oxaloacetate + glutamate\nBoth pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle.\nGlutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste nitrogen. Glutamate undergoes deamination, an oxidative reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase, as follows:\n glutamate + H2O + NADP+ \u2192 \u03b1-ketoglutarate + NADPH + NH3 + H+\nAmmonia (as ammonium) is then excreted predominantly as urea, synthesised in the liver. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea.\nGlutamate is also a neurotransmitter (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as glioma or glioblastoma exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene IDH1.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nNeurotransmitter.\nGlutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger the release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors. In the opposing postsynaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor or the AMPA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain. The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, and other parts of the brain. Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission. In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development as originally described by Mark Mattson.\nBrain nonsynaptic glutamatergic signaling circuits.\nExtracellular glutamate in \"Drosophila\" brains has been found to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor clustering, via a process involving receptor desensitization. A gene expressed in glial cells actively transports glutamate into the extracellular space, while, in the nucleus accumbens-stimulating group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, this gene was found to reduce extracellular glutamate levels. This raises the possibility that this extracellular glutamate plays an \"endocrine-like\" role as part of a larger homeostatic system.\nGABA precursor.\nGlutamate also serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). GABA-ergic neurons are identified (for research purposes) by revealing its activity (with the autoradiography and immunohistochemistry methods) which is most abundant in the cerebellum and pancreas.\nStiff person syndrome is a neurologic disorder caused by anti-GAD antibodies, leading to a decrease in GABA synthesis and, therefore, impaired motor function such as muscle stiffness and spasm. Since the pancreas has abundant GAD, a direct immunological destruction occurs in the pancreas and the patients will have diabetes mellitus.\nFlavor enhancer.\nGlutamic acid, being a constituent of protein, is present in foods that contain protein, but it can only be tasted when it is present in an unbound form. Significant amounts of free glutamic acid are present in a wide variety of foods, including cheeses and soy sauce, and glutamic acid is responsible for umami, one of the five basic tastes of the human sense of taste. Glutamic acid often is used as a food additive and flavor enhancer in the form of its sodium salt, known as monosodium glutamate (MSG).\nNutrient.\nAll meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and kombu are excellent sources of glutamic acid. Some protein-rich plant foods also serve as sources. 30% to 35% of gluten (much of the protein in wheat) is glutamic acid. Ninety-five percent of the dietary glutamate is metabolized by intestinal cells in a first pass.\nPlant growth.\nAuxigro is a plant growth preparation that contains 30% glutamic acid.\nNMR spectroscopy.\nIn recent years, there has been much research into the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A glutamic acid derivative, poly-\u03b3-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG), is often used as an alignment medium to control the scale of the dipolar interactions observed.\nGlutamate and aging.\nBrain glutamate levels tend to decline with age, and may be a useful as a marker of age-related diseases of the brain.\nPharmacology.\nThe drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP or 'Angel Dust') antagonizes glutamic acid non-competitively at the NMDA receptor. For the same reasons, dextromethorphan and ketamine also have strong dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. Acute infusion of the drug eglumetad (also known as eglumegad or LY354740), an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3) resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in bonnet macaques (\"Macaca radiata\"); chronic oral administration of eglumetad in those animals led to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels (approximately 50 percent) in comparison to untreated control subjects. Eglumetad has also been demonstrated to act on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) of human adrenocortical cells, downregulating aldosterone synthase, CYP11B1, and the production of adrenal steroids (i.e. aldosterone and cortisol). Glutamate does not easily pass the blood brain barrier, but, instead, is transported by a high-affinity transport system. It can also be converted into glutamine.\nGlutamate toxicity can be reduced by antioxidants, and the psychoactive principle of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the non psychoactive principle cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids, is found to block glutamate neurotoxicity with a similar potency, and thereby potent antioxidants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2013NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2013COO\u2212 form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC.\nHistidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from \"hist\u00f3s\" \"tissue\". It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl.\nProperties of the imidazole side chain.\nAt neutral or physiological pH, the imidazole side chain is neutral. The imidazole side chain in histidine has a p\"K\"a of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated and carries a positive +1 charge (as described by the Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogen atoms and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen atom, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH group is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as N\u03b5 (or N\u03c4, tau meaning \"tele\" \u2014 far) and N\u03b4 (or N\u03c0, pi meaning \"pros\" \u2014 near), are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation.\nThe acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme.\nThe tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited \u03c0* states of the aromatic ring. At pH &gt; 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm.\nLigand.\nHistidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper \"Atheris squamigera\" have been shown to bind Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases.\nN-terminal histidines are known to function as bidentate ligands, with a metal (generally copper) bound to both the amine of the N-terminus and the N\u03b4 of the histidine; the N\u03b5 is often methylated. Although recently discovered, this \"histidine brace\" motif is critical in biogeochemical cycles: it functions as the active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which break down unreactive polysaccharides such as cellulose. It is proposed that the evolution of these enzymes in fungi corresponds to the first widespread ability to decompose woody plant mass, leading to the end of the Carboniferous era and its mass accumulation of coal deposits.\nMetabolism.\nBiosynthesis.\nl-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized \"de novo\" in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as \"E. coli\". Histidine synthesis in \"E. coli\" involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway.\nHistidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine.\nThe histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus \"Neurospora crassa\", and a gene (\"His-3\") encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the \"His4\" gene of the bacterium \"E. coli\". A genetic study of \"N. crassa\" histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the \"His-3\" genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole.\nLike animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. But unlike animals, microorganisms and plants can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms.\nRegulation of biosynthesis.\nThis pathway requires energy in order to occur; therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition, meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine.\nDegradation.\nHistidine can be metabolized into glutamate, which is readily metabolized into AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate), making histidine one of the amino acids whose metabolites can become citric acid cycle intermediates. The process requires several steps. In prokaryotes, histidine first undergoes deamination, the removal of its amino group by the emzyme histidase. This step produces ammonia and urocanic acid (urocanate). The enzyme urocanase then converts urocanic acid into imidazolonepropionate (4-imidazolone-5-propionate). The enzyme imidazolonepropionase then converts imidazolonepropionate into formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The enzyme formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase removes the formimino group (which is transferred to tetrahydrofolate), leaving behind a glutamate molecule. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form \u03b1-ketoglutarate.\nRequirements.\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For histidine, for adults 19 years and older, 14\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day. Supplemental histidine is being investigated for use in a variety of different conditions, including neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH form under biological conditions), an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA.\nMetabolism.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:\nCatabolism.\nIsoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids.\nMetabolic diseases.\nThe degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:\nInsulin resistance.\nIsoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index.\nFunctions and requirement.\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily.\nBeside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form.\nGenetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins.\nMany animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish.\nSynthesis.\nRoutes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin.\nDiscovery.\nGerman chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lysine contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and a side chain (which is partially protonated when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and so it is classified as a basic, charged (in water at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is encoded by the codons AAA and AAG. Like almost all other amino acids, the \u03b1-carbon is chiral and lysine may refer to either enantiomer or a racemic mixture of both. For the purpose of this article, lysine will refer to the biologically active enantiomer -lysine, where the \u03b1-carbon is in the \"S\" configuration. \nThe human body cannot synthesize lysine. It is essential in humans and must therefore be obtained from the diet. In organisms that synthesise lysine, two main biosynthetic pathways exist, the diaminopimelate and \u03b1-aminoadipate pathways, which employ distinct enzymes and substrates and are found in diverse organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway.\nLysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. The \u03b5-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding and as a general base in catalysis. The \u03b5-ammonium group () is attached to the fourth carbon from the \u03b1-carbon, which is attached to the carboxyl () group.\nDue to its importance in several biological processes, a lack of lysine can lead to several disease states including defective connective tissues, impaired fatty acid metabolism, anaemia, and systemic protein-energy deficiency. In contrast, an overabundance of lysine, caused by ineffective catabolism, can cause severe neurological disorders.\nLysine was first isolated by the German biological chemist Ferdinand Heinrich Edmund Drechsel in 1889 from hydrolysis of the protein casein, and thus named it Lysin, from el \" \"\u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (lysis)\"\u00a0'loosening'. In 1902, the German chemists Emil Fischer and Fritz Weigert determined lysine's chemical structure by synthesizing it.\nThe one-letter symbol K was assigned to lysine for being alphabetically nearest, with L being assigned to the structurally simpler leucine, and M to methionine.\nBiosynthesis.\nTwo pathways have been identified in nature for the synthesis of lysine. The diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway belongs to the aspartate derived biosynthetic family, which is also involved in the synthesis of threonine, methionine and isoleucine, whereas the \u03b1-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway is part of the glutamate biosynthetic family.\nDAP pathway.\nThe DAP pathway is found in both prokaryotes and plants and begins with the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) (E.C 4.3.3.7) catalysed condensation reaction between the aspartate derived, -aspartate semialdehyde, and pyruvate to form (4\"S\")-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2\"S\")-dipicolinic acid (HTPA). The product is then reduced by dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR) (E.C 1.3.1.26), with NAD(P)H as a proton donor, to yield 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDP). From this point on, four pathway variations have been found, namely the acetylase, aminotransferase, dehydrogenase, and succinylase pathways. Both the acetylase and succinylase variant pathways use four enzyme catalysed steps, the aminotransferase pathway uses two enzymes, and the dehydrogenase pathway uses a single enzyme. These four variant pathways converge at the formation of the penultimate product, \"meso\"\u2011diaminopimelate, which is subsequently enzymatically decarboxylated in an irreversible reaction catalysed by diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) (E.C 4.1.1.20) to produce -lysine. The DAP pathway is regulated at multiple levels, including upstream at the enzymes involved in aspartate processing as well as at the initial DHDPS catalysed condensation step. Lysine imparts a strong negative feedback loop on these enzymes and, subsequently, regulates the entire pathway.\nAAA pathway.\nThe AAA pathway involves the condensation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA via the intermediate AAA for the synthesis of -lysine. This pathway has been shown to be present in several yeast species, as well as protists and higher fungi. It has also been reported that an alternative variant of the AAA route has been found in \"Thermus thermophilus\" and \"Pyrococcus horikoshii\", which could indicate that this pathway is more widely spread in prokaryotes than originally proposed. The first and rate-limiting step in the AAA pathway is the condensation reaction between acetyl-CoA and \u03b1\u2011ketoglutarate catalysed by homocitrate-synthase (HCS) (E.C 2.3.3.14) to give the intermediate homocitryl\u2011CoA, which is hydrolysed by the same enzyme to produce homocitrate. Homocitrate is enzymatically dehydrated by homoaconitase (HAc) (E.C 4.2.1.36) to yield \"cis\"-homoaconitate. HAc then catalyses a second reaction in which \"cis\"-homoaconitate undergoes rehydration to produce homoisocitrate. The resulting product undergoes an oxidative decarboxylation by homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HIDH) (E.C 1.1.1.87) to yield \u03b1\u2011ketoadipate. AAA is then formed via a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase (PLP-AT) (E.C 2.6.1.39), using glutamate as the amino donor. From this point on, the AAA pathway varies with [something is missing here ? -&gt; at the very least, section header! ] on the kingdom. In fungi, AAA is reduced to \u03b1\u2011aminoadipate-semialdehyde via AAA reductase (E.C 1.2.1.95) in a unique process involving both adenylation and reduction that is activated by a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (E.C 2.7.8.7). Once the semialdehyde is formed, saccharopine reductase (E.C 1.5.1.10) catalyses a condensation reaction with glutamate and NAD(P)H, as a proton donor, and the imine is reduced to produce the penultimate product, saccharopine. The final step of the pathway in fungi involves the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) (E.C 1.5.1.8) catalysed oxidative deamination of saccharopine, resulting in -lysine. In a variant AAA pathway found in some prokaryotes, AAA is first converted to \"N\"\u2011acetyl-\u03b1-aminoadipate, which is phosphorylated and then reductively dephosphorylated to the \u03b5-aldehyde. The aldehyde is then transaminated to \"N\"\u2011acetyllysine, which is deacetylated to give -lysine. However, the enzymes involved in this variant pathway need further validation.\nCatabolism.\nAs with all amino acids, catabolism of lysine is initiated from the uptake of dietary lysine or from the breakdown of intracellular protein. Catabolism is also used as a means to control the intracellular concentration of free lysine and maintain a steady-state to prevent the toxic effects of excessive free lysine. There are several pathways involved in lysine catabolism but the most commonly used is the saccharopine pathway, which primarily takes place in the liver (and equivalent organs) in animals, specifically within the mitochondria. This is the reverse of the previously described AAA pathway. In animals and plants, the first two steps of the saccharopine pathway are catalysed by the bifunctional enzyme, \u03b1-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which possess both lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) (E.C 1.5.1.8) and SDH activities, whereas in other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, both of these enzymes are encoded by separate genes. The first step involves the LKR catalysed reduction of -lysine in the presence of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to produce saccharopine, with NAD(P)H acting as a proton donor. Saccharopine then undergoes a dehydration reaction, catalysed by SDH in the presence of NAD+, to produce AAS and glutamate. AAS dehydrogenase (AASD) (E.C 1.2.1.31) then further dehydrates the molecule into AAA. Subsequently, PLP-AT catalyses the reverse reaction to that of the AAA biosynthesis pathway, resulting in AAA being converted to \u03b1-ketoadipate. The product, \u03b1\u2011ketoadipate, is decarboxylated in the presence of NAD+ and coenzyme A to yield glutaryl-CoA, however the enzyme involved in this is yet to be fully elucidated. Some evidence suggests that the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc), which is structurally homologous to the E1 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) (E.C 1.2.4.2), is responsible for the decarboxylation reaction. Finally, glutaryl-CoA is oxidatively decarboxylated to crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (E.C 1.3.8.6), which goes on to be further processed through multiple enzymatic steps to yield acetyl-CoA; an essential carbon metabolite involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).\nNutritional value.\nLysine is an essential amino acid in humans. The human daily nutritional requirement varies from ~60\u00a0mg/kg in infancy to ~30\u00a0mg/kg in adults. This requirement is commonly met in a western society with the intake of lysine from meat and vegetable sources well in excess of the recommended requirement. In vegetarian diets, the intake of lysine is less due to the limited quantity of lysine in cereal crops compared to meat sources.\nGiven the limiting concentration of lysine in cereal crops, it has long been speculated that the content of lysine can be increased through genetic modification practices. Often these practices have involved the intentional dysregulation of the DAP pathway by means of introducing lysine feedback-insensitive orthologues of the DHDPS enzyme. These methods have met limited success likely due to the toxic side effects of increased free lysine and indirect effects on the TCA cycle. Plants accumulate lysine and other amino acids in the form of seed storage proteins, found within the seeds of the plant, and this represents the edible component of cereal crops. This highlights the need to not only increase free lysine, but also direct lysine towards the synthesis of stable seed storage proteins, and subsequently, increase the nutritional value of the consumable component of crops. While genetic modification practices have met limited success, more traditional selective breeding techniques have allowed for the isolation of \"Quality Protein Maize\", which has significantly increased levels of lysine and tryptophan, also an essential amino acid. This increase in lysine content is attributed to an \"opaque-2\" mutation that reduced the transcription of lysine-lacking zein-related seed storage proteins and, as a result, increased the abundance of other proteins that are rich in lysine. Commonly, to overcome the limiting abundance of lysine in livestock feed, industrially produced lysine is added. The industrial process includes the fermentative culturing of \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\" and the subsequent purification of lysine.\nDietary sources.\nGood sources of lysine are high-protein foods such as eggs, meat (specifically red meat, lamb, pork, and poultry), soy, beans and peas, cheese (particularly Parmesan), and certain fish (such as cod and sardines). Lysine is the limiting amino acid (the essential amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the particular foodstuff) in most cereal grains, but is plentiful in most pulses (legumes). Beans contain the lysine that maize lacks, and in the human archeological record beans and maize often appear together, as in the Three Sisters: beans, maize, and squash.\nA food is considered to have sufficient lysine if it has at least 51\u00a0mg of lysine per gram of protein (so that the protein is 5.1% lysine). -lysine HCl is used as a dietary supplement, providing 80.03% -lysine. As such, 1\u00a0g of -lysine is contained in 1.25\u00a0g of -lysine HCl.\nBiological roles.\nThe most common role for lysine is proteinogenesis. Lysine frequently plays an important role in protein structure. Since its side chain contains a positively charged group on one end and a long hydrophobic carbon tail close to the backbone, lysine is considered somewhat amphipathic. For this reason, lysine can be found buried as well as more commonly in solvent channels and on the exterior of proteins, where it can interact with the aqueous environment. Lysine can also contribute to protein stability as its \u03b5-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding, salt bridges and covalent interactions to form a Schiff base.\nA second major role of lysine is in epigenetic regulation by means of histone modification. There are several types of covalent histone modifications, which commonly involve lysine residues found in the protruding tail of histones. Modifications often include the addition or removal of an acetyl (\u2212CH3CO) forming acetyllysine or reverting to lysine, up to three methyl (\u2212CH3), ubiquitin or a sumo protein group. The various modifications have downstream effects on gene regulation, in which genes can be activated or repressed.\nLysine has also been implicated to play a key role in other biological processes including; structural proteins of connective tissues, calcium homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Lysine has been shown to be involved in the crosslinking between the three helical polypeptides in collagen, resulting in its stability and tensile strength. This mechanism is akin to the role of lysine in bacterial cell walls, in which lysine (and \"meso\"-diaminopimelate) are critical to the formation of crosslinks, and therefore, stability of the cell wall. This concept has previously been explored as a means to circumvent the unwanted release of potentially pathogenic genetically modified bacteria. It was proposed that an auxotrophic strain of \"Escherichia coli\" (X1776) could be used for all genetic modification practices, as the strain is unable to survive without the supplementation of DAP, and thus, cannot live outside of a laboratory environment. Lysine has also been proposed to be involved in calcium intestinal absorption and renal retention, and thus, may play a role in calcium homeostasis. Finally, lysine has been shown to be a precursor for carnitine, which transports fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they can be oxidised for the release of energy. Carnitine is synthesised from trimethyllysine, which is a product of the degradation of certain proteins, as such lysine must first be incorporated into proteins and be methylated prior to being converted to carnitine. However, in mammals the primary source of carnitine is through dietary sources, rather than through lysine conversion.\nIn opsins like rhodopsin and the visual opsins (encoded by the genes OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW), retinaldehyde forms a Schiff base with a conserved lysine residue, and interaction of light with the retinylidene group causes signal transduction in color vision (See visual cycle for details).\nDisputed roles.\nThere has been a long discussion that lysine, when administered intravenously or orally, can significantly increase the release of growth hormones. This has led to athletes using lysine as a means of promoting muscle growth while training, however, no significant evidence to support this application of lysine has been found to date.\nBecause herpes simplex virus (HSV) proteins are richer in arginine and poorer in lysine than the cells they infect, lysine supplements have been tried as a treatment. Since the two amino acids are taken up in the intestine, reclaimed in the kidney, and moved into cells by the same amino acid transporters, an abundance of lysine would, in theory, limit the amount of arginine available for viral replication. Clinical studies do not provide good evidence for effectiveness as a prophylactic or in the treatment for HSV outbreaks. In response to product claims that lysine could improve immune responses to HSV, a review by the European Food Safety Authority found no evidence of a cause\u2013effect relationship. The same review, published in 2011, found no evidence to support claims that lysine could lower cholesterol, increase appetite, contribute to protein synthesis in any role other than as an ordinary nutrient, or increase calcium absorption or retention.\nRoles in disease.\nDiseases related to lysine are a result of the downstream processing of lysine, i.e., the incorporation into proteins or modification into alternative biomolecules. The role of lysine in collagen has been outlined above, however, a lack of lysine and hydroxylysine involved in the crosslinking of collagen peptides has been linked to a disease state of the connective tissue. As carnitine is a key lysine-derived metabolite involved in fatty acid metabolism, a substandard diet lacking sufficient carnitine and lysine can lead to decreased carnitine levels, which can have significant cascading effects on an individual's health. Lysine has also been shown to play a role in anaemia, as lysine is suspected to have an effect on the uptake of iron and, subsequently, the concentration of ferritin in blood plasma. However, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated. Most commonly, lysine deficiency is seen in non-western societies and manifests as protein-energy malnutrition, which has profound and systemic effects on the health of the individual. There is also a hereditary genetic disease that involves mutations in the enzymes responsible for lysine catabolism, namely the bifunctional AASS enzyme of the saccharopine pathway. Due to a lack of lysine catabolism, the amino acid accumulates in plasma and patients develop hyperlysinaemia, which can present as asymptomatic to severe neurological disabilities, including epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity, and psychomotor impairment. The clinical significance of hyperlysinemia is the subject of debate in the field with some studies finding no correlation between physical or mental disabilities and hyperlysinemia. In addition to this, mutations in genes related to lysine metabolism have been implicated in several disease states, including pyridoxine-dependent epilepsia (ALDH7A1 gene), \u03b1-ketoadipic and \u03b1-aminoadipic aciduria (DHTKD1 gene), and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GCDH gene).\nHyperlysinuria is marked by high amounts of lysine in the urine. It is often due to a metabolic disease in which a protein involved in the breakdown of lysine is non functional due to a genetic mutation. It may also occur due to a failure of renal tubular transport.\nUse of lysine in animal feed.\nLysine production for animal feed is a major global industry, reaching in 2009 almost 700,000 tons for a market value of over \u20ac1.22\u00a0billion. Lysine is an important additive to animal feed because it is a limiting amino acid when optimizing the growth of certain animals such as pigs and chickens for the production of meat. Lysine supplementation allows for the use of lower-cost plant protein (maize, for instance, rather than soy) while maintaining high growth rates, and limiting the pollution from nitrogen excretion. In turn, however, phosphate pollution is a major environmental cost when corn is used as feed for poultry and swine.\nLysine is industrially produced by microbial fermentation, from a base mainly of sugar. Genetic engineering research is actively pursuing bacterial strains to improve the efficiency of production and allow lysine to be made from other substrates. The most common bacteria used is Corynebacterium glutamicum specially mutagenized or gene-engineered to produce lysine, but analogous strains of Escherichia coli are also employed.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\", which is based on the 1990 novel \"Jurassic Park\" by Michael Crichton, features dinosaurs that were genetically altered so that they could not produce lysine, an example of engineered auxotrophy. This was known as the \"lysine contingency\" and was supposed to prevent the cloned dinosaurs from surviving outside the park, forcing them to depend on lysine supplements provided by the park's veterinary staff. In reality, no animal can produce lysine; it is an essential amino acid.\nIn 1996, lysine became the focus of a price-fixing case, the largest in United States history. The Archer Daniels Midland Company paid a fine of US$100\u00a0million, and three of its executives were convicted and served prison time. Also found guilty in the price-fixing case were two Japanese firms (Ajinomoto, Kyowa Hakko) and a South Korean firm (Sewon). Secret video recordings of the conspirators fixing lysine's price can be found online or by requesting the video from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. This case gave the basis for the book \"The Informant: A True Story\", and the movie \"The Informant!\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Leucine is an \u03b1-amino acid, meaning it contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH3+ form under biological conditions), an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, and beans and other legumes. It is encoded by the codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. Leucine is named after the Greek word for \"white\": \"\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\" (\"leuk\u00f3s\", \"white\"), after its common appearance as a white powder, a property it shares with many other amino acids. \nLike valine and isoleucine, leucine is a branched-chain amino acid. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans.\nLeucine and \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyric acid, a minor leucine metabolite, exhibit pharmacological activity in humans and have been demonstrated to promote protein biosynthesis via the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR).\nDietary leucine.\nAs a food additive, L-leucine has the E number E641 and is classified as a flavor enhancer.\nRequirements.\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For leucine, for adults 19 years and older, 42\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day.\nHealth effects.\nAs a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats. However, results of comparative studies are conflicted. Long-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men. More studies are needed, preferably ones based on an objective, random sample of society. Factors such as lifestyle choices, age, gender, diet, exercise, etc. must be factored into the analyses to isolate the effects of supplemental leucine as a stand-alone, or if taken with other branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Until then, dietary supplemental leucine cannot be associated as the prime reason for muscular growth or optimal maintenance for the entire population.\nBoth L-leucine and D-leucine protect mice against epileptic seizures. D-leucine also terminates seizures in mice after the onset of seizure activity, at least as effectively as diazepam and without sedative effects. Decreased dietary intake of L-leucine lessens adiposity in mice. High blood levels of leucine are associated with insulin resistance in humans, mice, and rodents. This might be due to the effect of leucine to stimulate mTOR signaling. Dietary restriction of leucine and the other BCAAs can reverse diet-induced obesity in wild-type mice by increasing energy expenditure, and can restrict fat mass gain of hyperphagic rats.\nSafety.\nLeucine toxicity, as seen in decompensated maple syrup urine disease, causes delirium and neurologic compromise, and can be life-threatening.\nA high intake of leucine may cause or exacerbate symptoms of pellagra in people with low niacin status because it interferes with the conversion of L-tryptophan to niacin.\nLeucine at a dose exceeding 500\u00a0mg/kg/d was observed with hyperammonemia. As such, unofficially, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for leucine in healthy adult men can be suggested at 500\u00a0mg/kg/d or 35 g/d under acute dietary conditions.\nPharmacology.\nPharmacodynamics.\nLeucine is a dietary amino acid with the capacity to directly stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis. This effect of leucine results from its role as an activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates protein biosynthesis and cell growth. The activation of mTOR by leucine is mediated through Rag GTPases, leucine binding to leucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucine binding to sestrin 2, and possibly other mechanisms.\nMetabolism in humans.\nLeucine metabolism occurs in many tissues in the human body; however, most dietary leucine is metabolized within the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. Adipose and muscle tissue use leucine in the formation of sterols and other compounds. Combined leucine use in these two tissues is seven times greater than in the liver.\nA small fraction of metabolism\u00a0\u2013 less than\u00a05% in all tissues except the testes, where it accounts for about\u00a033%\u00a0\u2013 is initially catalyzed by leucine aminomutase, producing \u03b2-leucine, which is subsequently metabolized into \u03b2-ketoisocaproate (\u03b2-KIC), \u03b2-ketoisocaproyl-CoA, and then acetyl-CoA by a series of uncharacterized enzymes.\nSynthesis in nonhuman organisms.\nLeucine is an essential amino acid in the diet of animals because they lack the complete enzyme pathway to synthesize it \"de novo\" from potential precursor compounds. Consequently, they must ingest it, usually as a component of proteins. Plants and microorganisms synthesize leucine from pyruvic acid with a series of enzymes:\nSynthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid valine also includes the initial part of this pathway.\nChemistry.\nLeucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) since it possesses an aliphatic side chain that is not linear.\nRacemic leucine had been subjected to circularly polarized synchrotron radiation to better understand the origin of biomolecular asymmetry. An enantiomeric enhancement of 2.6% had been induced, indicating a possible photochemical origin of biomolecules' homochirality.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis, a fever may occur; symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis, weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.\nThe two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are a gallstone blocking the common bile duct after the pancreatic duct has joined; and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis, these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.\nAcute pancreatitis is usually treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. For patients with severe pancreatitis who cannot tolerate normal oral food consumption, a nasogastric tube is placed in the stomach. A procedure known as an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to examine the distal common bile duct and remove a gallstone if present. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, in addition to the above, temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. Occasionally, surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.\nGlobally, in 2015 about 8.9 million cases of pancreatitis occurred. This resulted in 132,700 deaths, up from 83,000 deaths in 1990. Acute pancreatitis occurs in about 30 per 100,000 people a year. New cases of chronic pancreatitis develop in about 8 per 100,000 people a year and currently affect about 50 per 100,000 people in the United States. It is more common in men than women. Often chronic pancreatitis starts between the ages of 30 and 40 and is rare in children. Acute pancreatitis was first described on autopsy in 1882 while chronic pancreatitis was first described in 1946.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal or left upper quadrant burning pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting that is worse with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of internal bleeding. Blood pressure may be elevated by pain or decreased by dehydration or bleeding. Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated. The abdomen is usually tender but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease, bowel sounds may be reduced from reflex bowel paralysis. Fever or jaundice may be present. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of pancreatic enzymes hindering digestion.\nComplications.\nEarly complications include shock, infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and dehydration. Blood loss, dehydration, and fluid leaking into the abdominal cavity (ascites) can lead to kidney failure. Respiratory complications are often severe. Pleural effusion is usually present. Shallow breathing from pain can lead to lung collapse. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing inflammation. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome, further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen to relieve the pressure.\nLate complications include recurrent pancreatitis and the development of pancreatic pseudocysts\u2014collections of pancreatic secretions that have been walled off by scar tissue. These may cause pain, become infected, rupture and bleed, block the bile duct and cause jaundice, or migrate around the abdomen. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis can lead to a pancreatic abscess, a collection of pus caused by necrosis, liquefaction, and infection. This happens in approximately 3% of cases or almost 60% of cases involving more than two pseudocysts and gas in the pancreas.\nCauses.\nAbout 80 percent of pancreatitis cases are caused by gallstones or alcohol. Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the bile duct) are the single most common cause of acute pancreatitis, and alcoholism is the single most common cause of chronic pancreatitis. Serum triglyceride levels greater than 1000\u00a0mg/dL (11.29\u00a0mmol/L, i.e. hyperlipidemia) is another cause.\nThe mnemonic \"GET SMASHED\" is often used to help clinicians and medical students remember the common causes of pancreatitis: Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune, Scorpion sting, Hyperlipidemia, hypothermia or hyperparathyroidism, ERCP, Drugs (commonly azathioprine, valproic acid, liraglutide).\nMedications.\nThere are seven classes of medications associated with acute pancreatitis: statins, ACE inhibitors, oral contraceptives/hormone replacement therapy (HRT), diuretics, antiretroviral therapy, valproic acid, and oral hypoglycemic agents. Mechanisms of these drugs causing pancreatitis are not known exactly, but it is possible that statins have direct toxic effect on the pancreas or through the long-term accumulation of toxic metabolites. Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors cause angioedema of the pancreas through the accumulation of bradykinin. Birth control pills and HRT cause arterial thrombosis of the pancreas through the accumulation of fat (hypertriglyceridemia). Diuretics such as furosemide have a direct toxic effect on the pancreas. Meanwhile, thiazide diuretics cause hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia, where the latter is the risk factor for pancreatic stones.\nHIV infection itself can cause a person to be more likely to get pancreatitis. Meanwhile, antiretroviral drugs may cause metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia, which predisposes to pancreatitis. Valproic acid may have direct toxic effect on the pancreas. Various oral hypoglycemic agents are associated with pancreatitis including metformin, but glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetics such as exenatide are more strongly associated with pancreatitis by promoting inflammation in combination with a high-fat diet.\nAtypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.\nInfection.\nA number of infectious agents have been recognized as causes of pancreatitis including:\nOther.\nOther common causes include trauma, autoimmune disease, high blood calcium, hypothermia, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Pancreas divisum is a common congenital malformation of the pancreas that may underlie some recurrent cases. Diabetes mellitus type\u00a02 is associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk.\nLess common causes include pancreatic cancer, pancreatic duct stones, vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels in the pancreas), and porphyria\u2014particularly acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria.\nThere is an inherited form that results in the activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas, leading to autodigestion. Involved genes may include trypsin 1, which codes for trypsinogen, SPINK1, which codes for a trypsin inhibitor, or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.\nDiagnosis.\nThe differential diagnosis for pancreatitis includes but is not limited to cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis, and mesenteric ischemia.\nDiagnosis requires 2 of the 3 following criteria:\nAmylase and lipase are 2 enzymes produced by the pancreas. Elevations in lipase are generally considered a better indicator for pancreatitis as it has greater specificity and has a longer half life. However, both enzymes can be elevated in other disease states. In chronic pancreatitis, the fecal pancreatic elastase-1 (FPE-1) test is a marker of exocrine pancreatic function. Additional tests that may be useful in evaluating chronic pancreatitis include hemoglobin A1C, immunoglobulin G4, rheumatoid factor, and anti-nuclear antibody.\nFor imaging, abdominal ultrasound is convenient, simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive. It is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis from gallstones than other imaging modalities. However, in 25\u201335% of patients the view of the pancreas can be obstructed by bowel gas making it difficult to evaluate.\nA contrast-enhanced CT scan is usually performed more than 48 hours after the onset of pain to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis and extrapancreatic fluid as well as predict the severity of the disease. CT scanning earlier can be falsely reassuring.\nERCP or an endoscopic ultrasound can also be used if a biliary cause for pancreatitis is suspected.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether the diagnosis is for the mild form of the condition, which typically resolves without treatment, or the severe form, which can cause serious complications. Patients with mild AP should still be hospitalized, at least briefly, to receive IV fluids and for clinical monitoring purposes.\nPain management.\nAcute pancreatitis typically presents with severe to extreme abdominal pain. While the mildest cases of pancreatitis may be managed exclusively with NSAIDs (which are preferred in such scenarios due to the anti-inflammatory effects and the better safety profile), most patients with pancreatitis require heavy opioid regimens for pain therapy. Severe cases often require continuous IV infusions of opioid medications. It is appropriate for emergent cases of pancreatitis to be treated with these medications immediately, rather than attempting to control the pain with lesser medications first.\nThe early use of strong pain management therapies does not affect the ability for the physician to diagnose the cause of severe abdominal pain. Thus, pain management should not be reduced or withheld for the purposes of diagnosis in cases of suspected pancreatitis.\nFluid resuscitation.\nRegardless of disease severity, moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation is advisable for all patients with acute pancreatitis, especially if they can be diagnosed and treated early in the course of the disease. The preferred fluid for administration is lactated Ringer solution, but saline may also be used. Patients with acute pancreatitis of any severity are typically hypovolemic (decreased blood volume), and this hypovolemia can result in hypoperfusion of pancreatic cells. Without blood supplying them, the pancreatic cells can become necrotic, resulting in tissue death that can become further worsened by the strong inflammatory response that occurs following necrosis.\nManaging infection.\nInfection is a major cause of mortality in patients with pancreatitis, and these patients are prone to infections in a variety of organ systems. The majority of patients with pancreatitis have damage to the gut barrier, allowing gut bacteria to bypass this barrier and cause infection. Some species of gut bacteria are also known to detect pancreatitis and respond by releasing their own pro-inflammatory molecules. Conversely, a healthy microbiome is beneficial for preventing infection, and several gut bacteria are known to augment human immune defenses and reduce systemic inflammation.\nMild acute pancreatitis.\nThe treatment of mild acute pancreatitis is successfully carried out by admission to a general hospital ward for fluid resuscitation and patient monitoring. Traditionally, people were not allowed to eat until the inflammation resolved but more recent evidence suggests early feeding is safe and improves outcomes and may result in an ability to leave the hospital sooner, and guidelines have been updated to recommend early feeding for patients able to tolerate it.\nOpioids may be used for the pain. When the pancreatitis is due to gallstones, or even for patients without gallstones and no other identifiable cause, early gallbladder removal also appears to improve outcomes.\nSevere acute pancreatitis.\nSevere pancreatitis can cause organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people will need to be admitted to a high-dependency unit or intensive care unit. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a rapid and severe reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as hypovolemic shock. This condition represents a major life threat and may be prevented in some cases by prompt and aggressive fluid resuscitation.\nPatients with severe AP are often unable to receive oral nutrition, and so nasogastric feeding tubes are commonly used for these patients. Feeding tubes may be used to provide calories and nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia. Early enteral feeding within 48 hours of admission to the hospital has been associated with better outcomes.\nThe lungs can be inflamed as a result of the systemic inflammatory response and can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Supplemental oxygen is frequently required in the treatment of severe AP, and a patient may be given anything from supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, to full mechanical ventilation. In many cases, even the most intensive respiratory therapies are not enough, and many patients with severe pancreatitis die as a result of respiratory failure.\nAs with mild pancreatitis, it will be necessary to treat the underlying cause\u2014gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. There is also evidence that, even for patients without gallstones, surgical removal of the gallbladder may reduce the risk of recurrence, and as of 2024, guidelines recommend the procedure for any patient with severe pancreatitis with no clear cause.\nIf the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, many doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Patients whose pancreatitis can be linked to alcoholism are known to have a much higher risk of recurrence.\nPrognosis.\nSevere acute pancreatitis has mortality rates around 2\u20139%, higher where necrosis of the pancreas has occurred.\nSeveral scoring systems are used to predict the severity of an attack of pancreatitis. They each combine demographic and laboratory data to estimate severity or probability of death. Examples include APACHE\u00a0II, Ranson, BISAP, and Glasgow. The Modified Glasgow criteria suggests that a case be considered severe if at least three of the following are true:\nThis can be remembered using the mnemonic PANCREAS:\nThe BISAP score (blood urea nitrogen level &gt;25\u00a0mg/dL (8.9\u00a0mmol/L), impaired mental status, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, age over 60 years, pleural effusion) has been validated as similar to other prognostic scoring systems.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally the incidence of acute pancreatitis is 5 to 35 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence of chronic pancreatitis is 4\u20138 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 26\u201342 cases per 100,000. In 2013 pancreatitis resulted in 123,000 deaths up from 83,000 deaths in 1990.\nCosts.\nIn adults in the United Kingdom, the estimated average total direct and indirect costs of chronic pancreatitis is roughly \u00a379,000 per person on an annual basis. Acute recurrent pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis occur infrequently in children, but are associated with high healthcare costs due to substantial disease burden. Globally, the estimated average total cost of treatment for children with these conditions is approximately $40,500/person/year.\nOther animals.\nFatty foods may cause canine pancreatitis in dogs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH form under biological conditions), an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological conditions), and a side chain carboxamide, classifying it as a polar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. It is encoded by the codons AAU and AAC.\nThe one-letter symbol N for asparagine was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic asparagi\"N\"e;\nHistory.\nAsparagine was first isolated in 1806 in a crystalline form by French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet (then a young assistant). It was isolated from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant, hence the chosen name. It was the first amino acid to be isolated.\nThree years later, in 1809, Pierre Jean Robiquet identified a substance from liquorice root with properties which he qualified as very similar to those of asparagine, and which Plisson identified in 1828 as asparagine itself.\nThe determination of asparagine's structure required decades of research. The empirical formula for asparagine was first determined in 1833 by the French chemists Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Boutron Charlard and Th\u00e9ophile-Jules Pelouze; in the same year, the German chemist Justus Liebig provided a more accurate formula. In 1846 the Italian chemist Raffaele Piria treated asparagine with nitrous acid, which removed the molecule's amine (\u2013NH2) groups and transformed asparagine into malic acid. This revealed the molecule's fundamental structure: a chain of four carbon atoms. Piria thought that asparagine was a diamide of malic acid; however, in 1862 the German chemist Hermann Kolbe showed that this surmise was wrong; instead, Kolbe concluded that asparagine was an amide of an amine of succinic acid. In 1886, the Italian chemist Arnaldo Piutti (1857\u20131928) discovered a mirror image or \"enantiomer\" of the natural form of asparagine, which shared many of asparagine's properties, but which also differed from it. Since the structure of asparagine was still not fully known \u2013 the location of the amine group within the molecule was still not settled \u2013 Piutti synthesized asparagine and thus published its true structure in 1888.\nStructural function in proteins.\nSince the asparagine side-chain can form hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagine residues are often found near the beginning of alpha-helices as asx turns and asx motifs, and in similar turn motifs, or as amide rings, in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as \"capping\" the hydrogen bond interactions that would otherwise be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone.\nAsparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. Typically, a carbohydrate tree can solely be added to an asparagine residue if the latter is flanked on the C side by X-serine or X-threonine, where X is any amino acid with the exception of proline.\nAsparagine can be hydroxylated in the HIF1 hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. This modification inhibits HIF1-mediated gene activation.\nSources.\nDietary sources.\nAsparagine is not essential for humans, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates and is not required in the diet.\nAsparagine is found in:\nBiosynthesis and catabolism.\nThe precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate, which a transaminase enzyme converts to aspartate. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing \u03b1-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. Asparagine synthetase uses ATP to activate aspartate, forming \u03b2-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group, which reacts with \u03b2-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP.\nIn reaction that is the reverse of its biosynthesis, asparagine is hydrolyzed to aspartate by asparaginase. Aspartate then undergoes transamination to form glutamate and oxaloacetate from alpha-ketoglutarate. Oxaloacetate, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).\nAcrylamide controversy.\nHeating a mixture of asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food. These products occur in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and toasted bread. Acrylamide is converted in the liver to glycidamide, which is a possible carcinogen.\nFunction.\nAsparagine synthetase is required for normal development of the brain. Asparagine is also involved in protein synthesis during replication of poxviruses.\nThe addition of \"N\"-acetylglucosamine to asparagine is performed by oligosaccharyltransferase enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum. This glycosylation is involved in protein structure and function.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG. It is named after glutamic acid, which in turn is named after its discovery in cereal proteins, gluten.\nIn human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid.\nThe dietary sources of glutamine include especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso.\nThe one-letter symbol Q for glutamine was assigned in alphabetical sequence to N for asparagine, being larger by merely one methylene \u2013CH2\u2013 group. Note that P was used for proline, and O was avoided due to similarity with D. The mnemonic \"Q\"lutamine was also proposed.\nFunctions.\nGlutamine plays a role in a variety of biochemical functions:\nRoles in metabolism.\nGlutamine maintains redox balance by participating in glutathione synthesis and contributing to anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis by reductive carboxylation.\nGlutamine provides a source of carbon and nitrogen for use in other metabolic processes. Glutamine is present in serum at higher concentrations than other amino acids and is essential for many cellular functions. Examples include the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids. One of the most important functions of glutamine is its ability to be converted into \u03b1-KG, which helps to maintain the flow of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP via the electron carriers NADH and FADH2. The highest consumption of glutamine occurs in the cells of the intestines, kidney cells (where it is used for acid-base balance), activated immune cells, and many cancer cells.\nProduction.\nGlutamine is produced industrially using mutants of \"Brevibacterium flavum\", which gives ca. 40 g/L in 2 days using glucose as a carbon source.\nBiosynthesis.\nGlutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. The majority of glutamine production occurs in muscle tissue, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. Although the liver is capable of glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than productive, as the liver takes up glutamine derived from the gut via the hepatic portal system.\nUses.\nNutrition.\nGlutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, nonessential amino acid in the human body, and one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Humans obtain glutamine through catabolism of proteins in foods they eat. In states where tissue is being built or repaired, like growth of babies, or healing from wounds or severe illness, glutamine becomes conditionally essential.\nSickle cell disease.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved -glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder.\nThe safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful crises within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac (sickle cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median 4), fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral powder also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent).\nCommon side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain.\nL-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc.\nMedical food.\nGlutamine is marketed as medical food and is prescribed when a medical professional believes a person in their care needs supplementary glutamine due to metabolic demands beyond what can be met by endogenous synthesis or diet.\nSafety.\nGlutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. Although glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, their concentrations are not increased much, and no adverse neurological effects were detected. The observed safe level for supplemental -glutamine in normal healthy adults is 14 g/day.\nAdverse effects of glutamine have been described for people receiving home parenteral nutrition and those with liver-function abnormalities.\nAlthough glutamine has no effect on the proliferation of tumor cells, it is still possible that glutamine supplementation may be detrimental in some cancer types.\nCeasing glutamine supplementation in people adapted to very high consumption may initiate a withdrawal effect, raising the risk of health problems such as infections or impaired integrity of the intestine.\nStructure.\nGlutamine can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, -glutamine and -glutamine. The -form is found in nature. Glutamine contains an \u03b1-amino group which is in the protonated \u2212NH3+ form under biological conditions and a carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions.\nResearch.\nGlutamine supplementation was investigated for its possible effects in critically ill people or after abdominal surgery, but the low quality of research prevented conclusions about any effect. Supplementation does not appear to have an effect in infants with significant stomach or intestinal disorders.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63550", "revid": "16185333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63550", "title": "Arginine", "text": "Amino acid\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nArginine is the amino acid with the formula (H2N)(HN)CN(H)(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. The molecule features a guanidino group appended to a standard amino acid framework. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (\u2212CO2\u2212) and both the amino and guanidino groups are protonated, resulting in a cation. Only the l-arginine (symbol Arg or R) enantiomer is found naturally. Arg residues are common components of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. The guanidine group in arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Like all amino acids, it is a white, water-soluble solid.\nThe one-letter symbol R was assigned to arginine for its phonetic similarity in English.\nHistory.\nArginine was first isolated in 1886 from yellow lupin seedlings by the German chemist Ernst Schulze and his assistant Ernst Steiger. He named it from the Greek \"\u00e1rgyros\" (\u1f04\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"silver\" due to the silver-white appearance of arginine nitrate crystals. In 1897, Schulze and Ernst Winterstein (1865\u20131949) determined the structure of arginine. Schulze and Winterstein synthesized arginine from ornithine and cyanamide in 1899, but some doubts about arginine's structure lingered until S\u00f8rensen's synthesis of 1910.\nSources.\nProduction.\nIt is traditionally obtained by hydrolysis of various sources of protein, such as gelatin. It is obtained commercially by fermentation. In this way, 25-35 g/liter can be produced, using glucose as a carbon source.\nDietary sources.\nArginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline. Additional, dietary arginine is necessary for otherwise healthy individuals temporarily under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury or sepsis, or if either of the major sites of arginine biosynthesis, the small intestine and kidneys, have reduced function, because the small bowel does the first step of the synthesizing process and the kidneys do the second.\nArginine is an essential amino acid for birds, as they do not have a urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which need to be processed through the urea cycle, and if not enough arginine is present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.\nAnimal sources of arginine include meat, dairy products, and eggs, and plant sources include seeds of all types, for example grains, beans, and nuts.\nBiosynthesis.\nArginine is synthesized from citrulline in the urea cycle by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.\nThe pathways linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.\nArginine is made by the body as follows. The epithelial cells of the small intestine produce citrulline, primarily from glutamine and glutamate, which is secreted into the bloodstream which carries it to the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract the citrulline and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the blood. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis and thus create a dietary requirement for arginine. For such a person, arginine would become \"essential\".\nSynthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline to nitric oxide (citrulline-NO) or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, nitric oxide synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in nitric oxide producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of nitric oxide breakdown.\nFunction.\nArginine plays an important role in cell division, wound healing, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. It is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), making it important in the regulation of blood pressure. Arginine is necessary for T-cells to function in the body, and can lead to their deregulation if depleted.\nProteins.\nArginine's side chain is amphipathic, because at physiological pH it contains a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, at the end of a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein.\nArginine residues in proteins can be deiminated by PAD enzymes to form citrulline, in a post-translational modification process called citrullination. This is important in fetal development, is part of the normal immune process, as well as the control of gene expression, but is also significant in autoimmune diseases. Another post-translational modification of arginine involves methylation by protein methyltransferases.\nPrecursor.\nArginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide, an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection.\nArginine is also a precursor for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate). The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as -arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.\nStructure.\nThe amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a guanidinium group, which has a p\"K\"a of 13.8, and is therefore always protonated and positively charged at physiological pH. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds.\nResearch.\nGrowth hormone.\nIntravenously administered arginine is used in growth hormone stimulation tests because it stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. A review of clinical trials concluded that oral arginine increases growth hormone, but decreases growth hormone secretion, which is normally associated with exercising. However, a more recent trial reported that although oral arginine increased plasma levels of -arginine it did not cause an increase in growth hormone.\nHerpes-Simplex Virus (Cold sores).\nResearch from 1964 into amino acid requirements of herpes simplex virus in human cells indicated that \"...the lack of arginine or histidine, and possibly the presence of lysine, would interfere markedly with virus synthesis\", but concludes that \"no ready explanation is available for any of these observations\".\nFurther reviews conclude that \"lysine's efficacy for herpes labialis may lie more in prevention than treatment.\" and that \"the use of lysine for decreasing the severity or duration of outbreaks\" is not supported, while further research is needed. A 2017 study concludes that \"clinicians could consider advising patients that there is a theoretical role of lysine supplementation in the prevention of herpes simplex sores but the research evidence is insufficient to back this. Patients with cardiovascular or gallbladder disease should be cautioned and warned of the theoretical risks.\"\nHigh blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis showed that -arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 2.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure.\nSupplementation with l-arginine reduces diastolic blood pressure and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high blood pressure as part of pre-eclampsia. It did not lower systolic blood pressure or improve weight at birth.\nSchizophrenia.\nBoth liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assays have found that brain tissue of deceased people with schizophrenia shows altered arginine metabolism. Assays also confirmed significantly reduced levels of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but increased agmatine concentration and glutamate/GABA ratio in the schizophrenia cases. Regression analysis indicated positive correlations between arginase activity and the age of disease onset and between L-ornithine level and the duration of illness. Moreover, cluster analyses revealed that L-arginine and its main metabolites L-citrulline, L-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which were altered in the schizophrenia group. Despite this, the biological basis of schizophrenia is still poorly understood, a number of factors, such as dopamine hyperfunction, glutamatergic hypofunction, GABAergic deficits, cholinergic system dysfunction, stress vulnerability and neurodevelopmental disruption, have been linked to the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the disease.\nRaynaud's phenomenon.\nOral L-arginine has been shown to reverse digital necrosis in Raynaud syndrome.\nSafety and potential drug interactions.\nL-arginine is recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day. L-arginine is found in many foods, such as fish, poultry, and dairy products, and is used as a dietary supplement. It may interact with various prescription drugs and herbal supplements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO- form under biological conditions), and a side chain consisting of a hydroxymethyl group, classifying it as a polar amino acid. It can be synthesized in the human body under normal physiological circumstances, making it a nonessential amino acid. It is encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC.\nOccurrence.\nThis compound is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. Only the -stereoisomer appears naturally in proteins. It is not essential to the human diet, since it is synthesized in the body from other metabolites, including glycine. Serine was first obtained from silk protein, a particularly rich source, in 1865 by Emil Cramer. Its name is derived from the Latin for silk, \"sericum\". Serine's structure was established in 1902.\nBiosynthesis.\nThe biosynthesis of serine starts with the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate (an intermediate from glycolysis) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and NADH by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC https://). Reductive amination (transamination) of this ketone by phosphoserine transaminase (EC https://) yields 3-phosphoserine (\"O\"-phosphoserine) which is hydrolyzed to serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (EC https://).\nIn bacteria such as \"E. coli\" these enzymes are encoded by the genes serA (EC 1.1.1.95), serC (EC 2.6.1.52), and serB (EC 3.1.3.3).\nSerine hydroxymethyltransferase (SMHT) also catalyzes the biosynthesis of glycine (retro-aldol cleavage) from serine, transferring the resulting formaldehyde synthon to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. However, that reaction is reversible, and will convert excess glycine to serine. SHMT is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme.\nSynthesis and reactions.\nIndustrially, -serine is produced from glycine and methanol catalyzed by hydroxymethyltransferase.\nRacemic serine can be prepared in the laboratory from methyl acrylate in several steps:\nHydrogenation of serine gives the diol serinol:\nBiological function.\nMetabolic.\nSerine is important in metabolism in that it participates in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. It is the precursor to several amino acids including glycine and cysteine, as well as tryptophan in bacteria. It is also the precursor to numerous other metabolites, including sphingolipids and folate, which is the principal donor of one-carbon fragments in biosynthesis.\nSignaling.\n-Serine, synthesized in neurons by serine racemase from -serine (its enantiomer), serves as a neuromodulator by coactivating NMDA receptors, making them able to open if they then also bind glutamate. -serine is a potent agonist at the glycine site (NR1) of canonical diheteromeric NMDA receptors. For the receptor to open, glutamate and either glycine or -serine must bind to it; in addition a pore blocker must not be bound (e.g. Mg2+ or Zn2+). Some research has shown that -serine is a more potent agonist at the NMDAR glycine site than glycine itself. However, D-serine has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of \"t\"-NMDA receptors through the glycine binding site on the GluN3 subunit.\nLigands.\n-serine was thought to exist only in bacteria until relatively recently; it was the second amino acid discovered to naturally exist in humans, present as a signaling molecule in the brain, soon after the discovery of -aspartate. Had amino acids been discovered in humans sooner, the glycine site on the NMDA receptor might instead be named the -serine site. Apart from central nervous system, -serine plays a signaling role in peripheral tissues and organs such as cartilage, kidney, and corpus cavernosum.\nGustatory sensation.\nPure -serine is an off-white crystalline powder with a very faint musty aroma. -Serine is sweet with an additional minor sour taste at medium and high concentrations.\nClinical significance.\nSerine deficiency disorders are rare defects in the biosynthesis of the amino acid -serine. At present three disorders have been reported:\nThese enzyme defects lead to severe neurological symptoms such as congenital microcephaly and severe psychomotor retardation and in addition, in patients with 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency to intractable seizures. These symptoms respond to a variable degree to treatment with -serine, sometimes combined with glycine.\nResponse to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, as well as for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD).\nBesides disruption of serine biosynthesis, its transport may also become disrupted. One example is spastic tetraplegia, thin corpus callosum, and progressive microcephaly, a disease caused by mutations that affect the function of the neutral amino acid transporter A.\nResearch for therapeutic use.\nThe classification of -serine as a non-essential amino acid has come to be considered as conditional, since vertebrates such as humans cannot always synthesize optimal quantities over entire lifespans. Safety of -serine has been demonstrated in an FDA-approved human phase I clinical trial with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01835782), but treatment of ALS symptoms has yet to be shown. A 2011 meta-analysis found adjunctive sarcosine to have a medium effect size for negative and total symptoms of schizophrenia. There also is evidence that \u2010serine could acquire a therapeutic role in diabetes.\n-Serine is being studied in rodents as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. -Serine also has been described as a potential biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, due to a relatively high concentration of it in the cerebrospinal fluid of probable AD patients. D-serine, which is made in the brain, has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of \"t\"-NMDA receptors mitigating neuron loss in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy.\n-Serine has been theorized as a potential treatment for sensorineural hearing disorders such as hearing loss and tinnitus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63552", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63552", "title": "Amylase", "text": "Class of enzymes\nAn amylase () is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch (Latin \"amylum\") into sugars. Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters. All amylases are glycoside hydrolases and act on \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bonds.\nClassification.\n\u03b1-Amylase.\nThe \u03b1-amylases (EC https://) (CAS 9014\u201371\u20135) (alternative names: 1,4-\u03b1--glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes. By acting at random locations along the starch chain, \u03b1-amylase breaks down long-chain saccharides, ultimately yielding either maltotriose and maltose from amylose, or maltose, glucose and \"limit dextrin\" from amylopectin. They belong to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (https://www.cazypedia.org/index.php/Glycoside_Hydrolase_Family_13).\nBecause it can act anywhere on the substrate, \u03b1-amylase tends to be faster-acting than \u03b2-amylase. In animals, it is a major digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7\u20137.0.\nIn human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are \u03b1-amylases.\nThe \u03b1-amylase form is also found in plants, fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and bacteria (\"Bacillus\").\n\u03b2-Amylase.\nAnother form of amylase, \u03b2-amylase (EC https://) (alternative names: 1,4-\u03b1--glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also synthesized by bacteria, fungi, and plants. Working from the non-reducing end, \u03b2-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units (maltose) at a time. During the ripening of fruit, \u03b2-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit. They belong to glycoside hydrolase family 14.\nBoth \u03b1-amylase and \u03b2-amylase are present in seeds; \u03b2-amylase is present in an inactive form prior to germination, whereas \u03b1-amylase and proteases appear once germination has begun. Many microbes also produce amylase to degrade extracellular starches. Animal tissues do not contain \u03b2-amylase, although it may be present in microorganisms contained within the digestive tract. The optimum pH for \u03b2-amylase is 4.0\u20135.0.\n\u03b3-Amylase.\n\u03b3-Amylase (EC https://) (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; \"exo\"-1,4-\u03b1-glucosidase; glucoamylase; lysosomal \u03b1-glucosidase; 1,4-\u03b1--glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave \u03b1(1\u20136) glycosidic linkages, as well as the last \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond at the nonreducing end of amylose and amylopectin, yielding glucose. The \u03b3-amylase has the most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3. They belong to a variety of different glycoside hydrolase families, such as glycoside hydrolase family 15 in fungi, glycoside hydrolase family 31 of human MGAM, and glycoside hydrolase family 97 of bacterial forms.\nUses.\nFermentation.\n\u03b1- and \u03b2-amylases are important in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch. In fermentation, yeast ingests sugars and excretes ethanol. In beer and some liquors, the sugars present at the beginning of fermentation have been produced by \"mashing\" grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes). In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a \"mash\", which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars. Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars. In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.\nIn some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva. This practice continues to be practiced in home production of some traditional drinks, such as chhaang in the Himalayas, chicha in the Andes and kasiri in Brazil and Suriname.\nFlour additive.\nAmylases are used in breadmaking and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of ethanol and carbon dioxide. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This is the reason for long fermented doughs such as sourdough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.\n\u03b1-Amylase is often listed as an ingredient on commercially package-milled flour. Bakers with long exposure to amylase-enriched flour are at risk of developing dermatitis or asthma.\nMolecular biology.\nIn molecular biology, the presence of amylase can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the structural gene for amylase, successful integration will disrupt the amylase gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through iodine staining.\nMedical uses.\nAmylase also has medical applications in the use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). It is one of the components in Sollpura (liprotamase) to help in the breakdown of saccharides into simple sugars.\nScientific uses.\nSalivary alpha-amylase serves as a biomarker for physiological stress. In response to sympathetic nervous system activity (for example due to a real-life stressor), the level of alpha-amylase in the saliva is known to increase; therefore, the amount of alpha-amylase in the saliva can inform researchers specifically about the sympathetic nervous system activity component of the stress response. Like with other biomarkers for stress, it is known that the salivary alpha-amylase response to stress is reduced in intensity in people with occupational burnout.\nOther uses.\nAn inhibitor of alpha-amylase, called phaseolamin, has been tested as a potential diet aid.\nWhen used as a food additive, amylase has E number E1100, and may be derived from pig pancreas or mold fungi.\nBacilliary amylase is also used in clothing and dishwasher detergents to dissolve starches from fabrics and dishes.\nFactory workers who work with amylase for any of the above uses are at increased risk of occupational asthma. Five to nine percent of bakers have a positive skin test, and a fourth to a third of bakers with breathing problems are hypersensitive to amylase.\nHyperamylasemia.\nBlood serum amylase may be measured for purposes of medical diagnosis. A higher than normal concentration may reflect any of several medical conditions, including acute inflammation of the pancreas (which may be measured concurrently with the more specific lipase), perforated peptic ulcer, torsion of an ovarian cyst, strangulation, ileus, mesenteric ischemia, macroamylasemia and mumps. Amylase may be measured in other body fluids, including urine and peritoneal fluid.\nA January 2007 study from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme could be used to indicate sleep deficits, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep.\nHistory.\nIn 1831, Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1800\u20131837) described the hydrolysis of starch by saliva, due to the presence of an enzyme in saliva, \"ptyalin\", an amylase. It was named after the Ancient Greek name for saliva: - .\nThe modern history of enzymes began in 1833, when French chemists Anselme Payen and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Persoz isolated an amylase complex from germinating barley and named it \"diastase\". It is from this term that all subsequent enzyme names tend to end in the suffix -ase.\nIn 1862, Russian biochemist Aleksandr Yakovlevich Danilevsky (1838\u20131923) separated pancreatic amylase from trypsin.\nEvolution.\nSalivary amylase.\nSaccharides are a food source rich in energy. Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme amylase before being cleaved further into sugars. Many mammals have seen great expansions in the copy number of the amylase gene. These duplications allow for the pancreatic amylase \"AMY2\" to re-target to the salivary glands, allowing animals to detect starch by taste and to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. This has happened independently in mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and most importantly, humans after the agricultural revolution.\nFollowing the agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago, human diet began to shift more to plant and animal domestication in place of hunting and gathering. Starch has become a staple of the human diet.\nDespite the obvious benefits, early humans did not possess salivary amylase, a trend that is also seen in evolutionary relatives of the human, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, who possess either one or no copies of the gene responsible for producing salivary amylase.\nLike in other mammals, the pancreatic alpha-amylase \"AMY2\" was duplicated multiple times. One event allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of amylase in the saliva (named in humans as \"AMY1\"). The 1p21.1 region of human chromosome 1 contains many copies of these genes, variously named \"AMY1A\", \"AMY1B\", \"AMY1C\", \"AMY2A\", \"AMY2B\", and so on.\nHowever, not all humans possess the same number of copies of the \"AMY1\" gene. Populations known to rely more on saccharides have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch. The number of \"AMY1\" gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only two to three copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the Biaka, Datog, and Yakuts.\nThe correlation that exists between starch consumption and number of \"AMY1\" copies specific to population suggest that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations has been selected for by natural selection and considered the favorable phenotype for those individuals. Therefore, it is most likely that the benefit of an individual possessing more copies of \"AMY1\" in a high starch population increases fitness and produces healthier, fitter offspring.\nThis fact is especially apparent when comparing geographically close populations with different eating habits that possess a different number of copies of the \"AMY1\" gene. Such is the case for some Asian populations that have been shown to possess few \"AMY1\" copies relative to some agricultural populations in Asia. This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene as opposed to the possibility that the gene has spread through genetic drift.\nVariations of amylase copy number in dogs mirrors that of human populations, suggesting they acquired the extra copies as they followed humans around. Unlike humans whose amylase levels depend on starch content in diet, wild animals eating a broad range of foods tend to have more copies of amylase. This may have to do with mainly detection of starch as opposed to digestion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH form when dissolved in water), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form when dissolved in water), and a side chain containing a hydroxyl group, making it a polar, uncharged amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as \"E. coli\". It is encoded by all the codons starting AC (ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG).\nThreonine sidechains are often hydrogen bonded; the most common small motifs formed are based on interactions with serine: ST turns, ST motifs (often at the beginning of alpha helices) and ST staples (usually at the middle of alpha helices).\nModifications.\nThe threonine residue is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications. The hydroxyl side-chain can undergo \"O\"-linked glycosylation. In addition, threonine residues undergo phosphorylation through the action of a threonine kinase. In its phosphorylated form, it can be referred to as phosphothreonine. Phosphothreonine has three potential coordination sites (carboxyl, amine and phosphate group) and determination of the mode of coordination between phosphorylated ligands and metal ions occurring in an organism is important to explain the function of the phosphothreonine in biological processes.\nHistory.\nThreonine was the last of the 20 common proteinogenic amino acids to be discovered. It was discovered in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, collaborating with Curtis Meyer. The amino acid was named threonine because it was similar in structure to threonic acid, a four-carbon monosaccharide with molecular formula C4H8O5\nStereoisomers.\nThreonine is one of two proteinogenic amino acids with two stereogenic centers, the other being isoleucine. Threonine can exist in four possible stereoisomers with the following configurations: (2\"S\",3\"R\"), (2\"R\",3\"S\"), (2\"S\",3\"S\") and (2\"R\",3\"R\"). However, the name -threonine is used for one single stereoisomer, (2\"S\",3\"R\")-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid. The stereoisomer (2\"S\",3\"S\"), which is rarely present in nature, is called -allothreonine.\nBiosynthesis.\nAs an essential amino acid, threonine is not synthesized in humans, and needs to be present in proteins in the diet. Adult humans require about 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day. In plants and microorganisms, threonine is synthesized from aspartic acid via \u03b1-aspartyl-semialdehyde and homoserine. Homoserine undergoes \"O\"-phosphorylation; this phosphate ester undergoes hydrolysis concomitant with relocation of the OH group. Enzymes involved in a typical biosynthesis of threonine include:\nMetabolism.\nThreonine is metabolized in at least three ways:\nMetabolic diseases.\nThe degradation of threonine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:\nEvolutionary significance.\nDuring human evolution, a regulatory variant (rs34590044-A) increased expression of acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3), an enzyme involved in threonine catabolism. This variant, absent in non-human great apes, enhanced threonine metabolism, supporting higher basal metabolic rates and promoting skeletal growth. These changes likely contributed to the coevolution of metabolism and dietary shifts toward increased protein consumption unique to modern humans.\nResearch of Threonine as a Dietary Supplement in Animals.\nEffects of threonine dietary supplementation have been researched in broilers.\nAn essential amino acid, threonine is involved in the metabolism of fats, the creation of proteins, the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and the health and function of the intestines. Animal health and illness are strongly correlated with the need for and metabolism of threonine. Intestinal inflammation and energy metabolism disorders in animals may be alleviated by appropriate amounts of dietary threonine. Nevertheless, because these effects pertain to the control of nutrition metabolism, more research is required to confirm the results in various animal models. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand how threonine controls the dynamic equilibrium of the intestinal barrier function, immunological response and gut flora.\nExploration of L-Threonine for Tuberculosis.\nWith multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) remaining a public health crisis with a total of 1.25 million people dead worldwide from TB in 2023 alone, new treatment strategies for TB are critical. TB is an airborne infection, spread via inhalation of airborne droplets that can remain suspended in the air for several hours, and can either be killed, remain in a latent stage, or become active. One previous paper researched the inhibitory effects of the downstream product L-threonine on the homoserine kinase (HSK) pathway in Escherichia coli. They found that the HSK pathway can be successfully inhibited via L-threonine since the pathway acts as a negative feedback loop, becoming inhibited once enough of the product is formed. Investigation of this pathway in TB may yield new insights into potential drug targets. Inhibiting the fatty acid synthesis pathway as well could serve as a potential drug target since this pathway is responsible for synthesizing mycolic acids, components necessary for formation of TB's cell walls. Coupling of the amino acid L-threonine with a common TB drug that inhibits fatty acid synthesis, like ethionamide, could yield a new treatment strategy for tuberculosis.\nSources.\nFoods high in threonine include cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, lentils, black turtle bean and sesame seeds.\nRacemic threonine can be prepared from crotonic acid by alpha-functionalization using mercury(II) acetate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains an \u03b1-amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH3+ form under biological conditions), an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological conditions), and a side chain isopropyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. Valine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from dietary sources which are foods that contain proteins, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. It is encoded by all codons starting with GU (GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG).\nHistory and etymology.\nValine was first isolated from casein in 1901 by Hermann Emil Fischer. The name valine comes from its structural similarity to valeric acid, which in turn is named after the plant valerian due to the presence of the acid in the roots of the plant.\nNomenclature.\nAccording to IUPAC, carbon atoms forming valine are numbered sequentially starting from 1 denoting the carboxyl carbon, whereas 4 and 4' denote the two terminal methyl carbons.\nMetabolism.\nSource and biosynthesis.\nValine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is synthesized by bacteria and plants, but not by animals. It is therefore an essential amino acid in animals, and needs to be present in the diet. Adult humans require about 24\u00a0mg/kg body weight daily. It is synthesized in plants and bacteria via several steps starting from pyruvic acid. The initial part of the pathway also leads to leucine. The intermediate \u03b1-ketoisovalerate undergoes reductive amination with glutamate. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:\nDegradation.\nLike other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by transamination, giving alpha-ketoisovalerate, an alpha-keto acid, which is converted to isobutyryl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This is further oxidised and rearranged to succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle and provide direct fuel in muscle tissue.\nSynthesis.\nRacemic valine can be synthesized by bromination of isovaleric acid followed by amination of the \u03b1-bromo derivative.\n\nMedical significance.\nMetabolic diseases.\nThe degradation of valine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:\nInsulin resistance.\nLower levels of serum valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, are associated with weight loss and decreased insulin resistance: higher levels of valine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. Mice fed a BCAA-deprived diet for one day had improved insulin sensitivity, and feeding of a valine-deprived diet for one week significantly decreases blood glucose levels. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of valine and the other branched-chain amino acids resulted in a rapid reversal of the adiposity and an improvement in glucose-level control. The valine catabolite 3-hydroxyisobutyrate promotes insulin resistance in mice by stimulating fatty acid uptake into muscle and lipid accumulation. In mice, a BCAA-restricted diet decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved body composition.\nHematopoietic stem cells.\nDietary valine is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, as demonstrated by experiments in mice. Dietary valine restriction selectively depletes long-term repopulating HSC in mouse bone marrow. Successful stem cell transplantation was achieved in mice without irradiation after 3 weeks on a valine restricted diet. Long-term survival of the transplanted mice was achieved when valine was returned to the diet gradually over a 2-week period to avoid refeeding syndrome.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
