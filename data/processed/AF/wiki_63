Some equisetids were large trees reaching to tall. The genus \"Calamites\" of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period. The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, is said to have inspired John Napier to invent logarithms. Modern horsetails first appeared during the Jurassic period.\nA superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (\"Hippuris\"), is occasionally referred to as \"horsetail\", and adding to confusion, the name \"mare's tail\" is sometimes applied to \"Equisetum\".\nEtymology.\nThe name \"horsetail\", often used for the entire group, arose because the branched species somewhat resemble a horse's tail. Similarly, the scientific name \"Equisetum\" is derived from the Latin ('horse') + ('bristle').\nOther names include candock for branching species, puzzlegrass, and snake grass or scouring-rush for unbranched or sparsely branched species. The latter name refers to the rush-like appearance of the plants and to the fact that the stems are coated with abrasive silicates, making them useful for scouring (cleaning) metal items such as cooking pots or drinking mugs, particularly those made of tin. \"Equisetum hyemale\", rough horsetail, is still boiled and then dried in Japan to be used for the final polishing process on woodcraft to produce a smooth finish. In German, the corresponding name is ('tin-herb') or ('nesting stalk'). In Spanish-speaking countries, these plants are known as ('horsetail').\nDescription.\n\"Equisetum\" leaves are greatly reduced and usually non-photosynthetic. They contain a single, non-branching vascular trace, which is the defining feature of microphylls. However, it has recently been recognised that horsetail microphylls are probably not ancestral as in lycophytes (clubmosses and relatives), but rather derived adaptations, evolved by reduction of megaphylls.\nThe leaves of horsetails are arranged in whorls fused into nodal sheaths. The stems are usually green and photosynthetic, and are distinctive in being hollow, jointed and ridged (with sometimes 3 but usually 6\u201340\u00a0ridges). There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes. Unusually, the branches often emerge below the leaves in an internode, and grow from buds between their bases.\nSpores.\nThe spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like structures at the tips of some of the stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. \"E.\u00a0arvense\", field horsetail) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring. In some other species (e.g. \"E.\u00a0palustre\", marsh horsetail) they are very similar to sterile shoots, photosynthetic and with whorls of branches.\nHorsetails are mostly homosporous, though in the field horsetail, smaller spores give rise to male prothalli. The spores have four elaters that act as moisture-sensitive springs, assisting spore dispersal through crawling and hopping motions after the sporangia have split open longitudinally. They are photosynthetic and have a lifespan that is usually two weeks at most, but will germinate immediately under humid conditions and develop into a gametophyte.\nCell walls.\nThe crude cell extracts of all \"Equisetum\" species tested contain (MXE) activity. This is a novel enzyme and is not known to occur in any other plants. In addition, the cell walls of all \"Equisetum\" species tested contain mixed-linkage glucan (MLG), a polysaccharide which, until recently, was thought to be confined to the Poales. The evolutionary distance between \"Equisetum\" and the Poales suggests that each evolved MLG independently. The presence of MXE activity in \"Equisetum\" suggests that they have evolved MLG along with some mechanism of cell wall modification. Non-\"Equisetum\" land plants tested lack detectable MXE activity. An observed negative correlation between XET activity and cell age led to the suggestion that XET is catalysing endotransglycosylation in controlled wall-loosening during cell expansion. The lack of MXE in the Poales suggests that there it must play some other, currently unknown, role. Due to the correlation between MXE activity and cell age, MXE has been proposed to promote the cessation of cell expansion.\nTaxonomy.\nSpecies.\nCurrently, 18 species of \"Equisetum\" are accepted by Plants of the World Online. The living members are divided into three distinct lineages, which are usually treated as subgenera. The name of the type subgenus, \"Equisetum\", means \"horse hair\" in Latin, while the name of the other large subgenus, \"Hippochaete\", means \"horse hair\" in Greek. Hybrids are common, but hybridization has only been recorded between members of the same subgenus.\nTwo \"Equisetum\" plants are sold under the names \"Equisetum japonicum\" (barred horsetail) and \"Equisetum camtschatcense\" (Kamchatka horsetail). These are both types of \"E.\u00a0hyemale\" var. \"hyemale\", although they may also be listed as separate varieties of \"E.\u00a0hyemale\".\nThe Smith et al. classification of 2006, based on molecular phylogeny, placed \"Equisetum\" in Equisetaceae. Subsequent classifications have maintained this placement.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe oldest remains of modern horsetails of the genus \"Equisetum\" first appear in the Early Jurassic, represented by \"Equisetum dimorphum\" from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia and \"Equisetum laterale\" from the Early-Middle Jurassic of Australia. Silicified remains of \"Equisetum thermale\" from the Late Jurassic of Argentina exhibit all the morphological characters of modern members of the genus. The estimated split between \"Equisetum bogotense\" and all other living \"Equisetum\" is estimated to have occurred no later than the Early Jurassic.\nDistribution and ecology.\nThe genus \"Equisetum\" as a whole, while concentrated in the non-tropical northern hemisphere, is near-cosmopolitan, being absent naturally only from Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. They are most common in northern Europe, with ten species (\"E.\u00a0arvense\", \"E.\u00a0fluviatile\", \"E.\u00a0hyemale\", \"E.\u00a0palustre\", \"E.\u00a0pratense\", \"E.\u00a0ramosissimum\", \"E.\u00a0scirpoides\", \"E.\u00a0sylvaticum\", \"E.\u00a0telmateia\", and \"E.\u00a0variegatum\"); Great Britain has nine of these species, missing only \"E.\u00a0scirpoides\" of the European list. Northern North America (Canada and the northernmost United States), also has nine species (\"E.\u00a0arvense\", \"E.\u00a0fluviatile\", \"E.\u00a0laevigatum\", \"E.\u00a0palustre\", \"E.\u00a0praealtum\", \"E.\u00a0pratense\", \"E.\u00a0scirpoides\", \"E.\u00a0sylvaticum\", and \"E.\u00a0variegatum\"). Only five (\"E.\u00a0bogotense\", \"E.\u00a0giganteum\", \"E.\u00a0myriochaetum\", \"E.\u00a0ramosissimum\", and \"E.\u00a0xylochaetum\") of the eighteen species are known to be native south of the Equator.\nThey are perennial plants, herbaceous and dying back in winter in most temperate species, or evergreen as most tropical species and the temperate species \"E.\u00a0hyemale\" (rough horsetail), \"E.\u00a0ramosissimum\" (branched horsetail), \"E.\u00a0scirpoides\" (dwarf horsetail) and \"E.\u00a0variegatum\" (variegated horsetail). They typically grow 20\u00a0cm\u20131.5\u00a0m (8\u00a0in\u20135\u00a0ft) tall, though the subtropical \"giant horsetails\" are recorded to grow as high as (\"E.\u00a0giganteum\", southern giant horsetail) or (\"E.\u00a0myriochaetum\", Mexican giant horsetail), and allegedly even more.\nOne species, \"Equisetum fluviatile\", is an emergent aquatic, rooted in water with shoots growing into the air. The stalks arise from rhizomes that are deep underground and difficult to dig out. Field horsetail (\"E.\u00a0arvense\") can be a nuisance weed, readily regrowing from the rhizome after being pulled out. It is unaffected by many herbicides designed to kill seed plants. Since the stems have a waxy coat, the plant is resistant to contact weedkillers like glyphosate. However, as \"E.\u00a0arvense\" prefers an acid soil, lime may be used to assist in eradication efforts to bring the soil pH to 7 or 8. Members of the genus have been declared noxious weeds in Australia and in the US state of Oregon.\nAll the \"Equisetum\" are classed as \"unwanted organisms\" in New Zealand and are listed on the National Pest Plant Accord.\nConsumption.\nPeople have regularly consumed horsetails. The fertile stems bearing strobili of some species can be cooked and eaten like asparagus (a dish called in Japan). Indigenous nations across Cascadia consume and use horsetails in a variety of ways, with the Squamish calling them \"sx\u0331\u00e9m'x\u0331em\" and the Lushootseed using \"g\u02b7\u0259\u026bik\", or horsetail roots, for cedar root baskets. The young plants are eaten cooked or raw, but considerable care must be taken.\nIf eaten over a long enough period of time, some species of horsetail can be poisonous to grazing animals, including horses. The toxicity appears to be due to thiaminase, which can cause thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency.\n\"Equisetum\" species may have been a common food for herbivorous dinosaurs. With studies showing that horsetails are nutritionally of high quality, it is assumed that horsetails were an important component of herbivorous dinosaur diets. Analysis of the scratch marks on hadrosaur teeth is consistent with grazing on hard plants like horsetails.\nFolk medicine and safety concerns.\nExtracts and other preparations of \"E.\u00a0arvense\" have served as herbal remedies, with records dating over centuries. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority concluded there was no evidence for the supposed health effects of \"E.\u00a0arvense\", such as for invigoration, weight control, skincare, hair health or bone health. As of 2018[ [update]], there is insufficient scientific evidence for its effectiveness as a medicine to treat any human condition.\n\"E.\u00a0arvense\" contains thiaminase, which metabolizes the B vitamin, thiamine, potentially causing thiamine deficiency and associated liver damage, if taken chronically. Horsetail might produce a diuretic effect. Further, its safety for oral consumption has not been sufficiently evaluated and it may be toxic, especially to children and pregnant women.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Anzac biscuits have long been associated with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) established in World War I.\nIt is thought that these biscuits were sent by wives and women's groups to soldiers abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily and the biscuits kept well during naval transportation.\nAnzac biscuits should not be confused with hardtack, which was nicknamed \"ANZAC wafers\" in Australia and New Zealand.\nAnzac biscuits are an explicit exemption to an Australian ban on commercial goods that use the term \"Anzac\", so long as they are sold as \"biscuits\" and not \"cookies\".\nOrigins.\nThe origin of Anzac biscuits is contested between Australia and New Zealand. The first known recipe for the biscuit significantly predates the formation of the ANZAC Corps, and many early recipes differ from the modern version. For example, historical recipes have variously included non-traditional ingredients such as eggs, fruit, and jam.\nThe earliest known recipe combining the words 'Anzac' and 'biscuit' is a recipe from 1916 for \"ANZAC ginger biscuits\" which was published on 4 June 1916 in the Perth edition of \"The Sunday Times\". However, this recipe contains no mention of oats, which are present in modern Anzac biscuits. The first recipe for \"Anzac Biscuits\" appears in an Australian publication, the \"War Chest Cookery Book\" (Sydney, 1917), but this recipe was also for a different biscuit. The same publication also included the first two recipes for biscuits resembling modern Anzac biscuits, under the names of \"Rolled Oats Biscuits\" and just \"Biscuits\". The first recorded instance of the combination of the name \"Anzac biscuit\" and the recipe now associated with it was found in Adelaide dating to \"either late 1919 or early 1920\". Another early recipe for the Anzac biscuit dates back to 1921, published in an Australian newspaper called \"The Argus\". These early recipes did not contain desiccated coconut, which is present in many modern Anzac biscuits. The first recipe for an Anzac biscuit containing desiccated coconut is recorded to be from the city of Adelaide in 1924.\nIn New Zealand, a 1919 recipe for Anzac Crispies in the eighth edition of the St Andrew's Cookery Book had similar ingredients to modern Anzac biscuits.\nCurrent popularity.\nToday, Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale. Because of their historical military connection with the ANZACs and Anzac Day, these biscuits are still used as a fundraising item for the Royal New Zealand Returned Services' Association (RSA) and the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Special collectors old-style biscuit tins with World War military artwork are usually produced in the lead up to Anzac Day and sold in supermarkets, in addition to the standard plastic packets available all year. The official RSL biscuit is produced by \"Ital Food Group\" under licence.\nA British (though still Australian-produced) version of the Anzac biscuit, supporting the Royal British Legion, is available in several major supermarket chains in the UK.\nLegal issues.\nSimilarly to the use of the term Anzac, the Anzac biscuit is protected by regulations that restrict commercial production of the product. Primarily, such regulations pertain to the name and recipe. They must be referred to and sold as Anzac \"biscuits\" or \"slice\" and never as \"cookies\". While it is legally acceptable to substitute ingredients in a recipe to cater to dietary requirements, there is a commercial disallowance for any substantial modification of the recipe such that they deviate too far from traditional Anzac biscuit recipes. Variations of recipes posted on social media or written in cookbooks that merely include Anzac biscuits are excluded from regulations.\nAs a result of the restrictions on the recipe, the Subway chain of restaurants dropped the biscuit from their menu in September 2008. After being ordered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to bake the biscuits according to the original recipe, Subway decided not to continue to offer the biscuit, as they found that their supplier was unable to develop a cost-effective means of duplicating the recipe. In April 2025, the biscuit returned to the Subway menu.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Originating in either Australia or New Zealand in the early 20th century, it was named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. Taking the form of a cake-like circular block of baked meringue, pavlova has a crisp crust and soft, light inside. The confection is usually topped with fruit and whipped cream. The name is commonly pronounced or (in North America) , and occasionally closer to the name of the dancer, as .\nThe dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. The nationality of its creator has been a source of argument between the two nations for many years.\nThe dessert is an important part of the national cuisine of both Australia and New Zealand. It is frequently served during celebratory and holiday meals. It is most identified with and consumed most frequently in summer, including at Christmas time.\nOrigin.\nA recipe for \"Strawberries Pavlova\" appeared in the \"New Zealand Herald\" on 11 November 1911, but this was a kind of ice block or sorbet. Annabelle Utrecht, who wrote a book about the possible origins of pavlova, believes that this is a reprint from England. \nA 1922 book, \"Australian Home Cookery\" by Emily Futter, contained a recipe for \"Meringue with Fruit Filling\". David Burton regards this as the first known recipe for a food resembling the modern pavlova; Australian food writer Michael Symons, however, does not recognise it as such, pointing to its lack of vinegar or cornflour, to the absence of the pavlova name, and to its description as a meringue cake cut in half and filled.\nAnother recipe for a dish bearing the name \"pavlova\" was published in 1926 by the Davis Gelatine company in Sydney. However, this was a multi-layered jelly, not the meringue, cream and fruit dessert known today.\nHelen Leach, in her role as a culinary anthropologist at the University of Otago, states that the first recipe from New Zealand was a recipe for \"pavlova cake\" in 1929. A recipe for pavlova cake was published in \"The Evening Star\" on 10 November 1934.\nIt has also been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the Esplanade Hotel in Perth, Western Australia, in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor of the dish, a relative of Sachse's wrote to Leach suggesting that Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach replied they would not find evidence for that \"because it's just not showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia.\" However, a recipe for \"pavlova cake\" was published in \"The Advocate\" in 1935, and a 1937 issue of \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" contains a \"pavlova sweet cake\" recipe. A 1935 advertisement for a chromium ring used to prevent the dessert collapsing also indicates that the term \"pavlova cake\" had some currency in Auckland at that time.\nOther researchers have said that the origins of pavlova lie outside both Australia and New Zealand. Research conducted by New Zealander Andrew Paul Wood and Australian Annabelle Utrecht found that the origins of the modern pavlova can be traced back to the Austro-Hungarian Spanische Windtorte. It was later brought to the United States where German-speaking immigrants introduced meringue, whipped cream, and fruit desserts called \"Schaumtorte\" (\"foam cake\") and \"Baisertorte\". American corn starch packages which included recipes for meringue were exported to New Zealand in the 1890s.\nAnother story is that an unnamed New Zealand chef created Pavlova in 1926 in a Wellington hotel. Food anthropologist Helen Leach of the University of Otago was unable to verify that this was true. She found at least 21 pavlova recipes in New Zealand cookbooks by 1940, the year the Australian recipes appeared. She wrote the book \"The Pavlova Story\". The first she found was a multlayered and layered jelly in 1926. In 1928 from Dunedin, a walnut and coffee-flavoured meringue recipe was created and became popular throughout New Zealand. In 1929 a third recipe was published in the \"Dairy Farmer's Annual\". Leach said that this third recipe was \"stolen/falsely claimed by chefs/cooks across the Tasman\". A fourth recipe was published in the \"Rangiora Mother's Union Cookery Book of Tried and Tested Recipes\" in 1933, two years before a similar recipe was published in Australia, later republished to raise funds for the Rangiora Church. This recipe was a single-layered small cake, whose preparation consisted in two egg whites, sugar and cornflour, but with no vinegar, baked in a sandwich tin. One year later a recipe was published in the \"New Zealand Women's Weekly\", which contained four egg whites, a breakfast cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vinegar, to be cooked in a cake tin.\nAn article in Melbourne's \"The Argus\" from 17 November 1928 claims an \"American ice-cream\" was named after Anna Pavlova: \"Dame Nellie Melba, of course, has found fame apart from her art in the famous sweet composed of peaches and cream, while Mme. Anna Pavlova lends her name to a popular variety of American ice-cream.\" This article may suggest that pavlova has American origins. However, it's unclear how these words should be interpreted and whether that article is relevant. Firstly, the authors of that article offer no evidence for their claims or any depth of discussion of their claims. Secondly, given that pavlova is not an ice-cream, it is highly unclear as to whether the words \"American ice-cream\" is referring to the modern pavlova dessert or something else entirely.\nMichael Symons, an Australian then researching in New Zealand, has declared that pavlova has no singular birthplace. Rather, published recipes reveal the complex process of \"social invention\" with practical experience circulating, under a variety of names, across both countries. For example, Australians beat New Zealanders to create an accepted pavlova recipe as the 'Meringue Cake'. The illusion of some singular invention can be explained by distinguishing a second, associated level of \"social construction\", in which cooks, eaters and writers attach a name and myths to produce a widely-held concept that appears so deceptively distinct that it must have had a definite moment of creation.\nMatthew Evans, a restaurant critic for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", said that it was unlikely that a definitive answer about the dessert's origins would ever be found. \"People have been doing meringue with cream for a long time, I don't think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think of doing that.\"\nIn 2010 the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" noted that the first recorded recipe of pavlova was from 1927 in \"Davis Dainty Dishes\", published by the Davis Gelatine Company in New Zealand. This was a multi-coloured jelly dish. Confusingly, the dictionary ambiguously listed the origin as \"Austral. and N.Z\".\nPreparation and consumption.\nPavlova is made in a similar way to meringue. Egg whites (and sometimes salt) are beaten to a very stiff consistency, gradually adding caster sugar before folding in vinegar or lemon juice (or another edible acid), cornflour, and vanilla essence. The meringue mixture is placed on to baking paper and shaped to form a round cake around in diameter with a slightly recessed centre. The meringue is baked in a slow oven (; gas mark 1/2, 1, or 2) for 45\u201360 minutes, then left in the oven to cool and dry out, usually overnight.\nPavlova has a crisp and crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in contrast to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour is responsible for the marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid.\nPavlova is traditionally decorated with a topping of whipped cream and fresh soft fruit such as kiwifruit, passionfruit, and strawberries. Factory-made pavlovas can be purchased at supermarkets and decorated as desired. A commercial product is available that includes pre-mixed ingredients for baking the meringue shell, requiring only the addition of water and sugar.\nLeftover decorated pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but the dessert will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova can be left overnight in the oven, or for several days in an airtight container, to be decorated when ready.\nNew Zealand pavlova is more likely to have kiwifruit. In Australia, pavlova often has passionfruit and sometimes pineapples. In Britain it is more likely to have strawberries. Older versions of pavlova would have walnuts.\nIn culture.\nPavlova is popular on Christmas Day as a dessert usually served after being refrigerated due to Christmas being celebrated during the summer in the southern hemisphere.\nWorld's largest pavlova.\nTe Papa, New Zealand's national museum in Wellington, celebrated its first birthday in February 1999 with the creation of purportedly the world's largest pavlova, dubbed Pavzilla, which was cut by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. This record was broken by students at the Eastern Institute of Technology in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, in March 2005. Their creation, Pavkong, stretched 64 metres long in comparison to Te Papa's 45-metre-long pavlova. In August 2010, chef Aaron Campbell displayed a 50-square-metre rugby-themed pavlova, with the Bledisloe Cup in the centre, in the ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, to raise money for the official charity of the All Blacks. In May 2018 a Norwegian chef and 35 assistants produced an 85-square-metre pavlova.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The thin mixture is absorbed into the outside of the sponge cake and left to set, giving the cake a distinctive texture. A common variation has a layer of cream or strawberry jam between two lamington halves.\nOrigins.\nLamingtons are believed to be named after either Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901, or his wife, Lady Lamington. Most sources incline to the former. The earliest known reference to the naming of the lamington, from June 1927, links the cake to Lord Lamington.\nThe identity of the recipe's inventor has also been debated. Most stories attribute its creation to Lord Lamington's chef, the French-born Armand Galland, who was called upon at short notice to feed unexpected guests. Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over French vanilla sponge cake baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe. This version of events is supported by Lady Lamington's memoirs. Coconut was not widely used in European cooking at that time, but was known to Galland, whose wife was from Tahiti, where coconut was a common ingredient.\nOne account suggests that the lamington was first served in Toowoomba, when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to escape the steamy heat of Brisbane, whereas another claims that it was created by Galland at Queensland's Government House in Brisbane during the busy period leading up to Federation in 1901. A further alternative claim is that Lord Lamington's cook, presumably Galland, accidentally dropped a block of sponge cake into a dish of chocolate. It was later discovered that desiccated coconut, sprinkled over the top, made the cakes more appealing.\nThe first known mention of \"Lamington cake\" appears in an 1896 newspaper account of a \"Lamington Function\" at Laidley in Queensland. The event was in honour of Lord Lamington (although it appears he did not attend) and also featured \"Lamington Tea\", \"Lamington Soup\" etc., so, in the absence of any description of the cake, the name of the cake might signify nothing more than the name of the event. A 1900 recipe for Lamington Cakes has been found in the \"Queensland Country Life\" newspaper. While the recipe originated in Queensland, it spread quickly, appearing in a Sydney newspaper in 1901 and a New Zealand newspaper in 1902. However, none of these recipes indicate the creator of the recipe nor the reason for its name.\nA 2014 April Fools' Day story from \"Guardian Australia\" falsely claimed the lamington to have been based on a previously unknown New Zealand cake known as a \"Wellington\". This hoax origin story was later repeated by other sources.\nLamingtons are typically baked in a Lamington pan named for the cake.\nModern-day.\nLamingtons remain a popular treat across Australia and New Zealand, and 21 July was designated as National Lamington Day in Australia. Lamingtons are often sold at fundraisers for schools or charity groups, known as \"lamington drives\". Some Australians shorten the name to \"Lammo\" (singular) or \"Lammos\" (plural).\nThere are many variations on the basic lamington recipe, including different colours, flavours, and sizes.\nSimilar cakes in other countries.\nHungary has a similar item is known as , or coconut squares.\nRomanian cuisine calls the Lamington Prajitura tavalita cu cocos or \"cake tumbled in coconut\" and has a wide range of variations including different sauces and nuts and adding rum or orange or lemon zest to the cake.\nIn Malta, a popular version known as Pink Lamingtons, or (also ), is commonly found in bakeries. The sponge cake is coated in a fruit-flavoured jelly mixture and then rolled in desiccated coconut, resulting in a bright pink and sweet treat often enjoyed by children.\nSouth Africa has a similar but smaller-sized confection known as (little porcupines).\nIn the U.S. city of Cleveland, they are called coconut bars.\nThe British Overseas Territory of St Helena Island has a similar variation called coconut fingers, made traditionally for special occasions such as weddings and birthdays.\nIn Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, the \"\u010dupavci\" is a similar cake. \"\u010cupavci\" are one of the most popular Christmas desserts in Croatia. Slovenia, Romania and Hungary have similar cakes.\nIn Mauritius, there is a dessert which is a variant of the Lamington cake; It is called the \"red Lamington cake\", also known as \"gato carr\u00e9 rouge\" (lit. \"red cube cake\" or \"red square cake\" in English and in French) or \"gato Francis\" (lit. \"Francis cake\" in English or in French). Red dye is used to give the cake its red colour; square pieces of the cake are soaked in the red dye completely and then coated with desiccated coconut, and whipped cream is applied on the top surface of the cake. A half candied cherry or half a strawberry can also be applied on top of the cream as topping. The cake is sometimes strawberry flavoured.\nAwards.\nIn 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, the lamington was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \"innovation and invention\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Transphobia can include fear, aversion, hatred, violence or anger towards people who do not conform to social gender roles. Transphobia is a type of prejudice and discrimination, similar to racism, sexism, or ableism, and it is closely associated with homophobia. People of color who are transgender experience discrimination above and beyond that which can be explained as a simple combination of transphobia and racism.\nTransgender youth often experience a combination of abuse from family members, sexual harassment, and bullying or school violence. They are also disproportionately placed in foster care and welfare programs compared to their peers. Adult transgender people regularly encounter sexual violence, police violence, public ridicule, misgendering, or other forms of violence and harassment in their daily lives. These issues cause many trans people to feel unsafe in public. Other issues include healthcare discrimination, workplace discrimination or feeling under siege by conservative political or religious groups who oppose LGBT-rights laws. Discrimination and violence sometimes originates from people within the LGBT community or feminist movements.\nAs well as increased risk of violence and other threats, the stress created by transphobia causes negative mental health outcomes and leads to drug use disorders, running away from home (in minors), and suicide.\nIn much of the Western world, there has been a gradual establishment of policies combatting discrimination and supporting equal opportunity in all aspects of life since the 1990s. The trend is also taking shape in some developing nations. In addition, campaigns regarding the LGBT community are being spread around the world to improve social acceptance of nontraditional gender identities. The \"Stop the Stigma\" campaign by the UN is one such example. However, transphobic violence has been on the rise since 2021, accompanied with an increase in anti-trans discriminatory laws being enacted in many countries.\nEtymology and use.\nThe word \"transphobia\" is a classical compound patterned on the term \"homophobia\". The first component is the neo-classical prefix \"trans-\" (originally meaning \"across, on the far side, beyond\") from \"transgender\", and the second component \"-phobia\" comes from the Ancient Greek (, \"fear\"). Along with \"lesbophobia\", \"biphobia\" and \"homophobia\", \"transphobia\" is a member of the family of terms used when intolerance and discrimination is directed toward LGBT people.\n\"Transphobia\" is not a phobia as defined in clinical psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and usage parallels \"xenophobia\". The noun \"transphobe\" denotes someone who harbors transphobia. The adjectival form \"transphobic\" may be used to describe a transphobe or their actions. The words \"transphobia\" and \"transphobic\" were added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013.\nOrigins.\nResearch.\nAccording to a 2022 meta-analysis by Hailey A. Hatch and colleagues, a range of underlying factors contribute to transphobia. They found that the strongest predictor for transphobic attitudes were a person's corresponding attitudes towards lesbian, gay, or bisexual people, i.e., homophobia was strongly associated with transphobia. However, other factors were also statistically significant, including individual differences such as aggressiveness, gender role beliefs, demographics, and gender essentialism.\nRad \"et al.\" (2019) published a study they said had implications for understanding transphobia. Rad and colleagues surveyed a sample of 1323 American adults, asking them to identify the gender of transgender people who medically transitioned. Biological changes resulted in the target being more identified with their self-identified gender than their birth-assigned gender. Moreover, compared to male test subjects, female test subjects were more likely to identify the targets as their self-identified gender. This gender difference was larger in younger, more liberal, and less religious non-Midwestern respondents. The authors further showed that gender category beliefs (ratings of the transgender person's post-transition gender identity) were strongly associated with attitudes and feelings of warmth towards transgender people. However, gender category beliefs performed better in predicting bathroom policy preferences compared to feelings in unseen data, indicating that beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined are significantly linked to transphobia and support for anti-transgender policies. The authors argue that this pattern is consistent with theories that transphobia is rooted in a hierarchical social classification system where low-status groups (e.g., females) view the hierarchy in less essentialist ways than high-status groups (e.g., males).\nTheory.\nTransfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues that the root of transphobia is \"oppositional sexism\", i.e. the belief that male and female are \"rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires\". She contrasts this against the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity along with people's insecurities about gender and gender norms, which she calls \"traditional sexism\".\nOther transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia and violence towards transsexual people is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain's protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the paradigm of acceptable sexual behavior that assumes men's sexual arousal is category-specific and women's sex drive is lower and more inhibited causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are therefore sex criminals. They argue that studies that claim to show such sex differences have flaws, such as the possibility that more men are deterred from participating in sexual arousal studies than women due to fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused.\nSome authors have linked transphobia's origins to colonialism, arguing that gendercide against third gender people carried out during the European colonization of the Americas reflect the historical roots of transphobia.\nSociologists McLean and Stretesky argue that \"a veritable miasma of anti-trans campaign groups [...] united in their antipathy toward transgender people\" has contributed to an anti-trans moral panic in the United Kingdom, which they link to authoritarian beliefs.\nTransgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary, and the \"male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends\".\nDrawing on theory of radicalization, Craig McLean argues that discourse on transgender-related issues in the UK has been radicalized in response to the activities of what he terms the \"anti-transgender movement,\" claiming that the movement pushes \"a radical agenda to deny the basic rights of trans people (...) under the cover of 'free speech.'\"\nRelated concepts.\nCissexism (also termed cisgenderism, and related to but distinct from cisnormativity or cissexual assumption) is the appeal to norms that enforce the gender binary and gender essentialism, resulting in the oppression of gender variant, non-binary, and transgender identities. Cissexism refers to the assumption that, due to human sexual differentiation, one's gender is determined solely by a \"biological\" sex of male or female (or, in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to cisgender people. \"Cisgender privilege\" is the set of \"unearned rights afforded to nontransgender people by virtue of the fact that they are not transgender\", such as access to gender-segregated spaces and teams, lower exposure to gender-based violence, and easier access to gender-specific healthcare.\nHarassment and violence directed against transgender people is often called trans bashing, and can be physical, sexual or verbal. Whereas gay bashing is directed against a target's real or perceived sexual orientation, trans bashing is directed against the target's real or perceived expressed gender identity. The term has also been applied to hate speech directed at transgender people and to depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.\n\"Transprejudice\" is a term similar to transphobia, and refers to the negative valuing, stereotyping, and discriminatory treatment of individuals whose appearance or identity does not conform to current social expectations or conventional conceptions of gender.\nManifestations.\nTransgender people are often excluded from entitlements or privileges reserved for cisgender people of the same gender: for example, it is common for transgender women to be stopped or questioned when they use public bathrooms designated for women. Homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons have denied trans women admission to women's areas and forced them to sleep and bathe in the presence of men.\nHarassment and violence.\nThe stigma against transgender people often results in physical violence or bodily harm, sexual violence or assault, and verbal or emotional abuse. Transgender individuals are at increased risk for experiencing aggression and violence throughout their life when compared to cisgender individuals, especially when it comes to sexual violence. Other kinds of abuse include bullying, harassment, and multiple forms of discrimination. Abuse against transgender people can come from many different sources, including family and friends, partners, co-workers and acquaintances, strangers, and the police, and the abuse can occur at each developmental stage in life.\nAs homophobia and transphobia are correlated, many trans people experience homophobia and heterosexism due to people who associate trans people's gender identity with homosexuality, or because trans people may also have a sexual orientation that is non-heterosexual. Author Thomas Spijkerboer stated that \"transgender people subjected to violence, in a range of cultural contexts, frequently report that transphobic violence is expressed in homophobic terms.\"\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, transgender children are more likely than other children to experience harassment and violence in school, foster care, residential treatment centers, homeless centers, and juvenile justice programs. Researchers say trans youth routinely experience taunting, teasing and bullying at school, and that nearly all trans youth say they were verbally or physically harassed in school, particularly during gym class, at school events, or when using single-sex restrooms. Three-quarters report having felt unsafe.\nAs adults, transgender people are frequently subjected to ridicule, taunting, and threats of violence, even when just walking down the street or walking into a store. A U.S. survey of 402 older, employed, high-income transgender people found that 60% reported violence or harassment because of their gender identity. Among other things, 56% of the respondents reported being harassed or verbally abused, 30% reported being assaulted, and 8% reported unjustified arrest.\nA study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found that 30% of the respondents reported feeling unsafe in public because they were transgender, with 19% feeling uncomfortable for the same reason. When asked if they had ever been forced to have sex, experienced violence in their home, or been physically abused, the majority answered yes to each question.\nSexual violence.\nIn 2009, researcher Rebecca L. Stotzer published an article in \"Aggression and Violent Behavior\" that compiled information from numerous studies reporting violence against transgender people, describing it as \"shockingly common\" and noting that transgender people have a high risk of experiencing sexual violence throughout their lifetimes, and while reported rates vary considerably among studies for methodological and other reasons, the most common finding is that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.\nA meta-analysis on the rates of intimate partner violence found that transgender individuals are 66% more likely to experience violence of some kind from an intimate partner than cisgender subjects, and more than twice as likely to experience both sexual and physical intimate partner violence than their cisgender peers.\nPhysical violence.\nPerpetrators of physical violence against transgender people are reported to have been influenced by negative attitudes against transgender people, many of whom do not report their assault to the police. In the United States, the available homicide data suggests that transgender people are murdered at a lower rate than cisgender people. However, young Black and Latina trans women appear to be at greater risk of homicide than their cisgender peers.\nMisgendering.\nMisgendering is the act of labelling or referring to others with a gender that does not match their gender identity. Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental; common examples of misgendering a person are using the wrong pronouns to describe someone, calling a person \"ma'am\" or \"sir\" in contradiction to the person's gender identity, using a person's previous, pre-transition name for them in place of their current name (\"deadnaming\"), or insisting that a person must adhere to the norms of their sex assigned at birth rather than the ones that align with their gender identity; for example, using a bathroom designated for males even though the person identifies as female.\nThe experience of being misgendered is common for all transgender people before they transition, and for many afterwards as well. Transgender people are regularly misgendered by doctors, police, media, and peers, experiences that have been described as \"mortifying\", cruel, and \"only making our lives harder\". A 2018 study of 129 transgender and other gender-expansive youth published in the \"Journal of Adolescent Health\", found that \"for each additional social context in which a youth's chosen name was used, there was a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors,\" though the study was \"correlational so causality cannot be assumed, and the sample size was small.\" Deliberately misgendering a transgender person is considered extremely offensive by transgender individuals.\nIn society.\nIn healthcare.\nA study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered 'yes' when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, \"being transgender created a problem\" for them.\nAdditionally, a study of 223 healthcare providers indicated a correlation between transphobia and decreased performance on survey questions regarding the treatment of transgender patients, with no significant correlation to the amount of time spent learning about transgender health, leading researchers to state that \"broader efforts to address transphobia in society in general, and in medical education in particular, may be required to improve the quality of medical care for [transgender and gender diverse] patients.\"\nIn the United States\u2013based National Center For Transgender Equality's 2011 survey, 19% of respondents reported being refused medical care due to their transgender or gender non-conforming status, such as Robert Eads, who died of ovarian cancer after being refused treatment by more than two dozen doctors due to fears that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice, or Tyra Hunter, who was involved in an automobile accident; when rescue workers discovered she was transgender, they backed away and stopped administering treatment. She later died in a hospital.\nIn many European countries, laws require that any transgender person who wishes to change their legal gender must first be sterilized. Sweden repealed its law in December 2012, and the European Court of Human Rights struck down such laws in 2017.\nIn the workplace.\nTransphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their jobs when they begin to transition and a 1995 study from Willamette University stated that a transgender person fired for following the recommended course of treatment rarely wins it back through federal or state statutes.\nA survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health in 1997 and released in 1999 found that 40% of trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months. For trans men, the equivalent statistic was 81%. The survey also found that 46% of trans women and 57% of trans men reported employment discrimination. The \"Associated Press\" and the \"Out Traveler\" later reported the San Francisco Department of Public Health had found 70% of trans respondents in San Francisco were unemployed.\nA 2002 American study found that among educators, trans educators are 10\u201320% more likely to experience workplace harassment than their gay and lesbian colleagues.\nIn the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers sometimes finding other ostensible reasons to not hire a candidate. Additionally, when an employer fires a transgender employee, it may be a \"mixed motive\" case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing or job performance issues while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.\nEmployment discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression is illegal in the United States. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as \"Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co.\" and \"Jette vs. Honey Farms\".) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom have also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections. In 2000, the southern U.S. grocery chain Winn-Dixie fired long-time employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that Oiler identified as transgender and occasionally cross-dressed off the job. Management argued that this hurt Winn-Dixie's corporate image. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Winn-Dixie on behalf of Oiler, but a judge dismissed it.\nTransgender people facing employment discrimination may turn to sex work to survive, placing them at additional risk of encountering troubles with the law, including arrest and criminal prosecution, workplace violence, the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Lack of employment has also resulted in the transgender community resorting to illegal means of earning money such as drug-dealing.\nA study conducted by Anneliese Singh and Vel McKleroy on transgender people of color revealed that difficulty finding a job or losing a job due to transphobia resulted in some respondents living in crime-ridden neighborhoods and getting involved in abusive relationships. A 2021 study in the Journal of Career Development looked at 18 Latino transgender immigrants to the United States and found five themes related to these participants' experiences while seeking employment: discrimination, limited options, positive experiences, and disability benefits as financial relief.\nFrom government.\nVoter identification laws in the United States often impact transgender individuals' ability to vote, since many lack photo identification with their current name and gender.\nPrisons frequently make no attempt to accommodate transgender individuals, assigning them to facilities using only the criteria of genitalia, which is believed to contribute to the pervasiveness of prison rape with regards to transgender women. Prison staff have been noted to frequently deny trans women privileges disproportionately, and the Eighth Amendment right for an individual not to be given cruel or unusual punishment has historically not been liberally enforced in cases involving transgender inmates.\nIn July 2023, Russia enacted a law which had, among other measures, banned gender-affirming healthcare for all transgender people regardless of age and had also banned them from adopting children.\nTransgender people also face the denial of right of asylum or inhuman treatment in process of asylum-seeking.\nIn education.\nWithin the school system, many transgender teens are harassed and mistreated with reported negative effects on both victim and the school's population in general. Transgender youth frequently report fear and anxiety about using restrooms and locker rooms at school because of harassment by both peers and adults when using them. Over 80% of transgender teens report feeling unsafe in a school environment, more than 40% report having been physically abused, and over 65% report being bullied online or via social media. Such discrimination is generally underreported, and school officials may even participate in transphobic name-calling or victim-blaming. Additionally, administrative practices such as misgendering students in school records can contribute to transgender students' distress in school.\nA study done on Canadian high school students between December 2007 and June 2009 illustrated how the LGBTQ students felt unsafe at the school and were exposed to insults and discrimination by their peers and sometimes even by their teachers.\nOnline.\nOnline transphobia remains a growing problem across various online spaces. A study by Brandwatch analyzing over ten million posts in transgender-related discussions on various social media platforms between 2015 and 2019 found over 1.5 million transphobic posts. These posts varied from promoting transphobic sentiment to advocating for anti-transgender violence and genocide.\nTransgender people are often victims of online harassment and experience higher reported levels of online harassment compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts. One study on transphobic cyberbullying by Evelyn et al. found that participants most frequently reported being bullied on social media platforms, alongside frequently reporting bullying in online video games and dating apps. Most of the bullying was found to be from anonymous users or people unknown to the participants, and often in the form of transphobic insults, intersectional sexist, homophobic and/or racist insults, outing their identity, threats of harm, and sexual harassment. Participants even reported transphobic cyberbullying from other transgender individuals, usually by policing or outing their identity.\nOnline transphobia has potential to lead to real-world violence and threats. An example of this is when far-right Twitter account Libs of TikTok made a series of posts spreading misinformation that Boston Children's Hospital was performing hysterectomies on minors. This led to a series of death threats and bomb threats being made against the hospital and individual physicians, and individual physicians being doxxed and harassed in person. Libs of TikTok has similarly posted about several other LGBT-themed events, such as Drag Queen Story Hours, often leading to said events receiving mass threats of violence and being canceled or postponed by organizers.\nThe LGBT grooming conspiracy theory\u2014claiming that LGBTQ people and allies are systematically grooming children\u2014has been promoted online by both users and mainstream politicians such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. Former US President Donald Trump claimed in a video posted to Truth Social on 31 January 2023, that \"the left-wing gender insanity being pushed at our children is an act of child abuse\" and that if re-elected, he would pass numerous laws significantly limiting gender-affirming care for minors. One study on Twitter found that use of the term \"groomer\" in tweets spiked on multiple occasions, including the passing of the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, the signing into law of said act, and Twitter posting a statement that tweets calling transgender or nonbinary people \"groomers\" violates its hate speech policy.\nDespite Twitter's prior public stance against transphobia and homophobia on its platform, the company was criticized by organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign for being inefficient. One audit by the organization found that Twitter failed to act on 99 out of 100 of the most viewed anti-LGBT tweets between January and July 2022. The acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk has led to a significant increase in hate speech, especially in terms of anti-LGBTQ content. Following Musk's takeover, tweets linking LGBT people to grooming rose by 119%, and retweets and mentions of right-wing figures' anti-LGBT tweets increased by over 1200%. Under Elon Musk, Twitter has also relaxed transgender hate speech policies, such as misgendering. \"GLAAD\" described Twitter as \"the most dangerous platform for LGBTQ people\", ranking the lowest on its Social Media Safety Index.\nSimilarly, a 2020 study on Facebook by Media Matters for America found that right-leaning sources took up a vast majority of interactions in transgender topics compared to left-leaning or queer sources, with anti-LGBT outlets such as The Daily Wire and LifeSiteNews earning the highest engagements out of any source analyzed in the study.\nIn religion.\nIn Christianity.\nIn North America, organizations associated with the Christian right, including the American Family Association, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, believe that \"transgenderism\" is unnatural and that transgender people are and remain the sex they were assigned at birth. These organizations oppose laws and policies intended to accommodate transgender people, such as allowing them to change their legal sex, use the washroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify, or become ordained Christian ministers. It is their position that God created people's bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and natural law, and that the Bible refers to male and female only.\nAccording to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under Pope John Paul II, the Holy See first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.\nTransgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity. One author says \"expectations [based on gender] are usually predicated upon our genitalia and begin from the moment of birth, continuing throughout our lives.\" Many Christian denominations use biblical notions of gender and gender roles to support their views. These include \"So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them\" (Genesis 1:27) and \"The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God\" (Deuteronomy 22:5).\nViews of gender identity based on the Christian faith do not always coincide with the perspectives of transgender individuals. However, if they do not conform to these expectations, they may face rejection. Many transgender Christians seek out an \"individualized relationship with God\", often facing \"a period of denial and struggle\" as well as depression, disconnection, dissatisfaction, and spiritual difficulty before \"discovering a sense of self that feels integral and true\". Many transgender individuals face barriers within the church, such as \"fear and unfamiliarity on the part of the congregation, language issues, physical layout that separates people by gender, programs that exclude or separate by gender, pathologizing or designating trans issues as sinful, and overt hostility\".\nIn Islam.\nThe Islamic faith has historically supported heteronormative, binary gender identification. This support is reinforced by cultural norms and traditional readings of sacred texts which prohibit a wide range of identities. Despite this history, progressive Muslims have built arguments that support transgender Muslims on long-established doctrine, and support for gender transition has even been found among influential conservative scholars.\nIn 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt's Al-Azhar, the world's oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see transgender rights in Iran). The foundation for this accepting attitude in contrast to intolerance of homosexuality is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual. Despite this acceptance among some conservative Muslim scholars and leaders, transgender individuals within the Muslim community still face particular challenges.\nToday, there are some Muslim communities that explicitly welcome transgender Muslims, including some which have trans leadership. Masjid Al-Rabia, founded in 2017, is a trans-led, women-centred, LGBTQ+ affirming mosque based in Chicago, IL. In Northampton, Massachusetts, the Pioneer Valley Progressive Muslims (Masjid Al-Inshirah) was founded in 2010 by a transgender Muslim. Muslims for Progressive Values has founded Unity Mosques in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California; as well as outside the United States. The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity hosts an annual retreat for LGBTQ+ Muslims in Pennsylvania each May. The Trans and Muslim Project of TransFaith is a project devoted specifically to the support of transgender Muslims.\nIn language.\nTransphobia can manifest in attacks on inclusive language. Dorothee Beck writes that gender-inclusive language \"is a trigger point for 'anti-gender' attacks,\" and describes it as \"an important aspect of a broader political 'crusade' against gender.\" Lucy Jones writes, in her review of scholarly literature on language, gender, and sexuality, that anti-gender and gender-critical actors often resist the adoption of inclusive and nonbinary language, particularly in relation to pronouns and the recognition of transgender and nonbinary identities. Jones notes that gender-critical actors frequently reject linguistic practices that affirm trans and nonbinary identities, often citing the preservation of \"sex-based rights\" as justification. She observes that this resistance is typically framed by a binary and essentialist ideology that defines \"woman\" exclusively as someone assigned female at birth. Drawing on this scholarship, Jones characterizes gender-critical resistance to inclusive language as part of a broader \"cisnormative preoccupation with trans people's bodies\" and a form of linguistic policing aimed at denying the legitimacy of trans and nonbinary identities. Jones situates these discursive patterns within a wider political context by citing Borba (2022), who examines the emergence of an \"anti-gender register\" used in trans-exclusionary discourse, including gender-critical feminism. Borba argues that this register, which draws on essentialist ideas about sex and gender, has gained traction through a process of enregisterment, a way of making certain ideological positions appear natural or commonsensical. He further suggests that this has been achieved in part by appropriating the language of feminist and LGBTQ+ antidiscrimination activism, reframing it to emphasize threats to the rights of cisgender women and children.\nIn law.\nScholars have highlighted the activity of anti-trans voices in international legal arenas in the 2020s. Legal scholars Tamsin Phillipa Paige and Claerwen O'Hara describe what they call an increasingly aggressive anti-queer and transphobic movement that is now active also in legal circles, citing the activities of Reem Alsalem as a prominent example.\nIn feminism.\nIn her cross-cultural study on prejudice against transgender people, social psychologist Jaime L. Napier found that while prejudice against transgender people is more common in men, it is also found among some self-identified feminists, highlighting Sweden as an outlier and the only country in her research where anti-trans prejudice was more common among women.\nSome positions within feminism have been considered transphobic. This may include criticism of transitioning or sex reassignment surgery (SRS) as a personal choice or medical invention, or the position that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be allowed access to women-only spaces. Some second-wave feminists perceive trans men and women respectively as \"traitors\" and \"infiltrators\" to womanhood.\nSecond-wave feminist and activist Gloria Steinem expressed concerns in 1977 about transsexuality and SRS, writing that in many cases, transsexuals \"surgically mutilate their own bodies.\" She concluded that \"feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.\" For some years, this led to Steinem being characterized as transphobic. In 2013, she repudiated the interpretation of her text as an altogether condemnation of SRS, stating that her position was informed by accounts of gay men choosing to transition as a way of coping with societal homophobia. She added that she sees transgender people as living \"authentic lives\" that should be \"celebrated\".\nRadical feminist Janice Raymond's 1979 book, \"The Transsexual Empire\", was and is still controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries. In the book Raymond says, \"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive\" and that trans people should be \"morally mandated out of existence\".\nAnother site of conflict between feminists and trans women has been the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival. In the early 1990s, the festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder. In 2014, the festival \"passionately rejected\" accusations that it believed transgender women are \"less than\" other women. The activist group Camp Trans had protested the \"womyn-born-womyn\" intention and advocated for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. The festival had considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, but this was criticized as classist, as many trans women cannot afford sex reassignment surgery.\nTrans women such as Sandy Stone challenged the feminist conception of \"biological woman\". Stone worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased. The debate continued in Raymond's book, which devoted a chapter to criticism of \"the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist.\" Groups like Lesbian Organization of Toronto then voted to exclude trans lesbians. Sheila Jeffreys described \"transgenderism\" as \"deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights.\"\nThe work of poststructuralist feminist and lesbian Judith Butler, particularly their books \"Gender Trouble\" (1990) and \"Bodies That Matter\" (1993), argues that the \"violent inscription\" of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those who do not conform to such binaristic gender dichotomies.\nFeminists who oppose the inclusion of trans women in women's spaces have been labeled \"TERFs\", short for \"trans-exclusionary radical feminists\". Some of those at whom the term is directed, in turn, have perceived their labeling as \"TERF\" to be a slur.\nIn gay, lesbian, and bisexual communities.\nTransphobia is documented in the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities, despite historic cooperation between these communities in campaigns for equality.\nAuthors and observers, such as transgender author Jillian Todd Weiss, have written that \"there are social and political forces that have created a split between gay/lesbian communities and bisexual/transgender communities, and these forces have consequences for civil rights and community inclusion. 'Biphobia' and 'transphobia' are a result of these social and political forces, not psychological forces causing irrational fears in aberrant individuals.\"\nGay and lesbian communities.\nHistorian Joanne Meyerowitz documented transphobia within the gay rights movement in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of Christine Jorgensen. Jorgensen, who made frequent homophobic remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In 1953, for example, \"ONE\" magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a \"sweeping disservice\" to gay men. \"As far as the public knows,\" Winters wrote, \"you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it.\" For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine,\" which, he said, \"they are not.\" Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the \"reasoning\" that led \"to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment \u2013 and worse.\" In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.\u2014\u200a\nSeveral prominent figures in second wave feminism have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of \"The Transsexual Empire\" by radical lesbian feminist Janice Raymond, who popularized the term \"shemale\" as derogatory slur referring to trans women in 1994, and her statements on transsexuality and transsexual people have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as extremely transphobic and as constituting hate speech.\nIn 1950s America, there was a debate among gay men and women about those who felt they were of the opposite sex. Gay men and women who were trying to melt quietly into the majority society criticized them as \"freaks\" who brought unwanted disreputable attention upon them. Such attitudes were widespread at the time.\nSome trans men face rejection from lesbian communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, \"there are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease\", stating that this was \"shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world\". Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, the first time the 'womyn-born womyn only' policy has been used against trans males, women supporting the transgender community and young gender-variant women.\nIn the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, feminist and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer Beth Elliott became the focus of debate over whether to include transgender lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.\nBisexual communities and binarism.\nOne view is that the word \"bisexual\" is transphobic, as \"bi\" means \"two\" (thus implying a belief in the binary view of gender). Some people, such as scholar Shiri Eisner, say that some make the claim that the term \"erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence\", as many dictionaries define bisexuality as \"of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of either sex\", \"sexually attracted to both men and women\" and other similar definitions.\nHowever, some bisexual individuals and scholars object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since \"bisexual\" is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than one or more than two genders and is occasionally defined as such. Others, such as the American Institute of Bisexuality, say that the term \"is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions\" and that \"the scientific classification \"bisexual\" only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation.\"\nTo deal with issues related to transphobia and the gender binary, some individuals have taken on terms such as \"pansexual\", \"omnisexual\", or \"polysexual\" in place of the term \"bisexual\". The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that these terms \"describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with these labels are also bisexual\" and that the notion that bisexuality is a reinforcement of a gender binary is a concept that is founded upon \"anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world\". Eisner agrees with this view, stating that \"allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life\" and that the allegations are an attempt to separate the bisexual and transgender communities politically.\nConsequences.\nWhether intentional or not, transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low self-esteem, alienation and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or self-harming. Suicide rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.\nChildhood and adolescence.\nPolyvictimization is experiencing multiple forms of abuse and victimization throughout a person's life, such as physical or sexual violence, bullying/aggression, parental neglect or abuse, experiencing crime, etc. Polyvictimization can start in childhood and has consequences for adolescent health and thus adult health. \nTransgender, gender diverse, and sexual minority adolescents (TGSA) are more likely to experience polyvictimization when compared to their cisgender peers. Family traits more associated with polyvictimization in TGSA include: families that have higher than average levels of violence and adversity in their life, families that give their child higher than average levels of microaggressions and lower levels of microaffirmations, and families that have average levels of violence and adversity, and also give their child higher levels of microaffirmations. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by TGSA has shown to be a significant link between TGSA grouped by their family experiences and polyvictimization.\nResearch supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) assessed lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and noted that those who had moderate to high, and steady or increasing rates of victimization or verbal or physical threats, were at heightened risk for developing PTSD. Relational and physical bullying victimization, as well as various other forms of emotional distress, are increasingly experienced by the transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescent population. Those who experience the most physical and relational bullying victimization and emotional distress, are AMAB youth whom others perceived as very, or mostly, feminine. Moreover, regardless of assigned gender at birth, relational bullying victimization, depression, and suicidal ideation is common among adolescents that can be perceived as anything other than very, or mostly, masculine.\nRepeatedly, research on the effects of aggression and violence against TGD youth and young adults shows \u2013 when compared to their cisgender peers \u2013 higher rates of PTSD, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, intent, plan, and attempts, higher rates of substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana), trauma, skipping school due to safety concerns, and poorer health outcomes.\nThe 2015 United States Transgender Survey, the largest such survey ever carried out (with 27,715 respondents), found that one in ten respondents suffered transphobic violence at the hands of a family member and 8% were forced to leave their homes for being transgender. The majority of those who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender at school were victims of some form of mistreatment on account of this, including verbal abuse (54%), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%). 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they had to leave school. Support from one's community or family was correlated with more positive outcomes related to mental health and social functioning.\nAdulthood.\nIn adulthood, the effects of aggression and violence against various groups of transgender people has also been documented in domains such as mental and physical health, and safety and discrimination in the military. Transgender related bias, or discrimination, victimization, and rejection, affects transgender adults and the severity of PTSD symptoms they report. A systematic review completed in 2018 examined 77 studies that reported mental health disparities and social stress felt by TGD adults. The analysis found associations between TGD identity and anxiety, depression, PTSD, substance use, and suicidality, as well as added social stress factors such as violence, discrimination, and exclusion. When examining posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use in transgender adult communities, records indicated that transgender adults who have PTSD are more likely to be diagnosed with a substance use disorder within their lifetime. A National Institute of Health (NIH) analysis conducted with data collected at a community health center in the United States compared transgender and cisgender adult patients on various possible health disparities. Their research showed that within their lifetime, transgender patients experienced more violence, childhood abuse, discrimination, and suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts when compared to their cisgender counterparts who had a similar age, education, ethnicity/race, and income.\nUnited States military.\nStrong associations between military sexual assault (MSA) and PTSD have been documented in both men and women. A nationwide survey of military personnel in 2015 found that 17.2% of transgender veterans reported experiencing MSA. Links have been found between MSA experienced by transgender veterans and increased depression symptom severity, past-year drug use, and PTSD symptom severity.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder has also been associated with suicidality and substance use among adults. For instance, records reflect that veterans who identify as transgender increasingly experience PTSD and suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. Further, transgender specific stigma experienced while in the military and PTSD have been associated with deaths by suicide.\nThis could be worsened by racial health disparities that exist within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Particularly, racial health disparities between non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans (BTV) and non-Hispanic White transgender veterans (WTV) have been acknowledged. Non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans are at increased odds of having an array of physical health issues/diseases, serious mental illnesses, alcohol use, tobacco use, homelessness, and previous incarceration when compared to the WTV. Non-Hispanic White transgender veterans had increased odds of depression, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia when compared to BTV. Previous incarceration plays a larger role in the PTSD and homelessness that transgender veterans may experience. Specifically, transgender veterans that have a history of previous incarceration are more likely to have PTSD or to experience homelessness when compared to previously incarcerated veterans who are not transgender.\nPoverty and homelessness.\nNearly one third of U.S. transgender people responding to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey lived in poverty, compared to 14% of the population. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 30% of employed transgender people were either fired or mistreated for being transgender, from verbal abuse to sexual violence. 30% had been homeless at some point in their life, and 12% had been homeless during the previous year. Family and community support were correlated with significantly lower rates of homelessness and poverty.\nViolence and harassment.\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and 9% had been physically attacked for being transgender. 10% had been sexually assaulted during the previous year, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their life.\nEvidence collected by the Transgender Day of Remembrance and National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs on the homicide rates of transgender individuals suggests that the homicide rates of young trans women who are Black or Latina are \"almost certainly higher\" than those of cisgender women of the same race.\nIn public restrooms.\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 12% of respondents reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom. 1% reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender, and 1% reported being otherwise physically assaulted for being transgender. 9% reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.\nHealth.\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 59% of respondents reported avoiding using a public restroom out of fear of violence or harassment. 32% limited the amount they ate or drank in order to avoid using a public restroom. 8% reported suffering a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or other kidney problem as a result of avoiding public restrooms.\n33% reported having negative experiences with a healthcare professional related to being transgender, such as verbal harassment or denial of treatment. 23% reported that they did not seek treatment for a condition out of fear of being mistreated, while 33% did not seek treatment because they were unable to afford it.\nDuring the month prior to the survey, 39% of American transgender people experienced major psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population of the United States. 40% had attempted suicide at some point in their life, compared to 4.6 percent of the American population. Family and community support were correlated with far lower rates of suicide attempts and of major psychological distress.\nA study conducted on transgender women of color in San Francisco has shown a higher correlation between transphobia and risk of transgender women engaging in HIV risk behavior. The study shows that the transgender youth face social discrimination, and they may not have a social role model. The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.\nMental health.\nPeople who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).\nAccording to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%. In India, 31% to 50% of transgender people have tried to commit suicide before age 20. 50% of transgender people in Australia and 45% of those in England have attempted suicide at least once. In the United States, suicide attempts reported by transgender and gender nonconforming adults exceed the rate of the general population: 41% versus 4.6 percent. In San Francisco alone, the suicide attempt rate among transgender people is 32% overall, and for those under age 25 it is 50%.\nAccording to the study \"Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color\" by the University of California, San Francisco, transphobia affects the psychological vulnerability of transgender people of color as compared to those of other ethnicities. Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated. Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.\nInformation regarding the effects of transphobia with respect to minority identities has not been well documented. In a 2018 review of mental health research regarding transgender individuals, only 4 out of 77 studies that were reviewed examined the intersectionality of transgender and racial identities. There were other studies that included disproportionately high amounts of transgender individuals who are in multiple minority groups, but the authors note that it is difficult to tell if these studies generalize to the transgender/ gender nonconforming community as a whole due to lack of extensive study.\nTo help transgender people work through traumatic experiences, minority stress, and internalized transphobia, mental health practitioners have begun integrating the gender-affirmative model into cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy.\nPregnancy issues.\nMany transgender people transition without undergoing surgery to remove reproductive organs or to reconstruct genitals, thus transition does not necessarily remove the ability or the desire to reproduce. While the same-sex issues surrounding the birth and parenting of children have gained a degree of acceptance, trans practices of parenting have received much less attention and acceptance. In 2007 a transgender man, Thomas Beatie, became pregnant because his wife was infertile. His pregnancy drew world-wide attention. He commented:\nDoctors have discriminated against us, turning us away due to their religious beliefs. Health care professionals have refused to call me by a male pronoun or recognize Nancy as my wife. Receptionists have laughed at us. Friends and family have been unsupportive; most of Nancy's family doesn't even know I'm transgender.\nCountering prejudice.\nThe contact hypothesis is the influential theory that contact between groups reduces prejudice. The findings from a 2009 study by Mark E. King, PhD and his colleagues supported that the contact can reduce prejudice towards transgender people, in a studied Hong Kong population. Walch \"et al.\" (2012) found a significant reduction in prejudice following viewership of a transgender speaker panel. In 2020, professor Jordan R. Axt and colleagues found an association between tested subjects' results in \"a novel Implicit Association Test (IAT) assessing implicit attitudes toward transgender people\", and their beliefs about transgender people, as well as their contact with transgender people. However, Cheso \"et al.\" (2024) suggested contact has a larger effect in reducing prejudice towards transgender people depending on certain factors, such as the level of knowledge about transgender people, and the level of contact quality.\nFindings from Fitzgerald \"et al.\" (2023) suggested that intergroup contact with lesbian, gay, or bisexual people also had \"secondary transfer effects\" that reduced prejudice against transgender people.\nA study published 2016 found that ten minute deep canvassing conversations could reduce transphobia, with \"decreases greater than Americans' average decrease in homophobia from 1998 to 2012.\" The effect persisted in a follow-up survey three months later.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67088", "revid": "461300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67088", "title": "Conservation of energy", "text": "Law of physics and chemistry\nThe law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be \"conserved\" over time. In the case of a closed system, the principle says that the total amount of energy within the system can only be changed through energy entering or leaving the system. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes. If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the kinetic energy and potential energy of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.\nClassically, the conservation of energy was distinct from the conservation of mass. However, special relativity shows that mass is related to energy and vice versa by formula_1, the equation representing mass\u2013energy equivalence, and science now takes the view that mass-energy as a whole is conserved. This implies that mass can be converted to energy, and vice versa. This is observed in the nuclear binding energy of atomic nuclei, where a mass defect is measured. It is believed that mass-energy equivalence becomes important in extreme physical conditions, such as those that likely existed in the universe very shortly after the Big Bang or when black holes emit Hawking radiation.\nGiven the stationary-action principle, the conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by Noether's theorem as a consequence of continuous time translation symmetry; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\nA consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist; that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings. Depending on the definition of energy, the conservation of energy can arguably be violated by general relativity on the cosmological scale. In quantum mechanics, Noether's theorem is known to apply to the expected value, making any consistent conservation violation provably impossible, but whether individual conservation-violating events could ever exist or be observed is subject to some debate.\nHistory.\nAncient philosophers as far back as Thales of Miletus c.\u00a0550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify their theories with what we know today as \"mass-energy\" (for example, Thales thought it was water). Empedocles (490\u2013430 BCE) wrote that in his universal system, composed of four roots (earth, air, water, fire), \"nothing comes to be or perishes\"; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement. Epicurus (c. 350 BCE) on the other hand believed everything in the universe to be composed of indivisible units of matter\u2014the ancient precursor to 'atoms'\u2014and he too had some idea of the necessity of conservation, stating that \"the sum total of things was always such as it is now, and such it will ever remain.\"\nIn 1605, the Flemish scientist Simon Stevin was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that perpetual motion was impossible.\nIn 1639, Galileo published his analysis of several situations\u2014including the celebrated \"interrupted pendulum\"\u2014which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.\nIn 1669, Christiaan Huygens published a brief account on his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momenta as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his \"Horologium Oscillatorium\", Huygens gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of perpetual motion. His study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle, known as Torricelli's Principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object, or collection of objects, cannot lift itself. Using this principle, Huygens was able to derive the formula for the center of oscillation by an \"energy\" method, without dealing with forces or torques.\nBetween 1676 and 1689, Gottfried Leibniz first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy that is associated with \"motion\" (kinetic energy). Using Huygens's work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several masses \"mi\", each with velocity \"vi\"),\nformula_2\nwas conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the \"vis viva\" or \"living force\" of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction. Many physicists at that time, including Isaac Newton, held that the conservation of momentum, which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the momentum:\nformula_3\nwas the conserved \"vis viva\". It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously given the proper conditions, such as in an elastic collision.\nIn 1687, Isaac Newton published his \"Principia\", which set out his laws of motion. It was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.\nBy the 1690s, Leibniz was arguing that conservation of \"vis viva\" and conservation of momentum undermined the then-popular philosophical doctrine of interactionist dualism. (During the 19th century, when conservation of energy was better understood, Leibniz's basic argument would gain widespread acceptance. Some modern scholars continue to champion specifically conservation-based attacks on dualism, while others subsume the argument into a more general argument about causal closure.)\nThe law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, Johann and Daniel Bernoulli. The former enunciated the principle of virtual work as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his \"Hydrodynamica\", published in 1738, on this single vis viva conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate Bernoulli's principle, which asserts the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.\nThis focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the D'Alembert's principle, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian formulations of mechanics.\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy\u2014as indicated by the quantity of material displaced\u2014was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height from which the balls were dropped, equal to the initial potential energy. Some earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had believed that \"energy\" was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics, the correct formula is formula_4, where formula_5 is the kinetic energy of an object, formula_6 its mass and formula_7 its speed. On this basis, du Ch\u00e2telet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to consider it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat, ...).\nEngineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, Carl Holtzmann, Gustave-Adolphe Hirn, and Marc Seguin recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. Academics such as John Playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.\nGradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of \"vis viva\". In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of \"vis viva\" and caloric theory. Count Rumford's 1798 observations of heat generation during the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat and (that it was important) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). \"Vis viva\" then started to be known as \"energy\", after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas Young in 1807.\nThe recalibration of \"vis viva\" to\nformula_8\nwhich can be understood as converting kinetic energy to work, was largely the result of Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and Jean-Victor Poncelet over the period 1819\u20131839. The former called the quantity \"quantit\u00e9 de travail\" (quantity of work) and the latter, \"travail m\u00e9canique\" (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculations.\nIn the paper \"\u00dcber die Natur der W\u00e4rme\" (German \"On the Nature of Heat/Warmth\"), published in the in 1837, Karl Friedrich Mohr gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy: \"besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called \"Kraft\" [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others.\"\nMechanical equivalent of heat.\nA key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the \"mechanical equivalent of heat\". The caloric theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.\nIn the middle of the eighteenth century, Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.\nIn 1798, Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.\nThe mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon Julius Robert von Mayer in 1842. Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the Dutch East Indies, where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less oxygen, and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate. He discovered that heat and mechanical work were both forms of energy, and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.\nMeanwhile, in 1843, James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In one of them, now called the \"Joule apparatus\", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.\nOver the period 1840\u20131843, similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig A. Colding, although it was little known outside his native Denmark.\nBoth Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.\nIn 1844, the Welsh scientist William Robert Grove postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, light, electricity, and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations of a single \"force\" (\"energy\" in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book \"The Correlation of Physical Forces\". In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, Sadi Carnot, and \u00c9mile Clapeyron, Hermann von Helmholtz arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book \"\u00dcber die Erhaltung der Kraft\" (\"On the Conservation of Force\", 1847). The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.\nIn 1850, the Scottish mathematician William Rankine first used the phrase \"the law of the conservation of energy\" for the principle.\nIn 1877, Peter Guthrie Tait claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". This is now regarded as an example of Whig history.\nMass\u2013energy equivalence.\nMatter is composed of atoms and what makes up atoms. Matter has \"intrinsic\" or \"rest\" mass. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century, it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity showed that rest mass corresponds to an equivalent amount of \"rest energy\". This means that \"rest mass\" can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of (non-material) forms of energy, for example, kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth-century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the \"total\" mass or \"total\" energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.\nFor example, an electron and a positron each have rest mass. They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into photons which have electromagnetic radiant energy but no rest mass. If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total \"mass\" nor the total \"energy\" of the system will change. The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.\nThus, conservation of energy (\"total\", including material or \"rest\" energy) and conservation of mass (\"total\", not just \"rest\") are one (equivalent) law. In the 18th century, these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.\nConservation of energy in beta decay.\nThe discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus. This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by Enrico Fermi who proposed the correct description of beta-decay as the emission of both an electron and an antineutrino, which carries away the apparently missing energy.\nFirst law of thermodynamics.\nFor a closed thermodynamic system, the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:\nformula_9, or equivalently, formula_10\nwhere formula_11 is the quantity of energy added to the system by a heating process, formula_12 is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to work done by the system on its surroundings, and formula_13 is the change in the internal energy of the system.\nThe \u03b4's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the formula_13 increment of internal energy (see Inexact differential). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy formula_15 is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term \"heat energy\" for formula_11 means \"that amount of energy added as a result of heating\" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term \"work energy\" for formula_12 means \"that amount of energy lost as a result of work\". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as a result of work being performed on or by the system.\nEntropy is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.\nFor a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:\nformula_18\nwhere formula_19 is the pressure and formula_20 is a small change in the volume of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called \"quasi-static\", and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, the heat energy may be written\nformula_21\nwhere formula_22 is the temperature and formula_23 is a small change in the entropy of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of the state of a system.\nIf an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written as\nformula_24\nwhere formula_25 is the added mass of species formula_26 and formula_27 is the corresponding enthalpy per unit mass. Note that generally formula_28 in this case, as matter carries its own entropy. Instead, formula_29, where formula_30 is the entropy per unit mass of type formula_26, from which we recover the fundamental thermodynamic relation\nformula_32\nbecause the chemical potential formula_33 is the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species formula_26 and the Gibbs free energy formula_35.\nNoether's theorem.\nThe conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of Noether's theorem, developed by Emmy Noether in 1915 and first published in 1918. In any physical theory that obeys the stationary-action principle, the theorem states that every continuous symmetry has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance, then the conserved quantity is called \"energy\". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as \"nothing depends on time per se\". In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the continuous symmetry of time translation, then its energy (which is the canonical conjugate quantity to time) is conserved. Conversely, systems that are not invariant under shifts in time (e.g. systems with time-dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy\u00a0\u2013 unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time-invariant again. Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in physical theories such as special relativity and quantum theory (including QED) in the flat space-time.\nSpecial relativity.\nWith the discovery of special relativity by Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Albert Einstein, the energy was proposed to be a component of an energy-momentum 4-vector. Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given inertial reference frame. Also conserved is the vector length (Minkowski norm), which is the rest mass for single particles, and the invariant mass for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated).\nThe relativistic energy of a single massive particle contains a term related to its rest mass in addition to its kinetic energy of motion. In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the rest frame) of a massive particle, or else in the center of momentum frame for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the total energy of a particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is proportional to the rest mass or invariant mass, as described by the equation formula_36.\nThus, the rule of \"conservation of energy\" over time in special relativity continues to hold, so long as the reference frame of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the invariant mass, which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the energy\u2013momentum relation.\nGeneral relativity.\nGeneral relativity introduces new phenomena. In an expanding universe, photons spontaneously redshift and tethers spontaneously gain tension; if vacuum energy is positive, the total vacuum energy of the universe appears to spontaneously increase as the volume of space increases. Some scholars claim that energy is no longer meaningfully conserved in any identifiable form.\nJohn Baez's view is that energy\u2013momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum pseudotensor. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics, notably the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric that appears to govern the universe, do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined. Besides being dependent on the coordinate system, pseudotensor energy is dependent on the type of pseudotensor in use; for example, the energy exterior to a Kerr\u2013Newman black hole is twice as large when calculated from M\u00f8ller's pseudotensor as it is when calculated using the Einstein pseudotensor.\nFor asymptotically flat universes, Einstein and others salvage conservation of energy by introducing a specific global gravitational potential energy that cancels out mass-energy changes triggered by spacetime expansion or contraction. This global energy has no well-defined density and cannot technically be applied to a non-asymptotically flat universe; however, for practical purposes this can be finessed, and so by this view, energy is conserved in our universe. Alan Guth stated that the universe might be \"the ultimate free lunch\", and theorized that, when accounting for gravitational potential energy, the net energy of the Universe is zero.\nQuantum theory.\nIn quantum mechanics, the energy of a quantum system is described by a self-adjoint (or Hermitian) operator called the Hamiltonian, which acts on the Hilbert space (or a space of wave functions) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum Noether's theorem for the energy-momentum tensor operator. Thus energy is conserved by the normal unitary evolution of a quantum system.\nHowever, when the non-unitary Born rule is applied, the system's energy is measured with an energy that can be below or above the expectation value, if the system was not in an energy eigenstate. (For macroscopic systems, this effect is usually too small to measure.) The disposition of this energy gap is not well-understood; most physicists believe that the energy is transferred to or from the macroscopic environment in the course of the measurement process, while others believe that the observable energy is only conserved \"on average\". No experiment has been confirmed as definitive evidence of violations of the conservation of energy principle in quantum mechanics, but that does not rule out that some newer experiments, as proposed, may find evidence of violations of the conservation of energy principle in quantum mechanics.\nStatus.\nIn the context of perpetual motion machines such as the Orbo, Professor Eric Ash has argued at the BBC: \"Denying [conservation of energy] would undermine not just little bits of science - the whole edifice would be no more. All of the technology on which we built the modern world would lie in ruins\". It is because of conservation of energy that \"we know - without having to examine details of a particular device - that Orbo cannot work.\"\nEnergy conservation has been a foundational physical principle for about two hundred years. From the point of view of modern general relativity, the lab environment can be well approximated by Minkowski spacetime, where energy is exactly conserved. The entire Earth can be well approximated by the Schwarzschild metric, where again energy is exactly conserved. Given all the experimental evidence, any new theory (such as quantum gravity), in order to be successful, will have to explain why energy has appeared to always be exactly conserved in terrestrial experiments. In some speculative theories, corrections to quantum mechanics are too small to be detected at anywhere near the current TeV level accessible through particle accelerators. Doubly special relativity models may argue for a breakdown in energy-momentum conservation for sufficiently energetic particles; such models are constrained by observations that cosmic rays appear to travel for billions of years without displaying anomalous non-conservation behavior. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics claim that observed energy tends to increase when the Born rule is applied due to localization of the wave function. If true, objects could be expected to spontaneously heat up; thus, such models are constrained by observations of large, cool astronomical objects as well as the observation of (often supercooled) laboratory experiments.\nMilton A. Rothman wrote that the law of conservation of energy has been verified by nuclear physics experiments to an accuracy of one part in a thousand million million (1015). He then defines its precision as \"perfect for all practical purposes\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He once held the world record for the 100 metres. He recorded a time of 9.84 seconds to become Olympic champion in 1996. He was the first Canadian to legally break the 10-second barrier in the 100\u00a0m. Particularly noted for his top speed, Bailey ran in his 1996 Olympic title run, the fastest ever recorded by a human at the time. He was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 2004 as an individual athlete and in 2008 as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4 \u00d7 100 relay team. In 2005, he was also inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nDonovan Anthony Bailey was born in Manchester Parish, Jamaica, on December 16, 1967, as the fourth of five sons to George and Daisy Bailey. Before going to Mount Olivet Primary School, he would take care of his family's chickens, goats, and pigs. Donovan was fast when he was a young boy, with his former teacher Claris Lambert recounting that \"He showed his athletic skills from grade one. He always came first in races.\"\nBefore going to Canada, Bailey competed for one year at ISSA Champs for Knox College in Manchester, Jamaica.\nBailey immigrated to Canada at age 12 and played basketball before graduating from Queen Elizabeth Park High School in Oakville, Ontario. During high school, his brother, O'Neil, won 4 Ontario Provincial titles in the long jump. Bailey was exceptionally fast as well, clocking 10.65 seconds in the 100 m at the age of 16. However, his main interest was in basketball. After graduating in June 1984, Bailey attended Sheridan College, for which he played basketball during the 1986\u20131987 school year. He graduated from Sheridan with a degree in Business Administration. Bailey then began working as a property and marketing consultant for an importing and exporting clothing company.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIt was only in 1990 that Bailey decided to begin racing professionally; after watching the 1990 Canadian Track and Field Championships, he realized that most of the men competing were men he had beaten in high school. He began training as a 100 m sprinter part-time, while working as a stockbroker. In 1991, he won the 60 metres at the Ontario Indoor Championships, and at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, Cuba, Bailey anchored Canada's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay team, to a silver medal. In 1992, Bailey finished second in the 100 m at the national championships.\nFrom 1993 to 1994, he competed for Fenerbah\u00e7e Athletics. During this time, he claimed a bronze in the 100 m and a silver in the 200 m at the 1993 national championships, a silver in the 100 m and gold in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres at the 1994 Francophone Games in Paris, and a gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia. However, despite his impressive performances at a national level, he was only chosen as an alternate for the 4 \u00d7 100 m at the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart. American coach Dan Pfaff, who coached Bailey's high school friend Glenroy Gilbert at Louisiana State University and listened to Bailey's complaints, was impressed by Bailey's performances considering his terrible form and fitness. Pfaff invited Bailey to train with him and Gilbert at LSU, and with just 3 months of training together, Bailey shaved 3 tenths of a second off of his 100 m personal best; his time of 10.03 seconds was the third fastest in Canadian history.\n1995: Breakthrough.\nOn April 22, 1995, Bailey made history by breaking the 10-second barrier for the first time in the 100 m, becoming the 18th man and 2nd Canadian to legally do so. His time of 9.99 seconds was just 4 hundredths shy of Ben Johnson's record of 9.95. In July, he broke Johnson's record with 9.91 at the national championships, the fastest time of the year, effectively asserting his name as a favorite for the gold medal at the World Championships in Gothenburg later that year. Bailey went on to win the title in 9.97 seconds, then followed it up by anchoring Canada to their first world championship gold in the 4 \u00d7 100 m.\n1996: Olympic History.\nWith a world title now under his belt, Bailey was highly considered to be a favorite for the Olympic title in Atlanta that July. As a precursor to the centennial Olympics, Bailey broke the indoor 50 m world record during a competition in Reno, Nevada in 1996. He was timed at 5.56 seconds. Maurice Greene later matched that performance in 1999, but his run was never ratified as a world record.\nBailey was officially selected to represent Canada at the 1996 Summer Olympics after winning his 3rd consecutive national title in the 100 m. On July 27, after a very disrupted start to the race, Bailey won the Olympic 100 m title setting a new world record of 9.84 seconds. During the race, he hit a top speed of 12.10\u00a0m/s (43.6\u00a0km/h or 27.1\u00a0mph), which was the fastest top speed ever recorded by a human being at the time. Many Canadians felt Bailey's victory restored the image of Canadian athletes, after the exposure of Ben Johnson's history of doping. At the time, Bailey was only the second person after Carl Lewis to hold all the major titles in the 100 m concurrently (World Champion, Olympic Champion &amp; World Record Holder). 6 days later, he completed the 100 m/4 \u00d7 100 m double once again, anchoring Canada to their first ever Olympic 4 \u00d7 100 m title in a national record of 37.69 seconds.\nRivalry with Michael Johnson.\nAfter the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, American Sportscaster Bob Costas claimed that 200 m Gold medalist Michael Johnson was faster than Bailey because Johnson's 200 m time (19.32 Seconds) divided by 2 (9.66 Seconds) was shorter than Bailey's 100 m time (9.84). This started a debate on whether Johnson or Bailey was the real \"World's Fastest Man\", which in turn resulted in a 150m race between the two, in which Bailey won after Johnson allegedly injured his hamstring.\n1997 World Championships.\nAt the 1997 World Championships in Athens, Bailey attempted to defend his 100 m title, but was beaten by Maurice Greene and was forced to settle for the silver medal in 9.91 seconds. However, along with his Canadian teammates, he was able to defend Canada's 4 \u00d7 100 m title in 37.86 seconds, the fastest time of the year. One of his last meets of the season was at the ISTAF Berlin; after finishing 2nd in the 100 m, Bailey ran the first leg of the \"Dream Team II\" in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay: Carl Lewis' last race of his career. With Leroy Burrell on the 2nd leg, Frankie Fredericks on the 3rd, and Lewis on the anchor, the team won in 38.24 seconds, a meeting record.\n1998 Goodwill Games.\nBailey and the 4 \u00d7 100 metre Canadian relay team won a silver medal with a time of 38.23 at the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York, finishing behind the United States. Bailey ruptured his Achilles tendon while playing basketball during the post season of 1998, which effectively began the end of his athletics career.\n1999 Pan American Games and World Championships.\nBailey won a silver medal with the Canadian 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay team with a time of 38.49 at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, finishing behind Brazil. The silver medal matched his first international medal he won eight years earlier at the 1991 Pan American Games in the 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay and it would be his final international medal. Bailey was part of the Canadian 4 \u00d7 100 metre relay team at the 1999 World Championships in Seville but the team was disqualified in the first round of heats.\n2000 Summer Olympics and 2001 World Championships.\nHe made a second attempt in the 2000 Summer Olympics, but suffered from pneumonia and dropped out during the rounds. He retired from the sport in 2001 after the World Championships in Edmonton, having been a three-time World and 2 time Olympic champion.\nPost-retirement.\nAfter racing, Bailey started his own company called DBX Sport Management which helps amateur athletes find a way to promote themselves. He also started a sport injury clinic in Oakville, Ontario.\nHe has been inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame twice: in 2004 as an individual, and in 2008 as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4 \u00d7 100 relay team.\nIn August 2008 Bailey began work as a track commentator for CBC Television at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He estimated that had Usain Bolt not slowed down near the end of the 100 m dash (which he still won in record time), he could have set a time of 9.55 seconds. He returned as the track analyst for CBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nIn 2010, Bailey was one of the recipients of the Top 25 Canadian Immigrant Awards presented by Canadian Immigrant Magazine.\nIn 2014, Bailey pleaded guilty to a drinking and driving charge from 2012. This was the third driving-related incident for Bailey. In 1998 he crashed his car into a concrete utility pole and was fined $200 for failing to report an accident. In 2001, Bailey was fined $975 for driving 200\u00a0km/h on a 100\u00a0km/h road in Toronto.\nIn 2016, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario. In 2017, Canada's Walk of Fame honoured him with a star.\nIn 2018, it was reported that Bailey had provided his entire athlete's trust of $3.75 million to Aird &amp; Berlis lawyer Stuart Bollefer, who invested it in what was determined to be a tax evasion scheme by the Canadian government. Bailey lost the full amount due to the scheme, however the courts ordered Aird &amp; Berlis to pay all outstanding taxes due to their negligence.\nIn 2022, Bailey was named an officer to the Order of Canada.\nPersonal bests.\nTrack records.\nAs of 9 September 2024, Bailey holds the following track records for 100 metres.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the only British man to have won gold medals in the 100 metres at all four major competitions open to British athletes: the Olympic Games, the World Championships, the European Championships and the Commonwealth Games. He was the first European athlete to break the 10-second barrier in the 100\u00a0m and held the British record in the event for close to 30 years. He is a former world indoor record holder over 200 metres, and a former European record holder in the 60 metres, 100 m and 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay.\nHe remains one of the most highly decorated British athletes of all-time. By the end of his track career Christie had won 24 medals overall, more than any other British male athlete before or since. In 1993 he was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\nChristie tested positive for a banned stimulant in 1988 during the Seoul Olympics. In 1999 he was suspended for two years by the IAAF after the banned substance nandrolone was found in a test, although he had been effectively in retirement since 1997.\nAs a coach, two of his charges, Darren Campbell and Katharine Merry, went on to win Olympic and World medals.\nEarly life and education.\nChristie was born on 2 April 1960 in Saint Andrew, Jamaica, where he was brought up by his maternal grandmother. At the age of seven he joined his parents, who had emigrated to Acton, London, England, five years before. He was educated at Henry Compton Secondary School in Fulham, London and excelled in physical education. He competed in the very first London Youth Games in 1977 for the borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham. He also joined the Air Training Corps in 1978, 336 (Hammersmith) Squadron. He did not take up athletics seriously until he was 18.\nProfessional athletics career.\nChristie's early track career was not particularly promising. A comparatively slow starter, he failed to make the Great Britain team for the 1984 Summer Olympics, not even being included in the sprint relay squad. It was not until some years after he had begun to work in earnest on his running technique under the coaching guidance of Ron Roddan in 1979 that he fulfilled his potential.\nIn 1986, he was the surprise winner of the 100\u00a0m at the European Championships and finished second in the same event at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, behind Ben Johnson. At the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Christie came fourth in the 100\u00a0m, but was later awarded the bronze medal, when winner Johnson was disqualified after admitting years of steroid use.\nAt the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Christie won the 100\u00a0m silver behind Carl Lewis after Johnson, who set a world record in 9.79\u00a0seconds, was again disqualified following a positive drug test. Christie's time was 9.97 seconds, a new European record by 0.03 seconds and this was only the third time that an athlete had broken the ten second barrier in the 100 metres without winning the race.\nIn 1992, Christie became the third British athlete to win the Olympic 100\u00a0m, after Harold Abrahams and Allan Wells, winning the title ahead of Frankie Fredericks of Namibia at the Barcelona Olympic Games. In the absence of his great rival Lewis, Christie ran 9.96\u00a0s in the final, and at the age of 32 years 121 days became the oldest Olympic 100\u00a0m champion by four years and 38 days.\nIn 1993, he became the first man in history to hold the Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth titles in the 100 m as he was victorious at the Stuttgart World Championships in his fastest ever time of 9.87. The time stood as the British record until 2023. His achievement saw him being voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year by the British public that year.\nThe following year, in 1994, he defended his Commonwealth title in Victoria in his second fastest ever 100 m time of 9.91.\nDefending his Olympic title in 1996, Christie was disqualified in the final after two false starts. He said: \"The first one I knew I did, but on the second one I felt I reacted perfectly to the gun. I have never been disqualified from a race before in my life. What a place to do it.\" His reaction time was 0.086 seconds. Under IAAF rules, sprinters are not allowed to start from their blocks faster than 0.1 seconds.\nChristie retired from representative international competition in 1997, although he continued to make appearances at invitation meetings.\nDoping allegations and ban.\nEarly allegations.\nChristie faced an International Olympic Committee disciplinary hearing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics because of an adverse drug test for the banned stimulant pseudoephedrine after he ran in the heats of the 200 m. He escaped sanction after the committee voted by a margin of 11 to 10 and gave Christie \"the benefit of the doubt.\" Christie argued that he had taken it inadvertently when drinking some ginseng tea.\nAt the 1994 European championships staged in Helsinki, where British team captain Christie won his third European 100 m title, he was caught up in a doping controversy after Solomon Wariso, a 400 m runner making his international championship debut, tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine. Wariso revealed that he had used an over-the-counter pick-you-up called \"Up Your Gas\", which Christie had bought at a Florida pharmacy.\nIn 1998, less than six months before his first positive drug test, Christie won a libel action against the journalist John McVicar. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at an age when he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs. The jury found in Christie's favour by a 10\u20132 majority. The judge ordered that McVicar should be bound by an injunction restraining him from accusing Christie of taking banned substances. The modest \u00a340,000 damages awarded were outweighed by the legal costs that Christie incurred to bring the case. After the judgment, McVicar called Christie \"The Judy Garland of the 100 metres\", referring to the emotion that Christie had displayed before the court.\nPositive drugs test and ban from athletics.\nIn February 1999, Christie competed in an indoor meet in Dortmund, Germany. A routine in competition drug test found the banned substance nandrolone. After a six-month delay, a disciplinary hearing was convened by the British Athletic Federation which found Christie to be not guilty. But the IAAF overruled and confirmed a two-year suspension. He was found to have more than 100 times threshold levels of the metabolites of nandrolone in his urine. Various explanations were offered to explain the result. \"You think that's an awful lot,\" says Professor Ron Maughan one of the UK Athletics anti-doping panellists who worked on Christie's case, \"but the amounts are so small, they would have absolutely no physiological effect, but they would trigger a doping test.\". The IAAF rejected the explanations and gave Christie a two-years ban from athletics, despite UK Athletics feeling that there was reasonable doubt whether the drug had been taken deliberately, a decision which ignored the usual drug testing principle of \"strict liability\".\nSeveral alternative theories have been proposed that might explain Christie's positive test. Nandrolone is a long-acting anabolic steroid, and is well-known in athlete circles to be detectable in blood and urine screenings for long periods; ranging from 6 to 18 months. Sceptics of Christie's positive, and other Nandrolone sanctions in the late 1990s, have cited this detection window as a major deterrent to using the drug at any point during training or competition periods. Around this time pro-hormones like 19-norandrostenedione, Androstenedione, and 1-Testosterone, among others, abounded in the American supplement market, and were not yet codified as 'anabolic agents' under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.\nChristie has always denied any wrongdoing. \"If I took drugs there had to be a reason to take drugs. I had pretty much retired from the sport.\" Furthermore, he denied that his physique was gained through drug use and promoted an anti-steroid approach: \"It does not follow that all athletes who are big take drugs ... Only by testing all athletes will the sport be kept clean of drugs.\"\nFallout following positive drugs test.\nFollowing his positive drugs test and ban from athletics, Christie was banned for life from the British Olympic Association, who announced that Christie would not be accredited for any future Olympic Games, in accordance with their regulations.\nRetirement.\nFollowing the two-year ban, Christie worked as a presenter on the BBC programmes \"Record Breakers\" and \"Garden Invaders\", and also had a contract with BBC Sport. He has spent less time as a public figure and has devoted most of his time to managing his company. In 1990 he made his acting debut in the BBC programme \"Grange Hill\". Later he appeared in another BBC programme \"Hustle\". In 2010, Christie appeared on the UK ITV television channel's \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\" show, subsequently becoming the sixth person to be eliminated, on 30 November 2010.\nDuring the McVicar case, Christie raised another of his grievances with the media \u2013 insinuating comments about the figure-hugging running suits that Christie wore in his races. The term \"Linford's lunchbox\" had been coined by \"The Sun\" newspaper in reference to the noticeable bulge of Christie's genitalia in his Lycra shorts. He said \"\"Linford's lunchbox\" is one of my grievances with the media. I don't like it ... Nobody ever goes on about Sally Gunnell's breasts ... I think it is disgusting, I don't like it at all.\" In court, the judge Mr Justice Popplewell, amused some by tactlessly asking Christie to explain the phrase, asking \"What is 'Linford's lunchbox?'\"\nChristie's anger at this unwanted attention led to his infamous \"newspaper print\" running suit, although he has deliberately drawn attention to his body on occasions: he has remarked that \"A lot of people have looked at my physique and two things can come into their mind \u2013 admiration and envy.\" He also appeared shirtless and flexing his muscles on the BBC youth series \"Reportage\" in 1988. In recent years, however, Christie appears to have come to terms with the 'lunchbox' label, disclosing his preference for briefs rather than boxer shorts, and in 2002 becoming the \"face\" of Sloggi, the men's underwear brand, posing for advertising wearing only underwear.\nIn the successful British bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, Christie was absent from the team, even though he has stated that he attempted to get involved. Christie has cited an ongoing feud between himself and former teammate Sebastian Coe, who led the bid committee, as a likely reason for the snub. Commenting on the argument, Christie's teammate, Derek Redmond, said he was \"a well-balanced athlete; he has a chip on both shoulders.\"\nHowever, in April 2006, it was announced that Christie would be a senior mentor for athletes on the national team, along with former athletes Steve Backley, Daley Thompson and Katharine Merry. This proved controversial, however, due to Christie's 2 year drugs ban in February 1997. \"I don't think he should be in that mentor role,\" said Paula Radcliffe, the former women's marathon world record-holder. \"We have to make sure that the people in that mentor role have an integrity and strong sense of ethics and morals.\"\nThe BOA confirmed that their ban on Olympic accreditation for Christie remained in place. Christie claimed that he was invited by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to be one of the carriers of the 2008 Olympic Torch on its journey through London, although Livingstone denied that he had invited Christie to undertake that role. The IOC reacted angrily to any suggestion that \"an athlete who has an Olympic ban\" could have been invited to carry the Olympic torch.\nIn 2011, Christie was convicted of careless driving, after his vehicle crashed head-on into a taxi on 8 May 2010 due to driving on the wrong side of the A413 road in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. Four people, including a newly-wed couple, were hurt.\nIn November 2023, he appeared in \"\" as Huntsman. He was voted off first.\nA documentary film about his life, titled \"Linford\", premiered on BBC One in July 2024.\nAchievements and legacy.\nReflecting upon his track career, he stated: \"I will have no complaints if people remember me as one of the best athletes in the world.\" He was the British record-holder for nearly 30 years at 100\u00a0m, with the 9.87\u00a0s he ran at the 1993 World Championships. He was the third Briton, after Harold Abrahams and Allan Wells, and the fifth European to win the 100\u00a0m at the Olympic Games, and the last to do so until 2021, when Italian Marcell Jacobs took the Olympic title in Tokyo in the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics. He remains the oldest male athlete to win the 100\u00a0metres at the Olympics at the age of 32.\nAs of 2019, Christie's British record of 9.87\u00a0seconds in the 100\u00a0metres makes him the third fastest European in history; after Francis Obikwelu's 9.86\u00a0s personal best which broke Christie's European record, and the same time achieved by French sprinter Jimmy Vicaut. His 100\u00a0m personal best fares favourably in comparison with his contemporaries: Carl Lewis and Frankie Fredericks managed 9.86 s while Leroy Burrell ran 9.85 s. Christie broke the ten-second barrier nine times, and was the first European to break the ten-second barrier. In the 1988 100 metres Olympic final, he became the first man to break the ten-second barrier and not win the race. In the 1991 World Championships 100 m final, he became the first man to break the ten-second barrier and come fourth, running 9.92 seconds.\nIn the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay event Christie's performance as anchor, alongside Colin Jackson, Tony Jarrett and John Regis, set a European record of 37.77\u00a0s at the 1993 World Championships. This was beaten six years later by a 37.73\u00a0s run by a British team, which included his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Darren Campbell. However, Christie's team's performance is still the second fastest 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m performance by a European team and one of the best by a non-United States relay team.\nOver 60 m, Christie set a European record of 6.47\u00a0s in 1995 which was beaten by fellow Briton Jason Gardener in 1999 with 6.46\u00a0s. Christie has the fourth fastest time over the distance for a European after Gardener, Ronald Pognon and the current European record holder Dwain Chambers.\nChristie also holds 3 current 35\u201339 masters age group world records. On 23 September 1995, Christie set a M35 world record of 9.97 in the 100 m which no longer stands. On 25 June 1995 he set the current M35 world record in the 200 m in 20.11 seconds and on 3 January 1997 Christie set the current indoor record in the M35 60 m in a time of 6.51 seconds.\nChristie broke the world indoor record over 200 m with 20.25\u00a0s at Li\u00e9vin in 1995, and remains the seventh fastest sprinter on the all-time list.\nHe was appointed MBE in 1990 and OBE in 1998. In 1993, the West London Stadium, where he spent much time training, was renamed the Linford Christie Stadium in his honour. Christie's claim that he started races on the \"B of the Bang\" inspired a large public sculpture of the same name. Erected as a celebration of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, it was officially unveiled by Christie in 2004. Owing to safety concerns, it was dismantled in 2009. In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame, and in 2009, he was inducted into the London Youth Games Hall of Fame.\nStatistics.\nSeasonal bests.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nNational titles.\nChristie competed during the era of dual national championships, whereby the winner at the nominally open AAA Championships was often recognised as the national champion, but a separate UK only event, the UK Athletics Championships, was also held, crowning a UK Athletics champion. Between both events, Christie accumulated 19 outdoor championship golds. Eleven of these golds were in the AAA championships which were broadly recognised as the more prestigious of the national titles.\nPersonal life.\nLinford Christie has eight children. His niece Rachel Christie was crowned Miss England in 2009 though later relinquished the title following allegations of assault. His godson Omari Patrick is a professional footballer.\nIn 1993 Christie formed a sports management and promotions company, Nuff Respect, with sprint-hurdler Colin Jackson. One of their early products was a sports training and workout video, \"The S Plan: Get Fit with Christie and Jackson\". Jackson was later to leave the enterprise, saying \"Linford has to be in control, he has to be number one, he has to be the leader.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67119", "revid": "38263822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67119", "title": "National Rally", "text": "French political party\nThe National Rally (, , RN), known as the National Front from 1972 to 2018 (, , FN), is a French far-right political party, described as right-wing populist and nationalist. It is the single largest parliamentary opposition party in the National Assembly since 2022. It opposes immigration, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration, protection of French identity, and stricter control of illegal immigration. The party advocates a \"more balanced\" and \"independent\" French foreign policy, opposing French military intervention in Africa while supporting France leaving NATO's integrated command. It also supports reform of the European Union (EU), economic interventionism, protectionism, and zero tolerance for breaches of law and order.\nThe party was founded in 1972 by the Ordre Nouveau to be the legitimate political vehicle for the far-right movement. Jean-Marie Le Pen was its founder and leader until his resignation in 2011. While its influence was marginal until 1984, the party's role as a nationalist electoral force has grown considerably. It has put forward a candidate at every presidential election but one since 1974. In the 2002 presidential election, Jean-Marie Le Pen advanced to the second round but finished a distant second in the runoff to Jacques Chirac. His daughter Marine Le Pen was elected to succeed him as party leader in 2012. Jordan Bardella assumed the leadership in 2022.\nThe party has seen an increase in its popularity and acceptance in French society in recent years. It has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism. While her father was nicknamed the \"Devil of the Republic\" by mainstream media and sparked outrage for hate speech, including Holocaust denial and Islamophobia, Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of \"de-demonisation\", trying to frame the party as being neither right nor left. She endeavoured to extract it from its far-right roots, as well as censuring controversial members like her father, who was suspended and then expelled from the party in 2015. Following her election as the leader of the party in 2011, the popularity of the FN grew. By 2015, the FN had established itself as a major political party in France. Sources traditionally label the party as far-right, though some outlets argue it has substantially moderated from its years under Le Pen to be classified as \"right-wing populist\" or \"nationalist right\".\nAt the FN congress of 2018, Marine Le Pen proposed renaming the party \"Rassemblement National\" (National Rally), and this was confirmed by a ballot of party members. Formerly strongly Eurosceptic, the National Rally changed policies in 2019, deciding to campaign for a reform of the EU rather than leaving it and to keep the euro as the main currency of France (together with the CFP franc for some collectivities). In 2021, Le Pen announced that she wanted to remain in the Schengen Area, but to reserve free movement to nationals of a European Economic Area country, excluding residents of and visitors from another Schengen country.\nLe Pen reached the second round of the 2017 presidential election, receiving 33.9% of the votes in the run-off and losing to Emmanuel Macron. Again in the 2022 election, she lost to Macron in the run-off, receiving 41.45% of the votes. In the 2022 parliamentary elections, the National Rally achieved a significant increase in the number of its MPs in the National Assembly, from 7 to 89 seats. In June 2024, the party won the European Parliament elections in a landslide with 31.4% of the votes. This caused Macron to announce a snap election. Later that month, an RN-led right-wing coalition topped the first round of the snap French legislative election with a record 33.2% of the votes. On 7 July, the RN also won the popular vote (37.06%) in the second round of the snap election, but only won the third highest number of seats.\nOn 31 March 2025, 25 National Rally members (including Le Pen, former MEPs, and their assistants) were convicted of embezzlement for using European Parliament funds to fund National Front staff from 2004 to 2016. The sentences for several MEPs, including Le Pen, included bans on running for political office.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe party's ideological roots can be traced to both Poujadism, a populist, small business tax protest movement founded in 1953 by Pierre Poujade and on right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to the colony of French Algeria, (many , including Le Pen, were part of an inner circle of returned servicemen known as ). During the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small, extreme movements such as , (GUD), and the (ON).\nEspousing France's Catholic and monarchist traditions, one of the primary progenitors of the ideology generally promoted by FN was the , founded at the end of the 19th century, and its descendants in the \"Restauration Nationale\", a pro-monarchy group that supports the claim of the Count of Paris to the French throne.\nEarly years.\nFoundation (1972\u20131973).\nWhile \"Ordre Nouveau\" had competed in some local elections since 1970, at its second congress, in June 1972, it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections. The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity (\"Front national pour l'unit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise\"), or Front National. In order to create a broad movement, ON sought to model the new party on the more established Italian Social Movement (MSI), which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition of the Italian hard right. The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo. ON wanted to unite the various French far-right currents, and brought together \"nationals\" of Le Pen's group and Roger Holeindre's Party of French Unity; \"nationalists\" from Pierre Bousquet's \"Militant\" movement or Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau's and Alain Robert's Ordre Nouveau; the anti-Gaullist Georges Bidault's Justice and Liberty movement; as well as former Poujadists, Algerian War veterans, and some monarchists, among others. Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party, as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure in the far-right.\nThe National Front fared poorly in the 1973 legislative elections, receiving 0.5% of the national vote, although Le Pen won 5% in his Paris constituency. In 1973, the party created a youth movement, the \"Front national de la jeunesse\" (National Front of Youth; FNJ). The rhetoric used in the campaign stressed old, far-right themes and was largely uninspiring to the electorate at the time. Otherwise, its official program at this point was relatively moderate, differing little from the mainstream right's. Le Pen sought the \"total fusion\" of the currents in the party, and warned against \"crude activism.\" The FNJ were banned from the party later that year. The move towards the mainstream cost it many leading members and much of its militant base.\nIn the 1974 presidential election, Le Pen failed to find a mobilising theme for his campaign, since many of its platform's major issues, such as anti-communism, were shared by most of the mainstream right. Other FN issues included calls for increased French birth rates, immigration reduction (although this was downplayed), establishment of a professional army, abrogation of the \u00c9vian Accords, and generally the creation of a \"French and European renaissance.\" Despite being the only nationalist candidate, he failed to gain the support of the whole of the far-right, as the various groups either rallied behind other candidates or called for voter abstention. The campaign further lost ground when the Revolutionary Communist League made public a report of Le Pen's alleged involvement in torture during his time in Algeria. In his first participation in a presidential election, Le Pen won only 0.8% of the national vote.\nFN\u2013PFN rivalry (1973\u20131981).\nFollowing the 1974 election, the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces (PFN), founded by FN dissidents (largely from the ON). Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s. Along with the growing influence of Fran\u00e7ois Duprat and his \"revolutionary nationalists\", the FN gained several new groups of supporters in the late 1970s and early 1980s: Jean-Pierre Stirbois (1977) and his \"solidarists\", Bruno Gollnisch (1983), Bernard Antony (1984) and his Catholic fundamentalists, as well as Jean-Yves Le Gallou (1985) and the Nouvelle Droite. Following the death of Duprat in a bomb attack in 1978, the revolutionary nationalists left the party, while Stirbois became Le Pen's deputy as his solidarists effectively ousted the neo-fascist tendency in the party leadership. A radical group split off in 1980 and founded the French Nationalist Party, dismissing the FN as becoming \"too Zionist\" with Le Pen being a \"puppet of the Jews.\" The far right was marginalised altogether in the 1978 legislative elections, although the PFN came out better off. In the first election for the European Parliament in 1979, the PFN became part of an attempt to build a \"Euro-Right\" alliance of the continent's far-right parties, and was in the end the only one of the two that contested the election. It fielded Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour as its primary candidate, while Le Pen called for voter abstention.\nFor the 1981 presidential election, both Le Pen and Pascal Gauchon of the PFN declared their intentions to run. However, an increased requirement regarding obtaining signatures of support from elected officials had been introduced for the election, which left both Le Pen and Gauchon unable to participate.\nThe election was won by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of the Socialist Party (PS), a results that brought the political left to national power for the first time in the Fifth Republic; Mitterrand immediately dissolved the National Assembly and called a snap legislative election. With only three weeks to prepare its campaign, the FN fielded only a limited number of candidates and won only 0.2% of the national vote. The PFN was even worse off, and the election marked the effective end of competition from the party. The Socialists attained their best ever result with an absolute majority in the 1981 legislative election.\nThe \"socialist takeover\" led to a radicalisation in centre-right, anti-communist, and anti-socialist voters.\nJean-Marie Le Pen's leadership.\nElectoral breakthrough (1982\u20131988).\nWhile the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear-cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s, the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid-1980s. This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable, particularly after the Socialists' \"austerity turn\" (\"tournant de la rigueur\") of 1983, in turn inducing them to seek out to new political alternatives. By October 1982, Le Pen supported the prospect of deals with the mainstream right, provided that the FN did not have to soften its position on \"key issues.\" In the 1983 municipal elections, the centre-right Rally for the Republic (RPR) and the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns. The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11% of the vote. Subsequent by-elections kept media attention on the party, which was for the first time able to pose as a viable component of the broader right. In a by-election in Dreux in October 1983, the FN won 17% of the vote. With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN, the local RPR and UDF agreed to form an alliance with the FN, causing a national sensation; together, they won the second round with 55% of the vote. The events in Dreux were a monumental turning point in the rise of the FN.\nLe Pen protested the \"media boycott\" against his party by sending letters to President Mitterrand in mid-1982. Following an exchange of letters with Le Pen, Mitterrand instructed the heads of the main television channels to give equitable coverage to the FN. In January 1984, the party made its first appearance in a monthly poll of political popularity, in which 9% of respondents held a \"positive opinion\" of the FN and some support for Le Pen personally. The next month, Le Pen was, for the first time, invited on a prime-time television interview programme, which he himself later deemed \"the hour that changed everything\".\nIn the June 1984 European elections, the FN won 11% of the vote and ten seats, in a contest that was considered to have a low level of importance by the public, which played to the party's advantage. The FN, notably, made inroads in both right-wing and left-wing constituencies, and finished 2nd in a number of towns. While many Socialists had arguably exploited the party in order to divide the right, Mitterrand later conceded that he had underestimated Le Pen. By July, 17% of opinion poll respondents held a positive opinion of the FN.\nBy the early 1980s, the FN featured a mosaic of ideological tendencies and attracted figures who were previously resistant to the party. The party managed to draw supporters from the mainstream right, including some high-profile defectors from the RPR, the UDF, and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP). In the 1984 European elections, eleven of the 81 FN candidates came from these parties, while the party's list also included an Arab and a Jew - although in unwinnable positions. Former collaborators were also accepted in the party, as Le Pen urged the need for \"reconciliation\", arguing that forty years after the war the only important question was whether or not \"they wish to serve their country\". The FN won 8.7% overall support in the 1985 cantonal elections, netting over 30% in some areas.\nFor the 1986 legislative elections, the FN took advantage of the new, proportional representation system and won 9.8% of the vote and 35 seats in the National Assembly. Many of these seats were filled by a new wave of \"respectable\" political operatives, \"notables\", who had joined the party after its 1984 success. The RPR won a majority with smaller, centre-right parties, and thus avoided the need to deal with the FN. Although FN was unable to exercise any real political influence, the party could project an image of political legitimacy. Several of its legislative proposals were controversial and had a socially reactionary and xenophobic character, among them attempts to restore the death penalty, expel foreigners who \"proportionally committed more crimes than the French\", restrict naturalisation, introduce a \"national preference\" for employment, impose taxes on the hiring of foreigners by French companies, and privatise Agence France-Presse.\nThe party's time in the National Assembly effectively came to an end when Jacques Chirac reinstated the two-round system of majority voting for the next election. In the regional elections held on the same day, FN won 137 seats, and gained representation in 21 of the 22 French regional councils. The RPR depended on FN support to win presidencies in some regional councils, and the FN won vice-presidential posts in four regions.\nConsolidation (1988\u20131997).\nLe Pen's campaign for the presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election. To promote his statesmanship credentials, he made trips to South East Asia, the United States, and Africa. The management of the formal campaign, launched in April 1987, was entrusted to Bruno M\u00e9gret, one of the new \"notables\". With his entourage, Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and, helped by M\u00e9gret, employed an American-style campaign. Le Pen's presidential campaign was highly successful; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances. Using a populist tone, he presented himself as the representative of the people against the \"gang of four\" (RPR, UDF, PS, Communist Party), while the central theme of his campaign was \"national preference\". In the 1988 presidential election, Le Pen won an unprecedented 14.4% of the vote, and double the votes of 1984.\nIn the snap 1988 legislative elections, the FN was hurt by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many \"notables\". In the election, the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but was reduced to a single seat in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper \"National Hebdo\" in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Soon, other quarrels left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno M\u00e9gret as the unrivalled, de facto FN deputy leader. The party only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, a rejections that now included the local level.\nIn the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats, winning 11.7% of the vote.\nIn the wake of FN's electoral success, the immigration debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the \"fatwa\" against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 \"affaire du foulard\" was the first major test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following that success, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning mostly on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began also employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In the first round of the 1993 legislative elections, the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system. In the 1995 presidential election, votes for Le Pen rose to 15% of the total.\nThe FN won an absolute majority (and thus the mayorship) in three cities in the 1995 municipal elections: Toulon, Marignane, and Orange. Le Pen then declared that his party would implement its \"national preference\" policy, with the risk of provoking the central government and being at odds with the laws of the Republic. The FN's elected representatives pursued interventionist policies with regards to the new cultural complexion of their towns by directly influencing artistic events, cinema schedules, and library holdings, as well as cutting or halting subsidies for multicultural associations. The party won Vitrolles, its fourth town, in a 1997 by-election, where similar policies were subsequently pursued. Vitrolles' new mayor Catherine M\u00e9gret, who ran in place of her husband Bruno, went further in one significant measure, introducing a special 5,000-franc allowance for babies born to at least one parent of French (or EU) nationality. The measure was ruled illegal by a court, which sentenced her to a suspended prison sentence, a fine, and a two-year ban from office.\nTurmoil and split of the MNR (1997\u20132002).\nIn the 1997 legislative elections, the FN polled its best-ever result with 15.3% support in metropolitan France. The result showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who had decided not to run, in order to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly, in Toulon, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential at that time than it had been in 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno M\u00e9gret and Bruno Gollnisch, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such \"compromise.\" In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, M\u00e9gret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate M\u00e9gret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.\nM\u00e9gret and his faction left the FN in January 1999 and founded the National Republican Movement (MNR), effectively splitting the FN in half at most levels. Many of those who joined the new MNR had joined the FN in the mid-1980s, in part from the \"Nouvelle Droite\", with a vision of building bridges to the parliamentary right. Many had also been particularly influential in intellectualising the FN's policies on immigration, identity, and \"national preference\". Following the split, Le Pen denounced them as \"extremist\" and \"racist\". Support for the two parties was almost equal in the 1999 European election, as the FN polled its lowest national score since 1984 with just 5.7%, and the MNR won 3.3%. The effects of the split, and competition from more moderate nationalists, resulted in their combined support being lower than the FN result of 1984.\nPresidential run-off (2002).\nFor the 2002 presidential election, opinion polls had predicted a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. In a shock outcome, Le Pen outperformed Jospin (by 0.7%) in the 1st round, placing second and advancing to the runoff. This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate and the first ever with a candidate from the far-right. To Le Pen's advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law-and-order issues, helped by media attention on a number of violent incidents. Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties. Nevertheless, Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day in a demonstration of 1.5 million participants across France. Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled. In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote, with 71% of his votes\u2014according to polls\u2014cast simply \"to block Le Pen\". Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen's support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote. It nevertheless outpolled M\u00e9gret's MNR, which had fielded the same number of candidates but won a mere 1.1% support.\nDecline (2003\u20132010).\nA new electoral system of two-round voting had been introduced for the 2004 regional elections, in part in an attempt to reduce the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% of the vote in metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new system. For the 2004 European elections, too, a new system less favourable to the FN had been introduced. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.\nFor the 2007 presidential election, Le Pen and M\u00e9gret agreed to join forces. Le Pen came 4th in the election with 11% of the vote, and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year. The party's 4.3% support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate, Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais, reached the runoff -where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent. These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party's financial problems. Le Pen announced the sale of the FN headquarters in Saint-Cloud, \"Le Paquebot\", and of his personal armoured car. In 2008, a French court handed Le Pen a three-month suspended sentence and a \u20ac10,000 fine for remarks he made in 2005 that contravened France's law against Holocaust denial. Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008.\nIn the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re-emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12% of the overall vote and 118 seats.\nMarine Le Pen's leadership.\nRevival of the FN (2011\u20132012).\nJean-Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010. Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice-president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned to succeed Le Pen, with Marine's candidacy backed by her father. On 15 January 2011, it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two-thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN. She embarked on a project to transform the FN into a \"mainstream party\" by softening its xenophobic image. Opinion polls showed the party's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen, and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15% of the overall vote (up from 4.5% in 2008). However, due to the French electoral system, the party only won 2 of the 2,026 seats that were up for election. From January 2011 to December 2014 the FN's membership roughly tripled.\nAt the end of 2011, the National Front withdrew from the far-right Alliance of European National Movements and joined the more moderate European Alliance of Freedom. In October 2013, Bruno Gollnisch and Jean-Marie Le Pen resigned from their position in the AENM.\nFor the 2012 presidential election, opinion polls showed Marine Le Pen as a serious challenger, with a few polls even suggesting that she could win the first round of the election. In the event, Le Pen came 3rd in the first round, scoring 17.9% \u2013 the best showing ever in a presidential election for the FN at that time.\nIn the 2012 legislative election, the National Front won two seats: Gilbert Collard and Marion Mar\u00e9chal.\nIn two polls about presidential favourites, conducted in April and May 2013, Marine le Pen polled ahead of president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande but behind Nicolas Sarkozy.\nElectoral successes (2012\u20132017).\n In the municipal elections held on 23 and 30 March 2014, lists officially supported by the National Front won mayoralties in 12 cities: Beaucaire, Cogolin, Fr\u00e9jus, Hayange, H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, Le Luc, Le Pontet, Mantes-la-Ville, the 7th arrondissement of Marseille, Villers-Cotter\u00eats, B\u00e9ziers and Camaret-sur-Aigues. While some of these cities were in southern France (like Fr\u00e9jus) which traditionally votes more for right-wing parties than the rest of the country, others were located in northern France, where Socialist Party had been strong until the 2010s. Following these elections, the National Front had, in cities of over 1,000 inhabitants, 1,546 and 459 councilors at two different levels of local government. The international media described the results as \"historic\".\nThe National Front received 4,712,461 votes in the 2014 European Parliament election, finishing first with 24.86% of the vote and 24 of France's 74 seats. This was said to be \"the first time the anti-immigrant, anti-EU party had won a nationwide election in its four-decade history.\" The party's success came as a \"shock\" in France and the EU.\nFront National becomes Rassemblement National (2018).\nAt the conclusion of the 11 March 2018 party congress in Lille, Marine Le Pen proposed renaming the party to \"Rassemblement national\" (National Rally) while keeping the flame as its logo. The name was not unknown in French politics: it recalled both the National Popular Rally, a collaborationist party founded by Marcel D\u00e9at in 1941 with the help of Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle, founder of La Cagoule, and led by Georges Albertini during the Occupation and the Rassemblement National Fran\u00e7ais, founded by the far-right lawyer and politician Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, whose presidential campaign in 1965 was managed by Jean-Marie Le Pen. It had already been used by the FN for its parliamentary group between 1986 and 1988. Nevertheless, the name change faced opposition from an already-existing party named \"Rassemblement national\", whose president, Igor Kurek, described the group as \"Gaullist and republican right\" and who had registered the name with the INPI in 2013. On 1 June, Le Pen announced that the name change was approved by party adherents with 80.81% in favour.\nPresidential and parliamentary election, rebranding (2017\u20132022).\nOn 24 April 2017, a day after the first round of the presidential election, Marine Le Pen announced that she would temporarily step down as the party's leader in an attempt to \"unite voters.\" In the second round of voting, Le Pen was defeated 66.1% to 33.9% by her rival Emmanuel Macron of En Marche!\nDuring the following parliamentary elections, the FN received 13.02% of the vote, a little lower than the 13.07% of the 2012 elections. The party appeared to have suffered from a demobilisation of its voters from the previous vote. Nonetheless, eight deputies (six FN and two affiliated) were elected, the best number for the FN in a parliamentary election using a majoritarian electoral system since its creation. Marine Le Pen was elected to the National Assembly for the first time, while Gilbert Collard was re-elected. FN's 23-year-old Ludovic Pajot became the youngest ever member of the French parliament.\nIn late 2017, Florian Philippot left the FN and formed The Patriots, on the grounds that the FN had \"softened\" its position on leaving the EU and abandoning the Euro.\nIn 2018, Steve Bannon, former advisor to Donald Trump before and after his 2016 election, gave what has been described as a \"populist pep talk\". Bannon advised the party members to \"Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker. ... History is on our side and will bring us victory.\" Bannon's remarks brought the members to their feet.\nIn January 2019, ex-Sarkozy minister Thierry Mariani and former conservative lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud, left Les R\u00e9publicains (LR) and joined the National Rally.\nDuring a 2021 debate, Marine Le Pen was called \"soft\" on Islam by the Minister of the Interior in Macron's government, G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Marine Le Pen called for a \"national-unity government\" that would include persons such as Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, former LR officials, and souverainistes on the left, such as former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg.\nIn the months before the 2021 French regional elections, political commentators noted an increased moderation in the FN's platform that aimed to attract conservative voters, as well as a new image being promoted by the party as a force of \"la droite populaire\", i.e. the popular right, the social right. The party, nonetheless, fared badly in these elections.\nIn the 2022 French presidential election, Le Pen again reached the 2nd round with 23.15% of the votes, though she was defeated by incumbent Macron, after receiving 41.45% of the votes in the run-off. Marine Le Pen received 13 million votes in the second round, more than double the 5.25 million Jean Marie Le Pen received in 2002.\nIn the 2022 French legislative election, for which polling had indicated that FN would win only between 15 and 45 seats in the National Assembly, the party received 18.68% of the votes in the first round and won 89 seats in the second round, a significant increase from the previous total of 8 seats. The 89 seats enabled the National Rally to form a parliamentary group, for which at least 15 deputies are required, for the first time since 1986, when the national assembly was elected by proportional voting. The result made the party the 3rd largest party in the assembly and the largest parliamentary opposition group.\nJordan Bardella's leadership.\nJordan Bardella was elected president of the RN on 5 November 2022, ending Marine Le Pen's period as president of the party. Le Pen remained president of the RN's parliamentary group.\n2024 European parliament election.\nIn the 2024 European parliamentary elections, the RN won the most delegates of any single party (30). It won 31.4% of the vote, the first time since 1984 that a list had won more than 30% of the vote in a European Parliament election in France. On 8 July, Bardella became president of the Patriots for Europe, originally founded by Viktor Orb\u00e1n with the Czech ANO and the Austrian FP\u00d6 parties on a platform of refusing military aid to Ukraine, anti-immigration, and pro-\"traditional family\" values. The group, the third largest in the parliament, also includes members from the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Dutch PVV, and the Italian Lega per Salvini Premier.\nThe National Rally's success in the European elections led to the dissolution of the French lower house by Emmanuel Macron on 9 June 2024.\n2024 legislative election.\nIn June 2024, the party joined with the micro-party \"To the right! Friends of Eric Ciotti\", forming the union of the far-right in the 2024 French legislative election. Together, these parties secured the largest share of the vote in the first round with 33.15% of the vote. More voters who reported struggling financially voted for the RN than for any other party.\nBased on their first round performance, the RN will receive around \u20ac15 million per year in government subsidies for the next five years: each vote in the first round was worth \u20ac1.61 per year to the party.\nAccording to opinion polls, the National Rally were expected to get 230-270 seats, close to an absolute majority, However, 2\u20133 days before the second round, the RN were predicted to win around 170-220 seats. After the exit polls on 7 July, that figure was reduced to 120\u2013170 seats, and the New Popular Front were predicted to win 150\u2013190 seats, slightly ahead of president Macron's Ensemble alliance. Finally, the RN won only 142 seats, ranking third in the election.\nThe National Rally won vast swathes of southern France, including every seat in the departement of Gard.\nPolicies.\nThe party's ideology has been broadly described by scholars, including James Shields, Nonna Mayer, Jean-Yves Camus, Nicolas Lebourg and Michel Winock as nationalist, far-right (or \"Nouvelle Droite\") and populist. Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, following Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff's analysis, include the party in an old French tradition of \"national populism\" that can be traced back to Boulangism. National populists combine the social values of the left and the political values of the right and advocate a referendary republic that would bypass traditional political divisions and institutions. Aiming at unity of the political (the \"demos\"), ethnic (the \"ethnos\"), and social (the \"working class\") interpretations of the \"people\", they claim to defend the \"average Frenchman\" and \"common sense\", against the \"betrayal of inevitably corrupt elites\". The party has been also described as national conservative.\nThe FN has changed considerably since its foundation, pursuing the principles of modernisation and pragmatism and adapting to the changing political climate. Its message increasingly influenced mainstream political parties, and some commentators described it as right-wing, moving closer towards the centre-right. In the 2010s, the party attempted to \"de-demonise\" its image and changed its name to National Rally. A 2022 Kanar survey found that 46% of French voters saw Marine Le Pen as \"representing a patriotic Right attached to traditional values\", although 50% saw her as \"a danger to democracy\".\nSociety.\nGender and sexuality.\nThe party opposed the 2016 criminalisation of prostitution in France on the grounds that it would negatively affect the safety of sex workers.\nIn the 2002 legislative elections, the first under the new gender parity provision in the French Constitution, Le Pen's National Front was among the few parties to come close to meeting the law, with 49% female candidates; Jospin's Socialists had 36%, and Chirac's UMP had 19.6%. Women voters in France were traditionally more attracted to mainstream conservative parties than the radical right until the 2000s. The proportion of women in the party has risen to 39% by 2017.\nLaw and order.\nIn 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on a law-and-order platform of zero tolerance, harsher sentencing, increased prison capacity, and a referendum on re-introducing the death penalty. In its 2001 programme, the party linked the breakdown of law and order to immigration, deeming immigration a \"mortal threat to civil peace in France.\"\nMarine Le Pen rescinded the party's traditional support for the death penalty with her 2017 campaign launch, instead announcing support for imprisonment \"in perpetuity\" for the \"worst crimes\" in February 2017. In 2022, she proposed to hold a referendum on capital punishment in France if she were elected.\nImmigration.\nSince its early years, the party has called for immigration to be reduced. The theme of exclusion of non-European immigrants was brought into the party in 1978 and became increasingly important in the 1980s.\nAfter the 1999 split, the FN cultivated a more moderate image on immigration and Islam, no longer calling for the systematic repatriation of legal immigrants but still supporting the deportation of illegal, criminal, or unemployed immigrants.\nFollowing the Arab Spring (2011) rebellions in several countries, Marine Le Pen campaigned for a halt to the migration of Tunisian and Libyan immigrants to Europe.\nIn November 2015, the party stated its goal to have a net legal immigration rate (immigrants minus emigrants) of 10,000 in France per year. Since 2017, that yearly net immigration rate was around 182,000 if one takes into account only people born abroad from non-French parents, but was around 44,000 if one also includes the departures and returns of French expatriates.\nIn 2022, Marine Le Pen proposed an end to \"family reunification\" rights for foreigners with residency permits and the end to the right to automatic citizenship for children born in France to foreigners living there. She also supported a referendum on immigration policy.\nIslam.\nThe National Rally has sought to restrict Islamic practice in France. In 2011, Marine Le Pen warned that wearing full-face veils is \"the tip of the iceberg\" of Islamisation of French culture. In 2021, and again in 2022, Le Pen again proposed banning the hijab (headscarf which only covers the head but not face) in public. Le Pen also proposed to ban the production of both halal and kosher meat. Le Pen says she is \"against the visibility of Islam\" but not Islam per se.\nThe National Rally is considered Islamophobic by many. The party has connected immigration to Islamic terrorism.\nEconomy.\nAt the end of the 1970s, Jean-Marie Le Pen broke away from the anti-capitalist heritage of Poujadism and espoused a market liberal and anti-statist programme which included lower taxes, reducing state intervention, reducing the size of the public sector, privatisation, and scaling back government bureaucracy. Some scholars have characterised the FN's 1978 programme as \"Reaganite before Reagan\".\nThe party's economic policy shifted from the 1980s to the 1990s from neoliberalism to protectionism. This occurred within the framework of a changed international environment, from a battle between the Free World and Communism, to one between nationalism and globalisation. During the 1980s, Jean-Marie Le Pen complained about the rising number of \"social parasites\" and called for deregulation, tax cuts, and the phasing-out of the welfare state. As the party gained growing support from the economically vulnerable, it converted towards politics of social welfare and economic protectionism. This was part of its shift away from its former claim of being the \"social, popular, and national right\" to its claim of being \"neither right nor left \u2013 French!\" Increasingly, the party's program became an amalgam of free market and welfare policies. By the 2010s, some political commentators described its economic policies as left-wing.\nUnder Marine Le Pen, the RN has supported economic nationalism, which it calls \"economic patriotism\", and it has advocated populist policies, such as tax cuts for people under 30 years old, and cuts in the value-added tax on energy and essential products. The party has supported public services, protectionism, and economic intervention and opposed the increase in the fuel tax in 2018 and the increase in the retirement age in 2023.\nUnder Jordan Bardella, the RN has adopted more pro-market policies, including lower taxes and simplifying industrial norms. Bardella advocated an audit of public finances as a precursor to determining the 2025 budget. Bardella has sought to use these policies to court business support during the 2024 French legislative election campaign. During this time, Bardella also rescinded the prior RN pledge to repeal the 2023 French pension reform law. Bardella has been described as advocating economic liberalism, putting him in conflict with the economic vision of Marine Le Pen.\nClimate.\nLe Pen does not plan to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement but has stated that climate change is \"not the priority\" of the party. The party is against measures to tackle climate change and protecting the environment. The National Rally has proposed abolition of the European Green Deal, highlighting key policies it opposes such as the 2035 ban on fossil fuel cars.\nForeign policy.\nFrom the 1980s to the 1990s, the party's policy shifted from favouring the European Union to turning against it. In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France out of the EU and re-introducing the franc as the country's national currency. In the early 2000s, the party denounced the Schengen, Maastricht, and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for \"a supranational entity spelling the end of France.\" In 2004, the party criticised the EU as \"the last stage on the road to world government\", likening it to a \"puppet of the New World Order.\" It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar. Further, it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU. The FN was also one of several parties that backed France's 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution. In other issues, Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq, led by the United States, both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War. He visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 1990 and subsequently considered him a friend.\nMarine Le Pen advocated France leaving the euro, although that policy was dropped in 2019. She also intends to reintroduce customs borders and has campaigned against allowing dual citizenship. During both the 2010\u20132011 Ivorian crisis and the 2011 Libyan civil war, she opposed the French military involvements. However, the party supported the 2013 Operation Serval in Mali against Islamist militants in the country because it was at the request of the Malian government.\nLe Pen has praised Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for \"fighting radical Islam\", stating that Egypt's \"ability to separate extremist Islam from the religion sets an example to the rest of the world, including France, of how to deal with poisonous ideologies\". The party has also favourably contrasted the United Arab Emirates's opposition to Islamism with the more pro-Islamist position taken by Qatar. The party has advocated closer France\u2013Morocco relations, criticising Macron's attempts to deepen ties with Algeria. In January 2023, the National Rally was one of only four parties in the European Parliament that voted against a resolution condemning Morocco's treatment of journalist Omar Radi. It praised the 2024 recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and suggested the French government should have acted sooner.\nLe Pen supports the restoration of France-Syria relations and called for cooperation with Israel, the United States, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to support the economic recovery of Lebanon from the Lebanese economic crisis.\nThe party supports a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and welcomed the Abraham Accords. The party has shifted towards more pro-Israel policies over time, particularly following the Gaza war. Bardella has expressed opposition to recognition of Palestinian statehood following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, on the grounds that this would be \"recognising terrorism\". Following the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Le Pen suggested that a ceasefire would be impossible without the \"dismantling\" of Hezbollah. Following the June 2025 Israeli strikes on Iran, Bardella called for France to \"stand alongside Israel\" and claimed that Iran acquiring nuclear weapons would threaten world peace, while suggesting that France's role was to promote \"peace and de-escalation\". The National Rally welcomed the subsequent United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but noted that strikes on Iran should be exclusively targeted at nuclear sites.\nRussia and Ukraine.\nMarine Le Pen described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"defender of the Christian heritage of European civilisation.\" The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States, through the Revolution of Dignity. The National Front denounces anti-Russian feelings in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to \"Washington's\" interests in the region. Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia: \"European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation.\" She argues that the United States is leading a new Cold War against Russia. She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organise a kind of federation that would allow each region a large degree of autonomy. She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nation.\nLuke Harding wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the National Front's MEPs were a \"pro-Russian bloc.\" In 2014, the \"Nouvel Observateur\" said that the Russian government considered the National Front \"capable of seizing power in France and changing the course of European history in Moscow's favour.\" According to the French media, party leaders had frequent contact with Russian ambassador Alexander Orlov and Marine Le Pen made multiple trips to Moscow. In May 2015, one of her advisers, Emmanuel Leroy, attended an event in Donetsk marking the \"independence\" of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.\nThe RN remains divided on relations with Russia, with Bardella stating that he believed Russia threatened French security. At the same time, Thierry Mariani suggested it was not a threat to France or Europe. The more pro-Russian Mariani has been described as in conflict with Pierre-Romain Thionnet, who has advocated a more pro-Ukrainian line, with Bardella maintaining a balance between the two positions.\nDuring the 2022 French presidential election, Le Pen supported sending non-lethal defensive aid to Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War, but not heavy weapons that would make France a \"co-belligerent\" in the conflict. Similarly, Bardella has expressed support for defense equipment, ammunition, and logistical assistance to Ukraine but maintains opposition to giving long-range missiles to Ukraine or deploying French soldiers there. He is also opposed to Ukrainian NATO membership, suggesting it could escalate the war.\nEuropean Union.\nSince their entry into the European Parliament in 1979, the National Rally has promoted a message of being pro-Europe but anti-EU. However, in 2019, the proposal that France leave the Eurozone and the EU was removed from the party's manifesto, which has since called for \"reform from within\" of the union. The party advocates that EU legislation should be initiated by the Council of the EU rather than the European Commission, and that French laws should have primacy over EU laws.\nNATO.\nThe party's stance on NATO has varied throughout the years. Under Jean-Marie Le Pen's leadership, the party advocated a complete withdrawal from the organization, while under Marine Le Pen's leadership, the party has softened its stance to advocate leaving NATO's integrated military command structure, which France joined in 2009. Jordan Bardella later added that the RN would not advocate withdrawing France from the integrated command while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was ongoing.\nElectoral reform and referendums.\nThe National Rally has advocated for full proportional representation in France, claiming that the two-round system disenfranchises voters. In early 2021, Marine Le Pen, along with centrist politician Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou and green politician Julien Bayou, cosigned a letter asking President Emmanuel Macron to implement proportional representation for future elections.\nThe party advocates referendums on key issues such as the death penalty, immigration policy, and constitutional change. In 2022, Marine Le Pen stated: \"I want the referendum to become a classic operating tool.\"\nControversies.\nOpinions on the holocaust, and relations with Jewish groups.\nThere has been a difference between Marine Le Pen's and her father's opinions concerning the Holocaust and Jews. In 2005, Jean-Marie Le Pen wrote in the far-right weekly magazine \"Rivarol\" that the German occupation of France \"was not particularly inhumane, even if there were a few blunders, inevitable in a country of 640,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq. mi.)\" and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as \"a point of detail of the history of the Second World War\". He has repeated the latter claim several times. In 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said: \"I do not question the existence of concentration camps, but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to determine\". Jean-Marie Le Pen was fined for these remarks, but Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation. The leader of the party, Marine Le Pen, distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest at her father's comments. In response to her father's remarks, Marine Le Pen referred to the Holocaust as the \"abomination of abominations\".\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Marine Le Pen sought the support of Jewish people in France. Interviewed by the Israeli daily newspaper \"Haaretz\" about the fact that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticise the policy of the State of Israel \u2013 just as we are allowed to criticise any sovereign country \u2013 without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist. She has opposed the emigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: \"The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions against the development of radical Islam in problematic areas\".\nCzecho-Russian bank loan.\nIn November 2014, Marine Le Pen confirmed that the party had received a \u20ac9 million loan from the First Czech Russian Bank (FCRB) in Moscow to the National Front. Senior FN officials from the party's political bureau informed Mediapart that this was the first instalment of a \u20ac40 million loan, although Marine Le Pen has disputed this. \"The Independent\" said the loans \"take Moscow's attempt to influence the internal politics of the EU to a new level\". Reinhard B\u00fctikofer stated, \"It's remarkable that a political party from the motherland of freedom can be funded by Putin's sphere\u2014the largest European enemy of freedom\". Marine Le Pen argued that it was not a donation from the Russian government but a loan from a private Russian bank because no other bank would give her a loan. This loan is meant to prepare future electoral campaigns and to be repaid progressively. Marine Le Pen has publicly disclosed all the rejection letters that French banks have sent to her concerning her loan requests. Since November 2014, she insists that if a French bank agrees to give her a loan, she would break her contract with the FCBR, but she has not received any other counter-propositions. Le Pen accused the banks of collusion with the government. In April 2015, a Russian hacker group published texts and emails between Timur Prokopenko, a member of Putin's administration, and Konstantin Rykov, a former Duma deputy with ties to France, discussing Russian financial support to the National Front in exchange for its support of Russia's annexation of Crimea, though this has not coalesced.\nIdentitarian links.\nA 2019 undercover investigation by Al Jazeera uncovered links between high-ranking National Rally figures and Generation Identity, a far-right Identitarian youth group. In secretly taped conversations, RN leaders endorsed goals of Generation Identity and discussed plans to \"remigrate\" immigrants, effectively sending them back to their countries of origin, if the RN came to power. Christelle Lechevalier, a RN Member of the European Parliament (MEP), said that many RN leaders held similar opinions as the GI, but sought to hide them from voters.\nPayment of party officials with EU funds.\nIn December 2023, 28 people, including Marine Le Pen and her father Jean Marie, were ordered to stand trial after they were charged with a scheme which involved paying National Rally party officials through EU funds which were earmarked for European Parliament assistants.\nOn 31 March 2025, 25 National Rally members (including Le Pen, 9 other former NR MEPs, and 12 assistants) were found guilty. The sentences for Le Pen and several former MEPs included bans from running for political office.\nOrganization.\nLeadership.\nThe executive bureau features: Jordan Bardella (president), Steeve Briois (vice-president), Louis Aliot (vice-president), David Rachline (vice-president), K\u00e9vin Pfeffer (treasurer), Julien Sanchez (spokesperson), Gilles Pennelle (regional councilor), Edwige Diaz (deputy regional councilor), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Laporte, Philippe Olivier, and Jean-Paul Garraud.\nVice Presidents.\nThe party had five vice presidents between July 2012 and March 2018 (against three previously).\nIn March 2018, the position of vice-president replaced that of General Secretary. It became a duo in June 2019:\nGeneral Secretaries.\nThe position of General Secretary was held between 1972 and 2018:\nElected representatives.\nAs of February 2023, the National Rally has 88 MPs. They sit in the National Assembly as members of the National Rally group.\nInternational affiliation and relations.\n1980s-2000s.\nThe FN has been part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also consisted of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN.\nFrom 1999 to 2001, the FN was a member of the Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It was part of the Identity and Democracy group.\nIt was formerly known as the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, during which time it also included the Polish Congress of the New Right, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party. The RN has also been part of the Identity and Democracy Party (formerly the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom) since 2014, which additionally includes Slovakia's We Are Family and the Bulgarian Volya Movement, which was later renamed Patriots.eu. After the 2024 European Parliament election, the National Rally joined the Patriots for Europe group with Fidesz, Vox, the Czech ANO 2011, the Portuguese Chega, the Greek Voice of Reason, Latvia First and most former ID members, with Bardella ultimately chairing the group.\nDuring Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, the party has also been active in establishing extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted of a variety of European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) refused to join the efforts, as J\u00f6rg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's \"Issuikai\" (\"right-wing\") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.\n2010s.\nAt a conference in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FP\u00d6, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, announced deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonisation policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognised by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (B\u00fcrger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).\nDuring her 2012 visit to the United States, Marine Le Pen met two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives associated with the Tea Party movement, Joe Walsh, who is known for his strong stance against Islam, which Domenic Powell argues, rises to Islamophobia and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, whom Le Pen complimented for his stance on the gold standard. In February 2017, two more conservative Republican Congressmen, Steve King and Dana Rohrabacher, also met with Le Pen in Paris.\nThe party also has ties to Steve Bannon, who served as White House Chief Strategist under President Donald Trump, and addressed an RN event in 2018.\nThe FN allied with the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) in November 2013, after years of the PVV rejecting collaboration with the FN. Similarly, in December 2013, the FN formed an alliance with Matteo Salvini, the new leader of the Lega Nord, which had previously eschewed cooperation with the FN when it was led by Umberto Bossi.\nIn 2014, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage was critical of the FN, claiming that the FN's association with \"anti-Semitism and general prejudice\" made it impossible for UKIP to join Le Pen's efforts for a united right-wing populist European Parliament group despite an invitation from PVV leader Wilders.\nIn 2017, Marine Le Pen met with and was interviewed for the British radio station LBC by Farage, who praised Le Pen and expressed support for her presidential bid. Prior to the 2019 European Parliament election, Farage's Brexit Party initially considered forming a joint group in the next European Parliament, but ultimately once again declined. In 2024, Farage, in his capacity as the leader of Reform UK, distanced himself from the RN, describing its economic agenda as a \"disaster\" for France.\nThough the FN had close contacts with Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI) from 2013 onwards, the relationship between the RN and FdI became strained in 2022, after Meloni publicly declined to support Le Pen's 2022 presidential bid.\nIn 2023, Meloni complained to French President Emmanuel Macron after he compared her to Le Pen, while Le Pen criticised Meloni's illegal immigration policies.\nHowever, in early 2024, Le Pen and Meloni made overtures to one another, declining to rule out future cooperation between their parties. In July 2024, Meloni praised Le Pen's alliance with Eric Ciotti and Marion Mar\u00e9chal during the 2024 French legislative election, congratulated the RN on its success in the first round of the election, and expressed preference for the right-wing alliance in the second round of the election.\nIn addition, the party has had relations with Krasimir Karakachanov's IMRO \u2013 Bulgarian National Movement in 2014 and Nenad Popovi\u0107's Serbian People's Party since 2021. The RN was critical of the decision to allow the Bulgarian Revival to join the ID Party in 2024.\nSince 2018, the RN has had relations with Santiago Abascal's Vox in Spain. In 2024, Vox had Le Pen address its conference, despite Vox being a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group; after the election, Vox joined the RN in Patriots for Europe.\nIn 2019, RN MEPs participated in the first international delegation to visit India's Jammu and Kashmir following the decision by Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party government to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The delegation was not sanctioned by the European Parliament, and consisted mostly of right-wing populist politicians including MEPs from Vox, AfD, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the British Brexit Party, and Poland's Law and Justice party.\n2020s.\nIn October 2021, Le Pen met with Fidesz leader and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki from the Law and Justice (PiS) party, and Slovenian Democratic Party leader and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jan\u0161a. Both PiS and Fidesz had previously rejected cooperation with Le Pen in 2019. Orb\u00e1n subsequently supported Le Pen during the 2022 French presidential election. Morawiecki later expressed openness to the RN joining the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in February 2024.\nRelations with the AfD deteriorated in early 2024, following Le Pen's disagreements with the AfD members' discussions over remigration and the AfD questioning French control of Mayotte. In May 2024, the RN announced it would end its alliance with the AfD in the next European Parliament term.\nDuring the 2024 French legislative election, Israeli minister Amichai Chikli expressed support for Le Pen and the National Rally, and suggested that Likud leader and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared his views, prompting a rebuke by President Macron. Chikli later described his relations with the RN, stating it was \"natural that conservative leaders will have good relations with conservative leaders all across the globe\".\nDuring and after the 2024 United States presidential election, the National Rally distanced itself from Trump, banning its MPs from commenting on the election.\nElection results.\nThe National Front was a marginal party in 1973, the first election it participated in, but the party made its breakthrough in the 1984 European Parliament election, where it won 11% of the vote and ten MEPs. Following this election, the party's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15%, although it saw a drop to around 5% in some late 2000s elections. Since 2010, the party's support seems to have increased towards its former heights. The party managed to advance to the final round of the 2002 French presidential election, although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote. In the late 2000s the party suffered decline in elections. Under Marine Le Pen's presidency the party has increased its vote share significantly. The National Front came first in a national election for the first time during the 2014 European elections, when it gained 24% of the vote. During the 2017 presidential election the party advanced to the second round of the election for the second time, and doubled the percentage it received in the 2002 presidential election, earning 34%. In the 2019 European elections the rebranded National Rally retained its spot as first party.\nEuropean Parliament.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Earlier systems referred to this group by the name Monocotyledones, with Monocotyledoneae an earlier spelling (these names may be used in any rank). Systems such as the Dahlgren and Thorne systems (more recent than the Takhtajan and Cronquist systems) refer to this group by the name Liliidae (a name in the rank of subclass). Modern systems, such as the APG and APG II systems refer to this group by the name monocots (a name for a clade).

{"id": "67127", "revid": "49059523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67127", "title": "Carl Lewis", "text": "American track and field athlete (born 1961)\nFrederick Carlton Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete who won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper whose career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won the Olympic long jump. He is one of six athletes to win gold in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games, and is one of two people to win gold in the same individual athletics event in four Olympic Games, along with USA discus thrower Al Oerter. He is the head track and field coach for the University of Houston.\nLewis topped the world rankings in the 100\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set world records in the 100\u00a0m, 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m and 4 \u00d7 200\u00a0m relays, while his world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump over a span of ten years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Lewis broke 10 seconds for the 100\u00a0meters fifteen times and 20 seconds for the 200\u00a0meters ten times. He also long jumped over 71 times.\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations, \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, \"Olympian of the Century\" by \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Athlete of the Year\" by \"Track &amp; Field News\" in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\nAfter retiring from athletics, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a Democrat in the New Jersey Senate, but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services, including his own.\nAthletic career.\nFame as a competitive athlete.\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927\u20131987) and Evelyn n\u00e9e Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team. His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues. His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both him and his sister, Carol. She became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.\nLewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status. At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.\nMany colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis's coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13\u00a0m (). By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to \"Track and Field News\".\nAn old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35\u00a0m ().\nThough his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team. The Olympic boycott precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow, Russia; he instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77\u00a0m () for a bronze medal, and the American 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61\u00a0s. He received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created specifically for the athletes on the 1980 U.S. Summer Olympics team. At year's end, he was ranked sixth in the world in the long jump and seventh in the 100\u00a0m.\nBreakthrough in 1981 and 1982.\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62\u00a0m () at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.\nWhile marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records, Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, \"I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\" When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.\nAlso in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100\u00a0m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67\u00a0s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00\u00a0s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record. For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100\u00a0m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100\u00a0m and long jump. Additionally, he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.\nIn 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon's world record of 8.90\u00a0m () in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever. Before Lewis, \u00a0ft\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0(\u00a0m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, Lewis cleared \u00a0ft\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0(\u00a0m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.76\u00a0m () at Indianapolis on July 24. He also ran 10.00\u00a0s in the 100\u00a0m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00\u00a0s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61\u00a0m () twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76\u00a0m () at Indianapolis, he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached \u00a0ft\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0(\u00a0m). Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100\u00a0m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200\u00a0m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by \"Track and Field News\". From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100\u00a0m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson's 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third. His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.\n1983 and the inaugural World Championships.\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983. Lewis' chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing \u00a0ft\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0(\u00a0m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55\u00a0m () defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26\u00a0m ().\nHe also won the 100\u00a0m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07\u00a0s to 10.21\u00a0s. Smith won the 200\u00a0m title, an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis' shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200\u00a0m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03\u00a0s behind Pietro Mennea's 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration. Finally, Lewis ran the anchor in the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, winning in 37.86\u00a0s, a new world record and the first in Lewis' career.\nLewis' year-best performances in the 100\u00a0m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100\u00a0m at low-altitude with a 9.97\u00a0s in Modesto on May 14. His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79\u00a0m () and earned the world number one ranking in that event. \"Track and Field News\" ranked him number two in the 200\u00a0m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75\u00a0s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki. Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.\n1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens.\nAt the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of them and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin.\nLewis started his quest to match Owens with a convincing win in the 100\u00a0m, running 9.99\u00a0s to defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2\u00a0s. In his next event, the long jump, Lewis won with relative ease. His behavior in winning this event stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed that his tactics were correct. Since Lewis still had heats and finals in the 200\u00a0m and the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay to compete in, he chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win the event. He risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if he over-extended himself, and his ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. He knew that his first jump at 8.54\u00a0m () was sufficient to win the event. He fouled on his next jump and then passed on his remaining four allotted jumps. Lewis easily won gold, and Gary Honey of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of 8.24\u00a0m (). The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of Lewis's quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90\u00a0m (). Lewis himself had often stated it was a goal of his to surpass the mark. A television advertisement with Beamon appeared before the final, featuring the record-holder saying, \"I hope you make it, kid.\" So, when Lewis decided not to make any more attempts to try to break the record, he was loudly booed. When asked about those boos, Lewis said, \"I was shocked at first. But after I thought about it, I realized that they were booing because they wanted to see more of Carl Lewis. I guess that's flattering.\"\nHis third gold medal came in the 200\u00a0m, where he won with a time of 19.80\u00a0s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history. Finally, he won his fourth gold in the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay when he anchored the final leg of the race; he broke the tape with a time of 37.83\u00a0s, setting a new world record.\nLack of endorsements and public perception.\nAlthough Lewis had achieved what he had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, he did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that he had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars. Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Douglas said he was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.\nAdditionally, rumors circulated at that time that Lewis was gay. Although he denied the rumors, it likely hurt his marketability. Lewis' physical appearance at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. \"It doesn't matter what Carl Lewis' sexuality is\", high jumper Dwight Stones said. \"Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual.\" Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coca-Cola rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike already had Lewis under contract for several years, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with Lewis's new negative image and dropped him after the Games. \"If you're a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho\", said Don Coleman, a Nike representative. \"They started looking for ways to get rid of me\", Lewis said. \"Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they did not know what to do.\" Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno. Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the \"Carl bashing\", as he put it, typified by a \"Sports Illustrated\" article before the Olympics.\nAt year's end, Lewis was again awarded the top rankings in the 100\u00a0m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200\u00a0m, and for the third year in a row he was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by \"Track &amp; Field News\".\nThe Chicago Bulls drafted Lewis in the 1984 NBA draft as the 208th overall pick, although he had played neither high school nor college basketball. Lewis never played in the NBA. A poll on the NBA's website ranked Lewis second to Lusia Harris, the only woman to be drafted by the NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the NBA Draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of the Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended Lewis because he was the best athlete available. Similarly, Lewis was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL draft, even though he did not play football in college. He never played in the NFL either.\nBen Johnson and the 1987 World Championships.\nAfter the 1984 Olympics, Lewis continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which he would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge his dominance in the 100\u00a0m sprint. His low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96\u00a0s shortly before the 1984 Olympics, but his biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Johnson would beat Lewis once in 1985, but Lewis also lost to others, while winning most of his races. Lewis retained his number one rank that year; Johnson would place second. In 1986, Johnson defeated Lewis convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95\u00a0s. At year's end, Johnson was ranked number one, while Lewis slipped to number three, having lost more races than he won. He even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event he did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though he competed sparingly. Lewis ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61\u00a0m ().\nAt the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, Lewis skipped the 200\u00a0m to focus on his strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all his attempts. This was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; this was because history's second 29\u00a0ft long-jumper was in the field: Robert Emmiyan leapt 8.86\u00a0m () at altitude in May, just 4\u00a0cm short of Bob Beamon's record. But Emmiyan's best that day was a leap of 8.53\u00a0m (), second to Lewis' 8.67\u00a0m (). Lewis cleared 8.60\u00a0m () four times. \nIn the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, Lewis anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90\u00a0s, the third-fastest of all time.\nThe 100\u00a0m final was the most talked about event and caused the most drama. Johnson had run under 10.00 s three times in the year before Rome, while Lewis had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. Lewis looked strong in the heats of the 100\u00a0m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort. In the final, however, Johnson won with a time that stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. Lewis, second with 9.93 s, had tied the existing world record, but that was insufficient.\nWhile Johnson basked in the glory of his achievement, Lewis started to explain away his defeat. He first claimed that Johnson had false-started, then he alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened him, and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs.\" He added, \"I could run 9.8 or faster in the 100 if I could jump into drugs right away.\" This was the start of Lewis's calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. His detractors noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years, and it only became a cause for Lewis once he was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Johnson replied \"When Carl Lewis was winning everything, I never said a word against him. And when the next guy comes along and beats me, I won't complain about that either\".\n1988 Summer Olympics.\nLewis not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, he also lost his father. When William Lewis died of cancer at age 60, Lewis placed the gold medal he won for the 100\u00a0m in 1984 in his hand to be buried with him. \"Don't worry\", he told his mother. \"I'll get another one.\" Lewis repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. \"A lot happened to me last year, especially the death of my father. That caused me to re-educate myself to being the very best I possibly can be this season\", he said, after defeating Johnson in Z\u00fcrich on August 17.\nAt the Olympic trials in Indianapolis, Lewis won the 100 m finals in 9.78 s, which appeared to be a new world record. However, the race was determined to have been wind-aided, so the record did not count.\nThe 100\u00a0m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and its unexpected outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century. In the Olympic finals, Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while Lewis set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, his medal was taken away and Lewis was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.\nIn the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the competition citing an injury, and Lewis's main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. Lewis leapt 8.72\u00a0m (), a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of his competitors could match it. The Americans swept the medals in the event for the first time in 84 years. In the 200\u00a0m, Lewis dipped under his Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event he entered, the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, Lewis never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.\nA subsequent honor would follow: Lewis eventually was credited with the 100\u00a0m world record for the 9.92 s he ran in Seoul. Though Ben Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s he ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of his record and gold medal from the World Championships. Lewis was deemed to be the world record holder for his 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100\u00a0m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that Lewis had also, therefore, twice tied the \"true\" world record (9.93 s) for his 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Z\u00fcrich meet where he defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records. From January 1, 1990, Lewis was the world record holder in the 100\u00a0m. The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break Lewis's mark. Lewis also permanently lost his ranking as number one for the 200\u00a0m in 1988 and for the 100\u00a0m in 1989. He also lost the top ranking for the long jump in 1990 but was able to regain it in 1992.\n1991 World Championships: Lewis' greatest performances.\nTokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100\u00a0m final, Lewis faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart. In what would be the deepest 100\u00a0meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, Lewis not only defeated his opponents, he reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s. Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time he had crossed the line with \"WR\" beside his name on the giant television screens, and the first time he could savor his achievement at the moment it occurred. He could be seen with tears in his eyes afterwards. \"The best race of my life\", Lewis said. \"The best technique, the fastest. And I did it at thirty.\" Lewis's world record would stand for nearly three years. Lewis also anchored the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year he had anchored a 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m squad to a world record.\nLong jump showdown versus Powell.\nThe 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport. Lewis was up against his main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. Lewis had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which he competed. Powell had been unable to defeat Lewis, despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see them ruled fouls or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that Lewis himself had only rarely surpassed, only to see Lewis surpass them on his next or final attempt.\nLewis' first jump was 8.68\u00a0m (), a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside Lewis all-time. Powell, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped 8.54\u00a0m () to claim second place in the second round. Lewis jumped 8.83\u00a0m (), a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark that would have won all but two long jump competitions in history. Powell responded with a long foul, estimated to be around 8.80\u00a0m (). Lewis's next jump made history: the first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon's record. The wind gauge indicated the jump was wind-aided, so it could not be considered a record, but it would still count in the competition. 8.91\u00a0m () was the greatest leap ever under any condition.\nIn the next round, Powell responded. His jump was measured as 8.95\u00a0m (); this time, his jump was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3\u00a0m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Powell had not only jumped 4\u00a0cm further than Lewis, he had eclipsed the 23-year-old mark set by Bob Beamon and done so at low altitude. Lewis still had two jumps left, although he was now no longer chasing Beamon, but Powell. He leaped 8.87\u00a0m (), which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of 8.84\u00a0m (). He thus lost his first long jump competition in a decade. Powell's 8.95\u00a0m () and Lewis's final two jumps still stand, as of September 2025, as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is 8.74\u00a0m ().\nLewis' reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Powell. \"He just did it\", Lewis said of Powell's winning jump. \"It was that close, and it was the best of his life.\" Powell did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though both were wind-aided jumps at altitude: 8.99\u00a0m () in 1992 and 8.95\u00a0m () in 1994. Lewis's best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at 8.72\u00a0m (), and an 8.68\u00a0m () under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.\nIn reference to his efforts at the 1991 World Championships, Lewis said, \"This has been the greatest meet that I've ever had.\" \"Track and Field News\" was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after these Championships, \"It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.\" Lewis's 1991 outstanding results earned him the ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award he shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.\nFinal years and retirement.\nAfter the heights reached in 1991, Lewis started to lose his dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though he anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 \u00d7 200\u00a0m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992, he failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100\u00a0m or 200\u00a0m. In the latter race, he finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track. Lewis did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team. At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Lewis jumped 8.67\u00a0m () in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell who did a final-round 8.64\u00a0m (). In the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. He covered the final leg in 8.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.\nLewis competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100\u00a0m, and did not compete in the long jump. He did, however, earn his first World Championship medal in the 200\u00a0m, a bronze with his 19.99 s performance. That medal would prove to be his final Olympic or World Championship medal in a running event. Injuries kept Lewis largely sidelined for the next few years, then he made a comeback for the 1996 season.\nIn 1996, Lewis qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump for the fifth time, the first time an American man has done so. At the 1996 Olympics, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iv\u00e1n Pedroso, affected their performances. Lewis, on the other hand, was in good form. Though he did not match past performances, his third-round leap of 8.50\u00a0m () won gold by 0.21\u00a0m () over second-place finisher James Beckford of Jamaica. He became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstr\u00f8m and American discus thrower Al Oerter; the three would be joined by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016 and swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2024. Lewis's nine gold medals also tie him for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina,Mark Spitz and Katie Ledecky behind Phelps.\nLewis' 8.50\u00a0m () jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35\u201339 age group.\nControversy struck when, as \"Track and Field News\" put it, \"Lewis' attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off his final gold.\" After Lewis's unexpected long jump gold, it was noted that he could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if he entered the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team. Any member of the American Olympic men's track and field team could be used, even if they had not qualified for the relay event. Lewis said, \"If they asked me, I'd run it in a second. But they haven't asked me to run it.\" He further suggested on \"Larry King Live\" that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. Lewis had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude Lewis from the team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, \"The basis of their [the relay team's] opinion was 'We want to run, we worked our butts off and we deserve to be here.'\" The American relay team finished second behind Canada.\nLewis retired from track and field in 1997.\nDrug testing exoneration.\nIn 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to \"Sports Illustrated\" that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete. Before showing the documents to \"Sports Illustrated\", Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. His case was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. The USOC claimed his case \"baseless\" as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.\nLewis was among the named athletes and Exum's documents revealed that at the 1988 Olympics trials he had three positive results on a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. All were and are banned in sport due to their activity as stimulants, though at the time all three were available over-the-counter as dietary supplements or treatments for cold and allergy symptoms. The combined concentrations of these stimulants detected in the three successive tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.\nLewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain \"ma huang\", the Chinese name for \"Ephedra sinica\", an ephedrine-bearing plant which was then marketed as a weight loss aid. Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.\nThe highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed in 2003 that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"\nFollowing Exum's revelations the IAAF affirmed that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes' names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".\n\"Carl did nothing wrong. There was never intent. He was never told 'you violated the rules,'\" said Martin D. Singer, Lewis's lawyer, who also said that Lewis had inadvertently taken the banned stimulants in an over-the-counter herbal remedy. In an April 2003 interview, Lewis agreed that he tested positive three times in 1988 but he was let off as that was the normal practice in those times. \"The only thing I can say is I think it's unfortunate what Wade Exum is trying to do\", said Lewis. \"I don't know what people are trying to make out of nothing because everyone was treated the same, so what are we talking about? I don't get it.\"\nAchievements and honors.\nHonors.\nIn 1999, Lewis was voted \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the International Olympic Committee, elected \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the International Association of Athletics Federations and named \"Olympian of the Century\" by \"Sports Illustrated\". In 2000 his alma mater University of Houston named the Carl Lewis International Complex after him.\nIn 2010, Lewis was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\nIn 2016, Lewis was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Association Hall of Fame.\n World Athlete of the Year (Men)\uff1a1988, 1991\n World Sportsman of the Year: 1983, 1984, 1988, 1991\nCareer after retiring from athletics.\nFilm and television.\nLewis has appeared in numerous films and television productions. Among them, he played himself in cameos in \"Perfect Strangers\", \"Speed Zone\", \"Alien Hunter\" and \"Material Girls\". He made an appearance on \"The Weakest Link\". He also played Stu in the made-for-TV movie \"Atomic Twister\".\nIn 2011, Lewis appeared in the short documentary \"Challenging Impossibility\" which features the feats of strength demonstrated by the late spiritual teacher and peace advocate Sri Chinmoy.\nLewis also appeared in the film \"The Last Adam\" (2006).\nIn 2024, Lewis appeared in the fourth season of \"\", the Spanish version of \"Masked Singer\", under the Panda mask. He was eliminated in the season premiere.\nBid for New Jersey State Senate.\nOn April 11, 2011, Lewis filed petitions to run as a Democrat for the New Jersey Senate in the state's 8th legislative district in Burlington County. Two weeks later he was disqualified by Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state Kim Guadagno, as he did not meet the state's requirement that Senate candidates live in New Jersey for four years. Lewis appealed his decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; the court initially granted his appeal but a few days later the court reversed itself and Lewis withdrew his name.\nCoaching.\nAs of 2025, Lewis serves as the head track and field coach at his alma mater, the University of Houston. He was elevated from assistant coach in 2023.\nPersonal life.\nIn the 2025 documentary \"I'm Carl Lewis\", Lewis revealed that he had never been in a long-term relationship out of fear that it would have affected his professional aspirations. He has a son named Bakim aka Blew, who is a Director/Videographer and lives in Houston, Texas.\nLewis became a vegan in 1990, during his late twenties, and has credited his outstanding 1991 results in part to his vegan diet. He has said that it is better suited to him because he can eat a larger quantity without affecting his athleticism, and he believes that switching to a vegan diet can lead to improved athletic performance.\nAt a 2019 Pan American Games news conference, and in the aftermath of the deadly El Paso and Dayton shootings, Lewis called then\u2011U.S. President Donald Trump \"a racist who is prejudiced, misogynistic, who doesn't value anyone outside of himself\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "67129", "revid": "39761822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67129", "title": "Carlos Castaneda", "text": "American anthropologist (1925\u20131998)\nCarlos C\u00e9sar Salvador Arana (December 25, 1925 \u2013 April 27, 1998), better known as Carlos Castaneda, was an American anthropologist and writer. Starting in 1968, Castaneda published a series of books that describe a training in shamanism that he received under the tutelage of a Yaqui \"Man of Knowledge\" named don Juan Matus. While Castaneda's work was accepted as factual by many when the books were first published, the training he described is now generally considered to be fictional.\nThe first three books\u2014\"\", \"A Separate Reality\", and \"Journey to Ixtlan\"\u2014were written while he was an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Castaneda was awarded his bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, based on the work he described in these books.\nAt the time of his death in 1998, Castaneda's books had sold more than eight million copies and had been published in 17 languages.\nEarly life and education.\nAccording to his birth record, Carlos Casta\u00f1eda was born Carlos C\u00e9sar Salvador Arana on December 25, 1925, in Cajamarca, Peru, son of C\u00e9sar Arana and Susana Casta\u00f1eda. Immigration records confirm the birth record's date and place of birth. Castaneda moved to the United States in 1951 and became a naturalized citizen on June 21, 1957. Castaneda studied anthropology and was awarded his bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles.\nCareer.\nCastaneda's first three books\u2014\"\", \"A Separate Reality\", and \"Journey to Ixtlan\"\u2014were written while he was an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He wrote that these books were ethnographic accounts describing his apprenticeship with a traditional \"Man of Knowledge\" identified as \"Don Juan Matus\", an Indigenous Yaqui from northern Mexico. The veracity of these books was doubted from their original publication, and they are considered to be fictional by many scholars. Castaneda was awarded his bachelor's and doctoral degrees based on the work described in these books.\nIn 1974, his fourth book, \"Tales of Power\", chronicled the end of the story of his apprenticeship with Matus. Despite published questions and criticism, Castaneda continued to be popular with the reading public, and subsequent publications described further aspects of his training with Don Juan.\nCastaneda wrote that don Juan recognized him as the new \"nagual\", or leader of a party of seers of his lineage. He said Matus also used the term \"nagual\" to signify that part of perception which is in the realm of the unknown yet still reachable by man, implying that, for his party of seers, Matus was a connection to that unknown. Castaneda often referred to this unknown realm as \"non-ordinary reality\".\nWhile Castaneda was a well-known cultural figure, he rarely appeared in public forums. He was the subject of a cover article in the March 5, 1973, issue of \"Time,\" which described him as \"an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a tortilla\". There was controversy when it was revealed that Castaneda might have used a surrogate for his cover portrait. Correspondent Sandra Burton, apparently unaware of Castaneda's principle of freedom from personal history, confronted him about discrepancies in his account of his life. He responded: \"To ask me to verify my life by giving you my statistics\u00a0... is like using science to validate sorcery. It robs the world of its magic and makes milestones out of us all.\" Following that interview, Castaneda completely retired from public view until the 1990s.\nTensegrity.\nIn the 1990s, Castaneda once again began appearing in public to promote Tensegrity, described in promotional materials as \"the modernized version of some movements called magical passes developed by Indigenous shamans who lived in Mexico in times before the Spanish conquest\".\nCastaneda, with Carol Tiggs, Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar, created Cleargreen Incorporated in 1995, whose stated purpose was \"to sponsor Tensegrity workshops, classes and publications\". Tensegrity seminars, books, and other merchandise were sold through Cleargreen.\nPersonal life.\nCastaneda married Margaret Runyan in Mexico in 1960, according to Runyan's memoirs. He is listed as the father on the birth certificate of Runyan's son, C.J. Castaneda, even though the biological father was a different man. In an interview, Runyan said she and Castaneda were married from 1960 to 1973; however, Castaneda obscured whether the marriage occurred, and his death certificate stated he had never been married.\nDeath.\nCastaneda died on April 27, 1998 in Los Angeles due to complications from hepatocellular cancer. There was no public service; he was cremated, and the ashes were sent to Mexico. His death was unknown to the outside world until nearly two months later, on June 19, 1998, when an obituary, \"A Hushed Death for Mystic Author Carlos Castaneda\" by staff writer J. R. Moehringer appeared in the \"Los Angeles Times\".\nCastaneda's students.\nAfter Castaneda stepped away from public view in 1973, he bought a large multi-dwelling property in Los Angeles, which he shared with some of his followers, including Taisha Abelar (formerly Maryann Simko) and Florinda Donner-Grau (formerly Regine Thal). Like Castaneda, Abelar, and Donner-Grau were students of anthropology at UCLA. Each subsequently wrote a book about her experiences of Castaneda's / don Juan's teachings from a female perspective: \"The Sorcerer's Crossing: A Woman's Journey\" by Taisha Abelar, and \"Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers' World\" by Florinda Donner. Castaneda endorsed both of these books as authentic reports of the sorcery experience of Don Juan's world.\nAround the time Castaneda died, his companions Donner-Grau, Abelar and Patricia Partin informed friends they were leaving on a long journey. Amalia Marquez (also known as Talia Bey) and Tensegrity instructor Kylie Lundahl also left Los Angeles. Weeks later, Partin's red Ford Escort was found abandoned in Death Valley. Luis Marquez, Bey's brother, went to the police in 1999 over his sister's disappearance, but could not convince them that it merited investigation.\nIn 2003, Partin's sun-bleached skeleton was discovered by a pair of hikers in Death Valley's Panamint Dunes area and identified in 2006 by DNA testing. The investigating authorities ruled the cause of death as undetermined. However, Castaneda often talked about suicide, and associates believe the women killed themselves in the wake of Castaneda's death.\nReception.\nThe veracity of these books and the existence of Don Juan, were doubted from their original publication, and there is now consensus among critics and scholars that the books are largely, if not completely, fictional.\nEarly responses.\nIn the early years following the publication of Castaneda's first book, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge (1968), there was considerable positive coverage and interest in his work. \"The New York Times\" published a review that praised the book's captivating storytelling and its portrayal of Don Juan as a \"remarkable, almost legendary figure\". In 1971, \"Life Magazine\" included a review of \"A Separate Reality\", describing the book as \"breathtaking\" and focusing on the intrigue of his shamanic journey. The \"Saturday Review\" highlighted the vividness of Castaneda's descriptions and his portrayal of Don Juan's teachings as thought-provoking and transformative. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewed the book positively, emphasizing its impact on readers and its exploration of consciousness and reality. \"The Guardian's\" review of the book acknowledged Castaneda's skill as a writer and his ability to create a sense of immersion in his narrative. \"Time Magazine\" ran a feature article on Castaneda in 1973, which acknowledged the controversy and skepticism surrounding Castaneda's account but highlighted the book's allure, describing it as \"an extraordinary narrative\".\nLater responses.\nConcerns about the authenticity of Castaneda's work have existed since its initial publication, despite reviewers praising its writing and storytelling. For example, while Edmund Leach praised \"The Teachings of Don Juan\" as \"a work of art,\" he doubted its factual authenticity. Anthropologist E. H. Spicer offered a somewhat mixed review of the book, highlighting Castaneda's expressive prose and his vivid depiction of his relationship with don Juan. However, Spicer noted that the events described in the book were not consistent with other ethnographic accounts of Yaqui cultural practices, concluding it was unlikely that don Juan had ever participated in Yaqui group life. Spicer also wrote, \"[It is] wholly gratuitous to emphasize, as the subtitle does, any connection between the subject matter of the book and the cultural traditions of the Yaquis.\"\nIn a series of articles, R. Gordon Wasson, the ethnobotanist who made psychoactive mushrooms famous, similarly praised Castaneda's work, while expressing doubts about its accuracy.\nAn early unpublished review by anthropologist Weston La Barre was more critical and questioned the book's accuracy. The review, initially commissioned by \"The New York Times Book Review\", was rejected and replaced by a more positive review from anthropologist Paul Riesman.\nBeginning in 1976, Richard de Mille published a series of criticisms that uncovered inconsistencies in Castaneda's field notes, as well as 47 pages of apparently plagiarized quotes.\nThose familiar with Yaqui culture also questioned Castaneda's accounts, including anthropologist Jane Holden Kelley. Other criticisms of Castaneda's work include the total lack of Yaqui vocabulary or terms for any of his experiences, and his refusal to defend himself against the accusation that he received his PhD from UCLA through deception.\nModern perspectives.\nAccording to William W. Kelly, chair of the anthropology department at Yale University:\nI doubt you'll find an anthropologist of my generation who regards Castaneda as anything but a clever con man. It was a hoax, and surely don Juan never existed as anything like the figure of his books. Perhaps to many it is an amusing footnote to the gullibility of naive scholars, although to me it remains a disturbing and unforgivable breach of ethics.\nSociologist David Silverman sees value in the work even while considering it fictional. In \"Reading Castaneda,\" he describes the apparent deception as a critique of anthropology field work in general\u2014a field that relies heavily on personal experience, and necessarily views other cultures through a lens. He said that the descriptions of peyote trips and the work's fictional nature were meant to place doubt on other works of anthropology.\nDonald Wiebe cites Castaneda to explain the insider/outsider problem as it relates to mystical experiences, while acknowledging the fictional nature of Castaneda's work.\nExistence of Don Juan Matus.\nScholars have also debated \"whether Castaneda served as an apprentice to the alleged Yaqui sorcerer don Juan Matus or if he invented the whole odyssey.\" Castaneda's books are classified as non-fiction by their publisher, although there is consensus among critics that they are largely, if not completely, fictional.\nCastaneda critic Richard de Mille published two books\u2014\"Castaneda's Journey: The Power and the Allegory\" and \"The Don Juan Papers\"\u2014in which he argued that don Juan was imaginary, based on several arguments, including that Castaneda did not report on the Yaqui name of a single plant he learned about, and that he and don Juan \"go quite unmolested by pests that normally torment desert hikers.\" \"Castaneda's Journey\" also includes 47 pages of quotes Castaneda attributed to don Juan, which were actually from a variety of other sources, including anthropological journal articles and even well-known writers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and C. S. Lewis. In response, Castaneda was defended in a letter to the editor by the inventor of Core Shamanism, Michael Harner. Walter Shelburne contends that \"the Don Juan chronicle cannot be a true account.\"\nAccording to Jeroen Boekhoven, Castaneda spent some time with Ram\u00f3n Medina Silva, a Huichol \"mara'akame\" (shaman) and artist who may have inspired the don Juan character. Silva was murdered during a brawl in 1971.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nParodies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a part of the Volga Federal District; and its capital and largest city is Kazan, an important cultural centre in Russia. The region's main source of wealth is oil with a strong petrochemical industry.\nThe republic borders the oblasts of Kirov, Ulyanovsk, Samara and Orenburg, as well as the republics of Mari El, Udmurtia, Chuvashia and Bashkortostan. Tatarstan has strong cultural, linguistic and ethnic ties with its eastern neighbour, Bashkortostan, which is also a republic of Russia. The area of Tatarstan is , occupying 0.4% of the total surface of the country. As of the 2021 Census, the population of Tatarstan was\u00a04,004,809.\nThe earliest known organised state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria, which adopted Islam in 922. This is celebrated yearly in the city of \"Bolgar\". Successor states were the Golden Horde and the Khanate of Kazan. Only in 1920, the next Tatar state, the Tatar ASSR was formed. It became the current Republic of Tatarstan in 1992.\nTatarstan is a significant region of Russia in its connections to the global Islamic world. Its relations serve \"both federal foreign policy goals and local aspirations for international recognition\".\nThe official languages of the republic are Tatar, a Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak sub-branch, and Russian. The head of Tatarstan is Rustam Minnihanov. Religious leaders include the mufti Kamil Samigullin and the metropolitan bishop Cyril Nakonechny.\nEtymology.\n\"Tatarstan\" derives from the name of the ethnic group\u2014the Tatars\u2014and the Persian suffix \"-stan\" (meaning \"state\" or \"country\" of, an ending common to many Eurasian countries). Another version of the Russian name is \"\" (), which was official along with \"Tatar ASSR\" during Soviet rule.\nCorrect spelling of the Persian -stan as a suffix would use i/e after a consonant. Turkish spells Tatarstan as \"Tataristan\", and occasionally in Tatar, it is \"Tatar\u0131stan\" (\u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d).\nIn addition to the official \"Tatarstan respublikas\u0131\", the name \"Tatarstan C\u00f6mh\u00fcriy\u00e4te\" (\u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0496\u04e9\u043c\u04bb\u04af\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0435, from Arabic \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629) is used as well.\nGeography.\nThe republic is located in the center of the East European Plain, approximately east of Moscow. It lies between the Volga River and the Kama River (a tributary of the Volga), and extends east to the Ural Mountains.\nOak is the dominant tree species on 87% of the total area, followed by aspen, linden, birch, and Scots pine. The total forest cover has decreased from 51.2% to 17.1% over the last 300 years.\nThe Volga-Kama Nature Reserve is situated in Tatarstan.\nRivers.\nMajor rivers include:\nLakes.\nMajor reservoirs of the republic include:\nThe biggest lake is Kaban. The biggest swamp is Kulyagash.\nNatural resources.\nThe major natural resources of Tatarstan include oil, natural gas and gypsum. It is estimated that the republic has over one billion tons of oil deposits.\nAdministrative divisions.\nTatarstan's administrative and territorial divisions form 43 municipal districts and 2 urban districts (Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny), as well as 39 urban settlements and 872 rural settlements.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe earliest known organised state within the boundaries of Tatarstan was Volga Bulgaria (c.\u00a0700\u20131238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East, and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus, and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922.\nVolga Bulgaria finally fell to the armies of the Mongol prince Batu Khan in the late 1230s (see Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria). The inhabitants, a large amount of them killed and the rest mixing with the Golden Horde's Kipchaks, became known as the Volga Tatars. In the 1430s, the region again became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars.\nThe Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. A large number of Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and were culturally Russified. Cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593 all mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine the Great. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine's auspices was constructed in 1766\u20131770.\n19th century.\nIn the 19th century, Tatarstan became a centre of Jadidism, an Islamic movement that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire.\n20th century.\nDuring the Civil War of 1918\u20131920 Tatar nationalists attempted to establish an independent republic (the Idel-Ural State, \"Idel\" being the name of the Volga in Tatar) along with the neighbouring Bashkirs. Initially supported by the Bolsheviks, the state existed up until March 1918, when high-ranking members of its parliament were arrested by the Bolsheviks (who had turned on the state and denounced it as bourgeois) before the official declaration of its constitution. The Soviets later set up the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was established on 27\u00a0May 1920. The boundaries of the republic did not include a majority of the Volga Tatars. The Tatar Union of the Godless were persecuted in Joseph Stalin's 1928 purges.\nA famine occurred in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921\u20131922 as a result of the policy of war communism. The famine deaths of between 500,000 and 2 million Tatars in the Tatar ASSR and in the Volga-Ural region in 1921\u20131922 was catastrophic as half of the Volga Tatar population in the USSR died.\nStarting in the 1960s, schools opened in Tatarstan that taught Russian as an official second language, as it was necessary in order to individually advance in the broader Soviet society. By the 1980s, few schools still taught the Tatar language.\nPresent day.\nOn 30\u00a0August 1990, Tatarstan declared its sovereignty with the \"Declaration on the State Sovereignty of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic\" and in 1992 Tatarstan held a referendum on the new constitution, promoted by Tatarstan's President Shaymiyev and supervised by Helsinki Commission staff. Parliament opposition revolved around the Russian faction Narodovlastie (People's Power). Some 62% of those who took part voted in favour of the constitution, with ethnic Tatars supporting it much more than Russians. In the new constitution, Tatarstan is defined as a Sovereign State. However, the referendum and constitution were declared unconstitutional by the Russian Constitutional Court. Articles 1 and 3 of the Constitution as introduced in 2002 define Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation, removing the \"sovereignty\" term.\nOn 15\u00a0February 1994, the Treaty \"On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan\" and Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (\"On Delimitation of Authority in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Relations\") were signed. The power-sharing agreement was renewed on 11\u00a0July 2007, though with much of the power delegated to Tatarstan reduced.\nOn 20\u00a0December 2008, in response to Russia recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People organisation declared Tatarstan independent and asked for United Nations recognition. However, this declaration was ignored both by the United Nations and the Russian government. On 24\u00a0July 2017, the autonomy agreement signed in 1994 between Moscow and Kazan expired, making Tatarstan the last republic of Russia to lose its special status.\nDemographics.\nPopulation: \u2009(2021 census); \u2009(2010 census); \u2009(2002 census); \u2009(1989 Soviet census)\nSettlements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVital statistics.\nNote: TFR source.\nEthnic groups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThere are about 2 million ethnic Tatars and 1.5 million ethnic Russians in Tatarstan, along with significant numbers of Chuvash, Mari, and Udmurts, some of whom are Tatar-speaking. The Ukrainian, Mordvin, and Bashkir minorities are also significant. Most Tatars are Sunni Muslims, but a small minority known as Ker\u00e4\u015fen Tatars are Orthodox Christians, some of whom regard themselves as being distinct from other Tatars even though most Ker\u00e4\u015fen dialects differ only slightly from the Central Dialect of the Tatar language.\nDespite many decades of assimilation and intermingling, some Ker\u00e4\u015fen demanded and were awarded the option of being specifically enumerated in 2002. This has provoked great controversy, however, as many intellectuals have sought to portray the Tatars as homogeneous and indivisible. Although listed separately below, the Ker\u00e4\u015fen are still included in the grand total for the Tatars. Another unique ethnic group, concentrated in Tatarstan, is the Qaratay Mordvins.\nJews.\nTatar and Udmurt Jews are special territorial groups of the Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residential areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) populations. The Ashkenazi Jews first appeared in Tatarstan in the 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and Tatarstan are subdivided by cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews, or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.\nLanguages.\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the two state languages of the republic are Tatar and Russian. According to the 2002 Russian Federal Law (\"On Languages of Peoples of the Russian Federation\"), the official script is Cyrillic. Linguistic anthropologist Dr. Suzanne Wertheim notes that \"some men signal ideological devotion to the Tatar cause by refusing to accommodate to Russian-dominant public space or Russian speakers\", whilst women, in promoting \"the Tatar state and Tatar national culture, index their pro-Tatar ideological stances more diplomatically, and with linguistic practices situated only within the Tatar-speaking community... in keeping with normative gender roles within the Tatar republic.\"\nReligion.\nAs of 2012,[ [update]] Islam was the most common faith in Tatarstan, adhered to by 53.8% of the estimated 3.8 million population. Most of the remaining population is either Russian Orthodox Christian or non-religious.\nThe muftiate of Tatarstan is the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Republic of Tatarstan, led by Kamil Samigullin.\nEstablished in 922, the first Muslim state within the boundaries of modern Russia was Volga Bulgaria from which the Tatars inherited Islam. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922. Islam's long presence in Russia also extends at least as far back as the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, which brought the Tatars and Bashkirs on the Middle Volga into Russia.\nIn the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170\u00a0km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II.\nIn 1990, there were only 100 mosques, but by 2004 this number had risen to well over 1,000. As of 2008,[ [update]] as many as 1,398 religious organizations were registered in Tatarstan, of which 1,055 were Muslim. In September 2010, Eid al-Fitr as well as 21\u00a0May, the day the Volga Bulgars embraced Islam, were made public holidays.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is the second largest active religion in Tatarstan, and has been so for more than 150 years, with an estimated 1.6 million followers made up of ethnic Russians, Mordvins, Armenians, Belarusians, Mari people, Georgians, Chuvash and a number of Orthodox Tatars which together constitute 38% of the 3.8 million population of Tatarstan. On 23\u00a0August 2010, the \"Orthodox monuments of Tatarstan\" exhibition was held in Kazan by the Tatarstan Ministry of Culture and the Kazan Eparchy. At all public events, an Orthodox Priest is called upon along with an Islamic Mufti.\nThe Muslim Religious Board of Tatarstan frequently organizes activities, like the 'Islamic graffiti Contest' which was held on 20\u00a0November 2011.\nIslamic radicalism.\nBefore the 2010s, more radical versions of Islam were very rare and sporadic in Tatarstan. The most famous examples included the Ittifaq Party, whose leader Fauziya Bairamova was pro-Salafist in the 2000s. Imam Rustem Safin in Kazan was suspended for two years for his association with the pan-Islamic Hizb al-Tahrir party. A few dozen Tatars participated in the Chechen separatist wars, and in 2010 the Tatarstan Interior Ministry disbanded a short-lived formation in Nurlat district that had tried to imitate the Dagestan extremist movement of the 1990s.\nA noticeable turning point was in 2012, when the Tatar mufti Valiulla Yakupov, who opposed extremism, was shot dead in Kazan. On the same day, mufti Ildus Fayzov was injured when his car was blown up. A month later, another car exploded; this time, a bomb was supposedly detonated accidentally. Inside the car, three bodies were found, along with weapons and radical Islamic literature. They were suspected of planning an attack on president Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Tatarstan. Around the same time, a demonstration by supporters of Sharia law was seen, which was \u201cvery unusual for Tatarstan\u201d.\nA 2021 George Washington University study of Islam in Russia states: \u201cThe majority of Russian Muslims feel well integrated into Russia and show similar patriotism to Orthodox citizens. They favor either traditional Sufi-influenced Islam or a more politically engaged Islam that supports Putin. In addition, there is a small but increasingly influential minority of more radical anti-Russian Salafists.\u201d\nThe source of the rise of radicalism in Tatarstan is thought to be the combination of its native Tatar population feeling the desire for a more strong religious identity (which was weakened during Soviet Era), and an increased immigration from Caucasus and Central Asia.\nCurrent mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin has expressed the following regarding Wahhabism: \"We must ban this ideology, it is misanthropic, but the counter-enforcement practice in our country does not ban ideologies, but bans specific organizations. In our country, Wahhabis represent a set of different types of structures, they are developing, evolving. After such a ban, their activities will become significantly more complicated, which will reduce the influx of people into the terrorist underground\".\nPolitics.\nTatarstan's unicameral State Council consists of 100\u00a0seats: fifty for representatives of the parties and fifty for deputies from the republic's localities. The Chairman of the State Council is Farit Mukhametshin, who has served since 27\u00a0May 1998. The government is the \u0421abinet of Ministers. The prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan is Alexei Pesoshin.\nAccording to the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Rais can be elected only by the people of Tatarstan, but due to Russian federal law, this law was suspended for an indefinite term. The Russian law on the election of governors says they should be elected by regional parliaments and that the candidate for Rais can be presented only by the president of Russia.\nIn December 2022, regional lawmakers voted to change the title of the head of the republic from \"president\" to \"rais\" (an Arabic title for \"leader\"); lawmakers were expected to adopt new amendments to Tatarstan's constitution so that it would be in line with the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia and a federal law in 2021 which abolished regional presidencies. The title of president was seen as the last remaining symbol of federalism following the centralisation reforms under Vladimir Putin. Incumbent president Rustam Minnikhanov originally was to retain the title of president until his term expires in 2025 under transitional agreements, however he became Rais in February 2024.\nPolitical status.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan is a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. Most of the Russian federal subjects are tied with the Russian federal government by the uniform Federal Treaty (The contract expired in 2017), but relations between the government of Tatarstan and the Russian federal government are more complex and are precisely defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan. The following passage from the Constitution defines the republic's status without contradicting the Constitution of the Russian Federation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Republic of Tatarstan is a democratic state governed by the rule of law within the Russian Federation. The statehood of the Republic of Tatarstan is expressed in its possession of the full extent of state power outside the purview of the Russian Federation and the powers of the Russian Federation on matters of joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan; in its possession of its own territory, population, system of state authorities, its own Constitution and legislation, state languages, and state symbols.\nRelations with Islamic world.\nThe Republic of Tatarstan is actively involved in the global Islamic world. For example, relations with Turkey are significant. This is reflected in the \u201cStrategic Cooperation between Turkey and Tatarstan\u201d category on the website of the head of Tatarstan. According to Minnikhanov, \u201cTurkish companies have invested two billion US dollars in our republic. Today (2017) 10 Turkish factories are successfully operating in Tatarstan. The connections between Tatarstan and Turkey serve as a link between Turkey and Moscow.\u201d Erdo\u011fan has emphasized the close connection between Tatars and Turks.\nCooperation between Tatarstan and Iran has also been highlighted. In 2022, Minnikhanov stated that \u201cwe have rich historical, economic and cultural ties, as well as a long experience of cooperation\u201d. Iran\u2019s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, called Tatarstan \u201ca brother [of Iran]\u201d, and hoped for even closer cooperation between them.\nIn 2022, Hamas leader Isma\u2019il Haniyya visited Kazan. The meeting \u201cdiscussed issues of interaction through the Russia-Islamic World Organization, which Minnikhanov has headed since 2014\u201d. According to Minnokhanov, they work closely with their Palestinian colleagues. In 2010, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also visited Kazan, and during his visit described Tatarstan as \u201cthe cradle of Islam\u201d. Since the start of the Gaza War, Tatarstan has sent humanitarian aid to the region. Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin expressed his support for the Palestinians in November 2023, accusing the \"collective West\" of complicity in genocide.\n\"Kazan Forum\" is a \"platform for economic cooperation between the Russian Federation and the countries of the Islamic world\". During the 2025 forum, president Vladimir Putin stated that \"Tatarstan is one of the regions of the Russian Federation that is most actively building such fruitful and constructive relationships\".\nGiuliano Bifolchi, a PhD of Islamic history, the founder of Special Eurasia: \"Tatarstan\u2019s location within Russia is strategically important, serving as a vital link to Central Asia and the Muslim world. Its Turkic and Islamic identity, historical pursuit of autonomy, and high industrialisation provide it with distinct leverage. While the republic does not advocate separation, it constitutes a sensitive point within Russia\u2019s internal structure, where issues of identity, political control, and foreign policy intersect. Its role in hosting international forums serves both federal foreign policy goals and local aspirations for international recognition\".\nEconomy.\nTatarstan is one of the most economically developed regions of Russia. The republic is highly industrialised and ranks second to Samara Oblast in terms of industrial production per km2.\nIn 2021, Tatarstan's gross regional product was \u20ac40 billion, while GRP per capita was \u20ac10,000.\nThe region's main source of wealth is oil. Tatarstan produces 32 million tonnes of crude oil per year and has estimated oil reserves of more than 1 billion tons. Industrial production constitutes 45% of the Republic's gross regional domestic product. The most developed manufacturing industries are petrochemical industry and machine building. The truck-maker KamAZ is the region's largest enterprise and employs about one-fifth of Tatarstan's workforce. Kazanorgsintez, based in Kazan, is one of Russia's largest chemical companies. Tatarstan's aviation industry produces Tu-214 passenger airplanes and helicopters. The Kazan Helicopter Plant is one of the largest helicopter manufacturers in the world. Engineering, textiles, clothing, wood processing, and food industries are also of key significance in Tatarstan.\nTatarstan consists of three distinct industrial regions. The northwestern part is an old industrial region where engineering, chemical, and light industry dominate. In the newly industrial northeast region with its core in the Naberezhnye Chelny\u2013Nizhnekamsk agglomeration, major industries are automobile construction, the chemical industry, and power engineering. The southeast region has oil production with engineering under development. The north, central, south, and southwest parts of the republic are rural regions. The republic has huge water resources\u2014the annual flow of rivers of the Republic exceeds . Soils are widely diverse, with fertile soils covering approximately one-third of the territory that contribute to successful agricultural production. The main agricultural exports from Tatarstan are wheat, barley, and peas. Due to the high development of agriculture in Tatarstan (it contributes 5.1% of the total revenue of the republic), forests occupy only 16% of its territory. The agricultural sector of the economy is represented mostly by large companies as Ak Bars Holding and \"Krasnyi Vostok Agro\".\nPJSC Tattelecom operates in Tatarstan, a multiservice telecommunications operator in the Republic of Tatarstan, aimed at various consumers: individuals, small, medium and large businesses, government authorities and municipalities, as well as other telecom operators. The company provides broadband Internet access, mobile and fixed telephony (\"Letay\"), cable TV, IP intercom, video surveillance, etc.\nThe republic has a highly developed transport network. It mainly comprises highways, railway lines, four navigable rivers\u00a0\u2014 Volga (\u0130del), Kama (\u00c7ulman), Vyatka (Noqrat) and Belaya (A\u011fidel), and oil pipelines and airlines. The territory of Tatarstan is crossed by the main gas pipelines carrying natural gas from Urengoy and Yamburg to the west and the major oil pipelines supplying oil to various cities in the European part of Russia.\nTourism.\nThere are three UNESCO world heritage sites in Tatarstan\u2014Kazan Kremlin, Bulgarian State Museum-Reserve, and Assumption Cathedral and Monastery of the town-island of Sviyazhsk.\nThe annual growth rate of tourist flow to the republic is on average 13.5%; the growth rate of the volume of services in the tourism sector is 17.0%.\nAt the end of 2016, on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan there were 104 tour operators, of which 32 dealt in domestic tourism, 65 in domestic and inbound tourism, 1 in domestic and outbound tourism, and 6 in all three.\nAs of 2017,[ [update]] 404 collective accommodation facilities (CSR) operate in the Republic of Tatarstan; 379 CSR are subject to classification (183 in Kazan, 196 in other municipalities of the Republic of Tatarstan). 334 collective accommodation facilities received the certificate of assignment of the category, which is 88.1% of the total number of operating.\nIn 2016, special attention was paid to the development of tourist centres of the Republic of Tatarstan\u2014Kazan, Bolghar, the town-island of Sviyazhsk, Yelabuga, Chistopol, and Tetyushi. The growth of tourist flow in the main tourist centres of the Republic compared to 2015 amounted to an average of 45.9%.\nCurrently, sanatorium and resort recreation is developing rapidly in Tatarstan. There are 46 sanatorium-resort institutions in the Republic of Tatarstan. The capacity of the objects of the sanatorium-resort complex of Tatarstan is 8847 beds; more than 4300 specialists are engaged in the service of residents. In 2016, more than 160 thousand people rested in the health resorts of the Republic of Tatarstan. 22 health resort institutions of the Republic of Tatarstan are members of the Association of health resort institutions \"Health resorts of Tatarstan,\" including 11 sanatoriums of PJSC \"Tatneft.\"\nSince 2016, the Republic of Tatarstan has been operating the Visit Tatarstan program, the official tourism brand of the Republic, the purpose of which is to inform tourists, monitor the reputation of the Republic, develop the tourism potential of the regions of Tatarstan, conduct market research, create partner projects with local companies, and expand internationally. \"Tatarstan: 1001 pleasure\" is the main message that tourists receive. The Visit Tatar website, where there is information about the main sights and recreation in Tatarstan, is available in 8 languages: Tatar, Russian, English, Chinese, German, Spanish, Finnish, and Persian.\nCulture.\nDue to Islamic rules on artistic depictions, Tatars developed a uniquely geometric artistry, of which the craft of leather mosaic is a staple. They also observe certain pre-Islamic holidays, such as Sabantuy, which celebrates \"the completion of spring sowing works.\"\nMajor libraries include Kazan State University Nikolai Lobachevsky Scientific Library and the National Library of the Republic of Tatarstan. There are two museums of republican significance, as well as 90\u00a0museums of local importance. In the past several years, new museums appeared throughout the Republic.\nThere are twelve theatrical institutions in Tatarstan. The state orchestra is the National Tatarstan Orchestra.\nIn 1996, the Tatar singer, Guzel Ahmetova, cooperated with the German Eurodance group named Snap!, when she sang the lyrics of the song \"Rame\".\nAida Garifullina was born in 1987 to a Tatar family in Kazan. Following studies in Nuremberg, Germany and Vienna, Austria, she has achieved fame as a lyric soprano, in high demand both on the international operatic stage and concert platform. She is also a celebrated recording artist and a promoter of the Tatar culture.\nSports.\nWith 9,175 sports venues in Tatarstan, the republic is one of the leading sports regions in Russia. Since 1973, Kazan has been making efforts to expand its sports infrastructure, with sports being a \"great source of pride\" for the people of Kazan.\nTatarstan has Rubin Kazan, a major European football team which has played in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Twice Russian champions, Rubin Kazan play in the Russian Premier League. Also, Tatarstan has Unics Kazan which has gained a significant role in European basketball, playing in Euroleague and EuroCup for decades.\nIt also has two KHL teams, the successful Ak Bars Kazan, which is based in the capital city of Kazan, and the Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk, who play in the city of Nizhnekamsk. The state also has a Russian Major League team (the second highest hockey league in Russia), Neftyanik Almetyevsk, who play in the city of Almetyevsk. There are also two Minor Hockey League teams which serve as affiliates for the two KHL teams. A team also exists in the Russian Hockey League, the HC Chelny, which is based in the city of Naberezhnye Chelny. Another team plays in the MHL-B (the second level of junior ice hockey in Russia).\nNail Yakupov is an ethnic Tatar who was drafted first overall in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\nFormer ATP No. 1 Marat Safin and former WTA number 1 Dinara Safina are of Tatar descent.\nVictor Wild and Danil Sadreev are both Tatarstan Olympians, having won a bronze in parallel giant slalom and a silver in ski jumping, respectively.\nKazan hosted the XXVII Summer Universiade in 2013, the FINA World championship in aquatic sports in August 2015, and the World Junior Championship for swimming in 2022.\nEducation.\nThe most important facilities of higher education include Kazan Federal University, Kazan State Medical University, Kazan National Research Technological University, World Information Distributed University, Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N.Tupolev and Russian Islamic University. All of these are located in the capital city, Kazan.\nPublic spaces.\nTatarstan takes a unique participatory approach to the development of public spaces that has earned it recognition. The Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme aims to create spaces for meeting or recreation. The programme covers a wide spectrum of projects, including streets, squares, parks, river banks, pavilions, and sports facilities.\nSince 2016 (and continuing until 2022), the Architecturny Desant Architectural Bureau in Kazan has improved public spaces in each of Tatarstan's 45 municipal districts, from large cities to small villages. As of April 2019, the project had revamped 328 public spaces. By creating and rehabilitating public spaces, the programme aims to be a catalyst for positive social, economic, and environmental change.\nOne notable example is the \"Beach\" at Almetyevsk, which includes public swimming pools and a terrace. Other examples include an amphitheatre in Black Lake Park, Kazan; the Central Square in Bavly; a children's playground in Bogatye Saby village, which has a unique wooden play structure; the Cube container centre in the green beach at Gorkinsko-Ometievsky forest, Kazan; and the square on Festival Boulevard, Kazan.\nThe programme used an innovative participatory design approach, which later became mandatory for similar projects across Russia. This approach partners specialists with local residents at every stage of the project, from development, to implementation, to the ongoing use of the space.\nThe Tatarstan Public Spaces Development Programme was announced as one of the six winners of the 2019 Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The jury was impressed by the programme's systematic approach and involvement of residents to decide the future of each space.\nEach public space expresses the unique identity of that particular place, tying in its history while incorporating traditional materials. Major goals of the projects include improving the quality of life for residents and improving the environment. The Arhitekturnyi Desant team aims to provide a high quality public space, no matter the size of the settlement, including quality design, infrastructure, and materials.\nSpending on the public spaces projects is helping the local economy. The number of street furniture manufacturers in the area, for example, has increased from 12 to 75 since the programme started.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; travel guide from Wikivoyage"}

One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of Rhodes against an attack by Demetrius I of Macedon, who had besieged it for a year with a large army and navy.\nAccording to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or high \u2013 approximately two-thirds of the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown \u2013 making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with the Oracle of Delphi, the Rhodians did not rebuild it. John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign re-erected the Colossus, but he was mistaken. According to the Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans (), because they erected the statue on the island.\nIn 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Mu'awiya I conquered Rhodes, and according to the \"Chronicle\" of Theophanes the Confessor, the remains of the collapsed statue were completely destroyed and sold. \nSince 2008, a series of proposals to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour have been announced, although the actual location of the original monument remains in dispute.\nSiege of Rhodes.\nIn the late fourth century BC, Rhodes, allied with Ptolemy I of Egypt, prevented a mass invasion staged by their common enemy, Antigonus I Monophthalmus.\nIn 304\u00a0BC, a relief force of ships sent by Ptolemy arrived, and Demetrius I of Macedon (son of Antigonus) and his army abandoned the siege, leaving behind most of their siege equipment. To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians sold the equipment left behind for 300 talents and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god, Helios. Construction was left to the direction of Chares, a native of Lindos in Rhodes, who had been involved with large-scale statues before. His teacher, the sculptor Lysippos, had constructed a bronze statue of Zeus at Tarentum.\nConstruction.\nConstruction began in 292\u00a0BC. Ancient accounts, which differ to some degree, describe the structure as being built with iron tie bars to which bronze plates were fixed to form the skin. The interior of the structure, which stood on a white marble pedestal near the Rhodes harbour entrance, was then filled with stone blocks as construction progressed. Other sources place the Colossus on a breakwater in the harbour. According to most contemporary descriptions, the statue itself was about 70 cubits, or tall. Much of the iron and bronze was reforged from the various weapons Demetrius's army left behind, and the abandoned second siege tower may have been used for scaffolding around the lower levels during construction.\nPhilo of Byzantium wrote in \"De septem mundi miraculis\" that Chares created the sculpture in situ by casting it in horizontal courses and then placing \"...a huge mound of earth around each section as soon as it was completed, thus burying the finished work under the accumulated earth, and carrying out the casting of the next part on the level.\"\nModern engineers have put forward a hypothesis for the statue's construction (based on the technology of the time), and the accounts of Philo and Pliny, who saw and described the ruins.\nThe base pedestal was said to be at least in diameter, and either circular or octagonal. The feet were carved in stone and covered with thin bronze plates riveted together. Eight forged iron bars set in a radiating horizontal position formed the ankles and turned up to follow the lines of the legs while becoming progressively smaller. Individually cast curved bronze plates square with turned-in edges were joined by rivets through holes formed during casting to form a series of rings. The lower plates were in thickness to the knee and thick from knee to abdomen, while the upper plates were thick except where additional strength was required at joints such as the shoulder, neck, etc.\nArchaeologist Ursula Vedder has proposed that the sculpture was cast in large sections following traditional Greek methods and that Philo's account is \"not compatible with the situation proved by archaeology in ancient Greece.\"\nAfter twelve years, in 280\u00a0BC, the statue was completed. Greek anthologies of poetry have preserved what is believed to be the dedication text on the Colossus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014\"The Greek Anthology\", W. R. Paton, trans., William Heinemann, London (1916), vol. I, p. 387.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nCollapse (226\u00a0BC).\nThe statue stood for 54 years until a 226\u00a0BC earthquake caused significant damage to large portions of Rhodes, including the harbour and commercial buildings, which were destroyed. The statue snapped at the knees and fell over onto land. Ptolemy III offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue, but the Oracle of Delphi made the Rhodians fear that they had offended Helios, and they declined to rebuild it.\nFallen state (226\u00a0BC to 653\u00a0AD).\nThe remains lay on the ground for over 800 years and, even broken, they were so impressive that many travelled to see them.\nThe remains were described briefly by Strabo (64 or 63\u00a0BC \u2013 c.\u200924\u00a0AD), in his work Geography (Book XIV, Chapter 2.5). Strabo was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.\nStrabo is best known for his work \"Geographica\" (\"Geography\"), which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known during his lifetime. Strabo states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The city of the Rhodians lies on the eastern promontory of Rhodes; and it is so far superior to all others in harbours and roads and walls and improvements in general that I am unable to speak of any other city as equal to it, or even as almost equal to it, much less superior to it. It is remarkable also for its good order, and for its careful attention to the administration of affairs of state in general; and in particular to that of naval affairs, whereby it held the mastery of the sea for a long time and overthrew the business of piracy, and became a friend to the Romans and to all kings who favoured both the Romans and the Greeks. Consequently, it not only has remained autonomous but also has been adorned with many votive offerings, which for the most part are to be found in the Dionysium and the gymnasium, but partly in other places. The best of these are, first, the Colossus of Helius, of which the author of the iambic verse says, \"seven times ten cubits in height, the work of Chares the Lindian\"; but it now lies on the ground, having been thrown down by an earthquake and broken at the knees. In accordance with a certain oracle, the people did not raise it again. This, then, is the most excellent of the votive offerings (at any rate, it is by common agreement one of the Seven Wonders).\nPliny the Elder (AD 23/24 \u2013 79) was a Roman author, a naturalist and natural philosopher, a naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire, and a friend of emperor Vespasian. Pliny wrote the encyclopedic \"Naturalis Historia\" (Natural History), which became an editorial model for encyclopedias. The \"Naturalis Historia\" is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge. Pliny remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But that which is by far the most worthy of our admiration, is the colossal statue of the Sun, which stood formerly at Rhodes, and was the work of Chares the Lindian, a pupil of the above-named Lysippus; no less than seventy cubits in height. This statue fifty-six years after it was erected, was thrown down by an earthquake; but even as it lies, it excites our wonder and admiration. Few men can clasp the thumb in their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues. Where the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seen yawning in the interior. Within it, too, are to be seen large masses of rock, by the weight of which the artist steadied it while erecting it.\nDestruction of the remains.\nThe ultimate fate of the remains of the statue is uncertain. Rhodes has two serious earthquakes per century, owing to its location on the seismically unstable Hellenic arc. Pausanias mentions in the \"Descriptio Graeciae\", writing ca. 174, how the city was so devastated by an earthquake that the sibyl oracle foretelling its destruction was considered fulfilled. This means the statue could not have survived for long if it had ever been repaired. By the 4th century Rhodes was Christianized, so any further maintenance or rebuilding, if there ever was any before, on an ancient pagan statue is unlikely. The metal would probably have been used for coins and maybe also tools by the time of the Arab wars, especially during earlier conflicts such as the Sasanian wars.\nThe onset of Islamic naval incursions against the Byzantine Empire gave rise to a dramatic account of what became of the Colossus. In 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Mu'awiya I raided Rhodes, and according to the \"Chronicle\" of Theophanes the Confessor, the remains of the statue constituted part of the booty, being melted down and sold to a Jewish merchant of Edessa who loaded the bronze onto 900\u00a0camels. The same story is recorded by Bar Hebraeus, writing in Syriac in the 13th century in Edessa (after the Arab pillage of Rhodes): \"And a great number of men hauled on strong ropes which were tied around the brass Colossus which was in the city and pulled it down. And they weighed from it three thousand loads of Corinthian brass, and they sold it to a certain Jew from Emesa\" (the Syrian city of Homs).\nUltimately, Theophanes is the sole source of this account, and all other sources can be traced to him. As Theophanes' source was Syriac, it may have had vague information about a raid and attributed the statue's demise to it, not knowing much more. Or the Arab destruction and the purported sale to a Jew may have been a metaphor for Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the destruction of a great statue.\nGiven the likely previous neglect of the remains and various opportunities for authorities to have repurposed the metal, as well as the fact that, Islamic incursions notwithstanding, the island remained an important Byzantine strategic point well into the ninth century, an Arabic raid is unlikely to have found much, if any, remaining metal to carry away. For these reasons, as well as the negative perception of the Arab conquests, L.I. Conrad considers Theophanes' story of the dismantling of the statue as likely propaganda, like the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.\nPosture.\nThe harbour-straddling Colossus was a figment of medieval imaginations based on the dedication text's mention of \"over land and sea\" twice and the writings of an Italian visitor who in 1395 noted that local tradition held that the right foot had stood where the church of St John of the Colossus was then located. Many later illustrations show the statue with one foot on either side of the harbour mouth with ships passing under it. References to this conception are also found in literary works. William Shakespeare's Cassius in \"Julius Caesar\" (I, ii, 136\u201338) says of Caesar:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShakespeare alludes to the Colossus also in \"Troilus and Cressida\" (V.5) and in \"Henry IV, Part 1\" (V.1).\n\"The New Colossus\" (1883), a sonnet by Emma Lazarus written on a cast bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in 1903, contrasts the latter with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile these fanciful images feed the misconception, the mechanics of the situation reveal that the Colossus could not have straddled the harbour as described in Lempri\u00e8re's \"Classical Dictionary\". If the completed statue had straddled the harbour, then the entire mouth of the harbour would have been effectively closed during the entirety of the construction, and the ancient Rhodians would not have had the means to dredge and re-open the harbour after construction was finished. Additionally, the fallen statue would have blocked the harbour, and since the ancient Rhodians did not have the ability to remove the fallen statue from the harbour, it would not have remained visible on land for the next 800\u00a0years, as discussed above. Even neglecting these objections, the statue was made of bronze, and engineering analyses indicate that it could not have been built with its legs apart without collapsing under its own weight.\nMany researchers have considered alternative positions for the statue which would have made it more feasible for actual construction by the ancients. There is also no evidence that the statue held a torch aloft; the records simply say that after completion, the Rhodians kindled the \"torch of freedom\". A relief in a nearby temple shows Helios standing with one hand shielding his eyes (as if saluting) and it is quite possible that the colossus was constructed in the same pose.\nWhile scholars do not know what the statue looked like, they do have a good idea of what the head and face looked like, as it was of a standard rendering at the time. The head would have had curly hair, similar to the images found on contemporary Rhodian coins.\nPossible locations.\nWhile scholars generally agree that anecdotal depictions of the Colossus straddling the harbour's entry point have no historic or scientific basis, the monument's actual location remains a matter of debate. As mentioned above, the statue is thought locally to have stood where two pillars now stand at the Mandraki port entrance.\nThe floor of the Fortress of St Nicholas, near the harbour entrance, contains a circle of sandstone blocks of unknown origin or purpose. Curved blocks of marble that were incorporated into the Fortress structure, but are considered too intricately cut to have been quarried for that purpose, have been posited as the remnants of a marble base for the Colossus, which would have stood on the sandstone block foundation.\nArchaeologist Ursula Vedder postulates that the Colossus was not located in the harbour area at all, but rather was part of the Acropolis of Rhodes, which stood on a hill that overlooks the port area. The ruins of a large temple, traditionally thought to have been dedicated to Apollo, are situated at the highest point of the hill. Vedder believes that the structure would actually have been a Helios sanctuary, and a portion of its enormous stone foundation could have served as the supporting platform for the Colossus.\nModern Colossus projects.\nIn 2008, \"The Guardian\" reported that a modern Colossus was to be built at the harbour entrance by the German artist Gert Hof leading a Cologne-based team. It was to be a giant light sculpture made partially out of melted-down weapons from around the world. It would cost up to \u20ac200\u00a0million.\nIn December 2015, a group of European architects announced plans to build a modern Colossus bestriding two piers at the harbour entrance, despite a preponderance of evidence and scholarly opinion that the original monument could not have stood there. The new statue, tall (five times the height of the original), would cost an estimated US$283 million, funded by private donations and crowdsourcing. The statue would include a cultural centre, a library, an exhibition hall, and a lighthouse, all powered by solar panels. No such plans were carried out, however, and the website for the project went offline.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

NLP asserts a connection between neurological processes, language, and acquired behavioral patterns, and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. According to Bandler and Grinder, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, allergy, the common cold, and learning disorders, often in a single session. They also say that NLP can model the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire them.\nNLP has been adopted by some hypnotherapists as well as by companies that run seminars marketed as leadership training to businesses and government agencies.\nNo scientific evidence supports the claims made by NLP advocates, and it has been called a pseudoscience. Scientific reviews have shown that NLP is based on outdated metaphors of the brain's inner workings that are inconsistent with current neurological theory, and that NLP contains numerous factual errors. Reviews also found that research that favored NLP contained significant methodological flaws, and that three times as many studies of a much higher quality failed to reproduce the claims made by Bandler, Grinder, and other NLP practitioners.\nEarly development.\nAccording to Bandler and Grinder, NLP consists of a methodology termed \"modeling\", plus a set of techniques that they derived from its initial applications. They derived many of the fundamental techniques from the work of Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson and Fritz Perls. Bandler and Grinder also drew upon the theories of Gregory Bateson, and Noam Chomsky (particularly transformational grammar).\nBandler and Grinder say that their methodology can codify the structure inherent to the therapeutic \"magic\" as performed in therapy by Perls, Satir and Erickson, and indeed inherent to any complex human activity. From that codification, they say, the structure and its activity can be learned by others. Their 1975 book, \"The Structure of Magic I: A Book about Language and Therapy\", is intended to be a codification of the therapeutic techniques of Perls and Satir.\nBandler and Grinder say that they used their own process of modeling to model Virginia Satir so they could produce what they termed the Meta-Model, a model for gathering information and challenging a client's language and underlying thinking. They say that by challenging linguistic distortions, specifying generalizations, and recovering deleted information in the client's statements, the transformational grammar concept of surface structure yields a more complete representation of the underlying deep structure and therefore has therapeutic benefit. Also derived from Satir were anchoring, future pacing and representational systems.\nIn contrast, the Milton-Model\u2014a model of the purportedly hypnotic language of Milton Erickson\u2014was described by Bandler and Grinder as \"artfully vague\" and metaphoric. The Milton-Model is used in combination with the Meta-Model as a softener, to induce \"trance\" and to deliver indirect therapeutic suggestion.\nPsychologist Jean Mercer writes that Chomsky's theories \"appear to be irrelevant\" to NLP. Linguist Karen Stollznow describes Bandler's and Grinder's reference to such experts as namedropping. Other than Satir, the people they cite as influences did not collaborate with Bandler or Grinder. Chomsky himself has no association with NLP, with his work being theoretical in nature and having no therapeutic element. Stollznow writes, \"[o]ther than borrowing terminology, NLP does not bear authentic resemblance to any of Chomsky's theories or philosophies\u2014linguistic, cognitive or political.\"\nAccording to Andr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer, a researcher in the field of hypnosis, \"the major weakness of Bandler and Grinder's linguistic analysis is that so much of it is built upon untested hypotheses and is supported by totally inadequate data.\" Weitzenhoffer adds that Bandler and Grinder misuse formal logic and mathematics, redefine or misunderstand terms from the linguistics lexicon (e.g., nominalization), create a scientific fa\u00e7ade by needlessly complicating Ericksonian concepts with unfounded claims, make factual errors, and disregard or confuse concepts central to the Ericksonian approach.\nMore recently, Bandler has stated, \"NLP is based on finding out what works and formalizing it. In order to formalize patterns I utilized everything from linguistics to holography ... The models that constitute NLP are all formal models based on mathematical, logical principles such as predicate calculus and the mathematical equations underlying holography.\" There is no mention of the mathematics of holography nor of holography in general in Spitzer's, or Grinder's account of the development of NLP.\nOn the matter of the development of NLP, Grinder recollects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My memories about what we thought at the time of discovery (with respect to the classic code we developed\u2014that is, the years 1973 through 1978) are that we were quite explicit that we were out to overthrow a paradigm and that, for example, I, for one, found it very useful to plan this campaign using in part as a guide the excellent work of Thomas Kuhn (\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\") in which he detailed some of the conditions which historically have obtained in the midst of paradigm shifts. For example, I believe it was very useful that neither one of us were qualified in the field we first went after\u2014psychology and in particular, its therapeutic application; this being one of the conditions which Kuhn identified in his historical study of paradigm shifts.\nThe philosopher Robert Todd Carroll responded that Grinder has not understood Kuhn's text on the history and philosophy of science, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create \"paradigm shifts\" volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified in a field of science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a \"paradigm shift\" in that field and (c) \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" is foremost a work of \"history\" and not an instructive text on \"creating\" paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible\u2014extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a \"paradigm shift\" is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the dominant paradigm that produces data that cannot be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm\u2014hence a \"paradigm shift\", i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm. In developing NLP, Bandler and Grinder were not responding to a paradigmatic crisis in psychology nor did they produce any data that caused a paradigmatic crisis in psychology. There is no sense in which Bandler and Grinder caused or participated in a paradigm shift. \"What did Grinder and Bandler do that makes it impossible to continue doing psychology ... without accepting their ideas? Nothing,\" argues Carroll.\nCommercialization and evaluation.\nBy the late 1970s, the human potential movement had developed into an industry and provided a market for some NLP ideas. At the center of this growth was the Esalen Institute at Big Sur, California. Perls had led numerous Gestalt therapy seminars at Esalen. Satir was an early leader and Bateson was a guest teacher. Bandler and Grinder have said that in addition to being a therapeutic method, NLP was also a study of communication and began marketing it as a business tool, writing that, \"if any human being can do anything, so can you.\" After 150 students paid $1,000 each for a ten-day workshop in Santa Cruz, California, Bandler and Grinder gave up academic writing and started producing popular books from seminar transcripts, such as \"Frogs into Princes,\" which sold more than 270,000 copies. According to court documents relating to an intellectual property dispute between Bandler and Grinder, Bandler made more than $800,000 in 1980 from workshop and book sales.\nA community of psychotherapists and students began to form around Bandler and Grinder's initial works, leading to the growth and spread of NLP as a theory and practice. For example, Tony Robbins trained with Grinder and utilized a few ideas from NLP as part of his own self-help and motivational speaking programmes. Bandler led several unsuccessful efforts to exclude other parties from using NLP. Meanwhile, the rising number of practitioners and theorists led NLP to become even less uniform than it was at its foundation. Prior to the decline of NLP, scientific researchers began testing its theoretical underpinnings empirically, with research indicating a lack of empirical support for NLP's essential theories. The 1990s were characterized by fewer scientific studies evaluating the methods of NLP than the previous decade. Tomasz Witkowski attributes this to a declining interest in the debate as the result of a lack of empirical support for NLP from its proponents.\nMain components and core concepts.\nNLP can be understood in terms of three broad components: subjectivity, consciousness, and learning.\nAccording to Bandler and Grinder, people experience the world subjectively, creating internal representations of their experiences. These representations involve the five senses and language. In other words, our conscious experiences take the form of sights, sounds, feelings, smells, and tastes. When we imagine something, recall an event, or think about the future, we utilize these same sensory systems within our minds. Furthermore it is stated that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern.\nBandler and Grinder assert that behavior (both our own and others') can be understood through these sensory-based internal representations. Behavior here includes verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as effective or adaptive behaviors and less helpful or \"pathological\" ones. They also assert that behavior in both the self and other people can be modified by manipulating these sense-based subjective representations.\nNLP posits that consciousness can be divided into conscious and unconscious components. The part of our internal representations operating outside our direct awareness is referred to as the \"unconscious mind\".\nFinally, NLP uses a method of learning called \"modeling\", designed to replicate expertise in any field. According to Bandler and Grinder, by analyzing the sequence of sensory and linguistic representations used by an expert while performing a skill, it's possible to create a mental model that can be learned by others.\nTechniques or set of practices.\nAccording to one study by Steinbach, a classic interaction in NLP can be understood in terms of several major stages including establishing rapport, gleaning information about a problem mental state and desired goals, using specific tools and techniques to make interventions, and integrating proposed changes into the client's life. The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client. The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner and the client which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal (\"e.g.\", sensory predicates and keywords) and non-verbal behavior (\"e.g.\", matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior, or responding to eye movements) of the client.\nOnce rapport is established, the practitioner may gather information about the client's present state as well as help the client define a desired state or goal for the interaction. The practitioner pays attention to the verbal and non-verbal responses as the client defines the present state and desired state and any resources that may be required to bridge the gap. The client is typically encouraged to consider the consequences of the desired outcome, and how they may affect their personal or professional life and relationships, taking into account any positive intentions of any problems that may arise. The practitioner thereafter assists the client in achieving the desired outcomes by using certain tools and techniques to change internal representations and responses to stimuli in the world. Finally, the practitioner helps the client to mentally rehearse and integrate the changes into their life. For example, the client may be asked to envision what it is like having already achieved the outcome.\nAccording to Stollznow, \"NLP also involves fringe discourse analysis and 'practical' guidelines for 'improved' communication. For example, one text asserts 'when you adopt the \"but\" word, people will remember what you said afterwards. With the \"and\" word, people remember what you said before and after.'\"\nApplications.\nAlternative medicine.\nNLP has been promoted as being able to treat a variety of diseases including Parkinson's disease, HIV/AIDS and cancer. Such claims have no supporting medical evidence. People who use NLP as a form of treatment risk serious adverse health consequences as it can delay the provision of effective medical care.\nPsychotherapeutic.\nEarly books about NLP had a psychotherapeutic focus given that the early models were psychotherapists. As an approach to psychotherapy, NLP shares similar core assumptions and foundations in common with some contemporary brief and systemic practices, such as solution focused brief therapy. NLP has also been acknowledged as having influenced these practices with its reframing techniques which seeks to achieve behavior change by shifting its \"context\" or \"meaning\", for example, by finding the positive connotation of a thought or behavior.\nThe two main therapeutic uses of NLP are, firstly, as an adjunct by therapists practicing in other therapeutic disciplines and, secondly, as a specific therapy called Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy.\nAccording to Stollznow, \"Bandler and Grinder's infamous \"Frogs into Princes\" and their other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats a broad range of physical and mental conditions and learning difficulties, including epilepsy, myopia and dyslexia. With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR).\" A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt \"et al.\" (2012) concluded that \"there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes.\" In his review of NLP, Stephen Briers writes, \"NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basis ... [and its] evidence base is virtually non-existent.\" Eisner writes, \"NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky approach to dealing with mental health problems. Unfortunately, NLP appears to be the first in a long line of mass marketing seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorder ... it appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness. What remains is a mass-marketed serving of psychopablum.\"\nAndr\u00e9 Muller Weitzenhoffer\u2014a friend and peer of Milton Erickson\u2014wrote, \"Has NLP really abstracted and explicated the essence of successful therapy and provided everyone with the means to be another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson? ... [NLP's] failure to do this is evident because today there is no multitude of their equals, not even another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson. Ten years should have been sufficient time for this to happen. In this light, I cannot take NLP seriously ... [NLP's] contributions to our understanding and use of Ericksonian techniques are equally dubious. \"Patterns I\" and \"II\" are poorly written works that were an overambitious, pretentious effort to reduce hypnotism to a magic of words.\"\nClinical psychologist Stephen Briers questions the value of the NLP maxim\u2014a \"presupposition\" in NLP jargon\u2014\"there is no failure, only feedback\". Briers argues that the denial of the existence of failure diminishes its instructive value. He offers Walt Disney, Isaac Newton and J.K. Rowling as three examples of unambiguous acknowledged personal failure that served as an impetus to great success. According to Briers, it was \"the crash-and-burn type of failure, not the sanitised NLP Failure Lite, i.e. the failure-that-isn't really-failure sort of failure\" that propelled these individuals to success. Briers contends that adherence to the maxim leads to self-deprecation. According to Briers, personal endeavour is a product of invested values and aspirations and the dismissal of personally significant failure as mere feedback effectively denigrates what one values. Briers writes, \"Sometimes we need to accept and mourn the death of our dreams, not just casually dismiss them as inconsequential.\" Briers also contends that the NLP maxim is narcissistic, self-centered and divorced from notions of moral responsibility.\nOther uses.\nAlthough the original core techniques of NLP were therapeutic in orientation their generic nature enabled them to be applied to other fields. These applications include persuasion, sales, negotiation, management training, sports, teaching, coaching, team building, public speaking, and in the process of hiring employees.\nScientific criticism.\nIn the early 1980s, NLP was advertised as an important advance in psychotherapy and counseling, and attracted some interest in counseling research and clinical psychology. However, as controlled trials failed to show any benefit from NLP and its advocates made increasingly dubious claims, scientific interest in NLP faded.\nNumerous literature reviews and meta-analyses have failed to show evidence for NLP's assumptions or effectiveness as a therapeutic method. While some NLP practitioners have argued that the lack of empirical support is due to insufficient research which tests NLP, the consensus scientific opinion is that NLP is pseudoscience and that attempts to dismiss the research findings based on these arguments \"[constitute]s an admission that NLP does not have an evidence base and that NLP practitioners are seeking a post-hoc credibility.\"\nSurveys in the academic community have shown NLP to be widely discredited among scientists. Among the reasons for considering NLP a pseudoscience are that evidence in favor of it is limited to anecdotes and personal testimony that it is not informed by scientific understanding of neuroscience and linguistics, and that the name \"neuro-linguistic programming\" uses jargon words to impress readers and obfuscate ideas, whereas NLP itself does not relate any phenomena to neural structures and has nothing in common with linguistics or programming. In education, NLP has been used as a key example of pseudoscience.\nAs a quasi-religion.\nSociologists and anthropologists have categorized NLP as a quasi-religion belonging to the New Age and/or Human Potential Movements.\nMedical anthropologist Jean M. Langford categorizes NLP as a form of folk magic; that is to say, a practice with symbolic efficacy\u2014as opposed to physical efficacy\u2014that is able to effect change through nonspecific effects (e.g., placebo). To Langford, NLP is akin to a syncretic folk religion \"that attempts to wed the magic of folk practice to the science of professional medicine\".\nBandler and Grinder were influenced by the shamanism described in the books of Carlos Castaneda. Concepts like \"double induction\" and \"stopping the world\", central to NLP modeling, were incorporated from these influences.\nSome theorists characterize NLP as a type of \"psycho-shamanism\", and its focus on modeling has been compared to ritual practices in certain syncretic religions. The emphasis on lineage from an NLP guru has also been likened to similar concepts in some Eastern religions. Aupers, Houtman, and Bovbjerg identify NLP as a New Age \"psycho-religion\". Bovbjerg argues that New Age movements center on a transcendent \"other\". While monotheistic religions seek communion with a divine being, this focus shifts inward in these movements, with the \"other\" becoming the unconscious self. Bovbjerg posits that this emphasis on the unconscious and its hidden potential underlies NLP techniques promoting self-perfection through ongoing transformation.\nBovbjerg's secular critique echoes the conservative Christian perspective, as exemplified by David Jeremiah. He argues that NLP's emphasis on self-transformation and internal power conflicts with the Christian belief in salvation through divine grace.\nLegal disputes.\nFounding, initial disputes, and settlement (1979\u20131981).\nIn 1979, Richard Bandler and John Grinder established the Society of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to manage commercial applications of NLP, including training, materials, and certification. The founding agreement conferred exclusive rights to profit from NLP training and certification upon Bandler's corporate entity, Not Ltd. Around November 1980, Bandler and Grinder had ceased collaboration for undisclosed reasons.\nOn September 25, 1981, Bandler filed suit against Grinder's corporate entity, Unlimited Ltd., in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Cruz seeking injunctive relief and damages arising from Grinder's NLP-related commercial activities; the Court issued a judgment in Bandler's favor on October 29, 1981. The subsequent settlement agreement granted Grinder a 10-year license to conduct NLP seminars, offer NLP certification, and utilize the NLP name, subject to royalty payments to Bandler.\nFurther litigation and consequences (1996\u20132000).\nBandler commenced further civil actions against Unlimited Ltd., various figures within the NLP community, and 200 initially unnamed defendants in July 1996 and January 1997. Bandler alleged violations of the initial settlement terms by Grinder and sought damages of no less than US$10,000,000.00 from each defendant.\nIn February 2000, the Court ruled against Bandler. The judgment asserted that Bandler had misrepresented his exclusive ownership of NLP intellectual property and sole authority over Society of NLP membership and certification.\nTrademark revocation (1997).\nIn December 1997, a separate civil proceeding initiated by Tony Clarkson resulted in the revocation of Bandler's UK trademark of NLP. The Court ruled in Clarkson's favor.\nResolution and legacy (2000).\nBandler and Grinder reached a settlement in late 2000, acknowledging their status as co-creators and co-founders of NLP and committing to refrain from disparaging one another's NLP-related endeavors.\nDue to these disputes and settlements, the terms \"NLP\" and \"neuro-linguistic programming\" remain in the public domain. No single party holds exclusive rights, and there are no restrictions on offering NLP certifications.\nThe designations \"NLP\" and \"neuro-linguistic programming\" are not owned, trademarked, or subject to centralized regulation. Consequently, there are no restrictions on individuals self-identifying as \"NLP master practitioners\" or \"NLP master trainers\". This decentralization has led to numerous certifying associations.\nDecentralization and criticism.\nThis lack of centralized control means there is no single standard for NLP practice or training. Practitioners can market their own methodologies, leading to inconsistencies within the field. This has been a source of criticism, highlighted by an incident in 2009 where a British television presenter registered his cat with the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming (BBNLP), demonstrating the organization's lax credentialing. Critics like Karen Stollznow find irony in the initial legal battles between Bandler and Grinder, considering their failure to apply their own NLP principles to resolve their conflict. Others, such as Grant Devilly, characterize NLP associations as \"granfalloons\"\u2014a term implying a lack of unifying principles or a shared sense of purpose.\nSee also.\nNotable practitioners\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Deforges was the first woman to own and operate a publishing house in France. Over the years, she has been censored, prosecuted, and heavily fined for publishing \"offensive\" literature, beginning with Louis Aragon: \"Irene's Cunt\".\nOne of her novels, \"La Bicyclette bleue\u200a\" (\"The Blue Bicycle\"), published in 1981, was France's biggest bestseller. In 2000, it was made into a television series. A story of love, obsession, and survival set during the turmoil of World War II, it developed into a successful series of seven books. \"La Bicyclette bleue\" would go on to cause a major international intellectual property court case. In the initial ruling, Deforges was found guilty of plagiarizing Margaret Mitchell's famous novel Gone with the Wind. Deforges freely admitted that the first 70 pages were inspired by Mitchell's novel but the whole book was 1200 pages long. She won her case on appeal, and the ruling ordering her to pay damages was reversed. She was formerly president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres de France and a member of the Prix Femina jury. She lived in Paris.\nDeforges transformed her home town into a \"City of Writing\". It has had museums and bookshops with that theme since 2000. The idea that Montmorillon should be a Book town came from Deforges who was then a local councillor. The town had a history of paper-making and her idea received both local and international support. The old medieval quarter of the town attracted six million euros of funding and now brands itself as a book town.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It incorporates Carl Jung's work on \"Psychological Types\" with Antoni K\u0119pi\u0144ski's theory of information metabolism.\nIn contrast to the generally accepted views in personality psychology on age-related variability of the human psyche, socionics distinguishes 16 psychophysiological types (sociotypes) which it claims go unchanged throughout a person's life. The existence of personality types is extremely controversial in modern personality psychology. \nSocionics was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by the Lithuanian researcher . The name \"socionics\" is derived from the word \"society\", because believed that each sociotype has a distinct purpose in society.\nThe central idea of socionics is that information is intuitively divisible into eight categories, called information elements, which a person's psyche processes using eight psychological functions. Each sociotype has a different correspondence between functions and information elements, which it posits results in different ways of handling information and distinct thinking patterns. One prevalent idea in socionics is the theory of intertype relations, which is based on the interaction of these functions between types.\nIndependent authors point to the insufficient empirical validity of socionics both in its basis and in its further development, as well as the practical absence of studies on socionics outside the former USSR. The Commission on Pseudoscience of the Russian Academy of Sciences has placed socionics among such well-known pseudosciences as astrology and homeopathy.\nPurpose.\nSocionics provides a means of predicting the character of relations and degree of business compatibility, information sharing and psychological compatibility of people before their joining in one collective group, i.e. to solve the \"inverse task\" of sociometry.\nAccording to Aleksandr Bukalov and Betty Lou Leaver, socionics uses Jungian typology, informational model of psyche, and theory of information metabolism for political and sociological analysis.\nAccording to G. Fink and B. Mayrhofer, socionics is considered one of the four most popular models of personality (including cybernetic theory Maruyama, five-factor model, \"Big Five\" and the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator aka MBTI), deserving special attention because of its importance in the study of personality.\nAccording to J. Horwood, and A. Maw, socionics is a science developed by in the 1970s. and her colleagues worked with Carl Jung's personality typologies to develop personality-based relationship profiles. It was found that the nature and development of interpersonal relationships (both professional and personal) are far from random. Instead, they are based on how well suited each individual's psychological profiles are to one another, allowing to develop 16 'socionic types' predicting and describing the interpersonal relationships between any combination of Jung's personality types.\nAccording to R. Blutner and E. Hochnadel, \"socionics is not so much a theory of personalities per se, but much more a theory of type relations providing an analysis of the relationships that arise as a consequence of the interaction of people with different personalities.\"\nPhilosopher L. Monastyrsky treats socionics as pre-science. At the same time, L. Monastyrsky himself proposes to pay attention to \"the concept of socionic type\".\nPhilosopher E. Pletuhina defines socionics as the study about the information interaction of the human psyche with the outside world, between people. She also defines it as the doctrine of psychological types of people and the relationships between them, as well as notes that the particular quality of socionics is that it considers the innate qualities of the human psyche, including the personality type, which cannot be arbitrarily changed without prejudice to the mental and physical health.\nHistory.\nThe basic structure of socionics was established in the 1960s and 1970s by , along with a group of enthusiasts who met in Vilnius, Lithuania. What resulted from their discussions and 's personal investigations was an information model of the psyche and of interpersonal interaction based on Jung's typology but with eight psychic functions rather than four. 's first works on socionics were published between 1978 and 1980.\nSocionics as an academic discipline.\nThrough the work of the International Institute of Socionics and other schools of socionics, there are four scientific peer-reviewed journals (on the practical application of the methods of socionics in management, consulting, psychology, pedagogy, education, psychotherapy, and humanities) and an annual International conference on socionics. The Institute gives \"popularization and proliferation of socionic knowledge\" as one of its goals.\nSvetlana V. Ivanova notes that socionics is taught in more than 150 universities in Russia, Ukraine and other CIS and European Union countries. Some universities in Russia (including Altai State Technical University, Bashkir State University,\nKrasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, \nand Saint Petersburg State University)\nUkraine, Bulgaria, and Romania, have published or commissioned a number of textbooks and monographs on socionics, or on psychology, pedagogy and management, which socionics and its methods are devoted to specific topics.\nAreas of research include educational socionics, sociological socionics, aviation socionics, library socionics, technical socionics, linguistic socionics, penitentiary socionics, and socionics in other subject areas.\nSocionics is used in education, not only as a tool for teachers to manage the learning process, but also as a basis for the development and improvement of education and training. Bogdanova claim that a teacher holding socionic knowledge and technologies can consciously collaborate with others and improve professional efficiency. Targeted use of intertype relations helps intensify the didactic process, increase the motivation of students. Socionics is also used to assess the individual psychological and personal qualities to forecast the success of employee career.\nIzmailova and Kiseleva found socionics interesting to be applied in advertising and marketing, because it allows you to explain the reasons for the behavior of consumers.\nSocionics is a tool for the study of personality and creativity of the writer, the typology of the characters in his works. The method of linguistic-socionic modeling proposed by L. M. Komissarova, used for analysis of individual lexicon of language personality. A translation of socionic characteristics in verbal ones is called the \"method of linguistic-socionic modeling\" and widely used.\nSocionic methods have been proposed for the modeling of information processes in the \"human-machine\" systems, and practically used to model systems \"aircraft operator\" in pilots' training, and other similar areas.\nDue to the variety of applications of socionics, its concepts and information models, in the 1990s, Bukalov proposed to distinguish socionics of personality, or differential socionics, and generalized, more abstract integral socionics. Bukalov believes that the concept of information metabolism, cybernetic modeling and general systems theory extends beyond of psychology and sociology, and consider the relationship of technical information devices, and the types of information human interactions as operator with various technical and electronic management systems of major industries, including chemical, nuclear power stations, complex computer complexes with adaptive tunable to a specific operator interfaces.\nPropagation of socionics.\nInternational Institute of Socionics lists a number of academic publications on socionics in English in peer-reviewed journals. Since 2000 socionics as a scientific discipline and a field of research has been recognized in Russia and Ukraine.\nPedagogical socionics.\nThe concepts and methods of socionics are widely used in pedagogy, this collaboration creates a new scientific branch \u2013 pedagogical socionics.\nPletuhina noted that the parent, trainer or teacher, who knows the theory of socionics, who also understands an idea of the \"image of a socionics type\" and who can determine the child's personality type with a sufficient degree of probability can use those opportunities of the individual approaches that socionics provides to raise and educate a child.\nThe role that socionics takes in the educational process is not limited to being a teacher's tool for the managing process. It is also a base for development and improving the educational system and for preparing staff. Teachers armed with socionics technology can consciously establish relationships with other people and increase efficiency of their pedagogical skills. Rational implementation of intertype relationships can push educational process to become more intensive and increase students' motivation.\nSocionics is also researched practical methods and techniques dedicated to evaluation person's individual psychological values to prognoses professional success. Keneva, Marchenko, and Minaev argue that socionics might become a theoretical base for personal-oriented educational technologies.\nSocionics in astronautics.\nIn Star City conducted number of science seminars based on socionics methods and person typology to training space crews. Forming space crews by socionics methods was a central topic at the International conference on space researches, at the Space Forum 2011 and at the conference \"Piloted flights into Space\".\nAviation socionics.\nAccording to order of the Ministry of transport of Russian Federation Flight Standards Department approved a default application \"Training of pilots in the field of human factor\", which expects basic socionics knowledge not only among pilots and other crew members, but also prognosing interaction in air crews by socionics methods.\nTo improve interaction among crew members, specialists of Saint Petersburg University examined 2330 people by socionics methods, including university students; aircrews of airlines; air traffic controllers; professors from almost all flight academies of Russia; delegates from Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Estonia.\nThis database represents result of 10 years of scientific work. In their research, authors are relying on fundamental works of the Kyiv School of Socionics, International Institute of Socionics, publications in journals \"Socionics, mentology and personal psychology\", \"Management and personnel: management psychology, socionics and sociology\".\nAccording to the experimental results were obtained socionics and sociometric data of air traffic controllers and correlation analyses of its parameters, also was determined the connection's intensity between person's interaction levels. The practical values of this research is to develop automated module to determine individual characteristic of operators and to evaluate the effectiveness of socionics in the management of air traffic, particular in special cases of flight\nJung's psychological types.\nCarl Jung describes four \"psychological functions\" that are capable of becoming applicable psychically, but to differing degrees in individuals:\nIn addition to these four types, Jung defines a polarity between introverted and extraverted personalities. This distinction is based on how people invest energy: either into the inner, subjective, psychical world (usually called , soul, by Jung), or toward their outer, objective, physical world (including one's body).\nBy Jung's rules, 16 psychological types exist. But in his book \"Psychological Types\" he described in detail only 8, distinguished by the 8 possible dominant functions. Contrary to Socionics and MBTI, Jung did not conclude that the types had two introverted functions and two extroverted functions. He instead outlined that extroverted personality types had a Dominant extroverted function, with the remaining functions being of varying if lower levels of development that range from being Inferior introverted functions that are necessarily retarded to auxiliary functions that lie in the middle.\nInformation metabolism elements (often confused with memetics).\nIn socionics, Jung's cognitive functions are always either introverted (focused on refining quality) or extroverted (focused on increasing quantity), and are referred to as \"information metabolism elements\" (IM Elements). These are said to process \"information aspects\". To understand what an information aspect is, it is necessary to understand information metabolism as Augustinavi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 understood it.\n states that the human mind uses eight elements of information metabolism (mental functions) to perceive the world, and each of these eight elements reflect one particular aspect of objective reality. In her works she describes aspects of the world based on physical quantities such as potential and kinetic energy, space, time, and their properties.\nOften, other socionists have equated these information elements with their definition and according to fundamental physical concepts as well (Matter-Time-Energy-Space).). Matter is compared to Thinking, Energy to Feeling, Space to Sensing, and Time to Intuition. Given the division of aspects of the absolute between Extroverted (\"black\") and Introverted (\"white\"), being four times two, their number is eight.\nThe 8 socionics symbols ( ) were introduced by while working with Jung's typology and remain the dominant method of denoting the functions and the corresponding information aspects that they process. Text-based notation systems are also used, such as Victor Gulenko's 8 Latin letters ('P' for Pragmatism, 'E' for Emotions, 'F' for Force, 'I' for Ideas, 'L' for Laws, 'R' for Relation, 'S' for Senses, and 'T' for Time, respectively), or Myers-Briggs notation (Te, Fe, Se, Ne, Ti, Fi, Si, and Ni, respectively).\nThe 16 types.\n usually used names like \"sensory-logical introvert\" (SLI) to refer to the types. In SLI the leading function is introverted sensation and the creative function is extraverted logic. She also introduced the practice of referring to types by the name of a famous person of the type (although types of these persons are not universally agreed upon, with the old name \"Napoleon\" for the SEE being replaced by \"Caesar\" after being deemed an inaccurate type assignment). For example, she called the SLI \"Gabin\" and the SEI \"Dumas\". Also sometimes names such as \"Craftsman\" or \"Mediator\" are used to express the social role of the type\u2014a convention introduced by socionist Viktor Gulenko in 1995. Given the formal similarities present between Socionics and the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) abbreviations frequently used in English, some prefer to distinguish socionic type names from Myers\u2013Briggs' names by writing the last letter (J or P) in lower case (for example, ENTp, ESFj)\u2014a practice introduced by Sergei Ganin. This is because the relationship between socionics and Myers\u2013Briggs and Keirseyan types is controversial.\nDmitri Lytov and Marianna Lytova state that \"main spheres of application of socionics are almost the same as for the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Theory\", and that observed differences in correlation \"represent characteristic stereotypes of the socionics and the Keirsey typology. Others state that MBTI and socionics \"correlate in roughly 30% of cases,\" and that \"there are many subtle differences\". J and P in Socionics and Myers\u2013Briggs are completely different: in Myers\u2013Briggs, J and P stands for the \"first extraverted function\" (J\u2014extraverted thinking or feeling, P\u2014extraverted sensing or intuition); in Socionics, J and P stands for the first function\" (J\u2014rational (thinking and feeling), P\u2014irrational (sensing and intuition)). This formal\"' conversion is carried out in accordance with the '.\nIn dividing the socion according to the four Jungian dichotomies, from this is formed 16 socionic types. The following tables provide a list of types with the names most commonly used in socionics:\nThe second concept is the functional dimensions. It was introduced by Aleksandr Bukalov. He defined the first dimension as the personal experience (Ex), the second dimension as social norms (Nr), the third dimension as the current situation (St), and the fourth dimension as the globality, or time perspective (Tm). This concept is useful because it best illustrates the difference in cognitive power (imagine measuring capability of 2D v. 3D measuring tool) and roughly describes abilities of each function to process and generate information. Still, definitions of dimensions require further research and clarification. For example, the vulnerable function tends to lose knowledge which have not been used.\nCriticism.\nPsychophysiologist Sergey Bogomaz says there is no reason for considering socionics as a separate science. He considers socionic typology to be a Russian version of post-Jung typology, similar to the Myers-Briggs typology, but distinguished by a greater number of typological features and the formulation of prerequisites for the study of intertype relationships. Bogomaz considers the construction of the theory of intertype relationships to be an undoubted contribution of to the development of Jung typology, but criticized it by stating that there is little experimental data in socionics, there is no empirical verification of many claims, and by having many unsystematic pseudoscientific publications.\nPhilosopher L. M. Monastirsky identified the use of speculative categories as the first shortcoming of socionics. Secondly, he stated that it lacks clearly defined typing method and each socionics school defines methods of their own. At the same time Monastirsky, recognizing the potential of socionics, proposed to turn to the concept of a socionic type for carrying out some research in the field of the methodology of science.\nAn important issue in the field of socionics is the problem of convergence between type diagnoses of different analysts. Vladimir Ermak showed that ignorance of model A of the type of information metabolism leads to numerous mistakes in the definition of a socionic type.

The state of Hawaii gave a statue of him to the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C., as one of two statues it is entitled to install there.\nBirth and childhood.\nPaternity and family history.\nKamehameha (known as Pai\u02bbea at birth), was born to Keku\u02bbiapoiwa II, the niece of Alapainui, the usurping ruler of Hawaii Island who had killed the two legitimate heirs of Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku during civil war. By most accounts he was born in Ainakea, Kohala, Hawaii. His father was Ke\u014dua Kalanikupuapa'ikalaninui; however, Native Hawaiian historian Samuel Kamakau says that Maui monarch Kahekili II had \"h\u0101nai\" adopted (traditional, informal adoption) Kamehameha at birth, as was the custom of the time. Kamakau believes this is why Kahekili II is often referred to as Kamehameha's father and his baby hawk. The author also says that Kame\u02bbeiamoku told Kamehameha I that he was the son of Kahekili II, saying, \"I have something to tell you: Ka-hekili was your father, you were not Keoua's son. Here are the tokens that you are the son of Ka-hekili.\"\nKing Kal\u0101kaua wrote that these rumors were scandals and should be dismissed as the offspring of hatred and jealousies of later years. Regardless of the rumors, Kamehameha was a descendant of Keawe through his mother Keku\u02bbiapoiwa II; Ke\u014dua acknowledged him as his son and he is recognized as such by all the sovereigns and most genealogists.\nAccounts of Kamehameha I's birth vary, but sources place his birth between 1736 and 1761, with historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall believing it to be between 1748 and 1761. An early source is thought to imply a 1758 dating because that date matched a visit from Halley's Comet, and would make him close to the age that Francisco de Paula Mar\u00edn estimated he was. This dating, however, does not accord with the details of many well-known accounts of his life, such as his fighting as a warrior with his uncle, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu, or his being of age to father his first children by that time. The 1758 dating also places his birth after the death of his father.\nKamakau published an account in the \"Ka Nupepa Kuokoa\" in 1867 placing the date of Kamehameha's birth around 1736. He wrote, \"It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-ali\u02bbi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born\". However, his general dating has been challenged as twenty years too early, related to disputes over Kamakau's inaccuracy of dating compared to accounts of foreign visitors. Regardless, Abraham Fornander wrote in his book, \"An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations\": \"when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter\". \"A Brief History of the Hawaiian People\" by William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the \"Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History\" as 1736. In 1888 the Kamakau account was challenged by Samuel C. Damon in the missionary publication; \"The Friend\", deferring to a 1753 dating that was the first mentioned by James Jackson Jarves. But the Kamakau dating was widely accepted due to support from Abraham Fornander.\nConcealment and childhood.\nAt the time of Kamehameha's birth, his father, Ke\u014dua, along with his half-brother, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu, were serving Alapa\u02bbinui, ruler of the island of Hawai\u02bbi; Alapa\u02bbinui had brought the brothers to his court, after defeating both of their fathers in the civil war that followed the death of Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku. Ke\u014dua had died while Kamehameha was very young, thus the boy was raised in the court of his uncle, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu. The traditional chant of Keakamahana (chiefess and wife of Alapainui) mentions that Kamehameha was born in the month of (autumn/winter), or around November; Alapai gave the young Kamehameha to Keaka and her sister, H\u0101kau, to raise, once the ruler discovered the infant had indeed survived.\nOn February 10, 1911, the Kamakau version was challenged by the oral history of the Kaha family, as published in newspaper articles also appearing in the \"Kuoko\". After Kamakau's history was published again (this time to a wider, English-reading public in 1911 Hawaii), the Kaha version of these events was published by Kamaka Stillman, who had objected to the Nupepa article.\nConquest of the islands.\nHawaii Island.\nKamehameha was raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu. He achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's death. While the kingship was inherited by K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's son, Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position as guardian of the Hawaiian god of war, K\u016bka\u02bbilimoku. He was also given control of the district of Waipi\u02bbo Valley. The two cousins' relationship was strained after Kamehameha made a dedication to the gods instead of allowing K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d to do that. Kamehameha accepted the allegiance of a group of chiefs from the Kona district.\nThe other story took place after the prophecy was passed along by the high priests and high chiefs. When Kamehameha was able to lift the Naha Stone, he was considered the fulfiller of the prophecy. Other ruling chiefs, Keawe Mauhili, the Mahoe (twins) Keoua, and other chiefs rejected the prophecy of Ka Poukahi. The high chiefs of Kauai supported Kiwala\u02bbo even after learning about the prophecy.\nThe five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were Ke\u02bbeaumoku P\u0101pa\u02bbiahiahi (Kamehameha's father-in-law/grand uncle), Keaweaheulu Kalua\u02bb\u0101pana (Kamehameha's uncle), Kek\u016bhaupi\u02bbo (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), and Kame\u02bbeiamoku and Kamanawa (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the unifier Ka Na\u02bbi aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for ali\u02bbi nui. Both chose the younger nephews K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d and Kamehameha over themselves. K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d was soon defeated in the first key conflict, the Battle of Moku\u02bb\u014dhai. Kamehameha and his chiefs took over Konohiki responsibilities and sacred obligations of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and H\u0101m\u0101kua on Hawai\u02bbi.\nThe prophecy included far more than the island of Hawai\u02bbi. It went across and beyond the Pacific Islands to the semi-continent of Aotearoa (New Zealand). He was supported by his most political wife Ka\u02bbahumanu and father, High Chief Keeaumoku. Senior counselor to Kamehameha, she became one of Hawai\u02bbi's most powerful figures. Kamehameha and his council of chiefs planned to unite the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Allies came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Another major factor in Kamehameha's continued success was the support of Kauai chief Ka\u02bbiana and Captain William Brown of the \"Butterworth\" Squadron. He guaranteed Kamehameha unlimited gunpowder from Qing China and gave him the formula for gunpowder: sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal, all of which are abundant in the islands. Two westerners who lived on Hawai\u02bbi island, Isaac Davis and John Young, married native Hawaiian women and assisted Kamehameha.\nOlowalu Massacre.\nIn 1789, Simon Metcalfe had been captaining a fur-trading vessel, the \"Eleanora\", while his son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, captained the ship along the Pacific Northwest Coast; the two parties were to rendezvous in the Hawaiian Islands. \"Fair American\" was held up when it was captured by the Spanish at Nootka Sound and taken to San Blas, Nayarit, where it was soon released.\nThe \"Eleanora\" finally arrived in 1790, where it was greeted by Chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku. During their interactions, the chief allegedly offended or insulted Captain Metcalfe, who then struck the chief with the end of a rope. Sometime later, while docked in Honolua, Maui, a small boat\u2014which was tied to the larger ship, and had a crewman inside\u2014was stolen by native islanders. When Metcalfe discovered where the boat was taken, he sailed directly to the village of Olowalu. There, he confirmed that the boat had been broken apart and the shipmate murdered. Previously, Metcalfe had resorted to violence when he fired muskets into another village near where he had been anchored, ultimately killing some of the residents. This time, furious, Metcalfe took aim at Olowalu, ordering all cannons aboard the ship to be moved to one side, facing the island. As the captain initiated his trading calls and greetings to the locals, hundreds of people\u2014men, women, children and elderly\u2014ventured down to the beach to trade, on foot and by canoe. When the islanders were within range, Metcalfe ordered broadsides to be fired on the Hawaiians, killing over 100 of them.\nSix weeks later, \"Fair American\" was stuck near the Kona coast of Hawaii, where Chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku was living, near Ka\u02bb\u016bp\u016blehu. Kame\u02bbeiamoku had decided to attack the next foreign ship to avenge the strike by the elder Metcalfe. He canoed out to the ship with his men, where he killed Metcalfe's son and all but one (Isaac Davis) of the five crewmen. Kamehameha took Davis into protection and took possession of the ship. \"Eleanora\" was at that time anchored at Kealakekua Bay, where the ship's boatswain had gone ashore and been captured by Kamehameha's forces because Kamehameha believed Metcalfe was planning more revenge. \"Eleanora\" waited several days before sailing off, apparently without knowledge of what had happened to \"Fair American\" or Metcalfe's son. Davis and \"Eleanora's\" boatswain, John Young, tried to escape, but were treated as chiefs, given wives and settled in Hawaii.\nInvasion of Maui.\nIn 1790, while the ali\u02bbi Kahekili II was on O\u02bbahu, Kamehameha's army invaded Maui with the assistance of John Young and Isaac Davis. Using cannons from the \"Fair American\", they defeated Maui's army led by Kahekili's son Kalanik\u016bpule at the bloody Battle of Kepaniwai .\nIn 1791, Kahekili, supported by his brother K\u0101\u02bbeok\u016blani, ali\u02bbi of Kaua\u02bbi, reconquered Maui and also acquired cannons. In April or May 1791, Kahekili tried to invade the island of Hawai\u02bbi, but was defeated in a naval battle called Kepuwaha\u02bbula\u02bbula near Waipi\u02bbo.\nDeath of Ke\u014dua Kuahuula.\nIn 1790, Ke\u014dua K\u016b\u02bbahu\u02bbula, who came to rule the districts of Ka\u02bb\u016b and Puna, took advantage of Kamehameha's absence in Maui and began raiding the west coast of Hawaii. He also advanced against the district of Hilo, deposing his uncle Keawema\u02bbuhili. When Kamehameha returned, Ke\u014dua escaped to the K\u012blauea volcano, which erupted. Many warriors died from the poisonous gas emitted from the volcano.\nWhen the Pu\u02bbukohol\u0101 Heiau was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Ke\u014dua to meet with him. Ke\u014dua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to render himself an inappropriate sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha's chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts, he dodged it but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Ke\u014dua's bodyguards were killed. With Ke\u014dua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawai\u02bbi island.\nMaui and O\u02bbahu.\nIn 1794, the aged Kahekili II died. He left the governance of O\u02bbahu to his son Kalanik\u016bpule and of Maui and Moloka\u02bbi to K\u0101\u02bbeok\u016blani. A civil war between the two broke out, which ended when Kalanik\u016bpule killed K\u0101\u02bbeok\u016blani, taking control of Maui and Moloka\u02bbi. This initiated a succession crisis on Kaua\u02bbi, which had previously been ruled by K\u0101\u02bbeok\u016blani.\nSeeing an opportunity, in 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of Maui and Moloka\u02bbi at the Battle of Kawela. He moved on to the island of O\u02bbahu, landing his troops at Wai\u02bbalae and Waik\u012bk\u012b. Kamehameha did not know that one of his commanders, a high-ranking \"ali\u02bbi\" named Ka\u02bbiana, had defected to Kalanik\u016bpule. Ka\u02bbiana assisted in cutting notches into the Nu\u02bbuanu Pali mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a castle turret, were to serve as gunports for Kalanik\u016bpule's cannon. In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha's forces pushed Kalanik\u016bpule's men back until they were cornered on the Pali Lookout. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. He assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanik\u016bpule's gunners and took control. With the loss of their guns, Kalanik\u016bpule's troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha's still-organized troops. A fierce battle at Nu\u02bbuanu ensued, with Kamehameha's forces forming an enclosing wall. Using traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they killed most of Kalanik\u016bpule's forces. Over 700 men were forced over the Pali's cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Ka\u02bbiana was killed during the action; Kalanik\u016bpule was later captured and sacrificed to K\u016bk\u0101\u02bbilimoku.\nKaua\u02bbi and rebellion of N\u0101makeh\u0101.\nAfter his conquest of Oahu in the summer of 1795, Kamehameha I prepared his forces for the conquest of Kaua\u02bbi, the last remaining island kingdom out of his control. In the spring of 1796, he attempted to continue with his forces to Kaua\u02bbi but he lost many of his canoes in the strong winds and rough seas of the Ka\u02bbie\u02bbie Waho channel. He returned to Hawaii to pacify the rebellion of N\u0101makeh\u0101 (brother of Ka\u02bbiana) in Hilo and ruled from Hawaii for the next six years as he consolidated his conquests and prepared for a second invasion of Kaua\u02bbi. At Hilo, Kamehameha I commissioned the building of a large fleet of 800 (according to Kamakau) double-hulled war canoes called \"peleleu\" along with Western schooners, and he also stockpiled large number of guns, canons and ammunition. He took his \"peleleu\" to Maui where he stayed from 1802 to 1803 and then to O\u02bbahu in late 1803 or early 1804. While in O\u02bbahu, a large percentage of his force was killed by the \"ma\u02bbi \u02bboku\u02bbu\" epidemic, which was thought to be either cholera or bubonic plague. Kamehameha I contracted the illness but survived. The second invasion of Kaua\u02bbi was postponed.\nBy now, the succession crisis on Kaua\u02bbi had resolved, with K\u0101\u02bbeok\u016blani's son, Kaumuali\u02bbi, emerging as the new king. In April 1810, Kamehameha I negotiated the peaceful unification of the islands with Kaumuali\u02bbi. His court genealogist and high priest Kalaiku\u02bbahulu was instrumental in the monarch's decision to leave Kaumuali\u02bbi as a tributary king rather than killing him, when he was the single member of the ali\u02bbi council to agree with Kamehameha's own reluctance to do so. The other ali\u02bbi continued with the plan to poison Kaumuali\u02bbi when Isaac Davis warned him, making the ruler cut his trip short and return to Kaua\u02bbi, leaving Davis to be poisoned by the ali\u02bbi instead.\nAli\u02bbi Mo\u02bbi of the Hawaiian Islands.\nAs ruler, Kamehameha took steps to ensure the islands remained a united realm after his death. He unified the legal system. He used the products collected in taxes to promote trade with Europe and the United States.\nThe origins of the \"Law of the Splintered Paddle\" are derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawai\u02bbi. In 1782 during a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fishermen were brought before Kamehameha for punishment. The king instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fishermen gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, \"Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety\".\nYoung and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god K\u016bk\u0101\u02bbilimoku. The explorer George Vancouver noted that Kamehameha worshiped his gods and wooden images in a , but originally wanted to bring England's religion, Christianity, to Hawai\u02bbi. Missionaries were not sent from Great Britain because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with , and that through these gods, Kamehameha had become supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing Kamehameha's devotion, Vancouver decided against sending missionaries from England. Kamehameha I believed that Christianity may bring or heavenly power to revitalise the Hawaiian community. The first American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions company arrived in Hawaii on March 30, 1820, on the \"Thaddeus\" from Boston.\nLater life.\nAfter about 1812, Kamehameha returned from Oahu and spent the last years of his life at Kamakahonu, a compound he built in Kailua-Kona. As was the custom of the time, he had several wives and many children, though he outlived many of them.\nFinal resting place.\nWhen Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819, his body was hidden by his trusted friends, Hoapili and Ho\u02bbolulu, in the ancient custom called \"h\u016bn\u0101kele\" (literally, \"to hide in secret\"). The \"mana\", or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried in a hidden location because of his \"mana\". His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign, Kamehameha III asked that Hoapili show him where his father's bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.\nFamily.\nKamehameha had many wives. The exact number is debated because documents that recorded the names of his wives were destroyed. Hiram Bingham I lists 21 wives, but earlier research from Mary Kawena Pukui counted 26. In \"Kamehameha's Children Today\" authors Charles Ahlo, Rubellite Kawena Johnson and Jerry Walker list 30 wives: 18 who had children, and 12 who did not. They state the total number of children to be 35: 17 sons and 18 daughters. While he had many wives and children, only his children through his highest-ranking wife, Ke\u014dp\u016bolani, succeeded him to the throne. In \"Ho\u02bbomana: Understanding the Sacred and Spiritual\", Chun stated that Ke\u014dp\u016bolani supported Ka\u02bbahumanu's ending of the Kapu system as the best way to ensure that Kamehameha's children and grandchildren would rule the kingdom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is made of salted strained yogurt or diluted yogurt mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, red wine vinegar, sometimes with lemon juice, and herbs such as dill, mint, parsley and thyme. It is served as a cold appetiser (meze), a side dish, and as a sauce for souvlaki and gyros sandwiches and other foods.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"tzatziki\" appeared in English around the mid-20th century as a loanword from Modern Greek (), which in turn comes from the Turkish word . The root is likely related to several words in West Asian languages. Persian \"\" () refers to various herbs used for cooking, and Kurdish jaj or \u0698\u0627\u0698 refers to the caraway herb. That word is combined with the Turkish diminutive suffix \"-c\u0131k\" to yield \"cac\u0131k\". It may be related to an Armenian word, \"cac\u0131g\". According to Sevan Ni\u015fanyan the Armenian word may itself come from Turkish or Kurdish.\nEvliya \u00c7elebi's 1665 travelogue, the \"Seyahatn\u00e2me\", defined \"cac\u0131\u03c7\" (\"cac\u0131g\") as a kind of herb that is added to food. The modern term \"cac\u0131k\" (\u062c\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u0643) was mentioned in print for the first time in 1844 in Hoca K\u00e2mil Pasha's \"Melce\u00fc't-Tabb\u00e2h\u00een\" (\"The Sanctuary of Cooks\"), the first Ottoman cookbook, in which the basic description is given as \"yogurt with cucumber and garlic\" (\"h\u0131yar ve sarm\u0131sakl\u0131 yo\u011furt\").\nThe form \"tarator\", found in languages from the Balkans to the Levant with derivative forms now found in a range of countries.\nAccording to Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the name tarator (sauce) comes into Turkish directly from the Venetian word \"trattor\". In Venetian, this word means \"cook\". It has acquired the meaning of a type of sauce in Turkish. It has likely been borrowed from Turkish into other languages. The first use of this word in the sense of sauce was in the book Seyehatname by the Turkish traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi.\nHistory.\nTzatziki and similar yogurt-based dishes trace their origins to the Central Asian yogurt culture, which spread to Anatolia, the Balkans, and the Middle East through Turkic migrations. Turks had consumed yogurt since ancient times and introduced yogurt-based cold soups and sauces to Anatolia. \nDuring the Ottoman Empire, yogurt and garlic condiments became a part of the meze tradition. One notable example was \"tarator\", prepared with yogurt, cucumber, garlic, or sometimes walnuts. The 17th-century Ottoman traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi, in his \"Seyahatname\", described dishes made with yogurt and garlic, demonstrating their established place in Ottoman cuisine. \nIn the Balkans and the Levant, variations of \"tarator\" developed with different bases: in the Levant it is usually made with tahini, while in the Balkans it may include yogurt and walnuts. In Anatolia, however, the version made with yogurt, cucumber, garlic, and sometimes walnuts became known as cac\u0131k. \nToday, cac\u0131k is widely consumed in Turkey as a refreshing dish, especially in summer, while related versions continue to exist in Balkan and Levantine cuisines.\nVariations.\nGreece.\nGreek-style tzatziki sauce is commonly served as a meze, to be eaten with pita bread, olives, fried eggplant, zucchini, or other vegetables. It is also used for dishes like gyros, or souvlaki and most other greek dishes.\nRegular tzatziki is made of strained yogurt (usually from sheep or goat milk) mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, vinegar, dill, mint, and parsley.\nA variation made with purslane ( in Greek) may be called , meaning 'purslane and yogurt salad', rather than tzatziki. One simple recipe calls for purslane, olive oil, red wine vinegar and dill. There also is a version where walnut oil, crushed nuts (like walnuts, hazelnuts, or almonds) and red peppers are added to the standard yoghurt base.\nTurkey.\nTurkish \"cac\u0131k\" is made by combining water and yogurt together with garlic and different combinations of vegetables and herbs. Labne may be substituted for some of the yogurt.\nTurkish cacik also has many variations; different recipes use wheat berries, carrots, scallions, mint, radish, red pepper, parsley, dill, basil, chondrilla juncea, vinegar, walnuts, hazelnuts and unripe almonds.\nFor \"cac\u0131kl\u0131 arap k\u00f6ftesi\", kofta made from a mix of bulgur and ground meat is served over \"cac\u0131k\". In this case the \"cac\u0131k\" is made with chard rather than the usual cucumber (spinach or parsley may be substituted for the chard. Some recipes use purslane). \"Bulgurlu mad\u0131mak cac\u0131\u011f\u0131\" is made with cracked wheat, cucumber and a type of knotweed called \"mad\u0131mak\".\nBalkans.\n\"Tarator\" is found in many Balkan countries. It is often prepared as a cold soup, popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add bread. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with lettuce or carrots.\nA thicker variation is sometimes known as \"dry \"tarator\", or as \"Snezhanka\" salad, which means 'Snow White salad', and is served as an appetiser or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water. The cucumbers, garlic, minced walnuts, salt and vegetable oil are then added.\nIn Bulgaria, \"tarator\" is a popular meze (appetiser), but is also served as a side dish along with Shopska salad with some meals. Sunflower oil and olive oil are more commonly used, and the walnuts are sometimes omitted. \"Tarator\" is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It is a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\nIn Albania, \"tarator\" is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yogurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with \"tarator\". Other similar Albanian variants are \"Salc\u00eb Kosi\" and \"Xaxiq\".\nCyprus.\nIn Cyprus, the dish is known as (\"talattouri\"\") and is similar to the Greek recipe with a more characteristic flavour of mint and added acidity in the form of lemon juice.\nIt is made from strained yogurt, sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves, lemon juice and sprinkled with dried mint, oregano or olive oil.\nMiddle East.\nIn Iraq, \"jajeek\" is often served as meze. It may accompany alcoholic drinks, especially arak, an ouzo-like drink made from anise. In Iran, it is known as \"mast o khiar\".\nIn some parts of the Arab world, it is known as , \"sala\u1e6dat \u1e35iy\u0101r bi-l-laban\", made from yogurt and cucumbers.\nSimilar dishes.\nA similar dish in the Caucasus mountains, called \"ovdukh\", uses kefir instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and ham to create a variation of \"okroshka\", sometimes referred to as a \"Caucasus \"okroshka\"\".\n\"Mizeria\" is a Polish dish of sliced cucumbers mixed with sour cream or another fermented milk product, often herbs (such as dill or chives) and seasonings, which is commonly served as a savoury or sweet side salad with typical dinner dishes.\nIn South Asia, a similar dish is made with yogurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called \"raita\".\nIn Iran, ash-e doogh is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as basil, leek, mint, black pepper and raisins.

Erythrocytes take up oxygen in the lungs, or in fish the gills, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.\nThe cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin (Hb), an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270\u00a0million hemoglobin molecules. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.\nIn humans, mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus (which is expelled during development) and organelles, to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4\u00a0million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults. The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100\u2013120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages. Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute). Approximately 84% of the cells in the human body are the 20\u201330\u00a0trillion red blood cells. Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.\nPacked red blood cells are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion.\nStructure.\nVertebrates.\n The vast majority of vertebrates, including mammals and humans, have red blood cells. These erythrocytes are cells present in blood to transport oxygen. The only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood. While they no longer use hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome.\nVertebrate red blood cells consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the erythrocyte's cell membrane. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues; most waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) dissolved in the blood plasma. Myoglobin, a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store oxygen in muscle cells.\nThe color of red blood cells is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.\nHaving oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of red blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species; red blood cell width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood cells to tissues.\nMammals.\nThe red blood cells of mammals are typically shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This shape allows for a high surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio to facilitate diffusion of gases. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian red blood cells are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.\nRed blood cells in mammals are unique amongst vertebrates as most species do not have nuclei when mature. They do have nuclei during early phases of erythropoiesis, but extrude them during development as they mature; this provides more space for hemoglobin. The red blood cells without nuclei, called reticulocytes, subsequently lose all other cellular organelles such as their mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.\nThe spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells, which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.\nHuman.\nA typical human red blood cell has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2\u20138.2 \u03bcm and a maximum thickness of 2\u20132.5\u00a0\u03bcm and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm, being much smaller than most other human cells. These cells have an average volume of about 90 fL with a surface area of about 136 \u03bcm2, and can swell up to a sphere shape containing 150 fL, without membrane distension.\nAdult humans have roughly 20\u201330\u00a0trillion red blood cells at any given time, constituting approximately 70% of all cells by number. Women have about 4\u20135\u00a0million red blood cells per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5\u20136\u00a0million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more. Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000\u201311,000 white blood cells and about 150,000\u2013400,000 platelets per microliter.\nHuman red blood cells take on average 60 seconds to complete one cycle of circulation.\nThe blood's red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin. Each hemoglobin molecule carries four heme groups; hemoglobin constitutes about a third of the total cell volume. Hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen in the body (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.\nMicrostructure.\nNucleus.\nRed blood cells in mammals are \"anucleate\" when mature, meaning that they lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the red blood cells of other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of the family \"Plethodontidae\", where five different clades has evolved various degrees of enucleated red blood cells (most evolved in some species of the genus \"Batrachoseps\"), and fish of the genus \"Maurolicus\".\nThe elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome. The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.\nNucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms: normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic precursors to mature red blood cells, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors that occur in megaloblastic anemias.\nMembrane composition.\nRed blood cells are deformable, flexible, are able to adhere to other cells, and are able to interface with immune cells. Their membrane plays many roles in this. These functions are highly dependent on the membrane composition. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the glycocalyx on the exterior, which is rich in carbohydrates; the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins, besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian red blood cells are proteins. The other half are lipids, namely phospholipids and cholesterol.\nMembrane lipids.\nThe red blood cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer, similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight. The lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer.\nUnlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:\nOuter monolayer\nInner monolayer\nThis asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called \"Flippases\" move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called \"floppases\" do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy-dependent manner. Additionally, there are also \"scramblase\" proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy-independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.\nThe maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons:\nThe presence of specialized structures named \"lipid rafts\" in the red blood cell membrane have been described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with specific membrane proteins, namely flotillins, STOMatins (band 7), G-proteins, and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate \u03b22-adregenic receptor signaling and increase cAMP levels, and thus regulating entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells.\nMembrane proteins.\nThe proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the red blood cell (7\u20138 \u03bcm) and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber.\nThere are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as other currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\nThe red blood cell membrane proteins organized according to their function:\nTransport\nCell adhesion\nStructural role \u2013 The following membrane proteins establish linkages with skeletal proteins and may play an important role in regulating cohesion between the lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, likely enabling the red cell to maintain its favorable membrane surface area by preventing the membrane from collapsing (vesiculating).\nSurface electrostatic potential.\nThe zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the red blood cell is \u221215.7\u00a0millivolts (mV). Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed sialic acid residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of \u22126.06\u00a0mV.\nFunction.\nRole in CO2 transport.\nRecall that respiration, as illustrated schematically here with a unit of carbohydrate, produces about as many molecules of carbon dioxide, CO2, as it consumes of oxygen, O2.\n&lt;chem&gt;HCOH + O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;\nThus, the function of the circulatory system is as much about the transport of carbon dioxide as about the transport of oxygen.\nAs stated elsewhere in this article, most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is in the form of bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate provides a critical pH buffer. Thus, unlike hemoglobin for O2 transport, there is a physiological advantage to not having a specific CO2 transporter molecule.\nRed blood cells, nevertheless, play a key role in the CO2 transport process, for two reasons.\nFirst, because, besides hemoglobin, they contain a large number of copies of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase on the inside of their cell membrane. Carbonic anhydrase, as its name suggests, acts as a catalyst of the exchange between carbonic acid and carbon dioxide (which is the anhydride of carbonic acid). Because it is a catalyst, it can affect many CO2 molecules, so it performs its essential role without needing as many copies as are needed for O2 transport by hemoglobin.\nIn the presence of this catalyst carbon dioxide and carbonic acid reach an equilibrium very rapidly, while the red cells are still moving through the capillary. Thus it is the RBC that ensures that most of the CO2 is transported as bicarbonate.\nAt physiological pH the equilibrium strongly favors carbonic acid, which is mostly dissociated into bicarbonate ion.\n&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2O &lt;=\u00bb H2CO3 &lt;=\u00bb HCO3- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;\nThe H+ ions released by this rapid reaction within RBC, while still in the capillary, act to reduce the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin, the Bohr effect.\nThe second major contribution of RBC to carbon dioxide transport is that carbon dioxide directly reacts with globin protein components of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin compounds.\nAs oxygen is released in the tissues, more CO2 binds to hemoglobin, and as oxygen binds in the lung, it displaces the hemoglobin bound CO2, this is called the Haldane effect. Despite the fact that only a small amount of the CO2 in blood is bound to hemoglobin in venous blood, a greater proportion of the change in CO2 content between venous and arterial blood comes from the change in this bound CO2. That is, there is always an abundance of bicarbonate in blood, both venous and arterial, because of its aforementioned role as a pH buffer.\nIn summary, carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses very rapidly to areas of lower concentration, specifically into nearby capillaries.\nWhen it diffuses into a RBC, CO2 is rapidly converted by the carbonic anhydrase found on the inside of the RBC membrane into bicarbonate ion. The bicarbonate ions in turn leave the RBC in exchange for chloride ions from the plasma, facilitated by the band 3 anion transport protein colocated in the RBC membrane. The bicarbonate ion does not diffuse back out of the capillary, but is carried to the lung. In the lung the lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli causes carbon dioxide to diffuse rapidly from the capillary into the alveoli. The carbonic anhydrase in the red cells keeps the bicarbonate ion in equilibrium with carbon dioxide. So as carbon dioxide leaves the capillary, and CO2 is displaced by O2 on hemoglobin, sufficient bicarbonate ion converts rapidly to carbon dioxide to maintain the equilibrium.\nSecondary functions.\nWhen red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow.\nWhen their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, red blood cells release S-Nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels, thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.\nRed blood cells can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically, using L-arginine as substrate, as do endothelial cells. Exposure of red blood cells to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide synthase and export of nitric oxide, which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.\nRed blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to red blood cells converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide.\nRed blood cells also play a part in the body's immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing it.\nCellular processes.\nAs a result of not containing mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate. Furthermore, the pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in red blood cells; see glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency for more information.\nAs red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells.\nBecause of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA (although it does contain RNAs), and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities. The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells. However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus B19) can affect erythroid precursors while they still have DNA, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia.\nLife cycle.\nHuman red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed stem cells to mature red blood cells in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term infant). At the end of their lifespan, they are removed from circulation. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the red blood cells is reduced.\nCreation.\nErythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these constitute about 1% of circulating red blood cells.\nFunctional lifetime.\nThe functional lifetime of a red blood cell is about 100\u2013120 days, during which time the red blood cells are continually moved by the blood flow push (in arteries), pull (in veins) and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries. They are also recycled in the bone marrow.\nSenescence.\nThe aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, red blood cell programmed death. This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and energy depletion, as well as by a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.\nMuch of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin. The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin. Almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney.\nClinical significance.\nDisease.\nBlood diseases involving the red blood cells include:\n* Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia; it occurs when the dietary intake or absorption of iron is insufficient, and hemoglobin, which contains iron, cannot be formed.\n* Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease wherein the body lacks intrinsic factor, required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12 is needed for the production of red blood cells and hemoglobin.\n* Sickle-cell disease is a genetic disease that results in abnormal hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and viscoelastic, meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.\n* Thalassemia is a genetic disease that results in the production of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits.\n*Hereditary spherocytosis syndromes are a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in the red blood cell's cell membrane, causing the cells to be small, sphere-shaped, and fragile instead of donut-shaped and flexible. These abnormal red blood cells are destroyed by the spleen. Several other hereditary disorders of the red blood cell membrane are known.\n* Aplastic anemia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells.\n* Pure red cell aplasia is caused by the inability of the bone marrow to produce only red blood cells.\n* The malaria parasite spends part of its life-cycle in red blood cells, feeds on their hemoglobin and then breaks them apart, causing fever. Both sickle-cell disease and thalassemia are more common in malaria areas, because these mutations convey some protection against the parasite.\n* In polycythemia vera the increased number of red blood cells results from an abnormality in the bone marrow.\nTransfusion.\nRed blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the recipient at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified and matched with the recipient's blood to minimise the likelihood of acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, a type of transfusion reaction. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.\nBlood is often transfused when there is known anaemia, active bleeding, or when there is an expectation of serious blood loss, such as prior to an operation. Before blood is given, a small sample of the recipient's blood is tested with the transfusion in a process known as cross-matching.\nIn 2008 it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming red blood cells in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial red blood cells can eventually be used for blood transfusions.\nA human trial is conducted in 2022, using blood cultured from stem cells obtained from donor blood.\nTests.\nSeveral blood tests involve red blood cells. These include a \"RBC count\" (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood), calculation of the hematocrit (percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood transfusion or an organ transplantation.\nMany diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal poikilocytosis, which are variations in red blood cell shape. When red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as \"rouleaux formation\", and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.\nSeparation and blood doping.\nRed blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. Packed red blood cells, which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine. During plasma donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.\nSome athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping: first about 1\u00a0litre of their blood is extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at , or over 10 years using cryoprotectants) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity. Another method of blood doping involves injection with erythropoietin to stimulate production of red blood cells. Both practices are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nHistory.\nThe first person to describe red blood cells was the young Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had used an early microscope in 1658 to study the blood of a frog. Unaware of this work, Anton van Leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, \"25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of sand\".\nIn the 1740s, Vincenzo Menghini in Bologna was able to demonstrate the presence of iron by passing magnets over the powder or ash remaining from heated red blood cells.\nIn 1901, Karl Landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groups\u2014A, B, and C (which he later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner, identified a fourth blood group\u2014AB.\nIn 1959, by use of X-ray crystallography, Max Perutz was able to unravel the structure of hemoglobin, the red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.\nThe oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a natural mummy of a man who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Major types of blood cells include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Together, these three kinds of blood cells add up to a total 45% of the blood tissue by volume, with the remaining 55% of the volume composed of plasma, the liquid component of blood.\nRed blood cells.\nRed blood cells or \"erythrocytes\" primarily carry oxygen and collect carbon dioxide through the use of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that gives red blood cells their color and facilitates transportation of oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. Red blood cells are the most abundant cell in the blood, accounting for about 40\u201345% of its volume. Red blood cells are circular, biconcave, disk-shaped and deformable to allow them to squeeze through narrow capillaries. They do not have a nucleus. Red blood cells are much smaller than most other human cells.\nRBCs are formed in the red bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells in a process known as erythropoiesis. In adults, about 2.4 million RBCs are produced each second. The normal RBCs count is 4.5 to 5 millions per cu.mm. RBCs have a lifespan of approximately 100\u2013120 days. After they have completed their lifespan, they are removed from the bloodstream by the spleen.\nMature red blood cells are unique among cells in the human body in that they lack a nucleus (although erythroblasts do have a nucleus).\nThe condition of having too few red blood cells is known as anemia, while having too many is polycythemia.\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which RBCs sink to the bottom (when placed in a vertical column after adding an anticoagulant). Normal values of ESR are:\n\u2022 3 to 5 mm per hour in males.\n\u2022 4 to 7 mm per hour in females.\nWhite blood cells.\nWhite blood cells or \"leukocytes\", are cells of the immune system involved in defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials. They are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system. There are a variety of types of white blood cells that serve specific roles in the human immune system. WBCs constitute approximately 1% of the blood volume.\nWhite blood cells are divided into granulocytes and agranulocytes, distinguished by the presence or absence of granules in the cytoplasm. Granulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells. Agranulocytes include lymphocytes and monocytes.\nThe condition of having too few white blood cells is leukopenia, while having too many is leukocytosis. There are individual terms for the lack or overabundance of specific types of white blood cells. The number of white blood cells in circulation is commonly increased in the incidence of infection. Many hematological cancers are based on the inappropriate production of white blood cells.\nPlatelets.\nPlatelets, or \"thrombocytes\", are very small, irregularly shaped clear cell fragments, 2\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, which derive from fragmentation of megakaryocytes. The average lifespan of a platelet is normally just 5 to 9 days. Platelets are a natural source of growth factors. They circulate in the blood of mammals and are involved in hemostasis, leading to the formation of blood clots. Platelets release thread-like fibers to form these clots.\nThe normal range (99% of population analyzed) for platelets is 150,000 to 450,000 per cubic millimeter. If the number of platelets is too low, excessive bleeding can occur. However, if the number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form thrombosis, which may obstruct blood vessels and result in such events as a stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or blockage of blood vessels to other parts of the body, such as the extremities of the arms or legs. An abnormality or disease of the platelets is called a thrombocytopathy, which can be either a low number of platelets (thrombocytopenia), a decrease in function of platelets (thrombasthenia), or an increase in the number of platelets (thrombocytosis). There are disorders that reduce the number of platelets, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), that typically cause thromboses, or clots, instead of bleeding.\nPlatelets release a multitude of growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, and TGF beta, which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix. Both of these growth factors have been shown to play a significant role in the repair and regeneration of connective tissues. Other healing-associated growth factors produced by platelets include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Local application of these factors in increased concentrations through platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used as an adjunct to wound healing for several decades.\nComplete blood count.\nA complete blood count (CBC) is a test panel requested by a doctor or other medical professional that gives information about the cells in a patient's blood. A scientist or lab technician performs the requested testing and provides the requesting medical professional with the results of the CBC. In the past, counting the cells in a patient's blood was performed manually, by viewing a slide prepared with a sample of the patient's blood under a microscope. Today, this process is generally automated by use of an automated analyzer, with only approximately 10-20% of samples now being examined manually. Abnormally high or low counts may indicate the presence of many forms of disease, and hence blood counts are amongst the most commonly performed blood tests in medicine, as they can provide an overview of a patient's general health status.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1658 Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope, and in 1695, microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of \"red corpuscles\", as they were called. No further blood cells were discovered until 1842 when French physician Alfred Donn\u00e9 discovered platelets. The following year leukocytes were first observed by Gabriel Andral, a French professor of medicine, and William Addison, a British physician, simultaneously. Both men believed that both red and white cells were altered in disease. With these discoveries, hematology, a new field of medicine, was established. Even though agents for staining tissues and cells were available, almost no advances were made in knowledge about the morphology of blood cells until 1879, when Paul Ehrlich published his technique for staining blood films and his method for differential blood cell counting.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After writing more best-sellers in the genre in the 1980s, he branched into historical fiction with \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (1989), an epic set in medieval England which became his best-known work and the first published in the \"Kingsbridge\" series. He has continued to write in both genres, including the \"Century Trilogy\". Many of his books have achieved high ranking on bestseller lists, including the number-one position on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nEarly life and education.\nFollett was born on 5 June 1949 in Cardiff, Wales. He was the first child of Martin Follett, a tax inspector, and Lavinia (Veenie) Follett, who went on to have two more children, Hannah and James. Barred from watching films and television by his Plymouth Brethren parents, he developed an early interest in reading but remained an indifferent student until he entered his teens. His family moved to London when he was ten years old, and he began applying himself to his studies at Harrow Weald Grammar School and Poole Technical College.\nIn 1967, he was admitted to University College London, where he studied philosophy and became active in centre-left politics. He married Mary in 1968, and their son, Emanuele, was born the same year. After graduating in 1970, he completed a three-month postgraduate journalism course and began working as a trainee reporter for the \"South Wales Echo\" in Cardiff. In 1973, his daughter, Marie-Claire, was born.\nCareer.\nAfter three years in Cardiff, he returned to London as a general-assignment reporter for the \"Evening News\". Finding the work unchallenging, he eventually left journalism for publishing and became, by the late 1970s, deputy managing director of the small London publisher Everest Books. He began writing fiction during evenings and weekends as a hobby. Later, he said, he began writing books when he needed \u00a3200 to fix his car, and the publishers' advance a fellow journalist had been paid for a thriller was \u00a3200.\nFurther successes.\nSuccess came gradually at first, but the 1978 publication of \"Eye of the Needle\", which became an international bestseller and sold over 10 million copies, made him both wealthy and internationally famous.\nEach of Follett's subsequent novels has become a best-seller, ranking high on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list; a number have been adapted for the screen. As of January 2018, he had published 44 books. The first five best sellers were spy thrillers: \"Eye of the Needle\" (1978), \"Triple\" (1979), \"The Key to Rebecca \"(1980), \"The Man from St. Petersburg\" (1982) and \"Lie Down with Lions\" (1986). \"On Wings of Eagles\" (1983) was the true story of how two of Ross Perot's employees were rescued from Iran during the revolution of 1979.\nThe next three novels, \"Night Over Water\" (1991), \"A Dangerous Fortune\" (1993) and \"A Place Called Freedom\" (1995) were more historical than thriller, but he returned to the thriller genre with \"The Third Twin\" (1996) which in the \"Publishing Trends\" annual survey of international fiction best-sellers for 1997 was ranked no. 2 worldwide, after John Grisham's \"The Partner\". His next work, \"The Hammer of Eden\" (1998), was another contemporary suspense story followed by a Cold War thriller, \"Code to Zero\" (2000).\nFollett returned to the Second World War era with his next two novels, \"Jackdaws\" (2001), a thriller about a group of women parachuted into France to destroy a vital telephone exchange \u2013 which won the Corine Literature Prize for 2003 \u2013 and \"Hornet Flight\" (2002), about a daring young Danish couple who escape to Britain from occupied Denmark in a rebuilt Hornet Moth biplane with vital information about German radar. \"Whiteout\" (2004) is a contemporary thriller about the theft of a deadly virus from a research lab.\nKingsbridge series.\nFollett surprised his readers with his first non-spy thriller, \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (1989), a novel about building a cathedral in a small English village during the Anarchy in the 12th century. The novel was highly successful, received positive reviews and was on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for eighteen weeks. It topped best-seller lists in Canada, Britain and Italy, and was on the German best-seller list for six years. As of 2017 it has sold 26 million copies. On 16 August 2017, a computer game adaptation by German developer and publisher Daedalic Entertainment was released.\nIts much-later sequel, \"World Without End\" (2007), returns to Kingsbridge 157 years later, and features the descendants of the characters in \"Pillars\". It focuses on the destinies of a handful of people as their lives are devastated by the Black Death, the plague that swept Europe from the middle of the 14th century.\nThe next novel in the series is \"A Column of Fire\" (2017). Beginning in 1558, the story follows the romance between Ned Willard and Margery Fitzgerald over half a century. It commences at a time when Europe turns against Elizabethan England, and the queen finds herself beset by plots to dethrone her.\nA fourth novel, \"The Evening and the Morning\" (2020), is a prequel to \"The Pillars of the Earth\". Set in the decade around 1000 AD \u2013 in the so-called Dark Ages \u2013 the story \"concerns the gradual creation of the town of Kingsbridge and of the many people \u2013 priests, nobles, peasants, the enslaved \u2013 who played significant roles\". As such, the book provides \"a solid underpinning to the later installments of the Kingsbridge series\".\nA fifth novel, \"The Armour of Light\" (2023), is set in 1792, around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The book explores the societal upheaval following the invention of the Spinning Jenny in 1770. Set against the backdrop of Napoleonic wars and economic transformation, it follows interconnected characters: a widow coping with her husband\u2019s death in a factory accident, a young woman funding a school for impoverished children, a man inheriting a failing business, and a wealthy industrialist protecting his fortune at all costs. Amid war and social change, the story examines the human cost of progress and the struggle to rebuild a fractured world.\nThe series has been described as being \"as comprehensive an account of the building of a civilization \u2013 with its laws, structures, customs and beliefs \u2013 as you are likely to encounter anywhere in popular fiction\".\nCentury trilogy.\nFollett's novels, \"Fall of Giants\", \"Winter of the World\" and \"Edge of Eternity\", make up the Century Trilogy. \"Fall of Giants\" (2010) followed the fates of five interrelated families \u2013 Welsh, American, German, Russian and English \u2013 as they moved through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and the struggle for women's suffrage. \"Fall of Giants\", published simultaneously in 14 countries, was internationally popular and topped several best-seller lists.\n\"Winter of the World\" (2012) picks up where the first book left off, as its five interrelated families enter a time of enormous social, political, and economic turmoil, beginning with the rise of Nazi Germany, through the Spanish Civil War and the great dramas of World War II, to the explosions of the American and Soviet atom bombs and the beginning of the long Cold War.\nThe final novel in the 'Century' trilogy, \"Edge of Eternity\", which follows those families through the events of the second half of the 20th century, was published on 16 September 2014. Like the previous two books, it chronicles the lives of five families through the Cold War and civil-rights movements.\nA major element of the first two volumes, \"Fall of Giants\" and \"Winter of the World\", is the increasing political assertiveness of the British working class and the rise of the British Labour Party \u2013 exemplified by the Williams Family, Welsh coal miners, of which several viewpoint characters end up as Members of the British Parliament and one of them becomes a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee's post-WWII Labour government. However, the theme of British politics is nearly absent from the third part \"Edge of Eternity\", which concentrates on the Cold War on the one hand and the US Civil Rights Movement on the other; for example, though the novel continues until 1989, it makes no reference at all to the rise of Margaret Thatcher in 1979.\nAdaptations.\nFollett has had a number of novels made into films and television mini series: \"Eye of the Needle\" was made into an acclaimed film, starring Donald Sutherland, and six novels have been made into television mini-series: \"The Key to Rebecca\", \"Lie Down with Lions\", \"On Wings of Eagles\" (1986), \"The Third Twin\" \u2013 the rights for which were sold to CBS for $US1,400,000, a record price at the time \u2013 and \"The Pillars of the Earth\" (2010) and \"World Without End\" (2012).\nA video game adaptation titled \"Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth\", developed and published by German studio Daedalic Entertainment, was released in three parts from 2017 to 2018.\nFollett had cameo roles as the valet in \"The Third Twin\" and later as a merchant in \"The Pillars of the Earth\". In 2016, \"A Dangerous Fortune\" was also adapted.\n\"Pillars of the Earth\" and \"A Column of Fire\" have both been adapted into Danish-language musicals. \"Pillars of the Earth\" had its world premiere October 12, 2016 at \u00d8stre Gasv\u00e6rk Teater, Copenhagen. \"A Column of Fire\" had its world premiere in 2019 at Bellevue Teatret, Klampenborg. Both of the musicals were written by Thomas H\u00f8g, Lasse Aagaard, and Sune Svanekier.\nPublic life.\nFollett is a member of various organisations that promote literacy and writing, and is actively involved in various organisations in his home town of Stevenage.\nHe is active in numerous Stevenage charities and was a governor of Roebuck Primary School for ten years, serving as the Chair of Governors for four of those years.\nOn 15 September 2010, Follett, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in \"The Guardian\" stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK.\nHe has also donated \u00a325,000 to the Yvette Cooper campaign in the 2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election, as well as another \u00a325,000 from his wife Barbara Follett.\nFollett's archival papers are housed at the Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan, United States. They include outlines, first drafts, notes and correspondence, original manuscripts, and copies of early books now out of print.\nPersonal life.\nFollett was married to Mary Emma Ruth Elson from 1968 to 1985 and had two children Emanuele (born 1968) and Marie-Claire (born 1973). \nFollett became involved, during the late 1970s, in the activities of Britain's Labour Party. In the course of his political activities, he met Barbara Broer, a Labour Party official, who became his second wife in 1984. She was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1997, representing Stevenage. She was re-elected in both 2001 and 2005, but did not stand in the 2010 general election. Follett himself remains a prominent Labour supporter and fundraiser as well as a prominent Blairite.\nDuring university, Follett rebelled against his parents' \"puritanical faith\" and became an atheist. As of 2022, he is \"still an atheist, but I do have a spiritual life\".\nHe is an amateur musician playing bass guitar for Damn Right I Got the Blues, and appears occasionally with the folk group Clog Iron playing a bass balalaika.\nFollett now lives in Hertfordshire, England.\nBibliography.\nApples Carstairs series (as Simon Myles)\nPiers Roper series\nKingsbridge series\nThe Century Trilogy\nStandalone novels\nNon-fiction\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67161", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67161", "title": "Apollonius of Tyana", "text": "Greek Neopythagorean philosopher (c.15\u2013100)\nApollonius of Tyana (; c.\u2009AD\u00a015\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009100) was a Greek philosopher and religious leader from the town of Tyana, Cappadocia in Roman Anatolia, who spent his life travelling and teaching in the Middle East, North Africa and India. He is a central figure in Neopythagoreanism and was one of the most famous \"miracle workers\" of his day.\nHis exceptional personality and his mystical way of life, which was regarded as exemplary, impressed his contemporaries and had a lasting cultural influence. Numerous legends surrounding him and accounts of his life are contained in the extensive \"Life of Apollonius\". Many of the ancient legends of Apollonius consist of numerous reports about miracles that he was said to have performed as a wandering sage with his lifelong companion Damis.\nHe was tried for allegedly having used magic as a means of conspiring against the emperor; after his conviction and subsequent death-penalty, his followers believed he underwent heavenly ascension. Most modern scholars of antiquity agree that Apollonius existed historically.\nLife dates.\nApollonius was born into a respected and wealthy aristocratic Greek household. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (c.\u2009170\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009247), places him c.\u20093\u00a0BC\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009AD 97, however, the Roman historian Cassius Dio (c.\u2009AD 155\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009235) writes that Apollonius was in his 40s or 50s in the 90s AD, from which the scholar Maria Dzielska gives a birth year of about AD 40.\nSources.\nThe earliest and by far the most detailed source is the \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the sophist Philostratus at the request of empress Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus. She died in AD\u00a0217, and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s\u00a0AD. Philostratus's account shaped the image of Apollonius for posterity. To some extent it is a valuable source because it contains data from older writings that were available to Philostratus but disappeared later on. Among these works are an excerpt (preserved by Eusebius) from \"On Sacrifices\", and certain alleged letters of Apollonius. The sage may have actually written some of these works, along with the no-longer extant \"Life of Pythagoras\". At least two biographical sources that Philostratus used are lost: a book by the imperial secretary Maximus describing Apollonius's activities in Maximus's home city of Aegaeae in Aeolis and a biography by a certain Moiragenes. There also survives, separately from the life by Philostratus, a collection of letters of Apollonius, but at least some of these seem to be spurious.\nOne of the essential sources Philostratus claimed to know are the \"memoirs\" (or \"diary\") of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think it could have been a real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero's ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana entered heaven.\nHow much of this can be accepted as historical truth depends largely on the extent to which modern scholars trust Philostratus, and in particular on whether they believe in the reality of Damis. Some of these scholars contend that Apollonius never came to Western Europe and was virtually unknown there until the 3rd\u00a0century\u00a0AD, when Empress Julia Domna, who was herself from the province of Syria, decided to popularize him and his teachings in Rome. For that purpose, so these same scholars believe, she commissioned Philostratus to write the biography, in which Apollonius is exalted as a fearless sage with supernatural powers, even greater than Pythagoras. This view of Julia Domna's role in the making of the Apollonius legend gets some support from the fact that her son Caracalla worshipped him, and her grandnephew emperor Severus Alexander may have done so as well.\nApollonius was also a well-known figure in the Islamic world, being referred to by the name \"Balinus\".\nBiography.\nHistorical facts.\nWith the exception of the Adana Inscription from the 3rd or 4th century AD, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus.\nThe Adana Inscription has been translated by C.P. Jones as: \"This man, named after Apollo, and shining forth from Tyana, extinguished the faults of men. The tomb in Tyana (received) his body, but in truth, heaven received him so that he might drive out the pains of men (or: drive pains from among men).\" It is thought to have been brought from Cilicia, perhaps Aegae (Cilicia). However, Miroslav Marcovich translates part of the text as: \"Sure enough, Apollonius was born in Tyana, but the full truth is that he was a heaven-sent sage and healer, a new Pythagoras.\"\nAccording to James Francis, \"the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius appears to have been a wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire.\" What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (\"On sacrifices\"), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving \"nous\" (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.\nMiracles.\nPhilostratus implies on one occasion that Apollonius had extra-sensory perception (Book VIII, Chapter XXVI). When emperor Domitian was murdered on 18\u00a0September AD\u00a096, Apollonius was said to have witnessed the event in Ephesus \"about midday\" on the day it happened in Rome, and told those present \"Take heart, gentlemen, for the tyrant has been slain this day ...\". Both Philostratus and renowned historian Cassius Dio report this incident, probably on the basis of an oral tradition. Both state that the philosopher welcomed the deed as praiseworthy tyrannicide.\nJourney to India.\nPhilostratus devoted two and a half of the eight books of his \"Life of Apollonius\" (1.19\u20133.58) to the description of a journey of his hero to India. It's possible that the sage of Tyana indeed traveled to India, and it's also \"entirely plausible\" that he was attributed with this journey even before Philostratus.\nAccording to Philostratus' \"Life\", en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria (not Nineveh, as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. Pythagoras, whom the Neo-Pythagoreans regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have traveled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look like a good Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus' account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them rule out the possibility that the Tyanean actually did visit India. Philostratus has him meet Phraotes, the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, a city located in northern Ancient India in what is now northern Pakistan, around AD 46. And the description that Philostratus provides of Taxila comports with modern archaeological excavations at the ancient site.\nWhat seemed to be independent evidence showing that Apollonius was known in India has now been proven a forgery. In two Sanskrit texts quoted by Sanskritist Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya in 1943 he appears as \"Apal\u016bnya\", in one of them together with Damis (called \"Dam\u012b\u015ba\"), it is claimed that Apollonius and Damis were Western yogis, who later on were converted to the correct Advaita philosophy. Some have believed that these Indian sources derived their information from a Sanskrit translation of Philostratus' work (which would have been a most uncommon and amazing occurrence), or even considered the possibility that it was really an independent confirmation of the historicity of the journey to India. Only in 1995 were the passages in the Sanskrit texts proven to be interpolations by a late 19th-century forger.\nWritings.\nSeveral writings and many letters have been ascribed to Apollonius, but some of them are lost; others have only been preserved in parts or fragments of disputed authenticity. Porphyry and Iamblichus refer to a biography of Pythagoras by Apollonius, which has not survived; it is also mentioned in the \"Suda\". Apollonius wrote a treatise, \"On sacrifices\", of which only a short, probably authentic fragment has come down to us.\nPhilostratus' \"Life\" and the anthology assembled by Joannes Stobaeus contain purported letters of Apollonius. Some of them are cited in full, others only partially. There is also an independently transmitted collection of letters preserved in medieval manuscripts. It is difficult to determine what is authentic and what not. Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.\nImpact.\nAntiquity.\nIn the 2nd\u00a0century the satirist Lucian of Samosata was a sharp critic of Neo-Pythagoreanism. After AD\u00a0180 he wrote a pamphlet wherein he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius's students, as a charlatan and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian's time. One of Philostratus's foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized at the same time that his hero was not a magician but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.\nWhen Emperor Aurelian conducted his military campaign against the Palmyrene Empire, he captured Tyana in AD\u00a0272. According to the \"Historia Augusta\" he abstained from destroying the city after having a vision of Apollonius admonishing him to spare the innocent citizens.\nIn Late Antiquity talismans made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from afflictions. The great popularity of these talismans was a challenge to the Christians. Some Byzantine authors condemned them as sorcery and the work of demons, others admitted that such magic was beneficial; none of them claimed that it didn't work.\nIn the Western Roman Empire, Sidonius Apollinaris was a Christian admirer of Apollonius in the 5th\u00a0century. He produced a Latin translation of Philostratus's \"Life\", which is lost.\nThe Middle Ages.\nDuring the medieval period, a number of works related to Hermetic philosophy and medieval European magic were falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana which spanned the Greek, Arabic, and Latin traditions. \nIn the Greek tradition, there is \"The Book of Wisdom\" (Greek: \"Biblos Sophias\") which is \"The Book of Wisdom\" may also have survived in the Latin and Arabic traditions as having been published and distributed as a series of short separate tracts or chapters under a variety of different titles. \nIn the Latin tradition, there is the \"Golden Flowers\" (\"Flores Aurei\") which is a thirteenth-century book of angelic magic which supposedly contains Apollonius' select extracts and prayers from the mythical and lost \"Book of Flowers of Heavenly Teaching\" (\"Liber Florum Caelestis Doctrinae\") compiled by King Solomon. The \"Golden Flowers\" was later compiled with its own derivative text called the \"New Art\" (\"Ars Nova\") which would later become known as \"The Notory Art\" (\"Ars Notoria\"). The \"Notory Art\" explains that Apollonius of Tyana is the spiritual successor to King Solomon's angelic magic; for this reason, \"The Notory Art\" is often classified as belonging to the Pseudo-Solomonic corpus of magical literature. Another pseudepigraphal Latin work attributed to Apollonius of Tyana is the lost \"On Making Angelic Things\" (\"De Angelica Factura\" or \"De Angelica Factione\") cited by the Italian university professor Cecco d'Ascoli in his commentary on the Sphere of the Cosmos by John de Sacrobosco. Another falsely attributed work is \"On the Seven Figures of the Seven Planets\" (\"Liber De Septem Figuris Septem Planetarum\") which describes the seven magic squares attributed to the seven classical planets.\nIn the Arabic tradition, Apollonius of Tyana is called the \"Master of the Talismans\" (\"Sahib at-tilasmat\") and known as Balinus (or, Balinas, Belenus, or Abuluniyus). The ninth-century \"Book of Balinas the Wise: On the Causes, or, the Book of the Secret of Creation\" (\"Kitab Balaniyus al-Hakim fi'l- 'llal, Kitab Sirr al-khaliqa wa-san 'at al-tabi'a\") expounds upon the origins of the cosmos and its causes in six chapters and narrates the story of how Apollonius entered the crypt of Hermes Trismegistus to discover the Emerald Tablet (\"Tabula Smaragdina\") which became a foundational text of alchemy. In this way, Apollonius of Tyana becomes the philosophical and alchemical successor to Hermes Trismegistus. Another Arabic book falsely attributed to Apollonius is the \"Treatise on Magic\" (\"Risalat al-Sihr\") cited within the \"Great Introduction to the Treatise on Spirits and Talismans\" which was translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq (\"al-Mudkhal al-Kabir ila 'ilm af 'al al-Ruhaniyat waw Talassimat\"). The \"Treatise on Magic\" might be the same work under its Latin titles \"De Hyle\" and \"De Arte Magica\" as cited by Cecco d'Ascoli.\nModern era.\nBeginning in the early 16th century, there was great interest in Apollonius in Europe, but the traditional ecclesiastical viewpoint prevailed, and until the Age of Enlightenment the Tyanean was usually treated as a demonic magician and a great enemy of the Church who collaborated with the devil and tried to overthrow Christianity.\nEliphas Levi made three attempts to raise the shade of Apollonius of Tyana by occult ritual, as described in his textbook on magic \"Dogme de la magie\" (1854).\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Scripture.\nThe \"Tablet of Wisdom\", written by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, names \"Balinus\" (Apollonius) as a great philosopher, who \"surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication.\" In another text Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h states that he \"derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements\".\nLiterature and film.\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton refers to Apollonius in \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" and \"Zanoni\" as a great master of occult power and wisdom.\nApollonius appears in Gustave Flaubert's novel \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony\", where he tempts the titular saint with divine wisdom and the power to perform miracles. As a miracle worker and neo-Pythagorean philosopher, the character of Apollonius is used as a bridge between the two sections of the book covering the temptations of human sages and the temptations of the gods.\nApollonius of Tyana is a major character in Steven Saylor's historical novel \"Empire\", which depicts his confrontation with the harsh Emperor Domitian. Apollonius is shown confounding the Emperor (and many others) in quick-witted dialogue, reminiscent of Socrates. The book's plot leaves ambiguous the issue of whether Apollonius possessed true magical power or that he was able to use suggestion and other clever tricks.\nAvram Davidson's science fiction novel \"Masters of the Maze\" has Apollonius of Tyana as one of a select group of humans (and other sentient beings) who had penetrated to the center of a mysterious \"Maze\" traversing all of space and time. There he dwells in eternal repose, in company with the Biblical Enoch, the Chinese King Wen and Lao Tze, the 19th-century Briton Bathurst, and various other sages of the past and future, some of them Martians.\nIn \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\" (1935) by Charles G. Finney, Apollonius appears in the employ of Dr. Lao's circus and brings a dead man back to life. Apollonius of Tyana is one of the 7 circus characters portrayed by Tony Randall in the 1964 film \"The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao\". This character does not have any philosophical context, rather he is a sideshow attraction similar to a fortune-teller who, besides being blind, has been blessed with clairvoyance. While he always speaks the truth, ugly or not, about the future, he is accursed with an ironic fate \u2013 nobody ever believes what he says.\nIn television, Apollonius of Tyana was portrayed by Mel Ferrer in \"The Fantastic Journey\" episode entitled \"Funhouse\". Apollonius was banished centuries ago to a time zone by the gods for opposing them. When the time zone travelers led by the 23rd century healer and pacifist named Varian arrive at a seemingly abandoned carnival, Apollonius intends to lure them into his funhouse of horrors so that he can possess the body of one of the travelers and escape his eternal imprisonment.\nKeats' poem \"Lamia\" mentions and discusses Apollonius.\nIn Guillaume Apollinaire's poem \"https://,\" from \"Alcools,\" Apollonius is depicted with other figures historical and mythological, \"floating around the first aeroplane.\"\nComparisons with Jesus.\nComparisons between Apollonius and Jesus became commonplace in the 17th and 18th\u00a0centuries in the context of polemic about Christianity. Several advocates of Enlightenment, deism and anti-Church positions saw him as an early forerunner of their own ethical and religious ideas, a proponent of a universal, non-denominational religion compatible with reason. These comparisons continued into the 20th century.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It plays critical roles in facilitating nutrient, gas, and waste exchange between the physically separate maternal and fetal circulations, and is an important endocrine organ, producing hormones that regulate both maternal and fetal physiology during pregnancy. The placenta connects to the fetus via the umbilical cord, and on the opposite aspect to the maternal uterus in a species-dependent manner. In humans, a thin layer of maternal decidual (endometrial) tissue comes away with the placenta when it is expelled from the uterus following birth (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the 'maternal part' of the placenta). Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.\nMammalian placentas probably first evolved about 150 million to 200 million years ago. The protein syncytin, found in the outer barrier of the placenta (the syncytiotrophoblast) between mother and fetus, has a certain RNA signature in its genome that has led to the hypothesis that it originated from an ancient retrovirus: essentially a virus that helped pave the transition from egg-laying to live-birth.\nThe word \"placenta\" comes from the Latin word for a type of cake, from Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \"plak\u00f3enta/plako\u00fanta\", accusative of \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2/\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \"plak\u00f3eis/plako\u00fas\", \"flat, slab-like\", with reference to its round, flat appearance in humans. The classical plural is \"placentae\", but the form \"placentas\" is more common in modern English.\nEvolution and phylogenetic diversity.\nThe placenta has evolved independently multiple times, probably starting in fish, where it originated multiple times, including the genus \"Poeciliopsis.\" Placentation has also evolved in some reptiles.\nThe mammalian placenta evolved more than 100 million years ago and was a critical factor in the explosive diversification of placental mammals. Although all mammalian placentas have the same functions, there are important differences in structure and function in different groups of mammals. For example, human, bovine, equine and canine placentas are very different at both the gross and the microscopic levels. Placentas of these species also differ in their ability to provide maternal immunoglobulins to the fetus.\nStructure.\nPlacental mammals, including humans, have a chorioallantoic placenta that forms from the chorion and allantois. In humans, the placenta averages 22\u00a0cm (9\u00a0inch) in length and 2\u20132.5\u00a0cm (0.8\u20131\u00a0inch) in thickness, with the center being the thickest, and the edges being the thinnest. It typically weighs approximately 500\u00a0grams (just over 1\u00a0lb). It has a dark reddish-blue or crimson color. It connects to the fetus by an umbilical cord of approximately 55\u201360\u00a0cm (22\u201324\u00a0inch) in length, which contains two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The umbilical cord inserts into the chorionic plate (has an eccentric attachment). Vessels branch out over the surface of the placenta and further divide to form a network covered by a thin layer of cells. This results in the formation of villous tree structures. On the maternal side, these villous tree structures are grouped into lobules called cotyledons. In humans, the placenta usually has a disc shape, but size varies vastly between different mammalian species.\nThe placenta occasionally takes a form in which it comprises several distinct parts connected by blood vessels. The parts, called lobes, may number two, three, four, or more. Such placentas are described as bilobed/bilobular/bipartite, trilobed/trilobular/tripartite, and so on. If there is a clearly discernible main lobe and auxiliary lobe, the latter is called a \"succenturiate placenta\". Sometimes the blood vessels connecting the lobes get in the way of fetal presentation during labor, which is called \"vasa previa\".\nGene and protein expression.\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal mature placenta. Some 350 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the placenta and fewer than 100 genes are highly placenta specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly expressed in trophoblasts and have functions related to pregnancy. Examples of proteins with elevated expression in placenta compared to other organs and tissues are PEG10 and the cancer testis antigen PAGE4 and expressed in cytotrophoblasts, CSH1 and KISS1 expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, and PAPPA2 and PRG2 expressed in extravillous trophoblasts.\nPhysiology.\nDevelopment.\nThe placenta begins to develop upon implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal endometrium, very early on in pregnancy at about week 4.\nThe outer layer of the late blastocyst, is formed of trophoblasts, cells that form the outer layer of the placenta. This outer layer is divided into two further layers: the underlying cytotrophoblast layer and the overlying syncytiotrophoblast layer. The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated continuous cell layer that covers the surface of the placenta. It forms as a result of differentiation and fusion of the underlying cytotrophoblasts, a process that continues throughout placental development. The syncytiotrophoblast contributes to the barrier function of the placenta.\nThe placenta grows throughout pregnancy. Development of the maternal blood supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy week 14 (DM).\nPlacental circulation.\nMaternal placental circulation.\nIn preparation for implantation of the blastocyst, the endometrium undergoes decidualization. Spiral arteries in the decidua are remodeled so that they become less convoluted and their diameter is increased. The increased diameter and straighter flow path both act to increase maternal blood flow to the placenta. There is relatively high pressure as the maternal blood fills intervillous space through these spiral arteries which bathe the fetal villi in blood, allowing an exchange of gases to take place. In humans and other hemochorial placentals, the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the fetal chorion, though no fluid is exchanged. As the pressure decreases between pulses, the deoxygenated blood flows back through the endometrial veins.\nMaternal blood flow begins between days 5\u201312, and is approximately 600\u2013700\u00a0ml/min at term.\nFetoplacental circulation.\nDeoxygenated fetal blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta. At the junction of umbilical cord and placenta, the umbilical arteries branch radially to form chorionic arteries. Chorionic arteries, in turn, branch into cotyledon arteries. In the villi, these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arterio-capillary-venous system, bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood; but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs (\"placental barrier\").\nEndothelin and prostanoids cause vasoconstriction in placental arteries, while nitric oxide causes vasodilation. On the other hand, there is no neural vascular regulation, and catecholamines have only little effect.\nThe fetoplacental circulation is vulnerable to persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, which can lead to generation of excessive free radicals. This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy complications. It is proposed that melatonin plays a role as an antioxidant in the placenta.\nThis begins at day 17\u201322.\nBirth.\nPlacental expulsion begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The period from just after the child is born until just after the placenta is expelled is called the \"third stage of labor\".\nPlacental expulsion can be managed actively, for example by giving oxytocin via intramuscular injection followed by cord traction to assist in delivering the placenta. Alternatively, it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Blood loss and the risk of postpartum bleeding may be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour, however there may be adverse effects and more research is necessary.\nLabour is associated with an inflammatory response, which is expressed differently in the placenta depending on how a baby was delivered (e.g. via vaginal delivery, caesarean section or other) and the baby's biological sex.\nThe habit is to cut the cord immediately after birth, but it may be no medical reason to do this; on the contrary, not cutting the cord could sometimes help the baby in its adaptation to extrauterine life, for preterm infants.\nMicrobiome.\nThe placenta is traditionally thought to be sterile, but recent research suggests that a resident, non-pathogenic, and diverse population of microorganisms may be present in healthy tissue. However, whether these microbes exist or are clinically important is highly controversial and is the subject of active research.\nPhysiology of placenta.\nNutrition and gas exchange.\nThe placenta intermediates the transfer of nutrients between mother and fetus. The perfusion of the intervillous spaces of the placenta with maternal blood allows the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus and the transfer of waste products and carbon dioxide back from the fetus to the maternal blood. Nutrient transfer to the fetus can occur via both active and passive transport. Placental nutrient metabolism was found to play a key role in limiting the transfer of some nutrients. Adverse pregnancy situations, such as those involving maternal diabetes or obesity, can increase or decrease levels of nutrient transporters in the placenta potentially resulting in overgrowth or restricted growth of the fetus.\nExcretion.\nWaste products excreted from the fetus such as urea, uric acid, and creatinine are transferred to the maternal blood by diffusion across the placenta.\nImmunity.\nThe placenta functions as a selective barrier between maternal and fetal cells, preventing maternal blood, proteins and microbes (including bacteria and most viruses) from crossing the maternal-fetal barrier.\nDeterioration in placental functioning, referred to as placental insufficiency, may be related to mother-to-child transmission of some infectious diseases.\nA very small number of viruses including \"rubella virus\", \"Zika virus\" and \"cytomegalovirus\" (CMV) can travel across the placental barrier, generally taking advantage of conditions at certain gestational periods as the placenta develops. CMV and Zika travel from the maternal bloodstream via placental cells to the fetal bloodstream.\nBeginning as early as 13 weeks of gestation, and increasing linearly, with the largest transfer occurring in the third trimester, IgG antibodies can pass through the human placenta, providing protection to the fetus \"in utero\".\nThis passive immunity lingers for several months after birth, providing the newborn with a exact copy of the mother's long-term humoral immunity to see the infant through the crucial first months of extrauterine life. IgM antibodies, because of their larger size, cannot cross the placenta, one reason why infections acquired during pregnancy can be particularly hazardous for the fetus.\nImmunological barrier.\nThe placenta and fetus may be regarded as a foreign body inside the mother and must be protected from the normal immune response of the mother that would cause it to be rejected. The placenta and fetus are thus treated as sites of immune privilege, with immune tolerance.\nFor this purpose, the placenta uses several mechanisms :\nHowever, the placental barrier is not the sole means of evading the immune system, as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation, on the other side of the placental barrier.\nDNA methylation.\nThe trophoblast is the outer layer of cells of the blastocyst (see day 9 in Figure, above, showing the initial stages of human embryogenesis). Placental trophoblast cells have a unique genome-wide DNA methylation pattern determined by de novo methyltransferases during embryogenesis. This methylation pattern is principally required to regulate placental development and function, which in turn is critical for embryo survival.\nOther.\nThe placenta also provides a reservoir of blood for the fetus, delivering blood to it in case of hypotension and vice versa, comparable to a capacitor.\nClinical significance.\nNumerous pathologies can affect the placenta.\nSociety and culture.\nThe placenta often plays an important role in various cultures, with many societies conducting rituals regarding its disposal. In the Western world, the placenta is most often incinerated.\nSome cultures bury the placenta for various reasons. The M\u0101ori of New Zealand traditionally bury the placenta from a newborn child to emphasize the relationship between humans and the earth. Likewise, the Navajo bury the placenta and umbilical cord at a specially chosen site, particularly if the baby dies during birth. In Cambodia and Costa Rica, burial of the placenta is believed to protect and ensure the health of the baby and the mother. If a mother dies in childbirth, the Aymara of Bolivia bury the placenta in a secret place so that the mother's spirit will not return to claim her baby's life.\nThe placenta is believed by some communities to have power over the lives of the baby or its parents. The Kwakiutl of British Columbia bury girls' placentas to give the girl skill in digging clams, and expose boys' placentas to ravens to encourage future prophetic visions. In Turkey, the proper disposal of the placenta and umbilical cord is believed to promote devoutness in the child later in life. In Transylvania and Japan, interaction with a disposed placenta is thought to influence the parents' future fertility.\nSeveral cultures believe the placenta to be or have been alive, often a relative of the baby. Nepalese think of the placenta as a friend of the baby; the orang Asli and Malay populations in Malay Peninsula regard it as the baby's older sibling. Native Hawaiians believe that the placenta is a part of the baby, and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child. Various cultures in Indonesia, such as Javanese and Malay, believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house. Some Malays would bury the baby's placenta with a pencil (if it is a boy) or a needle and thread (if it is a girl).\nIn some cultures, the placenta is eaten, a practice known as human placentophagy. In some eastern cultures, such as China, the dried placenta (\"ziheche\" \u7d2b\u6cb3\u8f66, literally \"purple river car\") is thought to be a healthful restorative and is sometimes used in preparations of traditional Chinese medicine and various health products. The practice of human placentophagy has become a more recent trend in western cultures and is not without controversy; its practice being considered cannibalism is debated.\nSome cultures have alternative uses for placenta that include the manufacturing of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an aspartic endopeptidase belonging to MEROPS A1 family. It is produced by newborn ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. It is widely used in the production of cheese.\nHistorically, chymosin was obtained by extracting it from the stomachs of slaughtered calves. Today, most commercial chymosin used in cheese production is produced recombinantly in \"Escherichia coli\", \"Aspergillus niger\" var. \"awamori\", and \"Kluyveromyces lactis\".\nOccurrence.\nChymosin is found in a wide range of tetrapods, although it is best known to be produced by ruminant animals in the lining of the abomasum. Chymosin is produced by gastric chief cells in newborn mammals to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. Non-ruminant species that produce chymosin include pigs, cats, seals, and chicks.\nOne study reported finding a chymosin-like enzyme in some human infants, but others have failed to replicate this finding. Humans have a pseudogene for chymosin that does not generate a protein, found on chromosome 1. Humans have other proteins to digest milk, such as pepsin and lipase.\nIn addition to the primate lineage leading up to humans, some other mammals have also lost the chymosin gene.\nEnzymatic reaction.\nChymosin is used to bring about the extensive precipitation and curd formation in cheese-making. The native substrate of chymosin is K-casein which is specifically cleaved at the peptide bond between amino acid residues 105 and 106, phenylalanine and methionine. The resultant product is calcium phosphocaseinate. When the specific linkage between the hydrophobic (para-casein) and hydrophilic (acidic glycopeptide) groups of casein is broken, the hydrophobic groups unite and form a 3D network that traps the aqueous phase of the milk.\nCharge interactions between histidines on the kappa-casein and glutamates and aspartates of chymosin initiate enzyme binding to the substrate. When chymosin is not binding substrate, a beta-hairpin, sometimes referred to as \"the flap,\" can hydrogen bond with the active site, therefore covering it and not allowing further binding of substrate.\nExamples.\nListed below are the ruminant \"Cym\" gene and corresponding human pseudogene:\nRecombinant chymosin.\nBecause of the imperfections and scarcity of microbial and animal rennets, producers sought replacements. With the development of genetic engineering, it became possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomach and insert them into certain bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain any GM component or ingredient. FPC contains the identical chymosin as the animal source, but produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and are considered the ideal milk-clotting enzyme.\nFPC was the first artificially produced enzyme to be registered and allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration. In 1999, about 60% of US hard cheese was made with FPC and it has up to 80% of the global market share for rennet.\nBy 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC. The most widely used fermentation-produced chymosin is produced either using the fungus \"Aspergillus niger\" or using \"Kluyveromyces lactis\".\nFPC contains only chymosin B, achieving a higher degree of purity compared with animal rennet. FPC can deliver several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet, such as higher production yield, better curd texture and reduced bitterness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67168", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67168", "title": "\u0392-Galactosidase", "text": "Family of glycoside hydrolase enzymes\n\u03b2-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23, beta-gal or \u03b2-gal; systematic name \u03b2--galactoside galactohydrolase) is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing \u03b2--galactose residues in \u03b2--galactosides. (This enzyme digests many \u03b2-Galactosides, not just lactose. It is sometimes loosely referred to as lactase but that name is generally reserved for mammalian digestive enzymes that breaks down lactose specifically.)\n\u03b2-Galactosides include carbohydrates containing galactose where the glycosidic bond lies above the galactose molecule. Substrates of different \u03b2-galactosidases include ganglioside GM1, lactosylceramides, lactose, and various glycoproteins.\nFunction.\n\u03b2-Galactosidase is an exoglycosidase which hydrolyzes the \u03b2-glycosidic bond formed between a galactose and its organic moiety. It may also cleave fucosides and arabinosides but at a much lower rate. It is an essential enzyme in the human body. Deficiencies in the protein can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome. In \"E. coli\", the \"lacZ\" gene is the structural gene for \u03b2-galactosidase; which is present as part of the inducible system \"lac\" operon which is activated in the presence of lactose when glucose level is low. \u03b2-Galactosidase synthesis stops when glucose levels are sufficient.\n\u03b2-Galactosidase has many homologues based on similar sequences. A few are evolved \u03b2-galactosidase (EBG), \u03b2-glucosidase, 6-phospho-\u03b2-galactosidase, \u03b2-mannosidase, and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Although they may be structurally similar, they all have different functions. Beta-gal is inhibited by -ribose and by competitive inhibitors 2-phenylethyl 1-thio-\u03b2--galactopyranoside (PETG), -galactonolactone, isopropyl thio-\u03b2--galactoside (IPTG), and galactose.\n\u03b2-Galactosidase is important for organisms as it is a key provider in the production of energy and a source of carbons through the break down of lactose to galactose and glucose. It is also important for lactose-intolerant people as it is responsible for making lactose-free milk and other dairy products. Many adult humans lack the lactase enzyme, which has the same function as \u03b2-galactosidase, so they are not able to properly digest dairy products. \u03b2-Galactose is used in such dairy products as yogurt, sour cream, and some cheeses which are treated with the enzyme to break down any lactose before human consumption. In recent years, \u03b2-galactosidase has been researched as a potential treatment for lactose intolerance through gene replacement therapy where it could be placed into the human DNA so individuals can break down lactose on their own.\nStructure.\nThe 1,023 amino acids of \"E. coli\" \u03b2-galactosidase were sequenced in 1983, and its structure determined eleven years later in 1994. The protein is a 464-kDa homotetramer with 2,2,2-point symmetry. Each unit of \u03b2-galactosidase consists of five domains; domain 1 is a jelly-roll type \u03b2-barrel, domain 2 and 4 are fibronectin type III-like barrels, domain 5 a novel \u03b2-sandwich, while the central domain 3 is a distorted TIM-type barrel, lacking the fifth helix with a distortion in the sixth strand.\nThe third domain contains the active site. The active site is made up of elements from two subunits of the tetramer, and disassociation of the tetramer into dimers removes critical elements of the active site. The amino-terminal sequence of \u03b2-galactosidase, the \u03b1-peptide involved in \u03b1-complementation, participates in a subunit interface. Its residues 22\u201331 help to stabilize a four-helix bundle which forms the major part of that interface, and residue 13 and 15 also contributing to the activating interface. These structural features provide a rationale for the phenomenon of \u03b1-complementation, where the deletion of the amino-terminal segment results in the formation of an inactive dimer.\nReaction.\n\u03b2-Galactosidase can catalyze three different reactions in organisms. In one, it can go through a process called transgalactosylation to make allolactose, creating a positive feedback loop for the production of \u03b2-galactose. Allolactose can also be cleaved to form monosaccharides. It can also hydrolyze lactose into galactose and glucose which will proceed into glycolysis. The active site of \u03b2-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of its disaccharide substrate via \"shallow\" (nonproductive site) and \"deep\" (productive site) binding. Galactosides such as PETG and IPTG will bind in the shallow site when the enzyme is in \"open\" conformation while transition state analogs such as -ribose and -galactonolactone will bind in the deep site when the conformation is \"closed\".\nThe enzymatic reaction consists of two chemical steps, galactosylation and degalactosylation. Galactosylation is the first chemical step in the reaction where Glu461 donates a proton to a glycosidic oxygen, resulting in galactose covalently bonding with Glu537. In the second step, degalactosylation, the covalent bond is broken when Glu461 accepts a proton, replacing the galactose with water. Two transition states occur in the deep site of the enzyme during the reaction, once after each step. When water participates in the reaction, galactose is formed, otherwise, when -glucose acts as the acceptor in the second step, transgalactosylation occurs . It has been kinetically measured that single tetramers of the protein catalyze reactions at a rate of 38,500 \u00b1 900 reactions per minute. Monovalent potassium ions (K+) as well as divalent magnesium ions (Mg2+) are required for the enzyme's optimal activity. The \u03b2-linkage of the substrate is cleaved by a terminal carboxyl group on the side chain of a glutamic acid.\nIn \"E. coli\", Glu-461 was thought to be the nucleophile in the substitution reaction. However, it is now known that Glu-461 is an acid catalyst. Instead, Glu-537 is the actual nucleophile, binding to a galactosyl intermediate. In humans, the nucleophile of the hydrolysis reaction is Glu-268. Gly794 is important for \u03b2-galactosidase activity. It is responsible for putting the enzyme in a \"closed\", ligand bounded, conformation or \"open\" conformation, acting like a \"hinge\" for the active site loop. The different conformations ensure that only preferential binding occurs in the active site. In the presence of a slow substrate, Gly794 activity increased as well as an increase in galactosylation and decrease in degalactosylation.\nApplications.\nThe \u03b2-galactosidase assay is used frequently in genetics, molecular biology, and other life sciences. An active enzyme may be detected using artificial chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2--galactopyranoside, X-gal. \u03b2-galactosidase will cleave the glycosidic bond in X-gal and form galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole which dimerizes and oxidizes to 5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro-indigo, an intense blue product that is easy to identify and quantify. It is used for example in blue white screen. Its production may be induced by a non-hydrolyzable analog of allolactose, IPTG, which binds and releases the lac repressor from the lac operator, thereby allowing the initiation of transcription to proceed.\nIt is commonly used in molecular biology as a reporter marker to monitor gene expression. It also exhibits a phenomenon called \u03b1-complementation which forms the basis for the blue/white screening of recombinant clones. This enzyme can be split in two peptides, LacZ\u03b1 and LacZ\u03a9, neither of which is active by itself but when both are present together, spontaneously reassemble into a functional enzyme. This property is exploited in many cloning vectors where the presence of the \"lacZ\u03b1\" gene in a plasmid can complement in \"trans\" another mutant gene encoding the LacZ\u03a9 in specific laboratory strains of \"E. coli\". However, when DNA fragments are inserted in the vector, the production of LacZ\u03b1 is disrupted, the cells therefore show no \u03b2-galactosidase activity. The presence or absence of an active \u03b2-galactosidase may be detected by X-gal, which produces a characteristic blue dye when cleaved by \u03b2-galactosidase, thereby providing an easy means of distinguishing the presence or absence of cloned product in a plasmid. In studies of leukaemia chromosomal translocations, Dobson and colleagues used a fusion protein of LacZ in mice, exploiting \u03b2-galactosidase's tendency to oligomerise to suggest a potential role for oligomericity in MLL fusion protein function.\nA recent study conducted in 2020\u20132021 determined that \u03b2-Galactosidase activity correlates with cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is the process where cells do not divide, but do not die either. In senescent cells \u03b2-Galactosidase activity can be overexpressed, and this can lead to various diseases afflicting a wide range of body systems. These systems include the cardiovascular system, skeletal system, and many more. Detecting senescent cells can be achieved by measuring the lysosomal \u03b2-Galactosidase activity.\nA particular isoform of \u03b2-Galactosidase exclusively expressed by senescent cells was hypothesized to exist because only these types of cells showed \u03b2-Galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 (Senescence Associated beta-gal or SA-beta-gal). Specific quantitative assays were even developed for its detection. However, it is now known that this phenomenon occurs due to an overexpression and accumulation of the lysosomal endogenous \u03b2-Galactosidase, and thus it doesn't represent a distinct isoform of \u03b2-Galactosidase, nor is it a required phenotype for the progression or maintenance of the senescent state. Nevertheless, it remains the most widely used biomarker for senescent and aging cells, because it is reliable and easy to detect.\nEvolution.\nSome species of bacteria, including \"E. coli\", have additional \u03b2-galactosidase genes. A second gene, called evolved \u03b2-galactosidase (\"ebgA\") gene was discovered when strains with the \"lacZ\" gene deleted (but still containing the gene for galactoside permease, \"lacY\"), were plated on medium containing lactose (or other 3-galactosides) as sole carbon source. After a time, certain colonies began to grow. However, the EbgA protein is an ineffective lactase and does not allow growth on lactose. Two classes of single point mutations dramatically improve the activity of ebg enzyme toward lactose. and, as a result, the mutant enzyme is able to replace the lacZ \u03b2-galactosidase. EbgA and LacZ are 50% identical on the DNA level and 33% identical on the amino acid level. The active ebg enzyme is an aggregate of ebgA -gene and ebgC-gene products in a 1:1 ratio with the active form of ebg enzymes being an \"\u03b1\"4 \u03b24 hetero-octamer.\nSpecies distribution.\nMuch of the work done on \u03b2-galactosidase is derived from \"E. coli.\" However the enzyme can be found in many plants (especially fruits), mammals, yeast, bacteria, and fungi. \u03b2-galactosidase genes can differ in the length of their coding sequence and the length of proteins formed by amino acids. This separates the \u03b2-galactosidases into four families: GHF-1, GHF-2, GHF-35, and GHF- 42. \"E. Coli\" belongs to GHF-2, all plants belong to GHF-35, and \"Thermus thermophilus\" belongs to GHF-42. Various fruits can express multiple \u03b2-galactosidase genes. There are at least seven \u03b2-galactosidase genes expressed in tomato fruit development, that have amino acid similarity between 33% and 79%. A study targeted at identifying fruit softening of peaches found 17 different gene expressions of \u03b2-galactosidases. The only other known crystal structure of \u03b2-galactosidase is from \"Thermus thermophilus.\" \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Placentalia contains the vast majority of extant mammals, which are partly distinguished from monotremes and marsupials in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother to a relatively late stage of development. The name is something of a misnomer, considering that marsupials also nourish their fetuses via a placenta, though for a relatively briefer period, giving birth to less-developed young, which are then nurtured for a period inside the mother's pouch. Placentalia represents the only living group within Eutheria, which contains all mammals that are more closely related to placentals than they are to marsupials.\nAnatomical features.\nPlacental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:\nSubdivisions.\nAnalysis of molecular data led to rapid changes in assessments of the phylogeny of placental orders at the close of the 20th century. A novel phylogeny and classification of placental orders appeared with Waddell, Hasegawa and Okada in 1999. \"Jumping genes\"-type retroposon presence/absence patterns have provided corroboration of phylogenetic relationships inferred from molecular sequences. It is now widely accepted that there are three major subdivisions or lineages of placental mammals: Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria. All of these diverged from common ancestors.\n2022 studies of Bertrand, O. C. and Sarah L. Shelley have identified palaeoryctids and taeniodonts as basal placental mammal clades.\nThe 19 living orders of Placentalia in the three groups are:\nThe exact relationships among these three lineages is currently a subject of debate, and four different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal or diverged first from other placentals. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra), Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria) and a hypothesis supporting a near simultaneous divergence. Estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups mostly range from 105 to 120 million years ago (MYA), depending on the type of DNA, whether it is translated, and the phylogenetic method (e.g. nuclear or mitochondrial), and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data. In addition, a strict molecular clock does not hold, so it is necessary to assume models of how evolutionary rates change along lineages. These assumptions alone can make substantial differences to the relative ages of different mammal groups estimated with genomic data.\nCladogram and classification based on Amrine-Madsen, H. \"et al\". (2003) and Asher, R. J. \"et al\". (2009) Compare with Waddell, Hasegawa and Okada (1999) and Waddell et al. (2001).\nGenomics.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the genome has been sequenced for at least one species in each extant placental order and in 83% of families (105 of 127 extant placental families).\nSee list of sequenced animal genomes.\nEvolutionary history.\nTrue placental mammals (the crown group including all modern placentals) arose from stem-group members of the clade Eutheria, which had existed since at least the Middle Jurassic epoch, about 170 mya. These early eutherians were small, nocturnal insect eaters, with adaptations for life in trees.\nTrue placentals may have originated in the Late Cretaceous around 90 mya, but the earliest undisputed fossils are dated to the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (K-Pg boundary). The genus \"Protungulatum\" is sometimes placed as a stem-ungulate, with probably the earliest known species \"P. coombsi\" from the strata within the Hell Creek Formation specifically dated to at least 300,000 years before the K-Pg boundary. The genus \"Purgatorius\", sometimes considered a stem-primate, appears no more than 300,000 years after the K-Pg boundary. One study has recovered both genera to be closely related and as stem-eutherians outside modern placental mammals, but others have recovered \"Protungulatum\" as a pan-euungulate based on phylogenetic analysis and inner ear anatomy different from non-placentals. The rapid appearance of placentals after the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous suggests that the group had already originated and undergone an initial diversification in the Late Cretaceous, as suggested by molecular clocks. The lineages leading to Xenarthra and Afrotheria probably originated around 90 mya, and Boreoeutheria underwent an initial diversification around 70-80 mya, producing the lineages that eventually would lead to modern primates, rodents, insectivores, artiodactyls, and carnivorans.\nHowever, modern members of the placental orders originated in the Paleogene around 66 to 23 mya, following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. The evolution of crown orders such modern primates, rodents, and carnivores appears to be part of an adaptive radiation that took place as mammals quickly evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were left open when most dinosaurs and other animals disappeared following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. As they occupied new niches, mammals rapidly increased in body size, and began to take over the large herbivore and large carnivore niches that had been left open by the decimation of the dinosaurs (and perhaps more relevantly competing synapsids). Mammals also exploited niches that the non-avian dinosaurs had never touched: for example, bats evolved flight and echolocation, allowing them to be highly effective nocturnal, aerial insectivores; and whales first occupied freshwater lakes and rivers and then moved into the oceans. Primates, meanwhile, acquired specialized grasping hands and feet which allowed them to grasp branches, and large eyes with keener vision which allowed them to forage in the dark.\nThe evolution of land placentals followed different pathways on different continents since they cannot easily cross large bodies of water. An exception is smaller placentals such as rodents and primates, who left Laurasia and colonized Africa and then South America via rafting.\nIn Africa, the Afrotheria underwent a major adaptive radiation, which led to elephants, elephant shrews, tenrecs, golden moles, aardvarks, and manatees. In South America a similar event occurred, with radiation of the Xenarthra, which led to modern sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, as well as the extinct ground sloths and glyptodonts. Expansion in Laurasia was dominated by Boreoeutheria, which includes primates and rodents, insectivores, carnivores, perissodactyls and artiodactyls. These groups expanded beyond a single continent when land bridges formed linking Africa to Eurasia and South America to North America.\nA study on eutherian diversity suggests that placental diversity was constrained during the Paleocene, while multituberculate mammals diversified; afterwards, multituberculates decline and placentals explode in diversity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67173", "revid": "33436705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67173", "title": "World Trade Center site", "text": "Grounds of the World Trade Center in New York City\nThe World Trade Center site, often referred to as \"Ground Zero\" or \"the Pile\" immediately after the September 11 attacks, is a 14.6-acre (5.9\u00a0ha) area in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The site is bounded by Vesey Street to the north, the West Side Highway to the west, Liberty Street to the south, and Church Street to the east. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) owns the site's land (except for 7 World Trade Center). The original World Trade Center complex stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks.\nThe Port Authority, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) have overseen the reconstruction of the site as part of the new World Trade Center, following a master plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind. Developer Larry Silverstein holds the lease to retail and office space in four of the site's buildings.\nBefore the World Trade Center.\nThe western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River, with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. On this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich Street and the former Dey Street, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, the \"Tyger\", burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of another ship from the eighteenth century were found in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about below the surface.\nThe area that was cleared for construction of the original World Trade Center complex was previously occupied by various electronics stores in what was called Radio Row. These streets and stores were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the World Trade Center.\nOriginal buildings.\nAt the time of their completion the \"Twin Towers\"\u2014the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at , and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower)\u2014were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1972 and 1987, with a construction cost of $400 million (equivalent to $ in 2024 dollars). The complex was located in New York City's Financial District and contained of office space.\nThe World Trade Center experienced a fire on February 13, 1975, a bombing on February 26, 1993 and a robbery on January 14, 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority decided to privatize the World Trade Center, leasing the buildings to a private company to manage, and awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties on July 24, 2001.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, Islamist terrorists affiliated with Al-Qaeda hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both of which were en route from Boston to Los Angeles, and intentionally crashed them into the two main towers of the World Trade Center. The towers collapsed less than two hours later. 2,606 people, including 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area died in the attacks, as well as 147 civilians and the 10 hijackers aboard the two airliners. After the collapse of the World Trade Center, hospital workers and law enforcement officers began referring to the World Trade Center site as \"Ground Zero\".\nDebris and clean-up.\nThe collapse of the towers spread dust across New York City and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. To organize the cleanup and search for survivors and for human remains, the New York City Fire Department divided the disaster site into four sectors, each headed by its own chief. Cleanup workers trucked most of the building materials and debris from Ground Zero to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. Some people, such as those affiliated with World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial, were worried that human remains might also have been inadvertently transported to the landfill.\nThousands of immigrant laborers, including many undocumented workers, were employed by contractors and subcontractors to help remove debris, clean surrounding buildings, and sort materials from the site. According to journalist Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, these workers often performed hazardous tasks without adequate protective equipment or health insurance. Many developed serious health problems related to dust and chemical exposure. Despite their contributions to the cleanup effort, undocumented workers have rarely been officially acknowledged or included in public commemorations of the recovery.\nAccording to NIST, when WTC 1 (the North Tower) collapsed, falling debris struck 7 World Trade Center and ignited fires on multiple floors. The uncontrolled fires ultimately led to the progressive collapse of the structure.\nShortly after the attacks, the surrounding buildings were fitted with red mesh to prevent further damage. In November 2001, the remaining portions of Building 4 were leveled.\nIn December 2001, a temporary viewing platform at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public. That month, the last standing perimeter columns from the North Tower and the last remaining portions of Building 6 were removed. Early estimates suggested that debris removal would take a year, but cleanup ended in May 2002, under budget and without a single serious injury. The Winter Garden Atrium was reopened to the public on September 17, 2002, the first major structure to be completely restored following the attacks.\nStarting March 11, 2002, eighty-eight searchlights were installed and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky. This was called the \"Tribute in Light\", and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the second anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then. In February 2005, the New York City Medical Examiner's office ended its process of identifying human remains at the site.\nIn August 2008, New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company. The beam, mounted atop a platform shaped like the Pentagon, was erected outside the Shanksville firehouse near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93.\nPortions of the South Tower had also damaged the nearby Deutsche Bank Building, which soon became filled with toxic dust. By 2002, Deutsche Bank determined that its building was unsalvageable and it was scheduled for demolition. In January 2011, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Building was completed.\nArchaeology.\nIn July 2010, a team of archaeologists at the site discovered the remains of a -long boat over 200 years old; it was probably made in the 18th century and dumped there along with wooden beams and trash in about 1810 to make up the land. The boat had been weighted to make it sink as part of foundations for a new pier. Samples of its wood have been taken for dendrochronology.\nOwnership status.\nWhile the PANYNJ is often identified as the owner of the WTC site, the ownership situation was complicated after the September 11 attacks. The Port Authority did own a \"significant\" internal portion of the site of but has acknowledged \"ambiguities over ownership of miscellaneous strips of property at the World Trade Center site\" going back to the 1960s. It was unclear who owned of the site comprising land where streets had been before the World Trade Center was built. In subsequent deals, the Port Authority gave some land to Larry Silverstein, including the land under 2 and 3 WTC in 2008.\nPlanning for the new World Trade Center.\nSoon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center site. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani proclaimed, \"We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again.\"\nIn a later address before Congress, the president declared, \"As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.\" The immediate response from World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein was that \"it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York. It would give the terrorists the victory they seek.\" However, by 2011, only one building, 7 World Trade Center, had been rebuilt. The buildings that have been rebuilt as of June 2018 include 7 World Trade Center, One World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, and 3 World Trade Center. The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished and five years from the beginning planning stages. However, given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts, they are often cited as an example of a successful public-private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations.\nEarly proposals for redesign.\nLower Manhattan Development Corporation.\nGovernor Pataki established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in November 2001, as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process. The LMDC coordinates federal assistance in the rebuilding process, and works with the PANYNJ, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind, the master plan architect for the site's redesign. The corporation also handles communication with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks. A 16-member board of directors, half appointed by the governor and half by the mayor of New York, governs the LMDC.\nThe LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owns most of the property and Larry Silverstein leased the World Trade Center's office space in July 2001. But the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.\nDirectly after the attacks.\nIn the months following the attacks, architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site. In January 2002, New York City art dealer Max Protetch solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his Chelsea art gallery.\nIn April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected Beyer Blinder Belle as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.\nOn July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site. All six designs were voted \"poor\" by the roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback, so the LDMC announced a new, international, open-design study.\n2002 World Trade Center site design competition.\nIn an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site. The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions \u2013 a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations \u2013 announced seven semifinalists. The following seven architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:\nPeterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist.\nThe seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.\nDays before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair John Whitehead to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists' designs. As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill as his master planner for the site.\nOn February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Vi\u00f1oly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, Roland Betts, a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision. On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.\nLibeskind's original proposal, which is titled Memory Foundations, underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, whom Silverstein hired. Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes. As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding. The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the \"swap\" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial. The \"swap\" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.\nCriticism of progress.\nAn episode of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center (previously known as the Freedom Tower)'s having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved. Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero \"is still a hole in the ground\". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: \"I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime\". However, it was noted that in early 2011, all five office towers of the World Trade Center had begun construction.\nThe social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th Floor, called Windows on the World, and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers. This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called \"Windows on the World Wine School\", run by wine personality Kevin Zraly. Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt, the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.\nNew structures.\nAs of September\u00a02023[ [update]], the current structures on the site include:\nTowers.\nOne World Trade Center (previously coined the \"Freedom Tower\" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Libeskind's design. The building rises to , the height of the original World Trade Center's North Tower, and its antenna rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill architect David Childs. Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design. The design was finalized in 2004, but was revised extensively after the NYPD raised security concerns, which delayed the start of the construction by two years. In 2006, the Port Authority took over from Silverstein Properties. The project's developer Tishman Construction Corporation was the construction manager at the time. Construction began in April 2006. Digging the foundation and installing tower-foundation steel columns, concrete, and rebar took twice as long as it normally would due to the existence of the subway line under West Broadway nearby. The building reached grade level by 2010, progressed at a pace of one floor a week, topped out in August 2012, and was structurally completed in May 2013. The building opened on November 3, 2014, and the first 170 employees of anchor tenant Conde Nast began their work there.\nDanish architect Bjarke Ingels designed Two World Trade Center, also known as 200 Greenwich Street. The building's gardens integrate Tribeca with the Financial District at the World Trade Center. As part of a 2010 lease deal to finance 4 WTC, there were plans to build 2 and 3 World Trade Center to ground level. Construction of everything up to street level was completed in mid-2013. The rest of the building, however, has yet to be built until tenants for Tower 2 can be found.\nRichard Rogers Partnership designed Three World Trade Center, or 175 Greenwich Street, which stands across Greenwich Street from the Memorial's two reflecting pools. Groundbreaking occurred in fall 2008, and in May 2009, the Port Authority proposed reducing the tower to four stories. In 2012, with Silverstein still unable to find tenants, construction on the above-ground levels was delayed indefinitely, with plans for only 7 stories. However, work progressed on below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium, which was completed by October 2013. Anchor tenant Group M was finally signed in late 2013, but finance negotiations between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority dragged, until an agreement was reached in June 2014. Construction resumed in August 2014, and the building opened on June 11, 2018.\nMaki and Associates designed Four World Trade Center, also known as 150 Greenwich Street. Construction started in 2008, and the steel skeleton was mostly complete by 2012. The building opened in November 2013, making it the second tower on the site to open behind 7 World Trade Center, as well as the first building on the Port Authority property. The first tenants to move in were two government agencies, and as of July 2015[ [update]], the building is 62% leased.\nFive World Trade Center was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will stand where the Deutsche Bank Building once stood. On June 22, 2007, the Port Authority announced that JP Morgan Chase will lease the 42-story building for its investment banking headquarters; however, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns had caused construction to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue. Construction began on September 9, 2011. Although the foundation was completed, construction on the main structure never commenced.\n7 World Trade Center stands off of Port Authority property. David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill designed the tower. Construction of the new 7 World Trade Center began in 2002 and the building opened on May 23, 2006, achieving LEED gold status and being the first tower in the complex to reopen. The building is 52 stories tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.\nMemorial and museum.\nConstruction of the memorial was completed by early 2011. The memorial opened on September 11, 2011, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the attacks. The museum was initially scheduled to open on September 11, 2012, one year after the opening of the memorial. However, construction was halted in December 2011 due to financial disputes between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Foundation, deciding on who should be responsible for infrastructure costs. Those disputes were resolved and construction resumed on September 10, 2012. Further delays were caused when Hurricane Sandy significantly damaged the site in November 2012. The museum was completed and opened to families of the victims on May 15, 2014 and opened to the general public on May 21, 2014.\nRetail space.\nIn early December 2013, Australian retail corporation Westfield announced that it will invest US$800 million for complete control of the retail space at the rebuilt center. Westfield purchased the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's 50 percent stake in the retail part of the World Trade Center site, increasing its total investment to more than US$1.4 billion.\nTransportation Hub.\nA temporary PATH station opened in 2003 and construction on the permanent station was supposed to begin in fall 2004; however, the NYPD raised security concerns on the entire site. Among the revisions effecting the Transportation Hub was doubling the number of support columns. In the original plan, the construction of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum was only supposed to have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof of the Transportation Hub provided the foundation on which the Memorial rested upon and the walls of the Museum. Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims' families to have the Memorial completed by the 10th anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the Memorial and holding off construction of the Transportation Hub, which increased costs. Construction finally began on the Transportation Hub in 2010. The hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.\nExclusive ZIP code.\nThe World Trade Center site used the ZIP code 10048 before the September 11 attacks, and there were eight letter carriers assigned to the buildings to deliver mail to the buildings' tenants. All of the Postal Service employees survived the attacks. In the months following the attacks, over 80,000 pieces of mail continued to arrive each day addressed to the World Trade Center, including some items loosely addressed to such recipients as \"The Search Dogs\" or \"The Rescuers\". By 2003, 3,600 items of mail per day were still being sent to 10048. These items were processed at the James A. Farley General Post Office, the main facility for New York City, located across from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. Mail there was held for pick-up by messenger, forwarded to the intended recipient, returned to its sender, or destroyed.\nFollowing the attacks, the United States Postal Service provided free mail-forwarding service to the WTC's former occupants for three years, rather than the usual one-year period. By the end of 2006, the number of items sent to 10048 had decreased to around 300 items daily, mostly sent from businesses and organizations that had not yet updated their bulk mailing lists.\nThe 90 Church Street Station Post Office building is located adjacent to the new World Trade Center and the PATH station, and serves the ZIP code of 10007, which is assigned to the surrounding Tribeca neighborhood. The new World Trade Center does not use the ZIP code 10048; rather, it has been integrated within the existing 10007 ZIP code.

{"id": "67179", "revid": "9161489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67179", "title": "Phil Katz", "text": "American software developer (1962\u20132000)\nPhillip Walter Katz (November 3, 1962\u00a0\u2013 April 14, 2000) was a computer programmer best known as the co-creator of the ZIP file format for data compression, and the author of PKZIP, a program for creating zip files that ran under DOS. \nA copyright lawsuit between System Enhancement Associates (SEA) and Katz's company, PKWARE, was widely publicized in the BBS community in the late 1980s. Katz's software business was very successful, but he struggled with social isolation and chronic alcoholism in the last years of his life.\nEducation and career.\nPhil Katz was a graduate of Nicolet High School in Glendale, Wisconsin. He graduated from the Computer Science Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee. After his graduation, he was hired by the Allen-Bradley company as a programmer. He wrote code to run programmable logic controllers, which operated manufacturing equipment on shop floors worldwide for Allen-Bradley's customers.\nPKARC and PKWARE.\nKatz left Allen-Bradley in 1986 to work for Graysoft, a Milwaukee-based software company. At the time, he had worked on an alternative to Thom Henderson's ARC, named PKARC. ARC was written in C, with the source code available on System Enhancement Associates' bulletin board system (BBS). PKARC, written partially in assembly language, was much faster. Katz had a special flair for optimizing code: besides writing critical code in assembly language, he would write C code to perform the same task in several different ways and then examine the compiler output to see which produced the most efficient assembly code. He first publicly released only PKXARC, an extraction program, as freeware. Its much greater speed caused it to spread very quickly throughout the BBS community. Strong positive feedback and encouragement prompted Katz to release his compression program, PKARC, and eventually to make his software shareware. He founded PKWARE, Inc. (Phil Katz Software) in 1986, with the company's operations located in his home in Glendale, Wisconsin, but he remained at Graysoft until 1987. Steve Burg, a former Graysoft programmer, joined PKWARE in 1988.\nPKZIP.\nPKZIP made Katz one of the most well-known shareware authors of all time. Although PKWARE became a multimillion-dollar company, Katz was more noted for his technical expertise than business prowess. His family assisted him in running the company, but he eventually fired them when they denied him access to the company's profits.\nKatz was adamantly opposed to Microsoft Windows in the early 1990s. This led to PKWARE missing out on the opportunity to be the first to bring PKZIP to the platform, with WinZip becoming the standard tool on the platform instead.\nLawsuits.\nIn the late 1980s, a dispute arose between System Enhancement Associates (SEA), maker of the ARC program, and PKWARE. SEA sued Katz for trademark and copyright infringement. The most substantial evidence at trial was from an independent software expert, John Navas, who was appointed by the court to compare the two programs. He stated that PKARC was a derivative work of ARC, pointing out that comments in both programs were often identical, including spelling errors.\nOn August 2, 1988, the plaintiff and defendants announced a settlement of the lawsuit, which included a confidential cross-license agreement. Under the agreement, SEA licensed PKWARE for all the ARC-compatible programs published by PKWARE during the period beginning with the first release of PKXARC in late 1985 through July 31, 1988, in return for an undisclosed payment. PKWARE agreed to pay SEA to obtain a license that allowed the distribution of PKWARE's ARC-compatible programs until January 31, 1989, after which PKWARE would not license, publish or distribute any ARC compatible programs or utilities that process ARC compatible files. In exchange, PKWARE licensed SEA to use its source code for PKWARE's ARC-compatible programs. PKWARE also agreed to cease any use of SEA's trademark \"ARC\" and to change the names or marks used with PKWARE's programs to non-confusing designations. The remaining details of the agreement were sealed. In reaching the settlement, the defendants did not admit any fault or wrongdoing. The Wisconsin court order showed the defendants were ordered to pay damages to the plaintiff for the defendants' acts. Namely, the defendants were found to be infringing the plaintiff's copyrights, infringing trademark, as well as performing acts of unfair trade practices and unfair competition.\nThe leaked agreement document revealed that under the settlement terms, the defendants had paid the plaintiff $22,500 for past royalty payments and $40,000 for expense reimbursements. In addition, the defendants would pay the plaintiff a royalty fee of 6.5% of all revenue received for ARC compatible programs on all orders received after the effective date of the agreement. Such revenue would include any license fees or shareware registrations, received after the expiration of the license, for ARC compatible programs. In exchange, the plaintiff would also pay a commission in the amount of 6.5% of any license fees received by the plaintiff from any licensee referred to the plaintiff by the defendants, whether before or after the license termination date.\nAfter the lawsuit, PKWARE released one last version of its PKARC and PKXARC utilities under the new names \"PKPAK\" and \"PKUNPAK\", and from then on concentrated on developing the separate programs PKZIP and PKUNZIP, which were based on new and different file compression techniques. However, following the renaming, SEA filed a lawsuit against PKWARE for contempt, for continually using the plaintiff's protected mark \"ARC\" by turning ARC from noun into verb in the PKPAK manual. The United States district court of the East District of Wisconsin ruled SEA's motion was denied, and the defendant was entitled to recover the legal cost of $500.\nThe SEA vs. PKWARE dispute quickly expanded into one of the largest controversies the BBS world had ever seen. The suit by SEA angered many shareware users who perceived that SEA was a \"large, faceless corporation\" and Katz was \"the little guy\". In fact, at the time, both SEA and PKWARE were small home-based companies. However, the community largely sided with Katz, because SEA was attempting to retroactively declare the ARC file format to be closed and proprietary. Katz received positive publicity by releasing the APPNOTE.TXT specification, documenting the Zip file format, and declaring that the Zip file format would always be free for competing software to implement. The net result was that the ARC format quickly dropped out of common use as the predominant compression format that bulletin board systems used for their file archives, and after a brief period of competing formats, the Zip format was adopted as the predominant standard.\nAlcoholism and death.\nKatz battled alcoholism for years. The earliest known arrest occurred in 1991. About a year later, Katz was again convicted of drunk driving. Between 1994 and September 1999, Katz was arrested five times for operating after suspension or revocation of his driver's license.\nBefore his death, Ozaukee County Sheriff's Department had several outstanding warrants against Katz, including jumping bail and the charges of operating an automobile while intoxicated and operating after revocation.\nOn April 14, 2000, at the age of 37, Katz was found dead in a hotel room with an empty bottle of peppermint schnapps in his hand. A coroner's report stated his death was a result of acute pancreatic bleeding caused by chronic alcoholism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its primary functions are the production of sperm and the secretion of androgens, primarily testosterone.\nThe release of testosterone is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Sperm production is controlled by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland and by testosterone produced within the gonads.\nStructure.\nAppearance.\nMale humans have two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall. Scrotal asymmetry, in which one testicle extends farther down into the scrotum than the other, is common. This is because of the differences in the vasculature's anatomy. For 85% of men, the right testis hangs lower than the left one.\nMeasurement and volume.\nThe volume of the testicle can be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids (an orchidometer) of known sizes. Another method is to use calipers, a ruler, or an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes (length, depth and width). These measurements can then be used to calculate the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: \nformula_1\nformula_2\nHowever, the most accurate calculation of actual testicular volume is gained from the formula:\nformula_3\nAn average adult testicle measures up to . The Tanner scale, which is used to assess the maturity of the male genitalia, assigns a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less than 1.5\u00a0cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20\u00a0cm3. Normal volume is 15 to 25\u00a0cm3; the average is 18\u00a0cm3 per testis (range 12\u201330\u00a0cm3).\nThe number of spermatozoa an adult human male produces is directly proportional to testicular volume, as larger testicles contain more seminiferous tubules and Sertoli cells as a result. As such, men with larger testicles produce on average more sperm cells in each ejaculate, as testicular volume is positively correlated with semen profiles.\nInternal structure.\nDuct system.\nThe testes are covered by a tough fibrous shell called the tunica albuginea. Under the tunica albuginea, the testes contain very fine-coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. The tubules are lined with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly created sperm cells mature (spermatogenesis). The sperm move into the vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.\nPrimary cell types.\nWithin the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa through the process of spermatogenesis. The gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum. Sertoli cells\u00a0\u2013 the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support of germ cell development into spermatozoa. Sertoli cells secrete inhibin. Peritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.\nBetween tubules (interstitial cells) exist Leydig cells\u00a0\u2013 cells localized between seminiferous tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for puberty (including secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair), sexual behavior, and libido. Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis. Testosterone controls testicular volume.\nImmature Leydig cells and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.\nBlood supply and lymphatic drainage.\nThe testis has three sources of arterial blood supply: the testicular artery, the cremasteric artery, and the artery to the ductus deferens. Blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the testes and scrotum are distinct:\nLayers.\nMany anatomical features of the adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. The layers of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior abdominal wall. The cremasteric muscle arises from the internal oblique muscle.\nThe blood\u2013testis barrier.\nLarge molecules cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia occupy the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the more mature forms, such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, occupy the adluminal compartment.\nThe function of the blood\u2013testis barrier may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. Mature sperm (and their antigens) emerge significantly after immune tolerance is set in infancy. Since sperm are antigenically different from self-tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. The male can make antibodies against them.\nInjection of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and reduced fertility. The blood\u2013testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response.\nTemperature regulation and responses.\nCarl Richard Moore in 1926 proposed that testicles were external due to spermatogenesis being enhanced at temperatures slightly less than core body temperature outside the body. The spermatogenesis is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33\u00a0\u00b0C. Because the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can move them closer or further away from the body. The temperature of the testes is maintained at 34.4\u00a0\u00b0C, a little below body temperature, as temperatures above 36.7\u00a0\u00b0C impede spermatogenesis. There are a number of mechanisms to maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.\nThe cremasteric muscle covers the testicles and the spermatic cord. When this muscle contracts, the cord shortens and the testicles move closer up toward the body, which provides slightly more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. When cooling is required, the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicles lower away from the warm body and are able to cool. Contraction also occurs in response to physical stress, such as blunt trauma; the testicles withdraw and the scrotum shrinks very close to the body in an effort to protect them.\nThe cremasteric reflex will reflexively raise the testicles. The testicles can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially activates related muscles.\nGene and protein expression.\nThe human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these genes are expressed in adult testes. The testes have the highest fraction of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues. About 1000 of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated pattern of expression. A majority of these genes encode for proteins that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to spermatogenesis. Sperm cells express proteins that result in the development of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining the fallopian tube and cause the development of cilia. Sperm cell flagella and fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. The testis-specific proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.\nDevelopment.\nThere are two phases in which the testes grow substantially. These are the embryonic and pubertal phases.\nDuring mammalian development, the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the gonadal rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. At about week 6, sex cords develop within the forming testes. These are made up of early Sertoli cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly before sex determination begins. In males, the sex-specific gene SRY that is found on the Y chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation of sex-determining factors (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which lead to development of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential gonad toward the male path of development.\nTestes follow the path of descent, from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the inguinal canal and into the scrotum. In most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm), both testes have descended by birth. In most other cases, only one testis fails to descend. This is called cryptorchidism. In most cases of cryptorchidism, the issue will mostly resolve itself within the first half year of life. However, if the testes do not descend far enough into the scrotum, surgical anchoring in the scrotum is required due to risks of infertility and testicular cancer.\nThe testes grow in response to the start of spermatogenesis. Size depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid production. The testicles are fully descended before the male reaches puberty.\nClinical significance.\nDiseases and conditions.\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nTesticular prostheses are available to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. There have also been some instances of their implantation in dogs.\nScientists are working on developing lab-grown testicles that might help infertile men in the future.\nEffects of exogenous hormones.\nTo some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. Short of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered steroidal hormones. Steroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.\nStimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge their size. Testes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy or through chemical castration.\nIn all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds with a loss of spermatogenesis.\nSociety and culture.\nThe testicles of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. Testicles are a by-product of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they might have been a late-spring seasonal specialty. In modern times, they are generally frozen and available year-round.\nIn the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes had their left testicle removed. This was because people believed that the right testicle made \"boy\" sperm and the left made \"girl\" sperm. As early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle in men wishing to have boys.\nEtymology and slang.\nOne theory about the etymology of the word \"testis\" is based on Roman law. The original Latin word 'witness', was used in the firmly established legal principle \"\" (one witness [equals] no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. This led to the common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. Since such witnesses always came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive ().\nAnother theory says that \"testis\" is influenced by a loan translation, from Greek 'defender (in law), supporter' that is \"two glands side by side\".\nThere are multiple slang terms for the testes. They may be referred to as \"balls\". Frequently, \"nuts\" (sometimes intentionally misspelled as \"nutz\") are also a slang term for the testes due to the geometric resemblance. One variant of the term includes \"Deez Nuts\", which was used for a satirical political candidate in 2016.\nIn Spanish, the slang term is used, which is Spanish for eggs which typically refers to unfertilized chicken eggs. Note that this is a non-sequitur or false analogy. The male gonad in mammals produces sperm (which transport male gametes to an egg). The male gonad does not produce the female gametes found in eggs. Perhaps the word is used as slang for male testes because the body of each epididymus within the scrotum has an overall shape similar to that of a common bird egg.\nOther animals.\nExternal appearance.\nIn seasonal breeders, the weight of the testes often increases during the breeding season. The testicles of a dromedary camel are long, deep and in width. The right testicle is often smaller than the left.\nIn sharks, the testicle on the right side is usually larger. In many bird and mammal species, the left may be larger. Fish usually have two testes of a similar size. The primitive jawless fish have only a single testis, located in the midline of the body, although this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.\nLocation.\nInternal.\nThe basal condition for mammals is to have internal testes. The testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and afrotherians remain within the abdomen (testicondy). There are also some marsupials with external testes and boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. Cetaceans such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. As external testes would increase drag in the water, they have internal testes, which are kept cool by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin. In odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though otariids have scrotal testes.\nExternal.\nBoreoeutherian land mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes. Their testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature. Their testes are located outside of the body and are suspended by the spermatic cord within the scrotum.\nThere are several hypotheses as to why most boreotherian mammals have external testes that operate best at a temperature that is slightly less than the core body temperature. One view is that it is stuck with enzymes evolved in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons. Another view is that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.\nThe classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. There are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that are as efficient as the ones evolved.\nEarly mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body. However, boreotherian mammals may have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them cool. One argument is that mammals with internal testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses, have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.\nResearchers have wondered why birds, despite having very high core body temperatures, have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. It was once theorized that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.\nSome mammals with seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until the breeding season. After that, their testes descend and increase in size and become external.\nThe ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals may have been a small mammal that required very large testes for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the body. This might have led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum that is slightly less than core body temperature. When the boreoeutherian mammals diversified into forms that were larger or did not require intense sperm competition, they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures and had to keep their testes outside the body. This position is made less parsimonious because the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has external testicles. Separately from boreotherian mammals, the ancestors of kangaroos might have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed external testes; however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\nOne argument for the evolution of external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure changes caused by jumping and galloping.\nMild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility and abnormal embryonic development in mice. DNA strand breaks were found in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40\u00a0\u00b0C or 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes. These findings suggest that the external location of the testicles provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.\nSize.\nThe relative size of the testes is often influenced by mating systems. Testicular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. In the mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). Production of testicular output sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic competition for survival. The testes of the right whale are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb).\nAmong the Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). Chimpanzees have high promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). Human testicular size falls between these extremes (0.08%).\nTestis weight also varies in seasonal breeders like red foxes, golden jackals, and coyotes.\nInternal structure.\nAmphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called \"sperm ampullae\". These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates, including the same range of cell types.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Desegregation is typically measured by the index of dissimilarity, allowing researchers to determine whether desegregation efforts are having impact on the settlement patterns of various groups. This is most commonly used in reference to the United States. Desegregation was long a focus of the American civil rights movement, both before and after the US Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", particularly desegregation of the school systems and the military. Racial integration of society was a closely related goal.\nUS military.\nEarly history.\nStarting with King Philip's War in the 17th century, Black and White Americans served together in an integrated environment in the Thirteen Colonies. They continued to fight alongside each other in every American war until the War of 1812. Black people would not fight in integrated units again until the Korean War. Thousands of Black men fought in the new continental navy, on the side of rebellious colonists in the American revolutionary war. Their names, accomplishments and total numbers are unknown due to poor record keeping. \nDuring the American Civil War, Black people enlisted in large numbers. They were mostly enslaved African Americans who had escaped the South, though there were many Northern Black unionists as well. More than 180,000 Black people served with the Union army and navy during the civil war in segregated units, known as the United States Colored Troops, under the command of White officers. They were recorded and are part of the National Park Service's Civil War Soldiers &amp; Sailors System (CWSS). Around 18,000 Black people also joined the Union Navy as sailors, who are also part of the CWSS.\nWorld Wars I and II.\nDespite the NAACP lobbying for the commissioning of more Black officers, they were severely underrepresented throughout World War I. Upon entering office, President Woodrow Wilson officially segregated the United States navy for the first time in its history.\nDuring World War II, most officers were White, and the majority of Black troops still served as truck drivers and as stevedores. The Red Ball Express, which was instrumental in facilitating the rapid advance of allied forces across France after D-Day, was operated almost exclusively by African American truck drivers. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing military units, all of which were entirely white in composition. Thus, he made the decision to allow African American soldiers to join White military units in combat for the first time; this represented the first step toward a desegregated United States military. Eisenhower's decision in this case was strongly opposed by his own army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, who was outraged by the decision, and said that the American public would take offense with the integration of the military units.\nFor the US Army air corps, see the Tuskegee Airmen.\nFor the US Army, see the 761st Tank Battalion (United States).\nIn the Second World War, the US Navy first experimented with integration aboard USCGC \"Sea Cloud\", then later on , (both commanded by Carlton Skinner) a ship with Black crew members and commanded by White officers. Some called it \"Eleanor's folly\" after President Franklin Roosevelt's wife. \"Mason\"'s purpose had been to allow Black sailors to serve in the full range of billets (positions) rather than being restricted to stewards and mess men, as they were on most ships. The navy was pressured to train Black sailors for billets by Eleanor Roosevelt, who insisted that they be given the jobs for which they had trained.\nThe US Navy's newest component, the Seabees, had the same ingrained attitudes and approaches but ended up at the forefront of change. In February 1942, the CNO, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, recommended African Americans for ratings in the construction trades. In April, the navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, those men were put into segregated units, the 34th and 80th Naval Construction Battalions (NCBs). Both had White southern officers and Black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with this arrangement, which led to the replacement of the officers. In addition, many of the stevedore battalions (special construction battalions) were segregated. However, by war's end, many of those special construction battalions were the first fully integrated units in the US navy. The war's end also brought the decommissioning of every one of those units.\nModern history.\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 ordered the integration of the armed forces following World War II, a major advance in civil rights. Using the executive order meant that Truman could bypass Congress. Representatives of the Solid South, all White Democrats, would likely have stonewalled related legislation.\nFor instance, two months prior to Truman's executive order in May 1948, Richard B. Russell, Democratic senator from Georgia, unsuccessfully attempted to attach a \"Freedom of Selection\" amendment granting draftees and new inductees the opportunity to choose whether or not they wanted to serve in segregated military units to the Selective Service Act that was being debated in Congress.\nOn 12 October 1972, a racially fraught riot occurred on . \"Despite the presence of a Black executive officer, the ship's second-in-command, many Black sailors felt they were dealt harsher punishments and menial assignments because of their race\".\nUS housing.\nThe practice of housing segregation and racial discrimination has had a long history in the United States. Until the American civil rights movement in the 1960s, segregated neighborhoods were enforceable by law. The Fair Housing Act ended discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. This was the first housing law against discrimination. The passage of this act was contentious. It was meant to be a direct follow up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, from 1966 to 1967, it failed to garner enough political support for its passage in the United States Congress. At that time, several states had passed their own fair housing laws and Congress was not convinced that a federal law was necessary.\nIt was only after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on 4 April 1968 and the ensuing riots that the bill was finally passed. It was signed into law on 11 April 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a strong proponent. Johnson called the new law one of the \"promises of a century \u2026 It proclaims that fair housing for all \u2014 all human beings who live in this country \u2014 is now a part of the American way of life.\" Since the act's passage in 1968, it has been amended to include sex, familial status, and disability. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity within the US Department of Housing and Urban Development is charged with administering and enforcing this law.\nUS education system.\nAfter \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), the lawful segregation of African American children in schools became a violation of the 14th Amendment. In \"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education\" (1971), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that forced busing of students may be ordered to achieve racial desegregation. However, court-enforced school desegregation efforts have decreased over time.\nA major decline in manufacturing in northern cities, with a shift of jobs to suburbs, the South, and overseas, has led to increases in the numbers of residents of all races in suburbs, and shifts in population from the North and Great Plains to the southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the South. Left behind in many northeastern and midwestern inner cities have been the poorest Black people and other minorities. According to Jonathan Kozol, in the early 21st century, US schools have become as segregated as they were in the late 1960s.\nThe Civil Rights Project at Harvard University says that desegregation of US public schools peaked in 1988. As of 2005, the proportion of Black students at schools with a White majority was at \"a level lower than in any year since 1968\".\nSome critics of school desegregation have argued that court-enforced desegregation efforts of the 1960s were either unnecessary or self-defeating, ultimately resulting in White flight from cities to suburbs. Middle class and wealthy White people continued moving from cities to suburbs during the 1970s and later, in part to escape certain integrated public school systems, but also as part of the suburbanization caused by movement of jobs to suburbs, continuing state and federal support for expansion of highways, and changes in the economy.\nSome White parents in Louisiana said that they were afraid to drop off their children because of all the mobs surrounding the desegregated schools.\nSociologist David Armor states in his 1995 book \"Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law\" that efforts to change the racial compositions of schools had not contributed substantially to academic achievement by minorities. Carl L. Bankston and Stephen J. Caldas, in their books \"A Troubled Dream: The Promise and Failure of School Desegregation in Louisiana\" (2002) and \"Forced to Fail: The Paradox of School Desegregation\" (2005), argued that continuing racial inequality in the larger American society had undermined efforts to force schools to desegregate. They maintained that racial inequality had resulted in popular associations between school achievement and race. Therefore, the achievement levels of American schools were generally associated with their class and racial compositions. This meant that even parents without racial prejudice tended to seek middle class or better residential neighborhoods in seeking the best schools for their children. As a result, efforts to impose court-ordered desegregation often led to school districts with too few White students for effective desegregation, as White students increasingly left for majority White suburban districts or for private schools.\nAsian Americans.\nThe increasing diversity of American society has led to more complex issues related to school and ethnic proportion. In the 1994 federal court case \"Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District\", parents of Chinese American schoolchildren alleged that racial quotas under a 1983 consent decree constituted racial discrimination in violation of the United States Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The desegregation plan did not allow any school to enroll more than 50% of any ethnic group. Originally intended to aid integration of Black students, the ruling had a negative effect on the admissions of Chinese Americans, who had become the district's largest ethnic group.\nThe newspaper \"AsianWeek\" documented the Chinese American parents' challenge. Since Chinese Americans were already nearly half the student population, the consent decree had the effect of requiring the competitive Lowell High School in San Francisco, California, to apply much higher academic admission standards for Chinese American students. However, the civil rights group Chinese for Affirmative Action sided with the school district, arguing that such standards were not harmful to Chinese Americans, and were necessary to avoid the resegregation of schools. In 2006, Chinese parents continued to protest against race-based school assignments.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The genus name comes from Ancient Greek \u1f44\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2 (\"\u00f3phis\"), meaning \"snake\", and \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 (\"gl\u00f4ssa\"), meaning \"tongue\". Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats.\nThe genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist \"Sterkiella histriomuscorum\".\nDescription.\nAdders-tongues are so-called because the spore-bearing stalk is thought to resemble a snake's tongue. Each plant typically sends up a small, undivided leaf blade with netted venation, and the spore stalk forks from the leaf stalk, terminating in sporangia which are partially concealed within a structure with slit sides.\nWhen the leaf blade is present, there is not always a spore stalk present, and the plants do not always send up a leaf, sometimes going for a year to a period of years living only under the soil, nourished by association with soil fungi.\nThe plant grows from a central, budding, fleshy structure with fleshy, radiating roots.\n\"Ophioglossum malviae\" is known as the world's smallest terrestrial fern.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Ophioglossum\" has a high chromosome count in comparison to other species, with 120 or up to 720 chromosomes possible in intervals of 120 due to polyploidy (multiple possible copies of chromosomes). It has almost 1260 number of chromosomes in the meiocyte (spore mother cell) which undergo meiosis, the reduction division to form the spore with only one set of chromosomes getting incorporated into each spore. The species \"Ophioglossum reticulatum\" has the highest number of chromosomes found in any multicellular organism.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Smith et al. classification of 2006, based on molecular phylogeny, placed \"Ophioglossum\" in Ophioglossaceae. Subsequent classifications have maintained this placement. Circumscriptions of the genus vary. The Christenhusz and Chase classification of 2014 includes \"Cheiroglossa\" and \"Ophioderma\" within \"Ophioglossum\". This circumscription corresponds to subfamily Ophioglossoideae in the PPG I classification, which recognizes \"Cheiroglossa\", \"Ophioderma\", and \"Rhizoglossum\" as separate genera. More recently, it has been proposed to subdivide \"Ophioglossum\" more narrowly, removing a number of species into the new genera \"Goswamia\", \"Haukia\", and \"Whittieria\".\nPhylogeny.\nPhylogeny of \"Ophioglossum\"\nUnassigned species:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpecies that may be placed in this genus include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6, meaning that the 1s, 2s, and 2p subshells are occupied by two, two, and six electrons, respectively.\nElectronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by the nuclei and all the other electrons. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions.\nAccording to the laws of quantum mechanics, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration. In certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.\nKnowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements, for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together, and in understanding the chemical formulas of compounds and the geometries of molecules. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.\nShells and subshells.\nElectron configuration was first conceived under the Bohr model of the atom, and it is still common to speak of shells and subshells despite the advances in understanding of the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons.\nAn electron shell is the set of allowed states that share the same principal quantum number, \"n\", that electrons may occupy. In each term of an electron configuration, \"n\" is the positive integer that precedes each orbital letter (e.g. helium's electron configuration is 1s2, therefore \"n\" = 1, and the orbital contains two electrons). An atom's \"n\"th electron shell can accommodate 2\"n\"2 electrons. For example, the first shell can accommodate two\u00a0electrons, the second shell eight\u00a0electrons, the third shell eighteen, and so on. The factor of two arises because the number of allowed states doubles with each successive shell due to electron spin\u2014each atomic orbital admits up to two otherwise identical electrons with opposite spin, one with a spin +&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 (usually denoted by an up-arrow) and one with a spin of \u2212&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 (with a down-arrow).\nA subshell is the set of states defined by a common azimuthal quantum number, l, within a shell. The value of l is in the range from 0 to \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. The values l\u00a0= 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to the s, p, d, and f labels, respectively. For example, the 3d subshell has \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a03 and l\u00a0=\u00a02. The maximum number of electrons that can be placed in a subshell is given by 2(2l + 1). This gives two electrons in an s\u00a0subshell, six electrons in a p\u00a0subshell, and ten electrons in a d\u00a0subshell.\nThe numbers of electrons that can occupy each shell and each subshell arise from the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same values of the four quantum numbers.\nExhaustive technical details about the complete quantum mechanical theory of atomic spectra and structure can be found and studied in the basic book of Robert D. Cowan.\nNotation.\nPhysicists and chemists use a standard notation to indicate the electron configurations of atoms and molecules. For atoms, the notation consists of a sequence of atomic subshell labels (e.g. for phosphorus the sequence 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p) with the number of electrons assigned to each subshell placed as a superscript. For example, hydrogen has one electron in the s-orbital of the first shell, so its configuration is written 1s1. Lithium has two electrons in the 1s-subshell and one in the (higher-energy) 2s-subshell, so its configuration is written 1s2\u00a02s1 (pronounced \"one-s-two, two-s-one\"). Phosphorus (atomic number 15) is as follows: 1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p6\u00a03s2\u00a03p3.\nFor atoms with many electrons, this notation can become lengthy and so an abbreviated notation is used. The electron configuration can be visualized as the core electrons, equivalent to the noble gas of the preceding period, and the valence electrons: each element in a period differs only by the last few subshells. Phosphorus, for instance, is in the third period. It differs from the second-period neon, whose configuration is 1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p6, only by the presence of a third shell. The portion of its configuration that is equivalent to neon is abbreviated as [Ne], allowing the configuration of phosphorus to be written as [Ne]\u00a03s2\u00a03p3 rather than writing out the details of the configuration of neon explicitly. This convention is useful as it is the electrons in the outermost shell that most determine the chemistry of the element.\nFor a given configuration, the order of writing the orbitals is not completely fixed since only the orbital occupancies have physical significance. For example, the electron configuration of the titanium ground state can be written as either [Ar]\u00a04s2\u00a03d2 or [Ar]\u00a03d2\u00a04s2. The first notation follows the order based on the Madelung rule for the configurations of neutral atoms; 4s is filled before 3d in the sequence Ar, K, Ca, Sc, Ti. The second notation groups all orbitals with the same value of \"n\" together, corresponding to the \"spectroscopic\" order of orbital energies that is the reverse of the order in which electrons are removed from a given atom to form positive ions; 3d is filled before 4s in the sequence Ti4+, Ti3+, Ti2+, Ti+, Ti.\nThe superscript 1 for a singly occupied subshell is not compulsory; for example aluminium may be written as either [Ne]\u00a03s2\u00a03p1 or [Ne]\u00a03s2\u00a03p. In atoms where a subshell is unoccupied despite higher subshells being occupied (as is the case in some ions, as well as certain neutral atoms shown to deviate from the Madelung rule), the empty subshell is either denoted with a superscript 0 or left out altogether. For example, neutral palladium may be written as either [Kr] 4d10 5s0 or simply [Kr] 4d10, and the lanthanum(III) ion may be written as either [Xe] 4f0 or simply [Xe].\nIt is quite common to see the letters of the orbital labels (s, p, d, f) written in an italic or slanting typeface, although the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends a normal typeface (as used here). The choice of letters originates from a now-obsolete system of categorizing spectral lines as \"sharp\", \"principal\", \"diffuse\" and \"fundamental\" (or \"fine\"), based on their observed fine structure: their modern usage indicates orbitals with an azimuthal quantum number, l, of 0, 1, 2 or 3 respectively. After f, the sequence continues alphabetically g, h, i... (l\u00a0= 4, 5, 6...), skipping j, although orbitals of these types are rarely required.\nThe electron configurations of molecules are written in a similar way, except that molecular orbital labels are used instead of atomic orbital labels (see below).\nEnergy of ground state and excited states.\nThe energy associated to an electron is that of its orbital. The energy of a configuration is often approximated as the sum of the energy of each electron, neglecting the electron-electron interactions. The configuration that corresponds to the lowest electronic energy is called the ground state. Any other configuration is an excited state.\nAs an example, the ground state configuration of the sodium atom is 1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p6\u00a03s1, as deduced from the Aufbau principle (see below). The first excited state is obtained by promoting a 3s electron to the 3p subshell, to obtain the\n1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p6\u00a03p1 configuration, abbreviated as the 3p level. Atoms can move from one configuration to another by absorbing or emitting energy. In a sodium-vapor lamp for example, sodium atoms are excited to the 3p level by an electrical discharge, and return to the ground state by emitting yellow light of wavelength 589\u00a0nm.\nUsually, the excitation of valence electrons (such as 3s for sodium) involves energies corresponding to photons of visible or ultraviolet light. The excitation of core electrons is possible, but requires much higher energies, generally corresponding to X-ray photons. This would be the case for example to excite a 2p electron of sodium to the 3s level and form the excited 1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p5\u00a03s2 configuration.\nThe remainder of this article deals only with the ground-state configuration, often referred to as \"the\" configuration of an atom or molecule.\nHistory.\nIrving Langmuir was the first to propose in his 1919 article \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\" in which, building on Gilbert N. Lewis's cubical atom theory and Walther Kossel's chemical bonding theory, he outlined his \"concentric theory of atomic structure\". Langmuir had developed his work on electron atomic structure from other chemists as is shown in the development of the History of the periodic table and the Octet rule.\nNiels Bohr (1923) incorporated Langmuir's model that the periodicity in the properties of the elements might be explained by the electronic structure of the atom. His proposals were based on the then current Bohr model of the atom, in which the electron shells were orbits at a fixed distance from the nucleus. Bohr's original configurations would seem strange to a present-day chemist: sulfur was given as 2.4.4.6 instead of 1s2\u00a02s2\u00a02p6\u00a03s2\u00a03p4 (2.8.6). Bohr used 4 and 6 following Alfred Werner's 1893 paper. In fact, the chemists accepted the concept of atoms long before the physicists. Langmuir began his paper referenced above by saying,\u00ab\u2026The problem of the structure of atoms has been attacked mainly by physicists who have given little consideration to the chemical properties which must ultimately be explained by a theory of atomic structure. The vast store of knowledge of chemical properties and relationships, such as is summarized by the Periodic Table, should serve as a better foundation for a theory of atomic structure than the relatively meager experimental data along purely physical lines... These electrons arrange themselves in a series of concentric shells, the first shell containing two electrons, while all other shells tend to hold eight.\u2026\u00bbThe valence electrons in the atom were described by Richard Abegg in 1904.\nIn 1924, E.\u00a0C.\u00a0Stoner incorporated Sommerfeld's third quantum number into the description of electron shells, and correctly predicted the shell structure of sulfur to be 2.8.6. However neither Bohr's system nor Stoner's could correctly describe the changes in atomic spectra in a magnetic field (the Zeeman effect).\nBohr was well aware of this shortcoming (and others), and had written to his friend Wolfgang Pauli in 1923 to ask for his help in saving quantum theory (the system now known as \"old quantum theory\"). Pauli hypothesized successfully that the Zeeman effect can be explained as depending only on the response of the outermost (i.e., valence) electrons of the atom. Pauli was able to reproduce Stoner's shell structure, but with the correct structure of subshells, by his inclusion of a fourth quantum number and his exclusion principle (1925):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It should be forbidden for more than one electron with the same value of the main quantum number \"n\" to have the same value for the other three quantum numbers \"k\" [l], \"j\" [\"ml\"] and \"m\" [\"ms\"].\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation, published in 1926, gave three of the four quantum numbers as a direct consequence of its solution for the hydrogen atom: this solution yields the atomic orbitals that are shown today in textbooks of chemistry (and above). The examination of atomic spectra allowed the electron configurations of atoms to be determined experimentally, and led to an empirical rule (known as Madelung's rule (1936), see below) for the order in which atomic orbitals are filled with electrons.\nAtoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule.\nThe aufbau principle (from the German \"Aufbau\", \"building up, construction\") was an important part of Bohr's original concept of electron configuration. It may be stated as:\n\"a maximum of two electrons are put into orbitals in the order of increasing orbital energy: the lowest-energy subshells are filled before electrons are placed in higher-energy orbitals.\"\nThe principle works very well (for the ground states of the atoms) for the known 118\u00a0elements, although it is sometimes slightly wrong. The modern form of the aufbau principle describes an order of orbital energies given by Madelung's rule (or Klechkowski's rule). This rule was first stated by Charles Janet in 1929, rediscovered by Erwin Madelung in 1936, and later given a theoretical justification by V. M. Klechkowski:\nThis gives the following order for filling the orbitals:\n1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, (8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p, and 9s)\nIn this list the subshells in parentheses are not occupied in the ground state of the heaviest atom now known (Og, \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a0118).\nThe aufbau principle can be applied, in a modified form, to the protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus, as in the shell model of nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry.\nPeriodic table.\nThe form of the periodic table is closely related to the atomic electron configuration for each element. For example, all the elements of group 2 (the table's second column) have an electron configuration of [E]\u00a0\"n\"s2 (where [E] is a noble gas configuration), and have notable similarities in their chemical properties. The periodicity of the periodic table in terms of periodic table blocks is due to the number of electrons (2, 6, 10, and 14) needed to fill s, p, d, and f subshells. These blocks appear as the rectangular sections of the periodic table. The single exception is helium, which despite being an s-block atom is conventionally placed with the other noble gasses in the p-block due to its chemical inertness, a consequence of its full outer shell (though there is discussion in the contemporary literature on whether this exception should be retained).\nThe electrons in the valence (outermost) shell largely determine each element's chemical properties. The similarities in the chemical properties were remarked on more than a century before the idea of electron configuration.\nShortcomings of the aufbau principle.\nThe aufbau principle rests on a fundamental postulate that the order of orbital energies is fixed, both for a given element and between different elements; in both cases this is only approximately true. It considers atomic orbitals as \"boxes\" of fixed energy into which can be placed two electrons and no more. However, the energy of an electron \"in\" an atomic orbital depends on the energies of all the other electrons of the atom (or ion, or molecule, etc.). There are no \"one-electron solutions\" for systems of more than one electron, only a set of many-electron solutions that cannot be calculated exactly (although there are mathematical approximations available, such as the Hartree\u2013Fock method).\nThe fact that the aufbau principle is based on an approximation can be seen from the fact that there is an almost-fixed filling order at all, that, within a given shell, the s-orbital is always filled before the p-orbitals. In a hydrogen-like atom, which only has one electron, the s-orbital and the p-orbitals of the same shell have exactly the same energy, to a very good approximation in the absence of external electromagnetic fields. (However, in a real hydrogen atom, the energy levels are slightly split by the magnetic field of the nucleus, and by the quantum electrodynamic effects of the Lamb shift.)\nIonization of the transition metals.\nThe na\u00efve application of the aufbau principle leads to a well-known paradox (or apparent paradox) in the basic chemistry of the transition metals. Potassium and calcium appear in the periodic table before the transition metals, and have electron configurations [Ar]\u00a04s1 and [Ar]\u00a04s2 respectively, i.e. the 4s-orbital is filled before the 3d-orbital. This is in line with Madelung's rule, as the 4s-orbital has \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a0l\u00a0=\u00a04 (\"n\"\u00a0=\u00a04, l\u00a0=\u00a00) while the 3d-orbital has \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a0l\u00a0=\u00a05 (\"n\"\u00a0=\u00a03, l\u00a0=\u00a02). After calcium, most neutral atoms in the first series of transition metals (scandium through zinc) have configurations with two 4s electrons, but there are two exceptions. Chromium and copper have electron configurations [Ar]\u00a03d5\u00a04s1 and [Ar]\u00a03d10\u00a04s1 respectively, i.e. one electron has passed from the 4s-orbital to a 3d-orbital to generate a half-filled or filled subshell. In this case, the usual explanation is that \"half-filled or completely filled subshells are particularly stable arrangements of electrons\". However, this is not supported by the facts, as tungsten (W) has a Madelung-following d4\u00a0s2 configuration and not d5\u00a0s1, and niobium (Nb) has an anomalous d4\u00a0s1 configuration that does not give it a half-filled or completely filled subshell.\nThe apparent paradox arises when electrons are \"removed\" from the transition metal atoms to form ions. The first electrons to be ionized come not from the 3d-orbital, as one would expect if it were \"higher in energy\", but from the 4s-orbital. This interchange of electrons between 4s and 3d is found for all atoms of the first series of transition metals. The configurations of the neutral atoms (K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, ...) usually follow the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, ...; however the successive stages of ionization of a given atom (such as Fe4+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Fe+, Fe) usually follow the order 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, ...\nThis phenomenon is only paradoxical if it is assumed that the energy order of atomic orbitals is fixed and unaffected by the nuclear charge or by the presence of electrons in other orbitals. If that were the case, the 3d-orbital would have the same energy as the 3p-orbital, as it does in hydrogen, yet it clearly does not. There is no special reason why the Fe2+ ion should have the same electron configuration as the chromium atom, given that iron has two more protons in its nucleus than chromium, and that the chemistry of the two species is very different. Melrose and Eric Scerri have analyzed the changes of orbital energy with orbital occupations in terms of the two-electron repulsion integrals of the Hartree\u2013Fock method of atomic structure calculation. More recently Scerri has argued that contrary to what is stated in the vast majority of sources including the title of his previous article on the subject, 3d orbitals rather than 4s are in fact preferentially occupied.\nIn chemical environments, configurations can change even more: Th3+ as a bare ion has a configuration of [Rn]\u00a05f1, yet in most ThIII compounds the thorium atom has a 6d1 configuration instead. Mostly, what is present is rather a superposition of various configurations. For instance, copper metal is poorly described by either an [Ar]\u00a03d10\u00a04s1 or an [Ar]\u00a03d9\u00a04s2 configuration, but is rather well described as a 90% contribution of the first and a 10% contribution of the second. Indeed, visible light is already enough to excite electrons in most transition metals, and they often continuously \"flow\" through different configurations when that happens (copper and its group are an exception).\nSimilar ion-like 3d\"x\"\u00a04s0 configurations occur in transition metal complexes as described by the simple crystal field theory, even if the metal has oxidation state\u00a00. For example, chromium hexacarbonyl can be described as a chromium atom (not ion) surrounded by six carbon monoxide ligands. The electron configuration of the central chromium atom is described as 3d6 with the six electrons filling the three lower-energy d orbitals between the ligands. The other two d orbitals are at higher energy due to the crystal field of the ligands. This picture is consistent with the experimental fact that the complex is diamagnetic, meaning that it has no unpaired electrons. However, in a more accurate description using molecular orbital theory, the d-like orbitals occupied by the six electrons are no longer identical with the d orbitals of the free atom.\nOther exceptions to Madelung's rule.\nThere are several more exceptions to Madelung's rule among the heavier elements, and as atomic number increases it becomes more and more difficult to find simple explanations such as the stability of half-filled subshells. It is possible to predict most of the exceptions by Hartree\u2013Fock calculations, which are an approximate method for taking account of the effect of the other electrons on orbital energies. Qualitatively, for example, the 4d elements have the greatest concentration of Madelung anomalies, because the 4d\u20135s gap is larger than the 3d\u20134s and 5d\u20136s gaps.\nFor the heavier elements, it is also necessary to take account of the effects of special relativity on the energies of the atomic orbitals, as the inner-shell electrons are moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. In general, these relativistic effects tend to decrease the energy of the s-orbitals in relation to the other atomic orbitals. This is the reason why the 6d elements are predicted to have no Madelung anomalies apart from lawrencium (for which relativistic effects stabilise the p1/2 orbital as well and cause its occupancy in the ground state), as relativity intervenes to make the 7s orbitals lower in energy than the 6d ones.\nThe table below shows the configurations of the f-block (green) and d-block (blue) atoms. It shows the ground state configuration in terms of orbital occupancy, but it does not show the ground state in terms of the sequence of orbital energies as determined spectroscopically. For example, in the transition metals, the 4s orbital is of a higher energy than the 3d orbitals; and in the lanthanides, the 6s is higher than the 4f and 5d. The ground states can be seen in the Electron configurations of the elements (data page). However this also depends on the charge: a calcium atom has 4s lower in energy than 3d, but a Ca2+ cation has 3d lower in energy than 4s. In practice the configurations predicted by the Madelung rule are at least close to the ground state even in these anomalous cases. The empty f orbitals in lanthanum, actinium, and thorium contribute to chemical bonding, as do the empty p orbitals in transition metals.\nVacant s, d, and f orbitals have been shown explicitly, as is occasionally done, to emphasise the filling order and to clarify that even orbitals unoccupied in the ground state (e.g. lanthanum 4f or palladium 5s) may be occupied and bonding in chemical compounds. (The same is also true for the p-orbitals, which are not explicitly shown because they are only actually occupied for lawrencium in gas-phase ground states.)\nThe various anomalies describe the free atoms and do not necessarily predict chemical behavior. Thus for example neodymium typically forms the +3 oxidation state, despite its configuration [Xe] 4f4 5d0 6s2 that if interpreted na\u00efvely would suggest a more stable +2 oxidation state corresponding to losing only the 6s electrons. Contrariwise, uranium as [Rn] 5f3 6d1 7s2 is not very stable in the +3 oxidation state either, preferring +4 and +6.\nThe electron-shell configuration of elements beyond hassium has not yet been empirically verified, but they are expected to follow Madelung's rule without exceptions until element 120. Element 121 should have the anomalous configuration , having a p rather than a g electron. Electron configurations beyond this are tentative and predictions differ between models, but Madelung's rule is expected to break down due to the closeness in energy of the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals. That said, the filling sequence 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p is predicted to hold approximately, with perturbations due to the huge spin-orbit splitting of the 8p and 9p shells, and the huge relativistic stabilisation of the 9s shell.\nOpen and closed shells.\nIn the context of atomic orbitals, an open shell is a valence shell which is not completely filled with electrons or that has not given all of its valence electrons through chemical bonds with other atoms or molecules during a chemical reaction. Conversely a closed shell is obtained with a completely filled valence shell. This configuration is very stable.\nFor molecules, \"open shell\" signifies that there are unpaired electrons. In molecular orbital theory, this leads to molecular orbitals that are singly occupied. In computational chemistry implementations of molecular orbital theory, open-shell molecules have to be handled by either the restricted open-shell Hartree\u2013Fock method or the unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock method. Conversely a closed-shell configuration corresponds to a state where all molecular orbitals are either doubly occupied or empty (a singlet state). Open shell molecules are more difficult to study computationally.\nNoble gas configuration.\nNoble gas configuration is the electron configuration of noble gases. The basis of all chemical reactions is the tendency of chemical elements to acquire stability. Main-group atoms generally obey the octet rule, while transition metals generally obey the 18-electron rule. The noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) are less reactive than other elements because they already have a noble gas configuration. Oganesson is predicted to be more reactive due to relativistic effects for heavy atoms.\nEvery system has the tendency to acquire the state of stability or a state of minimum energy, and so chemical elements take part in chemical reactions to acquire a stable electronic configuration similar to that of its nearest noble gas. An example of this tendency is two hydrogen (H) atoms reacting with one oxygen (O) atom to form water (H2O). Neutral atomic hydrogen has one electron in its valence shell, and on formation of water it acquires a share of a second electron coming from oxygen, so that its configuration is similar to that of its nearest noble gas helium (He) with two electrons in its valence shell. Similarly, neutral atomic oxygen has six electrons in its valence shell, and acquires a share of two electrons from the two hydrogen atoms, so that its configuration is similar to that of its nearest noble gas neon with eight electrons in its valence shell.\nElectron configuration in molecules.\nElectron configuration in molecules is more complex than the electron configuration of atoms, as each molecule has a different orbital structure. The molecular orbitals are labelled according to their symmetry, rather than the atomic orbital labels used for atoms and monatomic ions; hence, the electron configuration of the dioxygen molecule, O2, is written 1\u03c3g2\u00a01\u03c3u2\u00a02\u03c3g2\u00a02\u03c3u2\u00a03\u03c3g2\u00a01\u03c0u4\u00a01\u03c0g2, or equivalently 1\u03c3g2\u00a01\u03c3u2\u00a02\u03c3g2\u00a02\u03c3u2\u00a01\u03c0u4\u00a03\u03c3g2\u00a01\u03c0g2. The term 1\u03c0g2 represents the two electrons in the two degenerate \u03c0*-orbitals (antibonding). From Hund's rules, these electrons have parallel spins in the ground state, and so dioxygen has a net magnetic moment (it is paramagnetic). The explanation of the paramagnetism of dioxygen was a major success for molecular orbital theory.\nThe electronic configuration of polyatomic molecules can change without absorption or emission of a photon through vibronic couplings.\nElectron configuration in solids.\nIn a solid, the electron states become very numerous. They cease to be discrete, and effectively blend into continuous ranges of possible states (an electron band). The notion of electron configuration ceases to be relevant, and yields to band theory.\nApplications.\nThe most widespread application of electron configurations is in the rationalization of chemical properties, in both inorganic and organic chemistry. In effect, electron configurations, along with some simplified forms of molecular orbital theory, have become the modern equivalent of the valence concept, describing the number and type of chemical bonds that an atom can be expected to form.\nThis approach is taken further in computational chemistry, which typically attempts to make quantitative estimates of chemical properties. For many years, most such calculations relied upon the \"linear combination of atomic orbitals\" (LCAO) approximation, using an ever-larger and more complex basis set of atomic orbitals as the starting point. The last step in such a calculation is the assignment of electrons among the molecular orbitals according to the aufbau principle. Not all methods in computational chemistry rely on electron configuration: density functional theory (DFT) is an important example of a method that discards the model.\nFor atoms or molecules with more than one electron, the motion of electrons are correlated and such a picture is no longer exact. A very large number of electronic configurations are needed to exactly describe any multi-electron system, and precisely associating a certain energy level with any single configuration is not possible. However, the electronic wave function is usually dominated by a very small number of configurations and therefore the notion of electronic configuration remains essential for multi-electron systems.\nA fundamental application of electron configurations is in the interpretation of atomic spectra. In this case, it is necessary to supplement the electron configuration with one or more term symbols, which describe the different energy levels available to an atom. Term symbols can be calculated for any electron configuration, not just the ground-state configuration listed in tables, although not all the energy levels are observed in practice. It is through the analysis of atomic spectra that the ground-state electron configurations of the elements were experimentally determined.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between 1238 and 1239 he also served as regent of Sandomierz and Opole\u2013Racib\u00f3rz. He was the son of Henry the Bearded and a member of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In October 2015, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Legnica opened up his cause for beatification, obtaining him the title of Servant of God.\nEarly life.\nHenry the Pious was the second son of High Duke Henry the Bearded of Poland and Hedwig of Andechs. His elder brother, Boles\u0142aw, died in 1206. In 1213, his younger brother Konrad the Curly died during a hunt, leaving the young Henry as the sole heir of Lower Silesia. Around 1218 his father arranged his marriage to Anne, daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia. This union with the royal P\u0159emyslid dynasty allowed Henry the Pious to participate actively in international politics.\nHenry the Bearded quickly designated his sole surviving son as his sole heir, and from 1222, the young prince countersigned documents with his father. By 1224, he had his own seal and notary. In 1227, during a meeting of Piast dukes in G\u0105sawa, Henry the Bearded and High Duke Leszek I the White were ambushed. Leszek was killed and Henry was seriously wounded. Henry the Pious acted as interim duke. In 1229, Henry the Bearded was captured by Duke Konrad I of Masovia, and again young Henry the Pious acted as interim duke. During 1229\u201330, he led a military expedition to recover and secure the possession of Lubusz Land, and in 1233\u201334 he actively supported his father's affairs in Prussia and Greater Poland. In 1234, Henry the Bearded named his son co-ruler. Later, Henry the Bearded took the duchies of Krak\u00f3w and Silesia, and Henry the Pious was given the duchies of Silesia and Greater Poland. When Henry the Bearded died on 19 March 1238, Henry the Pious became duke of Silesia, Krak\u00f3w and Greater Poland.\nSole reign.\nHenry the Pious inherited Lower Silesia from his father. Southern Greater Poland and Krak\u00f3w were ruled by the Piast princes, although the late duke of Greater Poland and Krak\u00f3w, W\u0142adys\u0142aw III, had left all his lands to Henry the Bearded. The will was ignored by Duke Konrad of Masovia and W\u0142adys\u0142aw's III nephew W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic.\nHenry II could retain his authority as a regent over the Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz and the Duchy of Sandomierz during the minority of their rulers Mieszko II the Fat and Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste. Nevertheless, in 1239, Henry was compelled to resign the regency, although he remained on good terms with the Dukes of Opole and Sandomierz, and managed to retain Greater Polish Kalisz and Wielu\u0144.\nThe situation in the northwest was more complicated: Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg took the important Greater Polish fortress at Santok and besieged Lubusz. Henry II also inherited the disputes with Konrad of Masovia, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic, and with the Church, led by Pe\u0142ka, Archbishop of Gniezno. The situation changed unexpectedly after the death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic on 5 June 1239, who left two minor sons, Przemys\u0142 I and Boles\u0142aw the Pious. Henry II took the majority of Odonic's possessions (including Gniezno), leaving Nak\u0142o nad Noteci\u0105 and Uj\u015bcie to Odonic's sons.\nHenry then abandoned the traditional alliance of his family with the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen and supported Pope Gregory IX, immediately resolving his dispute with the Church. He then put an end to his conflicts with Konrad of Masovia by arranging the marriages of two of his daughters to two of Konrad's sons: Gertrude to Boles\u0142aw, and Constance, to Casimir I of Kuyavia. In 1239, Henry II reclaimed the Santok fortress from Margrave Otto III after Henry's victory in the Battle of Lubusz.\nMongol invasion.\nIn the East, a new dangerous opponent appeared: the Mongols, under the leadership of Batu Khan, who, after the invasion of Rus' chose the Kingdom of Hungary as his next target. Batu Khan realized that he had to take control of Poland before he could take Hungary. In January 1241, Batu sent reconnaissance troops to Lublin and Zawichost. The invasion was launched a month later, by an army of 10,000 men under the leadership of Orda. In Lesser Poland the Mongols met weaker resistance, defeating and killing almost all the Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz nobility in the Battle of Tursko (13 February), and the Battles of Tarczek and Chmielnik (18 March), including the voivode of Krak\u00f3w, W\u0142odzimierz and the castellan Klement of Brze\u017anica. All of Lesser Poland, including Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz, fell into the hands of the Mongols.\nHenry did not wait for the promised aid from Western rulers and began to concentrate the surviving troops of Lesser Poland and his own Silesian and Greater Poland forces in Legnica. Europe's rulers were more focused on the struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and Papacy, and they ignored Henry's requests for help. The only foreign troops who joined him were those of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia and the combined forces of some Knights Templar. Some sources report that European forces halted their troops near Legnica, probably fearing that the Christian Army would become an easy prey to the Mongols. The battle of Legnica took place on 9 April 1241. Henry was defeated and killed in action.\nThe defeat was widely blamed on the European monarchs, especially Emperor Frederick II and King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary, who had refused to help, and the unexpected retreat from the battle by Henry's Upper Silesian cousin Mieszko II the Fat, through a trick of the Mongols. There are two descriptions of Henry's death, one submitted by Jan D\u0142ugosz (today considered dubious), and the second by C. de Brigia in his \"Historii Tartatorum\" (based on reports of direct witnesses, now considered more reliable). However, the Mongols did not intend to occupy the country, and shortly afterward they went through Moravia to Hungary, wanting to connect with the main army of Batu Khan. Henry's naked and decapitated body could only be identified by his wife, because of his polydactyly. He had six toes on his left foot, which was confirmed when his tomb was opened in 1832. Henry was buried in the crypt of the Franciscan Church of Sts. Vincent and Jacob in Wroc\u0142aw (Breslau).\nDespite ruling for only three years, Henry remained in the memories of Silesia, Greater Poland and Krak\u00f3w as the perfect Christian knight, lord and martyr, whose brilliant career was abruptly ended by his early death. Upon his death, the line of the Silesian Piasts fragmented into numerous dukes of Silesia, who (except for Henry's grandson Henry IV Probus) were no longer able to prevail as Polish high dukes and subsequently came under the influence of the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia.\nIn 1944, Henry the Pious' body went missing after being taken from its tomb by German scientists for laboratory tests; they had hoped to prove that the prince was Aryan.\nMarriage and children.\nBetween 1214 and 1218, Henry married Anna (ca. 1201 \u2013 23 June 1265), daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia. They had:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the age of three he became blind because of smallpox. Murenu's father was imprisoned when Melchiorre was ten years old, and is thought to have died during his imprisonment. This unfortunate circumstance drove Murenu's family in poverty (Murenu spoke of the difficult times of his childhood in the poem \"Supplica a Monsignore Bua\"). In these difficult circumstances Murenu could not afford to be formally educated, and he enjoyed spending time at the local church. There he acquainted himself to the biblical texts and, thanks to a prodigious memory, he could recite entire passages of the scriptures, as well as the daily sermons, entirely by heart.\nDespite this background (or, perhaps, because of it), poverty and oppression are the main subjects of Murenu's poetry. Among his most famous lyrics are \"Supplica a Monsignore Bua\" (\"Supplique to Mgr. Rua\", about his family's misfortunes), \" S'istadu de Sardigna \" (\"State of Sardinia\", about the pervasive injustice against the defenseless people of Sardinia), and \"Tancas serradas a muru\" (\"walled lands\"), a quartile about the appropriation of lands.\nAnother famous composition by Murenu sealed his fate; it is \"Sas isporchizias de Bosa\" (\"Bosa's filth\"), a fictional (and decidedly unflattering) description of the city of Bosa. It is commonly thought that because of this poem, some of Bosa's inhabitants decided to avenge such offense by killing him. The night of 21 October 1854, three men, claiming to be there on behalf of a poet known to Murenu, lured him out of his place and pushed him over a cliff.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of September\u00a02020[ [update]], 277 meteorites had been classified as Martian, less than half a percent of the 72,000 meteorites that have been classified. The second largest complete, uncut Martian meteorite, Taoudenni 002, was recovered in Mali in early 2021. It weighs 14.5 kilograms (32 pounds) and is on display at the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum.\nThere are three groups of Martian meteorite: shergottites, nakhlites and chassignites, collectively known as SNC meteorites. Several other Martian meteorites are ungrouped. These meteorites are interpreted as Martian because they have elemental and isotopic compositions that are similar to rocks and atmospheric gases on Mars, which have been measured by orbiting spacecraft, surface landers and rovers. The term does not include meteorites found on Mars, such as Heat Shield Rock.\nHistory.\nBy the early 1980s, it was obvious that the SNC group of meteorites (Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites) were significantly different from most other meteorite types. Among these differences were younger formation ages, a different oxygen isotopic composition, the presence of aqueous weathering products, and some similarity in chemical composition to analyses of the Martian surface rocks in 1976 by the Viking landers. Several scientists suggested these characteristics implied the origin of SNC meteorites from a relatively large parent body, possibly Mars.\nThen in 1983, various trapped gases were reported in impact-formed glass of the EET79001 shergottite, gases which closely resembled those in the Martian atmosphere as analyzed by Viking. These trapped gases provided direct evidence for a Martian origin. In 2000, an article by Treiman, Gleason, and Bogard gave a survey of all the arguments used to conclude that the SNC meteorites (of which 14 had been found at the time) were from Mars. They wrote, \"There seems little likelihood that the SNCs are not from Mars. If they were from another planetary body, it would have to be substantially identical to Mars as it now is understood.\"\nSubdivision.\nAs of April 25, 2018, 192 of the 207 Martian meteorites are divided into three rare groups of achondritic (stony) meteorites: \"shergottites\" (169), \"nakhlites\" (20), \"chassignites\" (3), and ones otherwise (15) (containing the orthopyroxenite (OPX) Allan Hills 84001, as well as 10 basaltic breccia meteorites). Consequently, Martian meteorites as a whole are sometimes referred to as the \"SNC group\" (pronounced ). They have isotope ratios that are consistent with each other and inconsistent with a terrestrial origin. The names derive from the location of where the first meteorite of their type was discovered.\nShergottites.\nRoughly three-quarters of all Martian meteorites can be classified as shergottites. They are named after the Shergotty meteorite, which fell at Sherghati, India in 1865. Shergottites are igneous rocks of mafic to ultramafic lithology. They fall into three main groups, the basaltic, olivine-phyric (such as the Tissint group found in Morocco in 2011) and lherzolitic shergottites, based on their crystal size and mineral content. They can be categorised alternatively into three or four groups based on their rare-earth element content. These two classification systems do not line up with each other, hinting at complex relationships between the various source rocks and magmas from which the shergottites formed.\nThe shergottites appear to have crystallised as recently as 180 million years ago, which is a surprisingly young age considering how ancient the majority of the surface of Mars appears to be, and the small size of Mars itself. Because of this, some have advocated the idea that the shergottites are much older than this. This \"Shergottite Age Paradox\" remains unsolved and is still an area of active research and debate.\nIt has been suggested the 3-million-year-old crater Mojave, 58.5\u00a0km in diameter, was a potential source of these meteorites. A paper published in 2021, however, disputes this, proposing instead the 28 km crater Tooting, or possibly the crater 09-000015 as the crater source of the depleted olivine-phyric shergottites ejected 1.1 Ma ago.\nNakhlites.\nNakhlites are named after the first of them, the Nakhla meteorite, which fell in El-Nakhla, Alexandria, Egypt in 1911 and had an estimated weight of 10\u00a0kg.\nNakhlites are igneous rocks that are rich in augite and were formed from basaltic magma from at least four eruptions, spanning around 90 million years, from 1416\u2009\u00b1\u20097 to 1322\u2009\u00b1\u200910 million years ago. They contain augite and olivine crystals. Their crystallization ages, compared to a crater count chronology of different regions on Mars, suggest the nakhlites formed on the large volcanic construct of either Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum.\nIt has been shown that the nakhlites were suffused with liquid water around 620 million years ago and that they were ejected from Mars around 10.75 million years ago by an asteroid impact. They fell to Earth within the last 10,000 years.\nChassignites.\nThe first chassignite, the Chassigny meteorite, fell at Chassigny, Haute-Marne, France in 1815. There has been only one other chassignite recovered, named Northwest Africa (NWA) 2737. NWA 2737 was found in Morocco or Western Sahara in August 2000 by meteorite hunters Bruno Fectay and Carine Bidaut, who gave it the temporary name \"Diderot.\" It was shown by Beck \"et al.\" that its \"mineralogy, major and trace element chemistry as well as oxygen isotopes revealed an unambiguous Martian origin and strong affinities with Chassigny.\"\nUngrouped meteorites.\nAmong these, the famous specimen Allan Hills 84001 has a different rock type from other Martian meteorites: it is an orthopyroxenite (an igneous rock dominantly composed of orthopyroxene). For this reason, it is classified within its group, the \"OPX Martian meteorites\". This meteorite received much attention after an electron microscope revealed structures that were considered to be the fossilized remains of bacteria-like lifeforms. As of 2005[ [update]], scientific consensus was that the microfossils were not indicative of Martian life, but of contamination by earthly biofilms. ALH 84001 is as old as the basaltic and intermediate shergottite groups\u00a0\u2013 i.e., 4.1 billion years old.\nIn March 2004 it was suggested that the unique Kaidun meteorite, which landed in Yemen on December 3, 1980, may have originated on the Martian moon of Phobos. Because Phobos has similarities to C-type asteroids and because the Kaidun meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite, Kaidun is not a Martian meteorite in the strict sense. However, it may contain small fragments of material from the Martian surface.\nThe Martian meteorite NWA 7034 (nicknamed \"Black Beauty\"), found in the Sahara desert during 2011, has ten times the water content of other Mars meteorites found on Earth. The meteorite contains components as old as 4.42 \u00b1 0.07 Ga (billion years), and was heated during the Amazonian geologic period on Mars.\nA meteorite that fell in 1986 in Dayanpo, China, contained a magnesium silicate mineral called \"Elgoresyte\", a mineral not found on Earth.\nOrigin.\nThe majority of SNC meteorites are quite young compared to most other meteorites and seem to imply that volcanic activity was present on Mars only a few hundred million years ago. The young formation ages of Martian meteorites was one of the early recognized characteristics that suggested their origin from a planetary body such as Mars. Among Martian meteorites, only ALH 84001 and NWA 7034 have radiometric ages older than about 1400\u00a0Ma (Ma\u00a0= million years). All nakhlites, as well as Chassigny and NWA 2737, give similar if not identical formation ages around 1300\u00a0Ma, as determined by various radiometric dating techniques. Formation ages determined for many shergottites are variable and much younger, mostly ~150\u2013575\u00a0Ma.\nThe chronological history of shergottites is not totally understood, and a few scientists have suggested that some may have formed prior to the times given by their radiometric ages, a suggestion not accepted by most scientists. Formation ages of SNC meteorites are often linked to their cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages, as measured from the nuclear products of interactions of the meteorite in space with energetic cosmic ray particles. Thus, all measured nakhlites give essentially identical CRE ages of approximately 11 Ma, which, when combined with their possible identical formation ages, indicates ejection of nakhlites into space from a single location on Mars by a single impact event. Some of the shergottites also seem to form distinct groups according to their CRE ages and formation ages, again indicating ejection of several different shergottites from Mars by a single impact. However, CRE ages of shergottites vary considerably (~0.5\u201319\u00a0Ma), and several impact events are required to eject all the known shergottites. It had been asserted that there are no large young craters on Mars that are candidates as sources for the Martian meteorites, but subsequent studies claimed to have a likely source for ALH 84001, and a possible source for other shergottites.\nIn a 2014 paper, several researchers claimed that all Shergottite meteorites come from the Mojave Crater on Mars.\nAge estimates based on cosmic ray exposure.\nThe amount of time spent in transit from Mars to Earth can be estimated by measurements of the effect of cosmic radiation on the meteorites, particularly on isotope ratios of noble gases. The meteorites cluster in families that seem to correspond to distinct impact events on Mars. It is thought that the meteorites all originate in relatively few impacts every few million years on Mars. The impactors would be kilometers in diameter, and the craters they form on Mars would be tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.\nAges since impact determined so far include\nPossible evidence of life.\nSeveral Martian meteorites have been found to contain what some think is evidence for fossilized Martian life forms. The most significant of these is a meteorite found in the Allan Hills of Antarctica (ALH 84001). Ejection from Mars seems to have taken place about 16 million years ago. Arrival on Earth was about 13,000 years ago. Cracks in the rock appear to have filled with carbonate materials (implying groundwater was present) between 4 and 3.6 billion years ago. Evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified with the levels increasing away from the surface. Other Antarctic meteorites do not contain PAHs. Earthly contamination should presumably be highest at the surface. Several minerals in the crack fill are deposited in phases, specifically, iron deposited as magnetite, which are claimed to be typical of biodepositation on Earth. There are also small ovoid and tubular structures that might be nanobacteria fossils in carbonate material in crack fills (investigators McKay, Gibson, Thomas-Keprta, Zare). Micropaleontologist Schopf, who described several important terrestrial bacterial assemblages, examined ALH 84001 and opined that the structures are too small to be Earthly bacteria and don't look especially like lifeforms to him. The size of the objects is consistent with Earthly \"nanobacteria\", but the existence of nanobacteria itself has been largely discredited.\nMany studies disputed the validity of the fossils. For example, it was found that most of the organic matter in the meteorite was of terrestrial origin. But, a 2009 study suggests that magnetite in the meteorite could have been produced by Martian microbes. The study, published in the Journal of the Geochemical and Meteoritic Society, used more advanced high-resolution electron microscopy than was possible in 1996. A serious difficulty with the claims for a biogenic origin of the magnetites is that the majority of them exhibit topotactic crystallographic relationships with the host carbonates (i.e., there are 3D orientation relationships between the magnetite and carbonate lattices), which is strongly indicative that the magnetites have grown in-situ by a physico-chemical mechanism.\nWhile water is no indication of life, many of the meteorites found on Earth have shown water, including NWA 7034 which formed during the Amazonian period of Martian geological history. Other signs of surface liquid water on Mars (such as recurring slope lineae) are a topic of debate among planetary scientists, but generally consistent with the earlier evidence provided by Martian meteorites. Any liquid water present is likely too minimal to support life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Foreskin restoration is primarily accomplished by gently tugging the skin of the penis by hand or with a restoration device to stimulate the production of more skin through tissue expansion, but surgical methods also exist. Restoration creates a functional facsimile of the foreskin, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision such as the preputial orifice cannot be reclaimed.\nHistory.\nIn the Greco-Roman world, uncircumcised genitals, including the foreskin, were considered a sign of beauty, civility, and masculinity. In Classical Greek and Roman societies (8th century BC to 6th century AD), exposure of the glans was considered disgusting and improper, and did not conform to the Hellenistic ideal of gymnastic nudity. Men with short foreskins would wear the kynodesme to prevent exposure and potentially permanently lengthen the foreskin. As a consequence of this social stigma, an early form of foreskin restoration known as \"epispasm\" was practiced among some Jews in Ancient Rome (8th century BC to 5th century AD). The history of foreskin restoration changed the practice of circumcision itself. Jewish religious leaders were upset that circumcision was being undone and changed the practice to remove significantly more skin in an attempt to make restoration more difficult.\nForeskin restoration is of ancient origin and dates back to the Alexandrian Empire (333 BC). Hellenized Jews stopped circumcising their sons to avoid persecution and so they could participate in the gymnasium. Some Jews at this time attempted to restore their foreskins, which caused conflict within Second Temple Judaism, some Jews viewed circumcision as an essential part of the Jewish identity (1 Maccabees 1:15). Following the death of Alexander, Judea and the Levant was part of the Seleucid Empire under Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 BC). Antiochus outlawed the Jewish practice of circumcision, both 1st and 2nd Maccabees records Jewish mothers being put to death for circumcising their sons (1:60-61 and 6:10 respectively). Some Jews during Antiochus' persecution sought to undo their circumcision. Within the 1st century A.D., there were still some forms of foreskin restoration being sought after (1 Corinthians 7:18). During the third Jewish-Roman Wars (AD 132\u2013135), the Romans had renamed Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolian and may have banned circumcision; however, Roman sources from the period only mention castration and say nothing about banning circumcision. According to rabbinic sources, during the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jews who had engaged in foreskin restoration were recircumcised (either voluntarily or by force). Again, during World War II, some European Jews sought foreskin restoration to avoid Nazi persecution.\nForeskin restoration is featured prominently in the 2017 documentary \"American Circumcision\". In the film, Ron Low, a device inventor, estimates a quarter million people worldwide were restoring in 2010.\nNon-surgical techniques.\nTissue expansion.\nNon-surgical foreskin restoration, accomplished through tissue expansion, is the more commonly used method.\nTissue expansion has long been known to stimulate mitosis, and research shows that regenerated human tissues have the attributes of the original tissue.\nCare must be taken not to injure or tear the skin. Applying tension to different parts of the skin can change the overall physical shape. This allows the restorer to change the ratio of outer skin to inner skin. Partial restoration can allow cosmetic and functional improvements in the case of circumcision complications such as uneven or excessive skin removal.\nMethods and devices.\nThere are multiple restoration methods, in the most common one the remaining penile skin is pulled forward over the glans, and tension is maintained either by hand or through the aid of a foreskin restoration device. The process slowly creates more skin, allowing more coverage and protection of the glans even when tension is removed.\nSurgical techniques.\nForeskin reconstruction.\nSurgical methods of foreskin restoration, known as foreskin reconstruction, usually involve grafting skin onto the distal portion of the penile shaft. The grafted skin is typically taken from the scrotum, which contains the same smooth muscle (known as dartos fascia) as the skin of the penis. One method involves a four-stage procedure in which the penile shaft is buried in the scrotum for a period of time.\nResults.\nPhysical aspects.\nRestoration creates a functional facsimile of the prepuce, but specialized tissues removed during circumcision such as the preputial orifice, the ridged band, and the frenulum cannot be reclaimed. Surgical procedures exist to reduce the size of the opening once restoration is complete (as depicted in the image above), or it can be alleviated through a longer commitment to the skin expansion regimen to allow more skin to collect at the tip.\nThe natural foreskin is composed of smooth dartos muscle tissue (called the \"peripenic muscle\"), large blood vessels, extensive innervation, outer skin, and inner mucosa.\nThe process of foreskin restoration seeks to regenerate some of the tissue removed by circumcision, as well as provide coverage of the glans. According to research, the foreskin comprises over half of the skin and mucosa of the human penis.\nPartial restoration can confer benefits such as ease of masturbation and protection of the rim around the glans known as the corona.\nIn a survey of foreskin restorers (the results of which were published in March 2023), 69 percent of respondents reported increased sexual pleasure and 25 percent reported improved relationships.\nOrganizations.\nVarious groups have been founded since the late 20th century, especially in North America where circumcision has been routinely performed on infants. In 1989, the National Organization of Restoring Men (NORM) was founded as a non-profit support group for men undertaking foreskin restoration. In 1991, the group UNCircumcising Information and Resource Centers (UNCIRC) was formed, which was incorporated into NORM in 1994. NORM chapters have been founded throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. In France, there are at least two associations. The \"Association contre la Mutilation des Enfants\" AME (association against child mutilation), and more recently \"Droit au Corps\" (right to the body).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He talks about basic concepts like space and time, building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He discusses two theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics that form the foundation of modern physics. Finally, he talks about the search for a unified theory that consistently describes everything in the universe.\nThe book became a bestseller and has sold more than 25 million copies in 40 languages. It was included on \"Time\"'s list of the 100 best nonfiction books since the magazine's founding. Errol Morris made a documentary, \"A Brief History of Time\" (1991) which combines material from Hawking's book with interviews featuring Hawking, his colleagues, and his family.\nAn illustrated version was published in 1996. In 2006, Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow published an abridged version, \"A Briefer History of Time\".\nPublication.\nIn 1983, Hawking approached Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press, with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology. Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript, which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach. In the acknowledgements, Hawking says he was warned that for every equation in the book, the readership would be halved. So it includes only a single equation: formula_1.\nContents.\nChapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe.\nHawking begins with an anecdote about a scientist lecturing on the universe. An old woman got up and said, \"What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.\" The scientist asked what the tortoise was standing on. She replied, \"You're very clever young man, very clever. But it's turtles all the way down!\" Hawking goes on to explain why we know better.\nHe discusses the history of astronomy, starting with Aristotle's conclusions about a spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. He discusses the development of the heliocentric model of the Solar System by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus in 1514. A century later, the Italian Galileo Galilei turned a Dutch spyglass to the heavens. His observations of Jupiter's moons provided support for Copernicus. The German astronomer Johannes Kepler formulated his laws of planetary motion, in which planets move in ellipses. Kepler's laws were explained by English physicist Isaac Newton in his \"Principia Mathematica\" (1687).\nHawking discusses how the subject of the origin of the universe has been debated over time: the perennial existence of the universe hypothesized by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by St. Augustine and other theologians' belief in its creation at a specific time in the past. Immanuel Kant argued that time had no beginning. In our time, the discovery of the expanding universe implied that between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago, the entire universe was contained in one singular extremely dense place, and that it doesn't make sense to ask what happened before. He writes: \"An expanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job!\"\nChapter 2: Space and Time.\nHawking describes the evolution of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and time. He starts with the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at rest, and it can only be moved by force, implying that heavier objects will fall faster. However, Galileo experimentally disproved Aristotle's theory by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same rate. This led to Newton's laws of motion and gravity. However, Newton's laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space: whether an object is 'at rest' or 'in motion' depends on the observer's inertial frame of reference.\nHawking describes the classical belief in absolute time, that observers in motion will measure the same time. However, Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of light. That light travels at a finite speed was discovered by Ole R\u00f8mer through his observations of Jupiter and its moons. Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell's equations unifying electricity and magnetism predicted the existence of waves moving at a fixed speed, the same speed that had been measured for light. Physicists believed that light must travel through a luminiferous aether, and that the speed of light was relative to that of the aether. The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, designed to detect the speed of light through the aether, got a null result. Michelson and Morley found that the speed of light was constant regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. Combining this with a postulate that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving relative to one another, Albert Einstein argued that the aether is superfluous if we abandon absolute time. His 1905 paper became known the special theory of relativity.\nHawking discusses two remarkable consequences of this new theory. The first is the equivalence of mass and energy: they are related by the equation formula_1. This also means that no object with mass can reach the speed of light (c = 3\u00d7108 m/s). The second consequence is a fundamental change in our ideas of 'space' and 'time'. Hawking points to the definition of the fundamental unit of length in terms of time as one example.\nIn 1915, Einstein published general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. Matter and energy (including light) follow geodesics. Einstein's theory of gravity predicts a dynamic universe.\nChapter 3: The Expanding Universe.\nHawking describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the Earth. Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night sky. In 1924, Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from Earth. The luminosity and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical formula. Using this, he showed that ours is not the only galaxy.\nIn 1929, Hubble discovered that light from most galaxies was shifted to the red, and that the degree of redshift is directly proportional to distance. From this, he determined that the universe is expanding. This possibility had not been seriously considered. Einstein was so sure of a static universe that he added the cosmological constant to his equations. Many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity, with one notable exception: the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann.\nIn 1922, Friedmann made two very simple assumptions: the universe is identical wherever we are, (homogeneity), and that it is identical in every direction that we look, (isotropy). It follows that the universe is non-static. Support was found when two physicists at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, found unexpected microwave radiation coming from all parts of the sky. At around the same time, Robert H. Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave radiation. They argued that radiation from the early universe should be detectable as the cosmic microwave background. This was what Penzias and Wilson had found.\nIn 1965, Roger Penrose used general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a singularity. Hawking and Penrose proved together that the universe should have arisen from a singularity. Hawking later argued this need not be the case once quantum effects are taken into account.\nChapter 4: The Uncertainty Principle.\nHawking begins by discussing nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace's belief in scientific determinism, where scientific laws would be able to perfectly predict the future of the universe. A crack in classical physics appeared with the ultraviolet catastrophe: according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans, a hot body should radiate an infinite amount of energy. In 1900, the ultraviolet catastrophe was averted by Max Planck, who proposed that energy must be absorbed or emitted in discrete packets called quanta.\nHawking discusses Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to Planck's quantum hypothesis: increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice versa. This overturned Laplace's idea of a completely deterministic theory of the universe. Hawking describes the development by Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Paul Dirac of quantum mechanics, a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into science, and despite Einstein's strong objections, has proven to be very successful in describing the universe at small scales.\nHawking discusses how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle implies the wave\u2013particle duality of light (and particles in general). \nHe describes the phenomenon of interference, where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component waves, as well as the interference within particles, exemplified by the two-slit experiment. Hawking writes that American scientist Richard Feynman's sum over histories is a useful way of visualize quantum behavior. Hawking explains that Einstein's general theory of relativity is a classical, non-quantum theory as it ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very strong, as in a singularity.\nChapter 5: Elementary Particles and Forces of Nature.\nHawking traces the history of investigation into the nature of matter: Aristotle's four elements, Democritus's indivisible atoms, John Dalton's idea of atoms combining to form molecules, J. J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron and finally Murray Gell-Mann's theorizing of quarks which constitute protons and neutrons (collectively called hadrons). Hawking discusses the six different \"flavors\" (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) and three different \"colors\" of quarks (red, green, and blue). Later he discusses anti-quarks, which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the universe.\nHawking introduces the spin of particles. Particles can be divided into two groups. Fermions, or matter particles, have a spin of 1/2. Fermions follow Wolfgang Pauli's exclusion principle: they cannot share the same quantum state (for example, two \"spin up\" protons cannot occupy the same location in space). Without this rule, atoms could not exist. Bosons, or the force-carrying particles, have a spin of 0, 1, or 2 and do not follow the exclusion principle.\n Gravity is thought to be carried by gravitons, massless particles with spin 2. The electromagnetic force is carried by photons. The weak nuclear force is responsible for radioactivity and is carried by W and Z bosons. The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into hadrons and binds hadrons together into atomic nuclei, is carried by the gluon. Hawking writes that color confinement prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own (except at extremely high temperature) as they remain confined within hadrons.\nHawking writes that at extremely high temperature, the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak force, giving rise to the speculation that at even higher temperatures, the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single force. Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this \"combined\" force are called Grand Unified Theories, which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics.\nChapter 6: Black Holes.\nHawking discusses black holes, regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents everything, including light, from escaping them. The term black hole was coined by John Archibald Wheeler in 1969, although the idea is older. The Cambridge clergyman John Michell imagined stars so massive that light could not escape their gravitational pull. Hawking explains stellar evolution: how main sequence stars shine by fusing hydrogen into helium, staving off gravitational collapse. A collapsed star may form a white dwarf, supported by electron degeneracy, or a neutron star, supported by the exclusion principle. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar found that for a collapsed star of more than 1.4 solar masses, there would be nothing to halt complete gravitational collapse. He was dissuaded from this thinking by Arthur Eddington, though it later won him the Nobel Prize in Physics. The critical mass is known as the Chandrasekhar limit.\nHe describes the event horizon, the black hole's boundary from which no particle can escape. He writes: \"One could well say of the event horizon what the poet Dante said of the entrance to Hell: 'All hope abandon, ye who enter here.'\" Hawking discusses non-rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with axisymmetry. The discovery of quasars by Maarten Schmidt in 1963 and pulsars by Jocelyn Bell-Burnell in 1967 gave hope that black holes might be detected. Even though black holes (by definition) do not emit light, astronomers can observe them through their interactions with visible matter. A star falling into a black hole would be a powerful source of X-rays. Cygnus X-1, a powerful source of X-rays, was the earliest plausible candidate for a black hole. Hawking concludes by mentioning his 1974 bet with American physicist Kip Thorne. Hawking argued that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. Hawking conceded the bet as evidence for black holes proved overwhelming.\nChapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black.\nHawking discusses an aspect of black holes' behavior that he discovered in the 1970s. According to earlier theories, black holes can only become larger because nothing which enters a black hole can come out. This was similar to entropy, a measure of disorder which, per the second law of thermodynamics, always increases. Hawking and his student Jacob Bekenstein suggested that the area of a black hole's event horizon is a measure of its entropy.\nBut if a black hole has entropy, it must have a temperature, and must emit radiation. In 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can emit radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly 'borrow' energy from the vacuum, then annihilate each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist. However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation. According to Hawking, black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually \"evaporate\" because of this radiation.\nChapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe.\nHawking recalls a conference on cosmology at the Vatican, where he was given an audience with Pope John Paul II. The Pope said it was fine to study the early universe, but scientists should not study the Big Bang itself, as that was the moment of Creation and the work of God. Hawking writes: \"I was glad then that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given at the conference -- the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of Creation. I had no desire to share the fate of Galileo, with whom I feel a strong sense of identity, partly because of the coincidence of having been born exactly 300 years after his death!\"\nAt the Big Bang, the universe had an extremely high temperature, which prevented the formation of complex structures like stars, or even very simple ones like atoms. George Gamow predicted that radiation from the Big Bang should still fill the present universe. This was the cosmic microwave background discovered by Penzias and Wilson. The Big Bang created hydrogen and helium, and heavier elements were forged in stars.\nThe Big Bang model was supported by the redshift of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundance of hydrogen and helium. But mysteries remained: Why is the universe isotropic? Why is the cosmic microwave background so homogenous? Widely separated parts of the universe have the same temperature, but there would not have been time for these regions to have come into contact. Alan Guth's model of cosmic Inflation provided an answer to this horizon problem. Inflation explains other characteristics of the universe that had previously greatly confused researchers. After inflation, the universe continued to expand at a slower pace. It became much colder, eventually allowing for the formation of such stars.\nHawking discusses how the universe might have appeared if it had expanded slower or faster than it actually has. If the universe expanded too slowly, it would collapse, and there would not be enough time for life to form. If the universe expanded too quickly, it would have become almost empty. He discusses the anthropic principle, which states that the universe has laws of physics that allow for the evolution of life because, if it didn't, we wouldn't be here.\nHawking suggests the no boundary proposal: that the universe is finite but has no beginning in imaginary time. It might merely exist.\nChapter 9: The Arrow of Time.\nHawking discusses three \"arrows of time\". The first is the thermodynamic arrow of time: the direction in which entropy increases. This is given as the explanation for why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole cup. The second is the psychological arrow of time, whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one direction, which is why we remember the past and not the future. The third is the cosmological arrow of time: the direction in which the universe is expanding rather than contracting. Hawking claims that the psychological arrow is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow. According to Hawking, during a contraction phase of the universe, the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not agree.\nHawking then claims that the \"no boundary proposal\" for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back again. He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is expanding, as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time advances. He argues that, because of the no boundary proposal, a contracting universe would not have a well-defined thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a universe that is in an expansion phase can support intelligent life. Using the weak anthropic principle, Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent life. This, in Hawking's view, is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same direction.\nChapter 10: Wormholes and Time Travel.\nHawking discusses whether time travel is possible. He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, or travel backwards in time. Kurt G\u00f6del presented Einstein with a solution to general relativity that allowed for time travel in a rotating universe. Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges were proposed early in the history of the theory. These wormholes would appear identical to black holes from the outside, but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in spacetime, potentially in a distant region of space, or even backwards in time. However, later research demonstrated that such a wormhole would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black hole. The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain open, and thus allow faster-than-light travel or time travel, would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density, which violates the energy conditions of general relativity. As such, almost all physicists agree that faster-than-light travel and travel backwards in time are not possible.\nChapter 11: The Unification of Physics.\nQuantum mechanics and general relativity describe the universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of applicability (atomic and cosmic scales, respectively). However, these two theories run into problems when combined. For example, the uncertainty principle is incompatible with Einstein's theory. This contradiction has led physicists to search for a theory of quantum gravity.\nHawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the universe may be found soon, in spite of significant challenges. At the time the book was written, superstring theory had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum gravity, but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had not yielded testable predictions (this remains the case as of 2021). String theory proposes that particles behave like one-dimensional \"strings\", rather than as dimensionless particles. These strings \"vibrate\" in many dimensions. Superstring theory requires a total of 10 dimensions. The nature of the six \"hyperspace\" dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to study.\nHawking thus proposes three possibilities: 1) there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually find; 2) the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and 3) there is no ultimate theory. The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so far, with increasingly accurate partial theories.\nHawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the universe in a laboratory setting, a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in physics.\nConclusion.\nHawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the understanding of the inner workings of the universe. He recalls Laplace's suggestion that the universe's structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God's domain. However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by quantum theory has set limits on knowledge.\nHawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophy. Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would understand the true origin and nature of the universe. \"That would be the ultimate triumph of human reason\u2014for then we know would know the mind of God\".\nEditions.\nThe introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions.\nAdaptions.\nFilm.\nIn 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking; although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book.\nApps.\n\"Stephen Hawking's Pocket Universe: A Brief History of Time Revisited\" is based on the book. The app was developed by Preloaded for Transworld publishers, a division of the Penguin Random House group.\nThe app was produced in 2016. It was designed by Ben Courtney and produced by Jemma Harris and is available on iOS only.\nOpera.\nThe Metropolitan Opera commissioned an opera to premiere in the 2015\u20132016 season based on Hawking's book. It was to be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage. The planned opera was changed to be about a different subject and eventually canceled completely.\nReception.\n\"A Brief History of Time\" was included on \"Time\" magazine's list of the 100 best nonfiction books since the magazine's founding. Jeffrey Kluger wrote: The genius of Hawking was to understand that while people weren't losing much sleep over such matters as event horizons, space-time geodesics and stellar contraction, they were deeply, primally interested in such questions as \"Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\" as he elegantly put it.

Ellis\nThe Large Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time is a 1973 treatise on the theoretical physics of spacetime by the physicist Stephen Hawking and the mathematician George Ellis. It is intended for specialists in general relativity rather than newcomers.\nBackground.\nIn the mid-1970s, advances in the technologies of astronomical observations \u2013 radio, infrared, and X-ray astronomy \u2013 opened up the Universe of exploration. New tools became necessary. In this book, Hawking and Ellis attempt to establish the axiomatic foundation for the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime as described by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and to derive its physical consequences for singularities, horizons, and causality. Whereas the tools for studying Euclidean geometry were a straightedge and a compass, those needed to investigate curved spacetime are test particles and light rays. According to the mathematical physicist John Baez from the University of California, Riverside, \"The Large Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time\" was \"the first book to provide a detailed description of the revolutionary topological methods introduced by Penrose and Hawking in the early seventies.\"\nHawking co-wrote the book with Ellis, while he was postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge. In his 1988 book \"A Brief History of Time\", he describes \"The Large Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time\" as \"highly technical\" and unreadable for the layperson.\nThe book, now considered a classic, has also appeared in paperback format and has been reprinted many times.a A fiftieth anniversary edition was published by Cambridge University Press in February 2023.\nAssessment.\nMathematician Nicholas Michael John Woodhouse at the University of Oxford considered this book to be an authoritative treatise that could become a classic. He observed that the authors begin with axioms of geometry and physics then derive the consequences in a rigorous fashion. Various well-known exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and their physical meaning are explored. In particular, Hawking and Ellis show that singularities and black holes arise in a large class of plausible solutions. He warned that although this book is self-contained, it is more suitable for specialists rather than new students as it is heavy-going and contains no exercises. He noted that despite the authors' attempt at a rigorous treatment, certain technical terms, such as Lie groups, are used but never explained, and that modern coordinate-free methods are introduced, but not used effectively.\nTheoretical physicist Rainer Sachs from the University of California, Berkeley, observed that \"The Large-Scale Structure of Space\u2013Time\" was published within just a few years as \"Gravitation and Cosmology\" by Steven Weinberg and \"Gravitation\" by Charles Misner, Kip Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler. He believed these three books can supplement each other and lead students to the forefront of research. Whereas Hawking and Ellis employ global analysis extensively but say relatively little about perturbative methods, the other two books neglect global analysis and cover in great detail perturbations. He believed Hawking and Ellis did a great job summarizing recent developments in the field (as of 1974) and that the intended audience is a doctoral student (or higher) with a strong mathematical background and prior exposure to general relativity. He argued that the core of the books consists of two chapters, Chapter 4 on the significance of spacetime curvature and Chapter 6 on causal structure, and that the most interesting application is the penultimate chapter on black holes. He noted that mathematical arguments are at times difficult to follow and suggested \"Techniques of Differential Topology in Relativity\" by Roger Penrose for reference. He also noticed a small number of errors, though none affect the general conclusions drawn by the authors. He thought that this book is a \"model\" presentation on the interplay between mathematics and physics that could become highly influential in the future.\nTheoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler of Princeton University recommended this book to anyone interested in the implications of general relativity for cosmology, the singularity theorems, and the physics of black holes, presented in an almost Euclidean fashion, though he acknowledged that this is not a textbook due to its lack of examples and exercises. He praised its 62 illustrative diagrams.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67230", "revid": "3492060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67230", "title": "Helios", "text": "Greek god and personification of the Sun\nIn ancient Greek religion and mythology, Helios (; ; Homeric Greek: ) is the god who personifies the Sun. His name is also Latinized as Helius, and he is often given the epithets Hyperion (\"the one above\") and Phaethon (\"the shining\"). Helios is often depicted in art with a radiant crown and driving a horse-drawn chariot through the sky. He was a guardian of oaths and also the god of sight. Though Helios was a relatively minor deity in Classical Greece, his worship grew more prominent in late antiquity thanks to his identification with several major solar divinities of the Roman period, particularly Apollo and Sol. The Roman Emperor Julian made Helios the central divinity of his short-lived revival of traditional Roman religious practices in the 4th century AD.\nHelios figures prominently in several works of Greek mythology, poetry, and literature, in which he is often described as the son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia and brother of the goddesses Selene (the Moon) and Eos (the Dawn). Helios's most notable role in Greek mythology is the story of his mortal son Phaethon. In the Homeric epics, his most notable role is the one he plays in the \"Odyssey\", where Odysseus's men despite his warnings impiously kill and eat Helios's sacred cattle that the god kept at Thrinacia, his sacred island. Once informed of their misdeed, Helios, in wrath, asks Zeus to punish those who wronged him, and Zeus, agreeing, strikes their ship with a thunderbolt, killing everyone except Odysseus himself, the only one who had not harmed the cattle and was allowed to live.\nDue to his position as the sun, he was believed to be an all-seeing witness and thus was often invoked in oaths. He also played a significant part in ancient magic and spells. In art he is usually depicted as a beardless youth in a chiton holding a whip and driving his quadriga, accompanied by various other celestial gods such as Selene, Eos, or the stars. In ancient times he was worshipped in several places of ancient Greece, though his major cult centres were the island of Rhodes, of which he was the patron god, Corinth, and the greater Corinthia region. The Colossus of Rhodes, a gigantic statue of the god, adorned the port of Rhodes until it was destroyed in an earthquake.\nName.\nThe Greek noun (GEN , DAT , ACC , VOC ) (from earlier ) is the inherited word for the Sun from Proto-Indo-European which is cognate with Latin , Sanskrit , Old English , Old Norse , Welsh , Avestan , etc. The Doric and Aeolic form of the name is , \"H\u00e1lios\". In Homeric Greek his name is spelled , \"\u0112\u00e9lios\", with the Doric spelling of that being , \"A\u00e9lios\". In Cretan it was (\"Ab\u00e9lios\") or (\"Aw\u00e9lios\"). The Greek view of gender was also present in their language. Ancient Greek had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), so when an object or a concept was personified as a deity, it inherited the gender of the relevant noun; \"helios\" is a masculine noun, so the god embodying it is also by necessity male. The female offspring of Helios were called Heliades, the male Heliadae.\nThe author of the \"Suda\" lexicon tried to etymologically connect to the word , \"aoll\u00edzesthai\", \"coming together\" during the daytime, or perhaps from , \"alea\u00ednein\", \"warming\". Plato in his dialogue \"Cratylus\" suggested several etymologies for the word, proposing among others a connection, via the Doric form of the word \"halios\", to the words , \"hal\u00edzein\", meaning collecting men when he rises, or from the phrase , \"ae\u00ed heile\u00edn\", \"ever turning\" because he always turns the earth in his course.\nDoric Greek retained Proto-Greek long *\u0101 as \u03b1, while Attic changed it in most cases, including in this word, to \u03b7.\n\"Cratylus\" and the etymologies Plato gives are contradicted by modern scholarship. From \"helios\" comes the modern English prefix \"helio-\", meaning \"pertaining to the Sun\", used in compounds word such as \"heliocentrism\", \"aphelion\", \"heliotropium\", \"heliophobia\" (fear of the sun) and \"heliolatry\" (\"sun-worship\").\nOrigins.\nHelios most likely is Proto-Indo-European in origin. Walter Burkert wrote that \"... Helios, the sun god, and Eos-Aurora, the goddess of the dawn, are of impeccable Indo-European lineage both in etymology and in their status as gods\" and might have played a role in Proto-Indo-European poetry. The imagery surrounding a chariot-driving solar deity is likely Indo-European in origin. Greek solar imagery begins with the gods Helios and Eos, who are brother and sister, and who become in the day-and-night-cycle the day (\"hemera\") and the evening (\"hespera\"), as Eos accompanies Helios in his journey across the skies. At night, he pastures his steeds and travels east in a golden boat. In them evident is the Indo-European grouping of a sun god and his sister, as well as an association with horses.\nHelen of Troy's name is thought to share the same etymology as Helios, and she may express an early alternate personification of the sun among Hellenic peoples. Helen might have originally been considered to be a daughter of the Sun, as she hatched from an egg and was given tree worship, features associated with the Proto-Indo-European Sun Maiden; in surviving Greek tradition however Helen is never said to be Helios's daughter, instead being the daughter of Zeus.\nIt has been suggested that the Phoenicians brought over the cult of their patron god Baal among others (such as Astarte) to Corinth, who was then continued to be worshipped under the native name/god Helios, similarly to how Astarte was worshipped as Aphrodite, and the Phoenician Melqart was adopted as the sea-god Melicertes/Palaemon, who also had a significant cult in the isthmus of Corinth.\nHelios's journey on a chariot during the day and travel with a boat in the ocean at night possibly reflects the Egyptian sun god Ra sailing across the skies in a barque to be reborn at dawn each morning anew; additionally, both gods, being associated with the sun, were seen as the \"Eye of Heaven\".\nDescription.\nHelios is the son of Hyperion and Theia, or Euryphaessa, or Basileia, and the only brother of the goddesses Eos and Selene. If the order of mention of the three siblings is meant to be taken as their birth order, then out of the four authors that give him and his sisters a birth order, two make him the oldest child, one the middle, and the other the youngest. Helios was not among the regular and more prominent deities, rather he was a more shadowy member of the Olympian circle, despite the fact that he was among the most ancient. From his lineage, Helios might be described as a second generation Titan. He is associated with harmony and order, both literally in the sense of the movement of celestial bodies and metaphorically in the sense of bringing order to society.\nHelios is usually depicted as a handsome young man crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun, which traditionally had twelve rays, symbolising the twelve months of the year. Beyond his Homeric Hymn, not many texts describe his physical appearance; Euripides describes him as (khrys\u043e\u0304p\u00f3s) meaning \"golden-eyed/faced\" or \"beaming like gold\", Mesomedes of Crete writes that he has golden hair, and Apollonius Rhodius that he has light-emitting, golden eyes. According to Augustan poet Ovid, he dressed in tyrian purple robes and sat on a throne of bright emeralds. In ancient artefacts (such as coins, vases, or reliefs) he is presented as a beautiful, full-faced youth with wavy hair, wearing a crown adorned with the sun's rays.\nHelios is said to drive a golden chariot drawn by four horses: Pyrois (\"The Fiery One\", not to be confused with Pyroeis, one of the five naked-eye planets known to ancient Greek and Roman astronomers), Aeos (\"He of the Dawn\"), Aethon (\"Blazing\"), and Phlegon (\"Burning\"). In a Mithraic invocation, Helios's appearance is given as thus:\nA god is then summoned. He is described as \"a youth, fair to behold, with fiery hair, clothed in a white tunic and a scarlet cloak and wearing a fiery crown.\" He is named as \"Helios, lord of heaven and earth, god of gods.\"\nAs mentioned above, the imagery surrounding a chariot-driving solar deity is likely Indo-European in origin and is common to both early Greek and Near Eastern religions.\nHelios is seen as both a personification of the Sun and the fundamental creative power behind it, and as a result is often worshiped as a god of life and creation. His literal \"light\" is often assorted with a metaphorical vitality, and other ancient texts give him the epithet \"gracious\" (). The comic playwright Aristophanes describes Helios as \"the horse-guider, who fills the plain of the earth with exceeding bright beams, a mighty deity among gods and mortals.\" One passage recorded in the Greek Magical Papyri says of Helios, \"the earth flourished when you shone forth and made the plants fruitful when you laughed and brought to life the living creatures when you permitted.\" He is said to have helped create animals out of primeval mud.\nMythology.\nGod of the Sun.\nRising and Setting.\nHelios was envisioned as a god driving his chariot from east to west each day, rising from the Oceanus River and setting in the west under the earth. It is unclear as to whether this journey means that he travels through Tartarus.\nAthenaeus in his \"Deipnosophistae\" relates that, at the hour of sunset, Helios climbs into a great cup of solid gold in which he passes from the Hesperides in the farthest west to the land of the Ethiops, with whom he passes the dark hours. According to Athenaeus, Mimnermus said that in the night Helios travels eastwards with the use of a bed (also created by Hephaestus) in which he sleeps, rather than a cup, as attested in the \"Titanomachy\" in the 8th century BCE. Aeschylus describes the sunset as such:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"There [is] the sacred wave, and the coralled bed of the Erythr\u00e6an Sea, and [there] the luxuriant marsh of the Ethiopians, situated near the ocean, glitters like polished brass; where daily in the soft and tepid stream, the all-seeing Sun bathes his undying self, and refreshes his weary steeds.\"\u2014\u200a\nAthenaeus adds that \"Helios gained a portion of toil for all his days\", as there is no rest for either him or his horses.\nAlthough the chariot is usually said to be the work of Hephaestus, Hyginus states that it was Helios himself who built it. His chariot is described as golden, or occasionally \"rosy\", and pulled by four white horses. The Horae, goddesses of the seasons, are part of his retinue and help him yoke his chariot. His sister Eos is said to have not only opened the gates for Helios, but would often accompany him as well. In the extreme east and west were said to be people who tended to his horses, for whom summer was perpetual and fruitful.\nDisrupted schedule.\nOn several instances in mythology the normal solar schedule is disrupted; he was ordered not to rise for three days during the conception of Heracles, and made the winter days longer in order to look upon Leucothoe. Athena's birth was a sight so impressive that Helios halted his steeds and stayed still in the sky for a long while, as heaven and earth both trembling at the newborn goddess' sight.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Hera who supports the Greeks, makes him set earlier than usual against his will during battle, and later still during the same war, after his sister Eos's son Memnon was killed, she made him downcast, causing his light to fade, so she could be able to freely steal her son's body undetected by the armies, as he consoled his sister in her grief over Memnon's death.\nIt was said that summer days are longer due to Helios often stopping his chariot mid-air to watch from above nymphs dancing during the summer, and sometimes he is late to rise because he lingers with his consort. If the other gods wish so, Helios can be hastened on his daily course when they wish it to be night.\nWhen Zeus desired to sleep with Alcmene, he made one night last threefold, hiding the light of the Sun, by ordering Helios not to rise for those three days. Satirical author Lucian of Samosata dramatized this myth in one of his \"Dialogues of the Gods\".\nWhile Heracles was travelling to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon for his tenth labour, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely (Pherecydes wrote that Heracles stretched his arrow at him menacingly, but Helios ordered him to stop, and Heracles in fear desisted); In turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail across the sea every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles's actions immensely bold. In the versions delivered by Apollodorus and Pherecydes, Heracles was only \"about to\" shoot Helios, but according to Panyassis, he \"did\" shoot and wounded the god.\nSolar eclipses.\nSolar eclipses were phaenomena of fear as well as wonder in Ancient Greece, and were seen as the Sun abandoning humanity. According to a fragment of Archilochus, it is Zeus who blocks Helios and makes him disappear from the sky. In one of his paeans, the lyric poet Pindar describes a solar eclipse as the Sun's light being hidden from the world, a bad omen of destruction and doom:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Beam of the sun! What have you contrived, observant one, mother of eyes, highest star, in concealing yourself in broad daylight? Why have you made helpless men's strength and the path of wisdom, by rushing down a dark highway? Do you drive a stranger course than before? In the name of Zeus, swift driver of horses, I beg you, turn the universal omen, lady, into some painless prosperity for Thebes ... Do you bring a sign of some war or wasting of crops or a mass of snow beyond telling or ruinous strife or emptying of the sea on land or frost on the earth or a rainy summer flowing with raging water, or will you flood the land and create a new race of men from the beginning?\u2014\u200a\nHorses of Helios.\nSome lists, cited by Hyginus, of the names of horses that pulled Helios's chariot, are as follows. Scholarship acknowledges that, despite differences between the lists, the names of the horses always seem to refer to fire, flame, light and other luminous qualities.\nHyginus writes that according to Homer, the horses' names are Abraxas and Therbeeo; but Homer makes no mention of horses or chariot.\nAlexander of Aetolia, cited in Athenaeus, related that the magical herb grew on the island Thrinacia, which was sacred to Helios, and served as a remedy against fatigue for the sun god's horses. Aeschrion of Samos informed that it was known as the \"dog's-tooth\" and was believed to have been sown by Cronus.\nAwarding of Rhodes.\nAccording to Pindar, when the gods divided the earth among them, Helios was absent, and thus he got no lot of land. He complained to Zeus about it, who offered to do the division of portions again, but Helios refused the offer, for he had seen a new land emerging from the deep of the sea; a rich, productive land for humans and good for cattle too. Helios asked for this island to be given to him, and Zeus agreed to it, with Lachesis (one of the three Fates) raising her hands to confirm the oath. Alternatively in another tradition, it was Helios himself who made the island rise from the sea when he caused the water which had overflowed it to disappear. He named it Rhodes, after his lover Rhode (the daughter of Poseidon and Aphrodite or Amphitrite), and it became the god's sacred island, where he was honoured above all other gods. With Rhode Helios sired seven sons, known as the Heliadae (\"sons of the Sun\"), who became the first rulers of the island, as well as one daughter, Electryone. Three of their grandsons founded the cities Ialysos, Camiros and Lindos on the island, named after themselves; thus Rhodes came to belong to him and his line, with the autochthonous peoples of Rhodes claiming descend from the Heliadae.\nPhaethon.\nThe most well known story about Helios is the one involving his son Phaethon, who asked him to drive his chariot for a single day. Although all versions agree that Phaethon eventually got to drive Helios's chariot, and that he failed in his task with disastrous results, there are a great number of details that vary by version, including the identity of Phaethon's mother, the location the story takes place, the role Phaethon's sisters the Heliades play, the motivation behind Phaethon's decision to ask his father Helios for such thing, and even the exact relation between the god and the mortals involved.\nTraditionally, Phaethon was Helios's son by the Oceanid nymph Clymene, or alternatively Rhode or the otherwise unknown Prote. In one version of the story, Phaethon is Helios's grandson, rather than son, through the boy's father Clymenus. In this version, Phaethon's mother is an Oceanid nymph named Merope.\nIn Euripides's lost play \"Phaethon\", surviving only in twelve fragments, Phaethon is the product of an illicit liaison between his mother Clymene (who is now married to Merops, the king of Aethiopia) and Helios, though she claimed that her lawful husband was the father of her all her children. Clymene reveals the truth to her son, and urges him to travel east to get confirmation from his father after she informs him that Helios promised to grant their child any wish when he slept with her. Although reluctant at first, Phaethon is convinced and sets on to find his birth father. In a surviving fragment from the play, Helios accompanies his son in his ill-fated journey in the skies, trying to give him instructions on how to drive the chariot while he rides on a spare horse named Sirius, as someone, perhaps a paedagogus informs Clymene of Phaethon's fate, who is probably accompanied by slave women:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Take, for instance, that passage in which Helios, in handing the reins to his son, says\u2014\n\"Drive on, but shun the burning Libyan tract;\nThe hot dry air will let thine axle down:\nToward the seven Pleiades keep thy steadfast way.\"\nAnd then\u2014\n\"This said, his son undaunted snatched the reins,\nThen smote the winged coursers' sides: they bound\nForth on the void and cavernous vault of air.\nHis father mounts another steed, and rides\nWith warning voice guiding his son. 'Drive there!\nTurn, turn thy car this way.\"\nIf this messenger did witness the flight himself, it is possible there was also a passage where he described Helios taking control over the bolting horses in the same manner as Lucretius described. Phaethon inevitably dies; a fragment near the end of the play has Clymene order the slave girls hide Phaethon's still-smouldering body from Merops, and laments Helios's role in her son's death, saying he destroyed him and her both. Near the end of the play it seems that Merops, having found out about Clymene's affair and Phaethon's true parentage, tries to kill her; her eventual fate is unclear, but it has been suggested she is saved by some deus ex machina. A number of deities have been proposed for the identity of this possible deus ex machina, with Helios among them.\nIn Ovid's account, Zeus's son Epaphus mocks Phaethon's claim that he is the son of the sun god; his mother Clymene tells Phaethon to go to Helios himself, to ask for confirmation of his paternity. Helios promises him on the river Styx any gift that he might ask as a proof of paternity; Phaethon asks for the privilege to drive Helios's chariot for a single day. Although Helios warns his son of how dangerous and disastrous this would be, he is nevertheless unable to change Phaethon's mind or revoke his promise. Phaethon takes the reins, and the earth burns when he travels too low, and freezes when he takes the chariot too high. Zeus strikes Phaethon with lightning, killing him. Helios refuses to resume his job, but he returns to his task and duty at the appeal of the other gods, as well as Zeus's threats. He then takes his anger out on his four horses, whipping them in fury for causing his son's death.\nNonnus of Panopolis presented a slightly different version of the myth, narrated by Hermes; according to him, Helios met and fell in love with Clymene, the daughter of the Ocean, and the two soon got married with her father's blessing. When he grows up, fascinated with his father's job, he asks him to drive his chariot for a single day. Helios does his best to dissuade him, arguing that sons are not necessarily fit to step into their fathers' shoes. But under pressure of Phaethon and Clymene's begging both, he eventually gives in. As per all other versions of the myth, Phaethon's ride is catastrophic and ends in his death.\nHyginus wrote that Phaethon secretly mounted his father's car without said father's knowledge and leave, but with the aid of his sisters the Heliades who yoked the horses.\nIn all retellings, Helios recovers the reins in time, thus saving the earth. Another consistent detail across versions are that Phaethon's sisters the Heliades mourn him by the Eridanus and are turned into black poplar trees, who shed tears of amber. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, it was Helios who turned them into trees, for their honour to Phaethon. In one version of the myth, Helios conveyed his dead son to the stars, as a constellation (the Auriga).\nThe Watchman.\nPersephone.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nHelios is said to have seen and stood witness to everything that happened where his light shone. When Hades abducts Persephone, Helios is the only one to witness it.\nIn Ovid's \"Fasti\", Demeter asks the stars first about Persephone's whereabouts, and it is Helice who advises her to go ask Helios. Demeter is not slow to approach him, and Helios then tells her not to waste time, and seek out for \"the queen of the third world\".\nAres and Aphrodite.\nIn another myth, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, but she cheated on him with his brother Ares, god of war. In Book Eight of the \"Odyssey\", the blind singer Demodocus describes how the illicit lovers committed adultery, until one day Helios caught them in the act, and immediately informed Aphrodite's husband Hephaestus. Upon learning that, Hephaestus forged a net so thin it could hardly be seen, in order to ensnare them. He then announced that he was leaving for Lemnos. Upon hearing that, Ares went to Aphrodite and the two lovers coupled. Once again Helios informed Hephaestus, who came into the room and trapped them in the net. He then called the other gods to witness the humiliating sight.\nMuch later versions add a young man to the story, a warrior named Alectryon, tasked by Ares to stand guard should anyone approach. But Alectryon fell asleep, allowing Helios to discover the two lovers and inform Hephaestus. For this, Aphrodite hated Helios and his race for all time. In some versions, she cursed his daughter Pasipha\u00eb to fall in love with the Cretan Bull as revenge against him. Pasipha\u00eb's daughter Phaedra's passion for her step-son Hippolytus was also said to have been inflicted on her by Aphrodite for this same reason.\nLeucothoe and Clytie.\nAphrodite aims to enact her revenge by making Helios fall for a mortal princess named Leucothoe, forgetting his previous lover the Oceanid Clytie for her sake. Helios watches her from above, even making the winter days longer so he can have more time looking at her. Taking the form of her mother Eurynome, Helios enters their palace, entering the girl's room before revealing himself to her.\nHowever, Clytie informs Leucothoe's father Orchamus of this affair, and he buries Leucothoe alive in the earth. Helios comes too late to rescue her, so instead he pours nectar into the earth, and turns the dead Leucothoe into a frankincense tree. Clytie, spurned by Helios for her role in his lover's death, strips herself naked, accepting no food or drink, and sits on a rock for nine days, pining after him, until eventually turning into a purple, sun-gazing flower, the heliotrope. This myth, it has been theorized, might have been used to explain the use of frankincense aromatic resin in Helios's worship. Leucothoe being buried alive as punishment by a male guardian, which is not too unlike Antigone's own fate, may also indicate an ancient tradition involving human sacrifice in a vegetation cult. At first the stories of Leucothoe and Clytie might have been two distinct myths concerning Helios which were later combined along with a third story, that of Helios discovering Ares and Aphrodite's affair and then informing Hephaestus, into a single tale either by Ovid himself or his source.\nOther.\nIn Sophocles's play \"Ajax\", Ajax the Great, minutes before committing suicide, calls upon Helios to stop his golden reins when he reaches Ajax's native land of Salamis and inform his aging father Telamon and his mother of their son's fate and death, and salutes him one last time before he kills himself.\nInvolvement in wars.\nHelios sides with the other gods in several battles. Surviving fragments from \"Titanomachy\" imply scenes where Helios is the only one among the Titans to have abstained from attacking the Olympian gods, and they, after the war was over, gave him a place in the sky and awarded him with his chariot.\nHe also takes part in the Giant wars; it was said by Pseudo-Apollodorus that during the battle of the Giants against the gods, the giant Alcyoneus stole Helios's cattle from Erytheia where the god kept them, or alternatively, that it was Alcyoneus's very theft of the cattle that started the war. Because the earth goddess Gaia, mother and ally of the Giants, learned of the prophecy that the giants would perish at the hand of a mortal, she sought to find a magical herb that would protect them and render them practically indestructible; thus Zeus ordered Helios, as well as his sisters Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn) not to shine, and harvested all of the plant for himself, denying Gaia the opportunity to make the Giants immortal, while Athena summoned the mortal Heracles to fight by their side.\nAt some point during the battle of gods and giants in Phlegra, Helios takes up an exhausted Hephaestus on his chariot. After the war ends, one of the giants, Picolous, flees to Aeaea, where Helios's daughter, Circe, lived. He attempted to chase Circe away from the island, only to be killed by Helios. From the blood of the slain giant that dripped on the earth a new plant was sprang, the herb moly, named thus from the battle (\"malos\" in Ancient Greek).\nHelios is depicted in the Pergamon Altar, waging war against Giants next to Eos, Selene, and Theia in the southern frieze.\nClashes and punishments.\nGods.\nA myth about the origin of Corinth goes as such: Helios and Poseidon clashed as to who would get to have the city. The Hecatoncheir Briareos was tasked to settle the dispute between the two gods; he awarded the Acrocorinth to Helios, while Poseidon was given the isthmus of Corinth.\nAelian wrote that Nerites was the son of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. In the version where Nerites became the lover of Poseidon, it is said that Helios turned him into a shellfish, for reasons unknown. At first Aelian writes that Helios was resentful of the boy's speed, but when trying to explain why he changed his form, he suggests that perhaps Poseidon and Helios were rivals in love.\nIn an Aesop fable, Helios and the north wind god Boreas argued about which one between them was the strongest god. They agreed that whoever was able to make a passing traveller remove his cloak would be declared the winner. Boreas was the one to try his luck first; but no matter how hard he blew, he could not remove the man's cloak, instead making him wrap his cloak around him even tighter. Helios shone bright then, and the traveller, overcome with the heat, removed his cloak, giving him the victory. The moral is that persuasion is better than force.\nMortals.\nRelating to his nature as the Sun, Helios was presented as a god who could restore and deprive people of vision, as it was regarded that his light that made the faculty of sight and enabled visible things to be seen. In one myth, after Orion was blinded by King Oenopion, he traveled to the east, where he met Helios. Helios then healed Orion's eyes, restoring his eyesight.\nIn Phineus's story, his blinding, as reported in Apollonius Rhodius's \"Argonautica\", was Zeus's punishment for Phineus revealing the future to mankind. According, however, to one of the alternative versions, it was Helios who had deprived Phineus of his sight. Pseudo-Oppian wrote that Helios's wrath was due to some obscure victory of the prophet; after Calais and Zetes slew the Harpies tormenting Phineus, Helios then turned him into a mole, a blind creature. In yet another version, he blinded Phineus at the request of his son Ae\u00ebtes.\nIn another tale, the Athenian inventor Daedalus and his young son Icarus fashioned themselves wings made of birds' feathers glued together with wax and flew away. According to scholia on Euripides, Icarus, being young and rashful, thought himself greater than Helios. Angered, Helios hurled his rays at him, melting the wax and plunging Icarus into the sea to drown. Later, it was Helios who decreed that said sea would be named after the unfortunate youth, the Icarian Sea.\nArge was a huntress who, while hunting down a particularly fast stag, claimed that fast as the Sun as it was, she would eventually catch up to it. Helios, offended by the girl's words, changed her shape into that of a doe.\nIn one rare version of Smyrna's tale, it was an angry Helios who cursed her to fall in love with her own father Cinyras because of some unspecified offence the girl committed against him; in the vast majority of other versions however, the culprit behind Smyrna's curse is the goddess of love Aphrodite.\nOxen of the Sun.\nHelios is said to have kept his sheep and cattle on his sacred island of Thrinacia, or in some cases Erytheia. Each flock numbers fifty beasts, totaling 350 cows and 350 sheep\u2014the number of days of the year in the early Ancient Greek calendar; the seven herds correspond to the week, containing seven days. The cows did not breed or die. In the \"Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes\", after Hermes has been brought before Zeus by an angry Apollo for stealing Apollo's sacred cows, the young god excuses himself for his actions and says to his father that \"I reverence Helios greatly and the other gods\".\nAugeas, who in some versions is his son, safe-keeps a herd of twelve bulls sacred to the god. Moreover, it was said that Augeas's enormous herd of cattle was a gift to him by his father.\nApollonia in Illyria was another place where he kept a flock of his sheep; a man named Peithenius had been put in charge of them, but the sheep were devoured by wolves. The other Apolloniates, thinking he had been neglectful, gouged out Peithenius's eyes. Angered over the man's treatment, Helios made the earth grow barren and ceased to bear fruit; the earth grew fruitful again only after the Apolloniates had propitiated Peithenius by craft, and by two suburbs and a house he picked out, pleasing the god. This story is also attested by Greek historian Herodotus, who calls the man Evenius.\nOdyssey.\nDuring Odysseus's journey to get back home, he arrives at the island of Circe, who warns him not to touch Helios's sacred cows once he reaches Thrinacia, or the god would keep them from returning home. Though Odysseus warns his men, when supplies run short they kill and eat some of the cattle. The guardians of the island, Helios's daughters Phaethusa and Lampetia, tell their father about this. Helios then appeals to Zeus telling him to dispose of Odysseus's men, rejecting the crewmen's compensation of a new temple in Ithaca. Zeus destroys the ship with his lightning bolt, killing all the men except for Odysseus.\nOther works.\nHelios is featured in several of Lucian's works beyond his \"Dialogues of the Gods\". In another work of Lucian's, \"Icaromenippus\", Selene complains to the titular character about philosophers wanting to stir up strife between herself and Helios. Later he is seen feasting with the other gods on Olympus, and prompting Menippus to wonder how can night fall on the Heavens while he is there.\nDiodorus Siculus recorded an unorthodox version of the myth, in which Basileia, who had succeeded her father Uranus to his royal throne, married her brother Hyperion, and had two children, a son Helios and a daughter Selene. Because Basileia's other brothers envied these offspring, they put Hyperion to the sword and drowned Helios in the river Eridanus, while Selene took her own life. After the massacre, Helios appeared in a dream to his grieving mother and assured her and their murderers would be punished, and that he and his sister would now be transformed into immortal, divine natures; what was known as Mene would now be called Selene, and the \"holy fire\" in the heavens would bear his own name.\nIt was said that Selene, when preoccupied with her passion for the mortal Endymion, would give her moon chariot to Helios to drive it.\nClaudian wrote that in his infancy, Helios was nursed by his aunt Tethys.\nPausanias writes that the people of Titane held that Titan was a brother of Helios, the first inhabitant of Titane after whom the town was named; Titan however was generally identified as Helios himself, instead of being a separate figure.\nAccording to sixth century BC lyric poet Stesichorus, with Helios in his palace lives his mother Theia.\nIn the myth of the dragon Python's slaying by Apollo, the slain serpent's corpse is said to have rotten in the strength of the \"shining Hyperion\".\nConsorts and children.\nThe god Helios is typically depicted as the head of a large family, and the places that venerated him the most would also typically claim both mythological and genealogical descent from him; for example, the Cretans traced the ancestry of their king Idomeneus to Helios through his daughter Pasipha\u00eb.\nTraditionally the Oceanid nymph Perse was seen as the sun god's wife by whom he had various children, most notably Circe, Ae\u00ebtes, Minos's wife Pasipha\u00eb, Perses, and in some versions the Corinthian king Aloeus. Ioannes Tzetzes adds Calypso, otherwise the daughter of Atlas, to the list of children Helios had by Perse, perhaps due to the similarities of the roles and personalities she and Circe display in the \"Odyssey\" as hosts of Odysseus.\nAt some point Helios warned Ae\u00ebtes of a prophecy that stated he would suffer treachery from one of his own offspring (which Ae\u00ebtes took to mean his daughter Chalciope and her children by Phrixus). Helios also bestowed several gifts on his son, such as a chariot with swift steeds, a golden helmet with four plates, a giant's war armor, and robes and a necklace as a pledge of fatherhood. When his daughter Medea betrays him and flees with Jason after stealing the golden fleece, Ae\u00ebtes calls upon his father and Zeus to witness their unlawful actions against him and his people.\nAs father of Ae\u00ebtes, Helios was also the grandfather of Medea and would play a significant role in Euripides's rendition of her fate in Corinth. When Medea offers Princess Glauce the poisoned robes and diadem, she says they were gifts to her from Helios. Later, after Medea has caused the deaths of Glauce and King Creon, as well as her own children, Helios helps her escape Corinth and her husband. In Seneca's rendition of the story, a frustrated Medea criticizes the inaction of her grandfather, wondering why he has not darkened the sky at sight of such wickedness, and asks from him his fiery chariot so she can burn Corinth to the ground.\nHowever, he is also stated to have married other women instead like Rhodos in the Rhodian tradition, by whom he had seven sons, the Heliadae (Ochimus, Cercaphus, Macar, Actis, Tenages, Triopas, Candalus), and the girl Electryone.\nIn Nonnus's account from the \"Dionysiaca\", Helios and the nymph Clymene met and fell in love with each other in the mythical island of Kerne and got married. Soon Clymene fell pregnant with Phaetheon. Her and Helios raised their child together, until the ill-fated day the boy asked his father for his chariot. A passage from Greek anthology mentions Helios visiting Clymene in her room.\nThe mortal king of Elis Augeas was said to be Helios's son, but Pausanias states that his actual father was the mortal king Eleios.\nIn some rare versions, Helios is the father, rather than the brother, of his sisters Selene and Eos. A scholiast on Euripides explained that Selene was said to be his daughter since she partakes of the solar light, and changes her shape based on the position of the sun.\nWorship.\nCult.\nArchaic and Classical Athens.\nScholarly focus on the ancient Greek cults of Helios has generally been rather slim, partially due to how scarce both literary and archaeological sources are. L.R. Farnell assumed \"that sun-worship had once been prevalent and powerful among the people of the pre-Hellenic culture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion\". The largely Attic literary sources used by scholars present ancient Greek religion with an Athenian bias, and, according to J. Burnet, \"no Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene, but he might think them to be gods, since Helios was the great god of Rhodes and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere\".Aristophanes's \"Peace\" (406\u2013413) contrasts the worship of Helios and Selene with that of the more essentially Greek Twelve Olympians.\nThe tension between the mainstream traditional religious veneration of Helios, which had become enriched with ethical values, poetical symbolism, and the Ionian proto-scientific examination of the sun, clashed in the trial of Anaxagoras c. 450 BC, in which Anaxagoras asserted that the Sun was in fact a gigantic red-hot ball of metal.\nHellenistic period.\nHelios was not worshipped in Athens until the Hellenistic period, in post-classical times. His worship might be described as a product of the Hellenistic era, influenced perhaps by the general spread of cosmic and astral beliefs during the reign of Alexander III. A scholiast on Sophocles wrote that the Athenians did not offer wine as an offering to the Helios among other gods, making instead \"nephalia\", or \"wineless\", sober sacrifices; Athenaeus also reported that those who sacrificed to him did not offer wine, but brought honey instead, to the altars reasoning that the god who held the cosmos in order should not succumb to drunkenness.\nLysimachides in the first century BC or first century AD reported of a festival Skira:\nthat the skiron is a large sunshade under which the priestess of Athena, the priest of Poseidon, and the priest of Helios walk as it is carried from the acropolis to a place called Skiron.\nDuring the Thargelia, a festival in honour of Apollo, the Athenians had cereal offerings for Helios and the Horae. They were honoured with a procession, due to their clear connections and relevance to agriculture. Helios and the Horae were also apparently worshipped during another Athenian festival held in honor of Apollo, the Pyanopsia, with a feast; an attested procession, independent from the one recorded at the Thargelia, might have been in their honour.\nSide B of LSCG 21.B19 from the Piraeus Asclepium prescribe cake offerings to several gods, among them Helios and Mnemosyne, two gods linked to incubation through dreams, who are offered a type of honey cake called \"arester\" and a honeycomb. The cake was put on fire during the offering. A type of cake called \"orthostates\" made of wheaten and barley flour was offered to him and the Hours. Phthois, another flat cake made with cheese, honey and wheat was also offered to him among many other gods.\nIn many places people kept herds of red and white cattle in his honour, and white animals of several kinds, but especially white horses, were considered to be sacred to him. Ovid writes that horses were sacrificed to him because no slow animal should be offered to the swift god.\nIn Plato's \"Republic\" Helios, the Sun, is the symbolic offspring of the idea of the Good.\nThe ancient Greeks called Sunday \"day of the Sun\" () after him. According to Philochorus, Athenian historian and Atthidographer of the 3rd century BC, the first day of each month was sacred to Helios.\nIt was during the Roman period that Helios actually rose into an actual significant religious figure and was elevated in public cult.\nRhodes.\nThe island of Rhodes was an important cult center for Helios, one of the only places where he was worshipped as a major deity in ancient Greece. One of Pindar's most notable greatest odes is an abiding memorial of the devotion of the island of Rhodes to the cult and personality of Helios, and all evidence points that he was for the Rhodians what Olympian Zeus was for Elis or Athena for the Athenians; their local myths, especially those concerning the Heliadae, suggest that Helios in Rhodes was revered as the founder of their race and their civilization.\nThe worship of Helios at Rhodes included a ritual in which a quadriga, or chariot drawn by four horses, was driven over a precipice into the sea, in reenactment to the myth of Phaethon. Annual gymnastic tournaments were held in Helios's honor; according to Festus (s. v. October Equus) during the Halia each year the Rhodians would also throw quadrigas dedicated to him into the sea. Horse sacrifice was offered to him in many places, but only in Rhodes in teams of four; a team of four horses was also sacrificed to Poseidon in Illyricum, and the sea god was also worshipped in Lindos under the epithet Hippios, denoting perhaps a blending of the cults.\nIt was believed that if one sacrificed to the rising Sun with their day's work ahead of them, it would be proper to offer a fresh, bright white horse.\nThe Colossus of Rhodes was dedicated to him. In Xenophon of Ephesus's work of fiction, \"Ephesian Tale of Anthia and Habrocomes\", the protagonist Anthia cuts and dedicates some of her hair to Helios during his festival at Rhodes. The Rhodians called shrine of Helios, Haleion ().\nA colossal statue of the god, known as the Colossus of Rhodes and named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was erected in his honour and adorned the port of the city of Rhodes.\nThe best of these are, first, the Colossus of Helius, of which the author of the iambic verse says, \"seven times ten cubits in height, the work of Chares the Lindian\"; but it now lies on the ground, having been thrown down by an earthquake and broken at the knees. In accordance with a certain oracle, the people did not raise it again.\nAccording to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or high \u2013 approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown \u2013 making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. It collapsed after an earthquake that hit Rhodes in 226 BC, and the Rhodians did not build it again, in accordance with an oracle.\nIn Rhodes, Helios seems to have absorbed the worship and cult of the island's local hero and mythical founder Tlepolemus. In ancient Greek city foundation, the use of the \"archegetes\" in its double sense of both founder and progenitor of a political order, or a polis, can be seen with Rhodes; real prominence was transferred from the local hero Tlepolemus, onto the god, Helios, with an appropriate myth explaining his relative insignificance; thus games originally celebrated for Tlepolemus were now given to Helios, who was seen as both ancestor and founder of the polis. A sanctuary of Helios and the nymphs stood in Loryma near Lindos.\nThe priesthood of Helios was, at some point, appointed by lot, though in the great city a man and his two sons held the office of priesthood for the sun god in succession.\nPeloponnese.\nThe scattering of cults in Sicyon, Argos, Hermione, Epidaurus and Laconia seem to suggest that Helios was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared to other parts of ancient Greece. It may have been the Dorians who brought his worship to Rhodes.\nHelios was an important god in Corinth and the greater Corinthia region. Pausanias in his \"Description of Greece\" describes how Helios and Poseidon vied over the city, with Poseidon getting the isthmus of Corinth and Helios being awarded with the Acrocorinth. Helios's prominence in Corinth might go as back as Mycenaean times, and predate Poseidon's arrival, or it might be due to Oriental immigration. At Sicyon, Helios had an altar behind Hera's sanctuary. It would seem that for the Corinthians, Helios was notable enough to even have control over thunder, which is otherwise the domain of the sky god Zeus.\nHelios had a cult in Laconia as well. Taletos, a peak of Mt. Taygetus, was sacred to Helios. At Thalamae, Helios together with his daughter Pasipha\u00eb were revered in an oracle, where the goddess revealed to the people consulting her what they needed to know in their dreams. While the predominance of Helios in Sparta is currently unclear, it seems Helen was the local solar deity. Helios (and Selene's) worship in Gytheum, near Sparta, is attested by an inscription (\"C.I.G. 1392\").\nIn Argolis, an altar was dedicated to Helios near Mycenae, and another in Troezen, where he was worshipped as the God of Freedom, seeing how the Troezenians had escaped slavery at the hands of Xerxes I. Over at Hermione stood a temple of his. He appears to have also been venerated in Epidaurus.\nIn Arcadia, he had a cult in Megalopolis as the Saviour, and an altar near Mantineia.\nElsewhere.\nTraces of Helios's worship can also be found in Crete. In the earliest period Rhodes stood in close relations with Crete, and it is relatively safe to suggest that the name \"Taletos\" is associated with the Eteocretan word for the sun \"Talos\", surviving in Zeus's epithet Tallaios, a solar aspect of the thunder god in Crete. Helios was also invoked in an oath of alliance between Knossos and Dreros.\nIn his little-attested cults in Asia Minor it seems his identification with Apollo was the strongest. It is possible that the solar elements of Apollo's Anatolian cults were influenced by Helios's cult in Rhodes, as Rhodes lies right off the southwest coast of Asia Minor.\nArchaeological evidence has proven the existence of a shrine to Helios and Hemera, the goddess of the day and daylight, at the island of Kos and excavations have revealed traces of his cult at Sinope, Pozzuoli, Ostia and elsewhere. After a plague hit the city of Cleonae, in Phocis, Central Greece, the people there sacrificed a he-goat to Helios, and were reportedly then spared from the plague.\nHelios also had a cult in the region of Thessaly. Plato in his \"Laws\" mentions the state of the Magnetes making a joint offering to Helios and Apollo, indicating a close relationship between the cults of those two gods, but it is clear that they were nevertheless distinct deities in Thessaly.\nHelios is also depicted on first century BC coins found at Halicarnassus, Syracuse in Sicily and at Zacynthus. From Pergamon originates a hymn to Helios in the style of Euripides.\nIn Apollonia he was also venerated, as evidenced from Herodotus's account where a man named Evenius was harshly punished by his fellow citizens for allowing wolves to devour the flock of sheep sacred to the god out of negligence.\nThe \"Alexander Romance\" names a temple of Helios in the city of Alexandria.\nOther functions.\nIn oath-keeping.\nGods were often called upon by the Greeks when an oath was sworn; Helios is among the three deities to be invoked in the \"Iliad\" to witness the truce between Greeks and Trojans. He is also often appealed to in ancient drama to witness the unfolding events or take action, such as in \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"Medea\". The notion of Helios as witness to oaths and vows also led to a view of Helios as a witness of wrong-doings. He was thus seen as a guarantor of cosmic order.\nHelios was invoked as a witness to several alliances such as the one between Athens and Cetriporis, Lyppeus of Paeonia and Grabus, and the oaths of the League of Corinth. In a treaty between the cities of Smyrna and Magnesia, the Magnesians swore their oath by Helios among others. The combination of Zeus, Gaia and Helios in oath-swearing is also found among the non-Greek 'Royal Gods' in an agreement between Maussollus and Phaselis (360s BC) and in the Hellenistic period with the degree of Chremonides's announcing the alliance of Athens and Sparta.\nIn magic.\nHe also had a role in necromancy magic. The Greek Magical Papyri contain several recipes for such, for example one which involves invoking the Sun over the skull-cup of a man who suffered a violent death; after the described ritual, Helios will then send the man's ghost to the practitioner to tell them everything they wish to know. Helios is also associated with Hecate in cursing magic. In some parts of Asia Minor Helios was adjured not to permit any violation of the grave in tomb inscriptions and to warn potential violators not to desecrate the tomb, like one example from Elaeussa-Sebaste in Cilicia:\nWe adjure you by the heavenly god [Zeus] and Helios and Selene and the gods of the underworld, who receive us, that no one [. . .] will throw another corpse upon our bones.\nHelios was also often invoked in funeral imprecations. Helios might have been chosen for this sort of magic because as an all-seeing god he could see everything on earth, even hidden crimes, and thus he was a very popular god to invoke in prayers for vengeance. Additionally, in ancient magic evil-averting aid and apotropaic defense were credited to Helios. Some magic rituals were associated with the engraving of images and stones, as with one such spell which asks Helios to consecrate the stone and fill with luck, honour, success and strength, thus giving the user incredible power.\nHelios was also associated with love magic, much like Aphrodite, as there seems to have been another but rather poorly documented tradition of people asking him for help in such love matters, including homosexual love and magical recipes invoking him for affection spells.\nIn dreams.\nIt has been suggested that in Ancient Greece people would reveal their dreams to Helios and the sky or the air in order to avert any evil foretold or presaged in them.\nAccording to Artemidorus's \"Oneirocritica\", the rich dreaming of transforming into a god was an auspicious sign, as long as the transformation had no deficiencies, citing the example of a man who dreamt he was Helios but wore a sun crown of just eleven rays. He wrote that the sun god was also an auspicious sign for the poor. In dreams, Helios could either appear in 'sensible' form (the orb of the sun) or his 'intelligible' form (the humanoid god).\nLate antiquity.\nBy Late Antiquity, Helios had accumulated a number of religious, mythological, and literary elements from other deities, particularly Apollo and the Roman sun god Sol. In 274 AD, on December 25, the Roman Emperor Aurelian instituted an official state cult to Sol Invictus (or \"Helios Megistos\", \"Great Helios\"). This new cult drew together imagery not only associated with Helios and Sol, but also a number of syncretic elements from other deities formerly recognized as distinct. Helios in these works is frequently equated not only with deities such as Mithras and Harpocrates, but even with the monotheistic Judaeo-Christian god.\nThe last pagan emperor of Rome, Julian, made Helios the primary deity of his revived pagan religion, which combined elements of Mithraism with Neoplatonism. For Julian, Helios was a triunity: The One; Helios-Mithras; and the Sun. Because the primary location of Helios in this scheme was the \"middle\" realm, Julian considered him to be a mediator and unifier not just of the three realms of being, but of all things. Julian's theological conception of Helios has been described as \"practically monotheistic\", in contrast to earlier Neoplatonists like Iamblichus.\nA mosaic found in the Vatican Necropolis (mausoleum\u00a0M) depicts a figure very similar in style to Sol / Helios, crowned with solar rays and driving a solar chariot. Some scholars have interpreted this as a depiction of Christ, noting that Clement of Alexandria wrote of Christ driving his chariot across the sky. Some scholars doubt the Christian associations, or suggest that the figure is merely a non-religious representation of the sun.\nIn the Greek Magical Papyri.\nHelios figured prominently in the Greek Magical Papyri. In these mostly fragmentary texts, Helios is credited with a broad domain, being regarded as the creator of life, the lord of the heavens and the cosmos, and the god of the sea. He is said to take the form of 12 animals representing each hour of the day, a motif also connected with the 12 signs of the zodiac.\nThe Papyri often syncretize Helios with a variety of related deities. He is described as \"seated on a lotus, decorated with rays\", in the manner of Harpocrates, who was often depicted seated on a lotus flower, representing the rising sun.\nHelios is also assimilated with Mithras in some of the Papyri, as he was by Emperor Julian. The Mithras Liturgy combines them as Helios-Mithras, who is said to have revealed the secrets of immortality to the magician who wrote the text. Some of the texts describe Helios-Mithras navigating the Sun's path not in a chariot but in a boat, an apparent identification with the Egyptian sun god Ra. Helios is also described as \"restraining the serpent\", likely a reference to Apophis, the serpent god who, in Egyptian myth, is said to attack Ra's ship during his nightly journey through the underworld.\nIn many of the Papyri, Helios is also strongly identified with Iao, a name derived from that of the Hebrew god Yahweh, and shares several of his titles including Sabaoth and Adonai. He is also assimilated as the Agathos Daemon, who is also identified elsewhere in the texts as \"the greatest god, lord Horus Harpokrates\".\nThe Neoplatonist philosophers Proclus and Iamblichus attempted to interpret many of the syntheses found in the Greek Magical Papyri and other writings that regarded Helios as all-encompassing, with the attributes of many other divine entities. Proclus described Helios as a cosmic god consisting of many forms and traits. These are \"coiled up\" within his being, and are variously distributed to all that \"participate in his nature\", including angels, daemons, souls, animals, herbs, and stones. All of these things were important to the Neoplatonic practice of theurgy, magical rituals intended to invoke the gods in order to ultimately achieve union with them. Iamblichus noted that theurgy often involved the use of \"stones, plants, animals, aromatic substances, and other such things holy and perfect and godlike.\" For theurgists, the elemental power of these items sacred to particular gods utilizes a kind of sympathetic magic.\nEpithets.\nThe Greek sun god had various bynames or epithets, which over time in some cases came to be considered separate deities associated with the Sun. Among these are:\nAcamas (; ; , \"Ak\u00e0mas\"), meaning \"tireless, unwearying\", as he repeats his never-ending routine day after day without cease.\nApollo (; ; , \"Ap\u00f3ll\u014dn\") here understood to mean \"destroyer\", the sun as a more destructive force.\nCallilampetes (; ; , \"Kallilamp\u00e9t\u0113s\"), \"he who glows lovely\".\nElasippus (; ; , \"El\u00e1sippos\"), meaning \"horse-driving\".\nElector (; ; , \"\u0112l\u00e9kt\u014dr\") of uncertain derivation (compare \"Electra\"), often translated as \"beaming\" or \"radiant\", especially in the combination \"\u0112lekt\u014dr Hyperi\u014dn\".\nEleutherius (; ; , \"Eleuth\u00e9rios) \"the liberator\", epithet under which he was worshipped in Troezen in Argolis, also shared with Dionysus and Eros.\nHagnus (; ; , Hagn\u00f3s), meaning \"pure\", \"sacred\" or \"purifying.\"\nHecatus (; ; , \"H\u00e9katos\"), \"from afar,\" also Hecatebolus (; ; , \"Hekat\u1e17bolos\") \"the far-shooter\", i.e. the sun's rays considered as arrows.\nHorotrophus (; ; , \"H\u043e\u0304rotr\u00f3phos\"), \"nurturer of the Seasons/Hours\", in combination with \"kouros\", \"youth\".\nHyperion (; ; , \"Hyper\u00ed\u014dn\") and Hyperionides (; ; , \"Hyperion\u00edd\u0113s\"), \"superus, high up\" and \"son of Hyperion\" respectively, the sun as the one who is above, and also the name of his father.\nIsodaetes (; ; , \"Isoda\u00edt\u0113s\"), literally \"he that distributes equal portions\", cult epithet also shared with Dionysus.\nPaean ( ; , \"Pai\u0101n\"), physician, healer, a healing god and an epithet of Apollo and Asclepius.\nPanoptes (; ; , \"Pan\u00f3pt\u0113s\") \"all-seeing\" and Pantepoptes (; ; , \"Pantep\u00f3pt\u0113s\") \"all-supervising\", as the one who witnessed everything that happened on earth.\nPasiphaes (; ; , \"Pasipha\u1e17s\"), \"all-shining\", also the name of one of his daughters.\nPatrius (; ; , \"P\u00e1trios\") \"of the fathers, ancestral\", related to his role as primogenitor of royal lines in several places.\nPhaethon (; ; , \"Pha\u00e9th\u014dn\") \"the radiant\", \"the shining\", also the name of his son and daughter.\nPhasimbrotus (; ; , \"Phas\u00edmbrotos\") \"he who sheds light to the mortals\", the sun.\nPhilonamatus (; ; , \"Philon\u00e1matos\") \"water-loving\", a reference to him rising from and setting in the ocean.\nPhoebus ( ; , \"Pho\u00eebos\"), literally \"bright\", several Roman authors applied Apollo's byname to their sun god Sol.\nSirius (; ; , \"Se\u00edrios\") literally meaning \"scorching\", and also the name of the Dog Star.\nSoter (; ; , \"S\u014dt\u1e17r\") \"the saviour\", epithet under which he was worshipped in Megalopolis, Arcadia.\nTerpsimbrotus (; ; , \"Terps\u00edmbrotos\") \"he who gladdens mortals\", with his warm, life-giving beams.\nTitan (; ; , \"Tit\u00e1n\"), possibly connected to meaning \"day\" and thus \"god of the day\".\nWhether Apollo's epithets \"Aegletes\" and \"Asgelatas\" in the island of Anaphe, both connected to light, were borrowed from epithets of Helios either directly or indirectly is hard to say.\nIdentification with other gods.\nApollo.\nHelios is sometimes identified with Apollo: \"Different names may refer to the same being,\" Walter Burkert argues, \"or else they may be consciously equated, as in the case of Apollo and Helios.\" Apollo was associated with the Sun as early as the fifth century BC, though widespread conflation between him and the Sun god was a later phaenomenon. The earliest certain reference to Apollo being identified with Helios appears in the surviving fragments of Euripides's play \"Phaethon\" in a speech near the end.\nBy Hellenistic times Apollo had become closely connected with the Sun in cult and Phoebus (Greek \u03a6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, \"bright\"), the epithet most commonly given to Apollo, was later applied by Latin poets to the Sun-god Sol.\nThe identification became a commonplace in philosophic and some Orphic texts. Pseudo-Eratosthenes writes about Orpheus in \"Placings Among the Stars\", section\u00a024:\nBut having gone down into Hades because of his wife and seeing what sort of things were there, he did not continue to worship Dionysus, because of whom he was famous, but he thought Helios to be the greatest of the gods, Helios whom he also addressed as Apollo. Rousing himself each night toward dawn and climbing the mountain called Pangaion, he would await the Sun's rising, so that he might see it first. Therefore, Dionysus, being angry with him, sent the Bassarides, as Aeschylus the tragedian says; they tore him apart and scattered the limbs.\nDionysus and Asclepius are sometimes also identified with this Apollo Helios.\nStrabo wrote that Artemis and Apollo were associated with Selene and Helios respectively due to the changes those two celestial bodies caused in the temperature of the air, as the twins were gods of pestilential diseases and sudden deaths. Pausanias also linked Apollo's association with Helios as a result of his profession as a healing god. In the \"Orphic Hymns\", Helios is addressed as Paean (\"healer\") and holding a golden lyre, both common descriptions for Apollo; similarly Apollo in his own hymn is described as Titan and shedding light to the mortals, both common epithets of Helios.\nAccording to Athenaeus, Telesilla wrote that the song sung in honour of Apollo is called the \"Sun-loving song\" (, \"philh\u0113li\u00e1s\"), that is, a song meant to make the Sun come forth from the clouds, sung by children in bad weather; but Julius Pollux describing a \"philhelias\" in greater detail makes no mention of Apollo, only Helios. Scythinus of Teos wrote that Apollo uses the bright light of the Sun (\"\") as his harp-quill and in a fragment of Timotheus's lyric, Helios is invoked as an archer with the invocation (a common way of addressing the two medicine gods), though it most likely was part of esoteric doctrine, rather than a popular and widespread belief.\nClassical Latin poets also used Phoebus as a byname for the Sun-god, whence come common references in later European poetry to Phoebus and his chariot as a metaphor for the Sun. Ancient Roman authors who used \"Phoebus\" for Sol as well as Apollo include Ovid, Virgil, Statius, and Seneca. Representations of Apollo with solar rays around his head in art also belong to the time of the Roman Empire, particularly under Emperor Elagabalus in 218-222 AD.\nUsil.\nThe Etruscan god of the Sun was Usil. His name appears on the bronze liver of Piacenza, next to \"Tiur\", the Moon. He appears, rising out of the sea, with a fireball in either outstretched hand, on an engraved Etruscan bronze mirror in late Archaic style. On Etruscan mirrors in Classical style, he appears with a halo. In ancient artwork, Usil is shown in close association with Thesan, the goddess of the dawn, something almost never seen with Helios and Eos, however in the area between Cetona and Chiusi a stone obelisk is found, whose relief decorations seem to have been interpreted as referring to a solar sanctuary: what appears to be a Sun boat, the heads of Helios and Thesan, and a cock, likewise referring to the Sunrise.\nZeus.\nHelios is also sometimes conflated in classical literature with the highest Olympian god, Zeus. An attested cult epithet of Zeus is \"Aleios Zeus\", or \"Zeus the Sun,\" from the Doric form of Helios's name. The inscribed base of Mammia's dedication to Helios and Zeus Meilichios, dating from the fourth or third century BC, is a fairly and unusually early evidence of the conjoint worship of Helios and Zeus. According to Plutarch, Helios is Zeus in his material form that one can interact with, and that's why Zeus owns the year, while the chorus in Euripides's \"Medea\" also link him to Zeus when they refer to Helios as \"light born from Zeus\". In his \"Orphic Hymn\", Helios is addressed as \"immortal Zeus\". In Crete, the cult of Zeus Tallaios had incorporated several solar elements into his worship; \"Talos\" was the local equivalent of Helios. Helios is referred either directly as Zeus's eye, or clearly implied to be. For instance, Hesiod effectively describes Zeus's eye as the Sun. This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto-Indo-European religion, in which the Sun is believed to have been envisioned as the eye of *\"Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25at\u1e17r\" (see Hvare-khshaeta). An Orphic saying, supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo, goes:\n \"Zeus, Hades, Helios-Dionysus, three gods in one godhead!\"\nThe Hellenistic period gave birth to Serapis, a Greco-Egyptian deity conceived by the Greeks as a chthonic aspect of Zeus, whose solar nature is indicated by the Sun crown and rays the Greeks depicted him with. Frequent joint dedications to \"Zeus-Serapis-Helios\" have been found all over the Mediterranean. There is evidence of Zeus being worshipped as a solar god in the Aegean island of Amorgos which, if correct, could mean that Sun elements in Zeus's worship could be as early as the fifth century BC.\nHades.\nHelios seems to have been connected to some degree with Hades, the god of the Underworld. A dedicatory inscription from Smyrna describes a 1st\u20132nd century sanctuary to \"God Himself\" as the most exalted of a group of six deities, including clothed statues of \"Plouton Helios\" and \"Koure Selene\", or in other words \"Pluto the Sun\" and \"Kore the Moon\". Roman poet Apuleius describes a rite in which the Sun appears at midnight to the initiate at the gates of Proserpina; the suggestion here is that this midnight Sun could be \"Plouton Helios\". Pluto-Helios seems to reflect the Egyptian idea of the nocturnal Sun that penetrated the realm of the dead.\nAn old oracle from Claros said that the names of Zeus, Hades, Helios, Dionysus and \"Jao\" all represented the Sun at different seasons. Macrobius wrote that Iao/Jao is \"Hades in winter, Zeus in spring, Helios in summer, and Iao in autumn.\"\nCronus.\nDiodorus Siculus reported that the Chaldeans called Cronus (Saturnus) by the name Helios, or the Sun, and he explained that this was because Saturn was the \"most conspicuous\" of the planets.\nMithras.\nHelios is frequently conflated with Mithras in iconography, as well as being worshipped alongside him as Helios-Mithras. The earliest artistic representations of the \"chariot god\" come from the Parthian period (3rd century) in Persia where there is evidence of rituals being performed for the sun god by Magi, indicating an assimilation of the worship of Helios and Mithras.\nIconography.\nDepiction and symbols.\nThe earliest depictions of Helios in a humanoid form date from the late sixth and early fifth centuries BC in Attic black-figure vases, and typically show him frontally as a bearded man on his chariot with a sun disk. A red-figure on a polychrome bobbin by a follower of the Brygos painter already signifies a shift in the god's depiction, painting him as a youthful, beardless figure. In later art, he is consistently drawn as beardless and young. In it, he is typically depicted with a radiant crown, with the right hand often raised, a gesture of power (which came to be a definitional feature of solar iconography), the left hand usually holding a whip or a globe.\nIn Rhodian coins, he was shown as a beardless god, with thick and flowing hair, surrounded by beams. He was also presented as a young man clad in tunic, with curling hair and wearing buskins. Just like Selene, who is sometimes depicted with a lunar disk rather than a crescent, Helios too has his own solar one instead of a sun crown in some depictions. It is likely that Helios's later image as a warrior-charioteer might be traced back to the Mycenaean period; the symbol of the disc of the sun is displayed in scenes of rituals from both Mycenae and Tiryns, and large amounts of chariots used by the Mycenaeans are recorded in Linear B tablets.\nIn archaic art, Helios rising in his chariot was a type of motive. Helios in ancient pottery is usually depicted rising from the sea in his four-horse chariot, either as a single figure or connecting to some myth, indicating that it takes place at dawn. An Attic black-figure vase shows Heracles sitting on the shores of the Ocean river, while next to him a pair of arrows protrude from Helios, crowned with a solar disk and driving his chariot.\nHelios adorned the east pediment of the Parthenon, along with Selene. Helios (again with Selene) also framed the birth of Aphrodite on the base of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Judgement of Paris, and possibly the birth of Pandora on the base of the Athena Parthenos statue. They were also featured in the pedimental group of the temple at Delphi. In dynamic Hellenistic art, Helios along with other luminary deities and Rhea-Cybele, representing reason, battle the Giants (who represent irrationality).\nIn Elis, he was depicted with rays coming out of his head in an image made of wood with gilded clothing and marble head, hands and feet. Outside the market of the city of Corinth stood a gateway on which stood two gilded chariots; one carrying Helios's son Phaethon, the other Helios himself.\nHelios appears infrequently in gold jewelry before Roman times; extant examples include a gold medallion with its bust from the Gulf of Elaia in Anatolia, where he's depicted frontally with a head of unruly hair, and a golden medallion of the Pelinna necklace.\nHis iconography, used by the Ptolemies after representations of Alexander the Great as Alexander-Helios, came to symbolize power and epiphany, and was borrowed by several Egyptian deities in the Roman period. Other rulers who had their portraits done with solar features include Ptolemy III Euergetes, one of the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt, of whom a bust with holes in the fillet for the sunrays and gold coins depicting him with a radiant halo on his head like Helios and holding the aegis exist.\nLate Roman era.\nHelios was also frequently depicted in mosaics, usually surrounded by the twelve zodiac signs and accompanied by Selene. From the third and fourth centuries CE onwards, the sun god was seen as an official imperial Roman god and thus appeared in various forms in monumental artworks. The cult of Helios/Sol had a notable function in Eretz Israel; Helios was Constantine the Great's patron, and so that ruler came to be identified with Helios. In his new capital city, Constantinople, Constantine recycled a statue of Helios to represent himself in his portrait, as Nero had done with Sol, which was not an uncommon practice among pagans. A considerable portion if not the majority of Jewish Helios material dates from the 3rd through the 6th centuries CE, including numerous mosaics of the god in Jewish synagogues and invocation in papyri.\nThe sun god was depicted in mosaics in three places of the Land of Israel; at the synagogues of Hammat Tiberias, Beth Alpha and Naaran. In the mosaic of the Hammat Tiberias, Helios is wrapped in a partially gilded tunic fastened with a fibula and sporting a seven-rayed halo with his right hand uplifted, while his left holds a globe and a whip; his chariot is drawn as a frontal box with two large wheels pulled by four horses. At the Beth Alpha synagogue, Helios is at the centre of the circle of the zodiac mosaic, together with the Torah shrine between \"menorahs\", other ritual objects, and a pair of lions, while the Seasons are in spandrels. The frontal head of Helios emerges from the chariot box, with two wheels in side view beneath, and the four heads of the horses, likewise frontal, surmounting an array of legs. In the synagogue of Naaran, the god is dressed in a white tunic embellished with gemstones on the upper body; over the tunic is a \"paludamentum\" pinned with a fibula or bulla and decorated with a star motif, as he holds in his hand a scarf, the distinctive symbol of a ruler from the fourth century onward, and much like all other mosaics he's seated in his four-horse chariot. Temporary writings record \"the sun has three letters of [God's] name written at its heart and the angels lead it\" and \"[t]he sun is riding on a chariot and rises decorated like a bridegroom\". Both at Naaran and Beth Alpha the image of the sun is presented in a bust in frontal position, and a crown with nimbus and rays on his head. Helios at both Hammath Tiberias and Beth Alpha is depicted with seven rays emanating from his head, it has been argued that those two are significantly different; the Helios of Hammath Tiberias possesses all the attributes of Sol Invictus and thus the Roman emperors, those being the rayed crown, the raised right hand and the globe, all common Helios-Sol iconography of the late third and early fourth centuries AD.\nHelios and Selene were also personified in the mosaic of the Monastery of Lady Mary at Beit She'an. Here he is not shown as Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, but rather as a celestial body, his red hair symbolizing the sun.\nThe poplar tree was considered sacred to Helios, due to the sun-like brilliance its shining leaves have. A sacred poplar in an epigram written by Antipater of Thessalonica warns the reader not to harm her because Helios cares for her.\nAelian wrote that the wolf is a beloved animal to Helios; the wolf is also Apollo's sacred animal, and the god was often known as Apollo Lyceus, \"wolf Apollo\".\nIn post-classical art.\nIn painting.\nHelios/Sol had little independent identity and presence during the Renaissance, where the main solar gods were Apollo, Bacchus and Hercules. In post-antiquity art, Apollo assimilates features and attributes of both classical Apollo and Helios, so that Apollo, along with his own iconography, is many times depicted as driving the four-horse chariot, representing both of them. In medieval tradition, each of the four horses had its own distinctive colour; in the Renaissance, however, all four are shown as white. In Versailles, a gilded statue depicts Apollo as the god of the sun, driving his quadriga as he sinks in the ocean; Apollo in this regard represents the king of France, \"le roi-soleil\", \"the Sun King\".\nAdditionally to the chariot, Apollo is often drawn with a solar halo around his head and depicted in scenes of Helios's mythology. Accordingly, in depictions of Phaethon meeting his father and asking him the privilege of driving the sun chariot, artists gave to Phaethon's father the appearance and attributes of Apollo.\nIn literature.\nA love affair between the Sun god and the Nereid Amphitrite is introduced by French playwright Monl\u00e9on's \"L'Amphytrite\" (1630); in the denouement, the Sun, scorned by the nymph, sets the land and sea ablaze, before the king of gods Jupiter intervenes and restores peace.\nIn Jean-Gilbert Durval's \"Le Travaux d'Ulysse\" (1631), after his men dine on the sacred sheep, the Sun appears in 'a chariot of light', accompanied by Jupiter; like in the myth, Jupiter kills Odysseus's crewmen with his lightning bolts when they put to sea again.\nFrench composer Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote in 1683 a \"trag\u00e9die en musique\" inspired by Ovid's handling of the tale of Helios's son, \"Pha\u00ebton\", in which Pha\u00ebton obtains from his father the sun chariot in order to prove his divine origins to his rival Epaphus, but loses control and is instead struck and killed by Jupiter. The luxury of the Sun and his palace was no doubt meant to connect to the Sun King, Louis XIV, who used the sun for his emblem. This Apollo-Sun was frequently used to represent Louis XIV's reign, such as in Pierre Corneille's \"Androm\u00e8de\" (1650).\nGerhart Hauptmann's \"Helios und Phaethon\" omits entirely the cosmic disaster Phaethon caused in order to focus on the relationship between the divine father and his mortal son, as Phaethon tries to convince his father he is well-suited for his five steeds, while Helios tries to dissuade his ambitious child, but eventually consents and gives him his reins and steeds to drive for a single day.\nIn James Joyce's book \"Ulysses\", episode 14 is titled \"Oxen of the Sun\", after the story of Odysseus's men and the cattle of Helios in book twelve of the \"Odyssey\".\nIn \"A True Story\", the Sun is an inhabited place, ruled by a king named Phaethon, referencing Helios's mythological son. The inhabitants of the Sun are at war with those of the Moon, ruled by King Endymion (Selene's lover), over colonization of the Morning Star (Aphrodite's planet).\nNamesakes.\nHelios is the Greek proper name for the Sun for both Ancient and Modern Greek, and additionally Helios, one of the craters of Hyperion, a moon of Saturn which bears Helios's father's name, is named after this Greek god. Several words relating to the Sun derive from \"helios\", including the rare adjective heliac (meaning \"solar\"), heliosphere, perihelion and aphelion among others.\nThe chemical element Helium, a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, first in the noble gas group in the periodic table, was named after Helios by Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland, as it was first observed in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun.\nHelius is a genus of crane fly in the family Limoniidae that shares its name with the god.\nA pair of probes that were launched into heliocentric orbit by NASA to study solar processes were called Helios A and Helios B.\nModern reception.\nHelios often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of the sun.\nHelios has been portrayed in many modern works of literature such as in Gareth Hinds's 2010 version of \"The Odyssey\".\nHelios has been portrayed in many video games, such as in Sony Computer Entertainment's \",\" \"God of War II\" and \"God of War III\" where the character is a boss and plays an antagonist role against Kratos. He also appears in the Wii game , where the second Seed guardian is named after Helios, and as an AI in the Deus Ex series.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the base unit for speed in the SI, it is commonly used in physics, mechanics, and engineering contexts. It represents both scalar speed and vector velocity, depending on context.

Prior to this, various units such as feet per second, miles per hour, and knots were more commonly used, depending on the region and application.\nThe unit derives from the SI base units of metre (length) and second (time), both of which were defined more precisely in the 20th century. The metre was originally based on the dimensions of the Earth, but is now defined by the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The second is defined using the vibration frequency of caesium atoms (9,192,631,770 oscillations per second). Because of its accuracy, simplicity and preciseness, this unit is adopted as the official unit of speed and velocity and is almost always used as the unit of speed and velocity in scientific occasions.\nRelation to other measures.\nThe benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second. Although it has seen some support as a practical unit, primarily from German sources, it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity and has not seen widespread use or acceptance.\nThe square of metres per second, or square metre per square second, is used as a unit of gravitational potential.\nUnicode character.\nThe \"metre per second\" symbol is encoded by Unicode at code point ."}

(; a syllabic abbreviation of its original name, Hassenfeld Brothers) is an American multinational toy manufacturing and entertainment holding company founded on December 6, 1923 by Henry, Hillel and Herman Hassenfeld and is incorporated and headquartered in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Hasbro owns the trademarks and products of Kenner, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, and Wizards of the Coast, among others. As of August 2020, over 81.5% of its shares were held by large financial institutions.\nAmong Hasbro's products are \"Transformers\", \"G.I. Joe\", \"Power Rangers\", Rom the Space Knight, Micronauts, \"M.A.S.K.\", \"Monopoly\", Furby, Nerf, Potato Head, \"Bop It!\", Play-Doh, \"Twister\", and \"My Little Pony\", and with the Entertainment One (now Lionsgate Canada) acquisition on December 30, 2019, franchises like \"Peppa Pig\" and \"PJ Masks\". Hasbro also spawned TV shows to promote its products, such as \"Family Game Night\" on Discovery Family, which has been co-owned by Hasbro since 2010. The company sold Entertainment One to Lionsgate (now Starz Entertainment) on December 27, 2023, however, it kept eOne's family brands and eOne's stake in Astley Baker Davies, placing them into a new division known as Hasbro Entertainment, formed on August 16, 2023. The company celebrated their 100th anniversary on December 6, 2023. Hasbro primarily competes with Mattel.\nHistory.\nHassenfeld Brothers.\nThree Polish-Jewish brothers, Herman, Hillel, and Henry Hassenfeld, founded Hassenfeld Brothers in Providence, Rhode Island, in late 1923, a company selling textile remnants. Over the next two decades, the company expanded to produce pencil cases and school supplies. On January 8, 1926, Hassenfeld Brothers was incorporated in Rhode Island; Hillel left for another textile business while Henry took charge of the corporation. They began making their own pencils after their pencil supplier began making pencil cases as well.\nHassenfeld Brothers produced modeling clay and then doctor and nurse kits as their first toys, and they became primarily a toy company by 1942. Hillel died in 1943 and Henry Hassenfeld became CEO, while his son Anthony Merrill became president. The company entered the plastic fields during World War II to support its toy line. The Hassenfeld brothers, immigrants from Ulan\u00f3w, Poland, also spent the war years helping to rescue and employ fellow Jews from Ulan\u00f3w; Jacob Klapper, a Holocaust survivor born in Ulan\u00f3w, recalled being told when he arrived in the United States that Hassenfeld Brothers would employ any survivor from Ulan\u00f3w, no questions asked. Hassenfeld Brothers' first popular toy was Mr. Potato Head, which the company purchased from George Lerner in 1952. In 1954, the company became a Disney major licensee.\nIn 1960, Henry died and Merrill took over the parent company, and his older brother Harold ran the pencil-making business of Empire Pencil. Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961.\nIn 1962, Hasbro purchased the former Potter &amp; Johnston manufacturing company building on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The Pawtucket plant facilities were eventually expanded to over 300,000 square feet.\nIn 1963 the company introduced Flubber, but reports of sore throats and rashes from the product and knock-offs prompted an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and a voluntary recall by Hassenfeld Brothers. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on \"The Lieutenant\", which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly short-lived television series. Instead, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the G.I. Joe toy in 1964 which they termed an \"action figure\" in order to market it to boys who wouldn't want to play with dolls. In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld's sales.\nHasbro Industries.\nThe company had previously sold toys under the Hasbro trade name, and it shortened its name to Hasbro Industries on July 12, 1968, and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public. The Vietnam War was at its height in 1969, so Hasbro redesigned GI Joe to be less militaristic and more adventure-oriented. Its promotional efforts included the catchphrase \"Boy Oh Boy! It's A Hasbro Toy!\" in television commercials and print ads. Also in 1969, Hasbro bought Burt Claster Enterprises which produced \"Romper Room\" and had just begun a Romper Room toy line. A month-long Teamsters strike and Far Eastern supplier troubles caused the company to post a $1 million loss for the year.\nIn 1970, Hasbro began a plan of diversification and opened the Romper Room Nursery School franchise chain to cash in on President Richard Nixon's Family Assistance Plan which subsidized day care for working mothers. By 1975, the company had ended the nursery chain. Hasbro also entered the cookware field with the Galloping Gourmet line based on a television cooking show.\nTwo new 1970s toys were public relations disasters. One of the toys was named Javelin Darts which were similar to the ancient Roman \"plumbata\". On December 19, 1988, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned lawn darts from sale in the United States due to their hazards as a flying projectile with a sharp metal point causing multiple deaths. The other toy was named The Hypo-Squirt, a hypodermic needle-shaped water gun tagged by the press as a \"junior junkie\" kit. Both were recalled. Romper Room and its toy line had continued success, although Action for Children's Television citizens group considered the program to be an advertising channel for toys.\nMerrill Hassenfeld took over as CEO in 1974, and his son Stephen D. Hassenfeld became president. The company became profitable once again but had mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset G.I. Joe's declining sales. Hasbro ended the G.I. Joe line in 1975 because of the rising prices of plastic and crude oil. In 1977, Hasbro's losses were $2.5 million, and the company held a large debt load. That same year, Hasbro acquired licensing rights to \"Peanuts\" cartoon characters. With the financial situation poor, Hasbro's bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early 1979. The toy division's losses increased Harold Hassenfeld's resentment regarding the company's treatment of the Empire Pencil subsidiary as Empire received lower levels of capital spending relative to profits than did the toy division.\nWith Merrill's death in 1979, Harold did not recognize Stephen's authority as the successor to the chairman and CEO position. As a solution, Hasbro spun off Empire Pencil in 1980, which was the nation's largest pencil maker, with Harold trading his Hasbro shares for those of Empire. Stephen then became both the CEO and chairman of the board. Between 1978 and 1981, Stephen reduced the Hasbro product line by one-third and its new products by one-half. Hasbro focused on simple, low-cost, longer life-cycle toys like Mr. Potato Head. Hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early 1980s.\nIn 1982, Hasbro revived its G.I. Joe line with the help of Marvel Comics, as an anti-terrorist special forces team based on current events. Following an interest in Takara's \"Diaclone\" and \"Micro Change\" toylines in the 1983 International Tokyo Toy Show, the company licensed the toylines and subsequently launched the successful \"Transformers\" toy line along with a children's animated TV series two years later. With the toys and TV series being popular, Stephen Hassenfeld posed with the toys for a \"People\" magazine cover photo.\nIn 1982, Hasbro produced the successful toy franchise \"My Little Pony\". In 1983, they purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world's largest bib producer, and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a struggling Warner Communications subsidiary. Hasbro paid 37% of its stock to Warner, which was paid into Hasbro's executive-controlled voting trust, and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, Alan G. Hassenfeld took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company was the nation's sixth best-selling toymaker, and then acquired the Milton Bradley Company, which was the nation's fifth best-selling toymaker. This brought The Game of Life, Twister, Easy Money, and Playskool into the Hasbro fold and on September 10 transformed Hasbro into Hasbro Bradley. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company's president and CEO, with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions.\nHasbro.\n1985\u20132007.\nOn June 6, 1985, the company changed its name again to just Hasbro, Inc. The Jumpstarters toys were the subject of a lawsuit in 1985 when Hasbro sued a toy manufacturer for selling toys based on their Transformers design. Hasbro won the suit.\nIn the mid-1980s, Hasbro moved past Mattel to become the world's largest toy company. Hasbro then moved to outsell Mattel's Barbie in the fashion doll market with the 1986 introduction of Jem, a record producer/rock musician dual identity fashion doll. Jem initially posted strong sales but plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in 1987. Hasbro followed up in 1988 with Maxie, a Barbie-sized blonde doll, so that Barbie clothing and accessories would fit. Maxie lasted until 1990.\nUnder Alan's initiative in the late 1980s, Hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking toys overseas that had failed in the US market and selling them for as much as four times the original price. This increased international sales from $268 million in 1985 to $433 million in 1988.\nIn 1988, Hasbro purchased part of Coleco Industries' indoor and outdoor children's furniture and ride-on toy product lines for $21 million including two just closed manufacturing plants in Amsterdam, New York. In July 1989, Hasbro acquired bankrupt Coleco for $85 million. Stephen Hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of $104 million in the year he took control to 1989 sales of over $1.4 billion.\nAlan succeeded Stephen as chairman and CEO. In 1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka Corp. for $486 million, along with its units Parker Brothers, the maker of Monopoly, and Kenner Products. Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers were merged into one division. Alan moved to expand Hasbro overseas with new units in Greece, Hungary, and Mexico.\nAlan saw the Far East as an important market to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for J. W. Spear &amp; Sons, a U.K.-based game maker, to Mattel.\nIn the US, Hasbro's growth since 1980 was from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets. New product development was not as successful except for film and TV tie-in product lines with Jurassic Park and Barney. Thus, US sales were stagnant in the early 1990s, falling from 1993 to 1995. To turn domestic performance around in 1994, Hasbro merged the Hasbro Toy, Playskool, Playskool Baby, Kenner, and Kid Dimension units into the Hasbro Toy Group. Meanwhile, Mattel purchased Fisher-Price and retook the top spot in the toy industry.\nHasbro Interactive was started in 1995 and released the Monopoly game on CD-ROM. Mattel also proposed a merger that year, but was turned down by the Hasbro board in 1996 due to antitrust issues and Justice Department investigation into exclusionary policies between toy manufacturers and toy retailers, particularly Toys \"R\" Us.\nIn 1998, Hasbro bought Avalon Hill for $6 million and Galoob for $220 million. That same year, Milton Bradley merged with Parker Bros. to form Hasbro Games. In 1999, Hasbro paid $ for rights to \"Pok\u00e9mon\" toys. The same year, Wizards of the Coast was bought in a deal worth $325\u00a0million. Wizards of the Coast is now a subsidiary of Hasbro and has Avalon Hill as its division. In 2001 money-losing Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames, a French software concern, for $100\u00a0million. Hasbro entered the building block toy with its Built to Rule line in 2003, which did not hold together well or were too hard for the targeted age group, thus ended in 2005.\nIn 2004, the company entered into a deal with Paramount Home Entertainment to release its programs based on its games and toys on VHS and DVD.\n2008\u20132018.\nIn 2008, Hasbro acquired game maker Cranium, Inc. for $77.5\u00a0million. The deal was announced on January 4 and closed on January 25.\nHasbro and Universal Pictures signed an agreement in February 2008 to derive four films from seven Hasbro properties for production. In May, Bennett Schneir was hired to lead its Hasbro Films division, while Hasbro also reacquired series based on their properties from Sunbow Productions.\nThe year of his promotion to CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldner was named CEO of the year by News Corporation affiliate website MarketWatch.com. Goldner became the first person not from the founding Hassenfeld family to hold the position.\nIn 2009, the Milton Bradley and Parker Bros. brands were retired after 25 years and eighteen years of Hasbro ownership respectively. That same year, Hasbro Studios was formed for TV development, production and distribution. On December 11, 2012, Hasbro transferred all entertainment divisions to Hasbro Studios, including their LA-based film group, and Cake Mix Studio, the company's Rhode Island\u2013based producer of commercials and short form content.\nHasbro collaborated with Discovery on The Hub, a cable television network targeting younger children and families, which launched on October 10, 2010. The venture found unexpected success with the revival of the \"My Little Pony\" franchise, \"\", which became the network's highest-rated program and attracted a significant cult following . The Hub was renamed to Hub Network in 2013, and was rebranded again as Discovery Family on October 13, 2014. In 2013, Hasbro renewed its deal to produce Marvel Comics and \"Star Wars\" toys through at least 2020.\nIn 2011, Greenpeace accused Hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in Indonesia. Hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy, earning the company praise from Greenpeace executive director Phil Radford, who said: \"The new Hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper in its toy packaging. Hasbro's new commitments are great news for Indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them.\"\nBy April 2011, Hasbro started 360 Manufacturing Services, a contract OEM game manufacturing operating out of Hasbro's USA plant. Having been absent from the building block market since the failure of the Built to Rule line, Hasbro re-entered the market with the Kre-O line in late 2011, starting with some \"Transformers\"-based sets.\nIn 2012, Hasbro received a $1.6 million tax credit from the state of Rhode Island with a promise to create 245 new jobs in the state. Instead, they laid off more than 125 workers. This was followed in 2013 with further layoffs of North American workers, amounting to 10% of its salaried employees. Meanwhile, CEO Brian Goldner signed a new five-year contract. As of fiscal year 2012, Goldner had a total calculated compensation of $9,684,285.

The deal was set to close in sixty days. Hasbro signed a five-year deal with Cartamundi to produce their board games at the East Longmeadow plant.\nWith Mattel adding two competing lines, and the expiration of their Disney Princess license at the end of 2015, Disney gave Hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on \"Star Wars\", which led to a \"Descendants\" license. DCP was also attempting to evolve the brand from one of them less as damsels and more as heroines. In September 2014, Disney announced that Hasbro would be the doll licensee for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016.\nOn July 13, 2016, Hasbro acquired Dublin-based Boulder Media Limited and placed it under the control of its chief content officer.

At the time, Mattel's worth was $5 billion, while Hasbro's worth was about $11 billion. On February 27, 2018, \"Variety\" reported in a detailed article that Hasbro came close to buying Lionsgate (now Starz Entertainment), exploring options to expand its entertainment division and bolster its content production capabilities due to interest in film and television ventures, but the deal fell through.\n2018\u20132021.\nOn February 16, 2018, Saban Brands appointed Hasbro as the global master toy licensee for \"Power Rangers\" with a future collaboration and option to purchase the franchise. On May 1, 2018, Hasbro agreed to purchase \"Power Rangers\" and other entertainment assets from Saban Brands for $522 million in cash and stock with the licensing fee recently paid with credit. The sale, which also collaborated with \"My Pet Monster\", \"Popples\", \"Julius Jr.\", \"Treehouse Detectives\" and additional properties, was expected to close in the second quarter until it was finished with Saban's collab. On October 19, 2018, the company announced plans to cut jobs amounting to less than 10% of its 5,000-plus global workforce in response to changes in how consumers buy toys.\nIn 2018, Hasbro signed a number of licensing agreements for hospitality deals based on Hasbro brands. On May 1, 2018, the Monopoly Mansion hotel agreement was announced by Hasbro, with M101 Holdings overseeing construction and M101's Sirocco Group assigned to manage the hotel when it opened in 2019.

From the outside, Hasbro looks like a toy company, but with these numbers, it's revealed to be a geek game company with toy and entertainment divisions\".\nIn April 2021, Hasbro agreed to sell eOne Music unit to Blackstone for $385 million, offloading part of the Entertainment One operations that it acquired in 2019.\n2021\u2013present: Restructuring and turnaround.\nHasbro's longtime CEO Brian Goldner died on October 12, 2021, after a 7-year battle with cancer. Richard Stoddart served as the interim CEO of the company following Goldner's death; Chris Cocks was named as Goldner's successor on January 5, 2022, and became CEO on February 25, 2022. Cocks was formerly the president and chief operating officer of Wizards of the Coast, a division of Hasbro.\nIn June 2022, Hasbro defeated a board challenge from activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management LLC. The hedge fund company, which owns a 2.5% stake of Hasbro, had been pushing to spin out Wizards of the Coast \"into its own company in an attempt to create what they saw was more value by making a second publicly traded company with a more profitable line of business\".\nOn November 17, 2022, Hasbro announced they had put Entertainment One up for sale. This includes their film and TV business but would exclude the company's kids and family division, which would remain under Hasbro.

However, Fremantle dropped out of the bid while CVC Capital Partners and GoDigital Media Group joined in the bid for the eOne buyout. On April 20, 2023, it was reported that Hasbro was in talks with Throop on the possibility of buying the company back. On July 17, 2023, \"Deadline\" reported that Lionsgate was a frontrunner to acquire eOne.

Hasbro kept eOne\u2019s family brands and its stake in Astley Baker Davies, and created a division called Hasbro Entertainment later that month, which held Astley Baker Davies and Discovery Family.\nOn December 12, 2023, TechCrunch reported that paperwork Hasbro filed with the SEC contained information announcing layoffs of 1,100 employees (20% of their entire workforce across all divisions) effective immediately. President and COO Eric Nyman left the company. Hasbro's CEO, Chris Cocks, stated that this reduction is part of a broader cost-saving strategy, aimed at saving $350 million to $400 million by 2025, with a renewed focus on high-profit areas like licensing and entertainment, particularly in the Wizards of the Coast division. Hasbro also announced to have signed a deal with McFarlane Toys as part the latter's Page Punchers line-up.\nOn February 13, 2024, following the completion of its sale of Entertainment One assets, Hasbro reported losses of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.49 billion for the full year, resulting in its entire total net income from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2023 to plummet to $0.

Headquarters for the company's gaming and digital divisions, including Wizards of the Coast would remain in Renton, Washington. The move is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026.\nToys and games.\nHasbro has several brands of toys and games aimed at different demographics. Some of its better-known toy lines (past and present) are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHasbro is the largest producer of board games in the world as a result of its component brands, such as Parker Brothers, Waddingtons, Milton Bradley, Wizards of the Coast, and Avalon Hill (all acquisitions since the 1980s). As a result, it has well known and top selling games such as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHasbro also produces many variations of most of their games. For example, in addition to original Scrabble, the game is also available as \"Scrabble Deluxe Edition\", \"Scrabble Deluxe Travel Edition\", \"Scrabble Junior\", and \"Scrabble Onyx Edition\".\nHasbro also offers Game of skill such as:\nThey also formerly sold:\nHasbro also offers a memory game called \"Simon\" which involves memorising sequences of colors and lights.\nIn 1995, Hasbro began a short-lived video game development and publishing venture called Hasbro Interactive, but disbanded it in 2001 when it was bought by the now defunct Infogrames. Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as Activision, Electronic Arts, and THQ. Following the rise of smartphones and tablet PCs in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as economic slumps, several of Hasbro's brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as Gameloft, releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming.\nOn February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical toothbrush to the market. The \"Tooth Tunes\", released in early 2007, transmits music from the jawbone to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth.\nIn November 2023, Hasbro signed a licensing deal with Ageless Innovation to design toys and games for people over 65. Hasbro will produce \"Generations\" versions of known games such as \"Scrabble\", \"Life\", and \"Trivial Pursuit\". The new versions will include larger fonts and game pieces as well as content that is relevant to different generations.\nIn January 2024, Hasbro launched a new line of \"Star Wars\" figures to join The Black Series and The Vintage Collection for the 25th anniversary of \"The Phantom Menace\". The line includes a Destroyer Droid that can roll. In the same month, Hasbro announced a pre-order for a new crowdfunding project; the creation of Omega Prime, a Transformer that is a combination of the iterations of Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.\nIn February 2024, Hasbro announced a new game, \"Life in Reterra,\" a Eurogame-style board game created by Eric M. Lang and Ken Gruhl.\nCriticism and controversy.\nIn 2007, a workers' rights group investigated several of Hasbro's Chinese suppliers and found that, in one instance, a toy factory in China's Guangxi Province had hired 1000 junior high school students. The same group discovered other widespread labor violations, including unsafe working conditions, mandatory overtime, verbal abuse and sexual harassment of employees. Hasbro issued a statement, saying that it would \"act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes\" and had \"increased the intensity of [its] ongoing safety review efforts.\" Critics pointed out that Hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories. Hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors. These auditors made unannounced visits to the East Asian subcontractors. Reports then emerged that the factory managers have been coached in how to deceive the auditors.\nHasbro has also been criticized for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups. For example, a letter spread widely on social media in November 2012 written by a six-year-old Irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game \"Guess Who?\". This garnered attention in the press after the girl's mother posted the exchange on her blog. \"Guess Who?\" had previously received complaints over gender and ethnic bias in its choice of 24 images.\nHasbro primarily sells toys directed at girl or boy markets. As such, there have been criticisms that Hasbro's toys reinforce gender stereotypes. For example, in December 2012, 13-year-old McKenna Pope started a campaign on Change.org, calling on the company to create a \"boy-friendly\" version of the popular Easy-Bake Oven and to feature boys on their packaging and materials. Within a week, over 30,000 people signed her petition.\nHasbro was criticized for \"sexist\" product design when its 2015 \"Star Wars\" Monopoly board game failed to feature Rey, the female protagonist in \"\", while including all of the supporting male characters. Hasbro explained that Rey was left out of the Monopoly game to avoid spoilers, because the game was released months before the movies. On January 5, 2016, Hasbro announced that Rey would be included in future versions. Hasbro later stated that it struggled to distribute the updated Monopoly game that includes the Rey piece, because retailers (especially in the United States) showed \"insufficient interest\" after having already purchased stock of the first release.\nOn October 2, 2015, Lorraine Markham sued Hasbro for breach of contract for failure to pay royalties to her. She was seeking a declaration from the U.S. District Court in Providence that her husband Bill Markham was the sole creator of \"The Game of Life\".\nOn August 7, 2020, Hasbro produced a DreamWorks Animation Troll doll device for pre-school children which had an unadvertised activator on the doll's private parts that caused the device to emit several audio recordings that were questioned by some American mothers; in particular one of them posted a Facebook video stream that went viral. In it, she questioned whether the intent was to groom children for depravity. A Hasbro senior officer for global communications said that it was \"not intentional\" and the company removed the device from the marketplace. A writer for \"USA Today\" opined that \"We rate the claim that the doll was designed to groom children as PARTLY FALSE.\"\nIn late December 2022, continuing into 2023, Hasbro and subsidiary company Wizards of the Coast received backlash from Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans due to leaked information indicating the companies planned to revoke a longstanding open license and to replace it with one that imposed severe new regulations on content created under the previous license agreement. The legality of this move by Hasbro has been debated.\nIn 2023, subsidiary Wizards of the Coast hired several Pinkerton employees to seize the upcoming \"March of the Machine: The Aftermath\" card set for trading card game Magic: The Gathering from a YouTuber who had purchased them from a local game store and published their contents on YouTube ahead of release.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2017, \"Corporate Responsibility Magazine\" rated Hasbro number one on its \"100 Best Corporate Citizens\" list, a measure of corporate philanthropy. The company was ranked number five for 2018, and number 13 in 2019.\nConventions.\nHasCon (2017).\nHasCon was a fan convention created by Hasbro to promote its various licensed properties, including \"Transformers, G.I. Joe, ,\" and \".\" It thus replaces the previous fan convention from Fun Publications, BotCon. However, Fun Publications' G. I. Joe Convention continued to be held as of 2017. It was subsequently announced that the first HasCon is scheduled for September 8\u201310, 2017, at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Meanwhile, Summer Hayes, LLC., which organizes My Little Pony Fair convention, has announced that their convention will not be held for 2017, and would collaborate with HasCon instead.\nThere was supposed to be a HasCon event in 2019 at the Rhode Island Convention Center and Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, but it has been cancelled due the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHasbro Pulse Con (Since 2020).\nHasbro Pulse Con is a virtual convention held through the Hasbro Pulse website due the COVID-19 pandemic, following the cancellation of HasCon 2019. Since 2020, four yearly conventions were made at the moment.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the city's population was 311,549. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 317,303 for 2024, making it the 64th-most populous municipality in the nation.\nSettled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark is one of the oldest cities in the United States. Its location at the mouth of the Passaic River, where it flows into Newark Bay, has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Port Newark\u2013Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the U.S. East Coast. Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States and has become one of the busiest.\nSeveral companies are headquartered in Newark, including Prudential, PSEG, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Audible.com, IDT Corporation, Manischewitz, and AeroFarms. Higher education institutions in the city include the Newark campus of Rutgers University, which includes law and medical schools and the Rutgers Institute of Jazz Studies; University Hospital; the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and Seton Hall University's law school. Newark is a home to numerous governmental offices, largely concentrated at Government Center and the Essex County Government Complex. Cultural venues include the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark Symphony Hall, the Prudential Center, The Newark Museum of Art, and the New Jersey Historical Society. Branch Brook Park is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000.\nNewark is divided into five political wards (East, West, South, North and Central). The majority of Black residents reside in the South, Central, and West Wards of the city, while the North and East Wards are mostly populated by Latinos. Ras Baraka has served as mayor of Newark since 2014.\nHistory.\nNewark was settled in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert Treat from the New Haven Colony. It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas. On October 31, 1693, it was organized as a New Jersey township based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a royal charter on April 27, 1713. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by the New Jersey Legislature's Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark's Vailsburg.\nThe name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent, England, because of the influence of the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire. But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named \"New Ark\" for \"New Ark of the Covenant\" and some of the colonists saw it as \"New-Work\", the settlers' new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name \"New Ark\" are found in preserved letters written by historical figures such as David A. Ogden in his claim for compensation, and James McHenry, as late as 1787.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, British troops made several raids into the town. The city saw tremendous industrial and population growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the 1967 Newark riots, which led to an increase in white flight, with 100,000 white residents leaving the city in the 1960s, though the exodus of white residents from the city had started after World War II as housing availability was limited in the city, while white residents were able to buy homes in the western suburbs of Essex County, where the population grew rapidly.\nThe city has experienced revitalization since the 1990s, with major office, arts and sports projects representing $2\u00a0billion in investment. The city's population, which had dropped by more than a third from 1950 to its post-war low in 2000, has since rebounded, with 38,000 new residents added from 2000 to 2020.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , including of land and of water (6.72%). It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida. The city's altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately above sea level in the western section of the city. Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River, with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark's high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.\nUntil the 20th century, the marshes on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was able to reclaim of the marshland for the further expansion of Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.\nNewark is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey's Gateway Region, which is said to have received its name from Newark's nickname as the \"Gateway City\".\nThe city borders the municipalities of Belleville, Bloomfield, East Orange, Irvington, Maplewood and South Orange in Essex County; Bayonne, East Newark, Harrison, Jersey City and Kearny in Hudson County; and Elizabeth and Hillside in Union County.\nNeighborhoods.\nNewark is the second-most racially diverse municipality in the state, behind neighboring Jersey City. It is divided into five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.\nState law requires that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered.\nNewark's Central Ward, formerly known as the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's history including the original squares Lincoln Park, Military Park and Harriet Tubman Square. The ward contains the University Heights, The Coast, historic Grace Episcopal Church, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the subject of the 1968 novel \"Howard Street\" by Nathan Heard, is still in common usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue.\nIn the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other white Catholic and Protestant groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by African Americans. The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the nation's largest health sciences university, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. It is also home to three other universities \u2013 New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University \u2013 Newark, and Essex County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library.\nThe North Ward is surrounded by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section. Forest Hill contains the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered on state and national historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes. A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward had its own Little Italy, centered on heavily Italian Seventh Avenue and the area of St. Lucy's Church; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse.\nThe West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg, Ivy Hill, West Side, Fairmount and Lower Roseville. It is home to the historic Fairmount Cemetery. The West Ward, once a predominantly Irish-American, Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed primarily of Latinos, African Americans, and Caribbean Americans. Relative to other parts of the city, the West Ward has for many decades struggled with elevated rates of crime, particularly violent crime.\nThe South Ward comprises the Weequahic, Clinton Hill, Dayton, and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home to residents of predominantly Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics. The city's second-largest hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, is in the South Ward, as are seventeen public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, one police precinct, a mini-precinct, and three fire houses.\nThe East Ward consists of much of Newark's Downtown commercial district, as well as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark's industry was in the 19th century. Today, the Ironbound (also known as \"Down Neck\" and \"The Neck\") is a destination for shopping, dining, and nightlife. A historically immigrant-dominated section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed \"Little Portugal\" and \"Little Brazil\" due to its heavily Portuguese and Brazilian population, Newark being home to one of the largest Portuguese speaking communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become home to Latin Americans (especially Ecuadorians, Peruvians, and Colombians), Puerto Ricans, African Americans, as well as commuters to Manhattan. Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and six elementary schools. The ward is densely packed, with well-maintained housing and streets, primarily large apartment buildings and rowhouses.\nClimate.\nNewark lies in the transition between a humid subtropical and humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa/Dfa\"), with cold winters and hot humid summers. The January daily mean is , and although temperatures below are to be expected in most years, sub- readings are rare; conversely, some days may warm up to .

The extensive fiber optic networks in Newark started in the 1990s when telecommunication companies installed fiber optic network to put Newark as a strategic location for data transfer between Manhattan and the rest of the country during the dot-com boom. At the same time, the city encouraged those companies to install more than they needed. A vacant department store was converted into a telecommunication center called 165 Halsey Street. It became one of the world's largest carrier hotels. As a result, after the dot-com bust, there were a surplus of dark fiber (unused fiber optic cables). Twenty years later, the city and other private companies began utilizing the dark fiber to create high performance networks within the city.\nAs a concentration of technology workforce increased and investments grew in the city, it created an ecosystem for technology startups.

The Newark movie theatres during this early part of the 20th century had established a large audience, with 62 movie houses in the city by 1922.\nLater, many of these locations were used for live performances of notable actors prior to becoming renowned. The introduction of television for entertainment during the 1940s and 1950s was the start of a decades-long decline in attendance in movie theaters. The last two downtown movie theatres were the Adams and the Newark Paramount Theatre, which both closed in 1986. Attempts for movie theatre revivals were established in the 1990s. As of 2024, the CityPlex 12 Newark movie theatre, located off Springfield Avenue and Bergen Street, is the only theater in operation in the city. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center, located at 1 Center Street, is currently operating as theatre production and concerts. The 2,800-seat Newark Symphony Hall located at 1020 Broad Street has been in operations since 1925.\nSports.\nNewark has hosted many teams, though much of the time without an MLB, NBA, NHL, or NFL team in the city proper.

Known as \"The Rock\", the arena opened in 2007 and is the home of the Devils, the New York Sirens of the Professional Women's Hockey League, and the NCAA's Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team, seating 18,711 for basketball and 16,514 for hockey.\nDowntown was also home to Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium, which was a 6,200-seat baseball park built near the Passaic River to house the Newark Bears, an independent minor league baseball team, and opened in 1999. Also serving as the home stadium for Rutgers-Newark and NJIT's college baseball teams, Riverfront Stadium closed in 2014 after the Bears ceased operations. In 2016, the stadium was sold to a developer, and three years later it was demolished.\nThe New Jersey Nets played two seasons (2010\u20132012) at the Prudential Center until moving to the Barclays Center. The New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) also played there for three seasons (2011\u20132013) during renovations of Madison Square Garden. The center has hosted the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, the 2011 NBA draft, and the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. , a mixed martial arts (MMA) event which took place on May 31, 2008, was the first MMA event aired in primetime on major American network television.\nNewark was a host city and its airport a gateway for Super Bowl XLVIII which was played on February 2, 2014. The game took place at MetLife Stadium, home of the hosting teams New York Giants and New York Jets.

In the 2024 presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump became the only Republican, since at least 2004, to obtain over 20% of the vote in Newark with 20.5%, correlating with the rightward shift of both New Jersey and the nation as a whole. At the same time, and while still winning by a wide margin, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was the only Democrat to receive under 80% of the vote since at least that same year, with 78.3%. Trump also received the most votes out of any Republican nominee compared to all elections since 2004, including himself in 2016 and 2020. with 13,754 votes. Overall, Newark experienced an approximate 8 point shift to the right from his performance in 2020. From 2016 to 2020, the city shifted right by about 6 points. In turn, from 2016 to 2024, Newark swung about 14 points to the right.\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Republican\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Democratic\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Third party(ies)\n!!scope=\"col\"|No.\u202f !!scope=\"col\"|% !!scope=\"col\"|No.\u202f !!scope=\"col\"|% !!scope=\"col\"|No.\u202f !!scope=\"col\"|%\nIn the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono received 80.8% of the vote (29,039 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 17.9% (6,443 votes), and other candidates with 1.2% (437 votes), among the 37,114 ballots cast by the city's 149,778 registered voters (1,195 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 24.8%.

Five of the previous seven mayors of Newark have been indicted on criminal charges, including the three mayors before Cory Booker: Hugh Addonizio, Kenneth Gibson and Sharpe James. As reported by \"Newsweek\": \"...\u00a0every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for crimes committed while in office\".\nAddonizio was mayor of Newark from 1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War\u00a0II veteran, he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the political machine of the era. In December 1969, Addonizio and nine present or former officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a Federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted. In July 1970, the former mayor, and four other defendants, were found guilty by a Federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion. In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and fined $25,000 by Federal Judge George H. Barlow for his role in a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5\u00a0million in kickbacks, a crime that the judge said \"tore at the very heart of our civilized society and our form of representative government\".\nHis successor was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud and bribery charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.\nSharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nNewark is the home of multiple institutions of higher education, including a Berkeley College campus, the main campus of Essex County College, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), a campus of Rutgers Health (formerly the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey), Rutgers University\u2013Newark, Seton Hall University School of Law, and Pillar College. The main campus of Seton Hall University is located in adjacent South Orange, while Kean University is located in nearby Union. Most of Newark's academic institutions are in the city's University Heights district. The colleges and universities have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 60,000 students and faculty.\nPublic schools.\nIn the 2013\u20132017 American Community Survey, 13.6% of Newark residents ages 25 and over had never attended high school and 12.5% did not graduate from high school, while 74.1% had graduated from high school, including the 14.4% who had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. The total school enrollment in Newark was 77,097 in the 2013\u20132017 ACS, with nursery and preschool enrollment of 7,432, elementary / high school (K\u201312) enrollment of 49,532 and total college / graduate school enrollment of 20,133.\nThe Newark Public Schools, a state-operated school district for two decades and until 2018, is the largest school system in New Jersey. The district was one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in \"Abbott v. Burke\" which are now referred to as \"SDA Districts\" based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2020\u201321 school year, the district, containing 65 schools, had an enrollment of 40,423 students and 2,886.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 14.0:1.\nScience Park High School, which was the 69th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in \"New Jersey Monthly\" magazine's September 2010 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", after being ranked 50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. Technology High School has a GreatSchools rating of 9/10 and was ranked 165th in \"New Jersey Monthly's\" 2010 rankings. Newark high schools ranked in the bottom 10% of the \"New Jersey Monthly\" 2010 list include Central (274th), East Side (293rd), Newark Vocational (304th), Weequahic (310th), Barringer (311th), Malcolm X Shabazz (314th) and West Side (319th). Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg donated a challenge grant of $100\u00a0million to the district in 2010, choosing Newark because he stated he believed in Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie's abilities.\nCharter schools in Newark include the Robert Treat Academy Charter School, a National Blue Ribbon School drawing students from all over Newark. It remains one of the top performing K\u20138 schools in New Jersey based on standardized test scores. University Heights Charter School is another charter school, serving children in grades K\u20135, recognized as a 2011 Epic Silver Gain School. Gray Charter School, like Robert Treat, also won a Blue Ribbon Award. Also, Newark Collegiate Academy (NCA) opened in August 2007 and serves 420 students in grades 9\u201312. It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other charter schools in the area.\nPrivate schools.\nThere are two Catholic high schools in Newark, both run by religious communities. Saint Benedict's Preparatory School is a Roman Catholic school founded in 1868 and operated by the Benedictine monks of Newark Abbey, whose property encompass both sides of MLK Jr. Blvd. south of Springfield Avenue. Originally an all-boys high school, the 2020 closing of Benedictine Academy led to the decision to accept high school girls for the first time in the school's history under a co-institutional model in which male and female students participate in activities together but are taught in separate classes. As of 2024, enrollment at Saint Benedict's was just under a thousand students in grades K-12.\nSaint Vincent Academy is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and operated continuously since 1869.\nLink Community School is a non-denominational coeducational day school that serves approximately 128 students in seventh and eighth grades. The Newark Boys Chorus School was founded in the 1960s. University Heights Charter School, which opened in 2006, taught 614 students in grades Pre-K\u20138 in 2014\u20132015.\nPublic safety.\nNewark Department of Public Safety.\nIn 2016, under Mayor Ras Baraka's direction, the city consolidated the then-separate departments of Fire, Police, and Office of Emergency Management as divisions under the newly created Department Of Public Safety.\nFire department.\nThe city is protected by more than 700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Division (NFD). Founded in 1863, the NFD operates out of 16 firehouses throughout the city that are organized into 4 firefighting battalions (Battalions 1,3,4, and 5), with each Battalion Chief under the command of a deputy chief/tour commander. There is also a Safety Battalion Chief, Battalion 2, and a Special Operations Battalion Chief, Battalion 6, on duty 24/7. The NFD operates 16 engine companies, 8 ladder companies, 1 rescue company, an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Collapse Rescue Unit (Rescue 2), a USAR Collapse Rescue Shoring Unit, 2 fire boats, a scuba diving unit, a mobile medical ambulance bus, an air cascade unit, a foam unit, a quick attack response vehicle (QRV\u00a01), a mobile command unit, 3 HazMat units, and numerous special, support, and reserve units. The NFD responds to approximately 45,000 emergency calls annually. In 2006, the NFD responded to 2,681 fire and hazardous condition calls. The department is a member of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which includes nine North Jersey fire departments.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Newark Police Division is a city-operated law enforcement agency. As of January 2014, the force had 1,006 officers in its ranks. The Director of Public Safety is Brian A. O'Hara.\nThe Essex County Sheriff's Office, the New Jersey Transit Police Department (headquartered in Penn Plaza East) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department are also within their jurisdiction in the city, as are the New Jersey State Police. In April 2014, it was announced that the State Police would play a more prominent role in patrolling the streets of the city under the \"TIDE-TAG\" program. The Essex County College Police Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology Police Department and Rutgers University Police Department patrol their respective college campuses in the city. Conrail and Amtrak Police patrol their respective rail yards and property.\nIn July 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced that the Newark Police Department (NPD) would be placed under a federal monitor after a three year investigation found the NPD \"engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional practices, chiefly in its use of force, stop-and-frisk tactics, unwarranted stops and arrests and discriminatory police actions.\" The investigation found that the department's internal affairs bureau was dysfunctional to the point that it had only sustained one complaint of police brutality over a five year period. Newark became the first municipal police department in state history to operate under a federal watchdog and the 13th in the United States. In December 2014, mayor Ras Baraka announced the creation of a Civilian Complaint Review board and in 2016, the city entered into consent decree agreeing to a federal monitoring program and comprehensive reforms.\nIn 2018, the Newark Police began a de-escalation training program, which they credit for the achievement of no officer firing their weapon on duty in all of 2020. As of 2024, the Newark Police Department was still under federal oversight. In November 2025, a judge lifted Newark\u2019s consent decree of the federal monitor, ruling that the reforms the NPD implemented have been \"effective at curbing unconstitutional stops, searches, excessive use of force and other abuses.\"\nEmergency management.\nThe city's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) purpose is to facilitate coordination of emergency response activities and provide available emergency management resources for support of emergency response activities within the city. The OEM establishes policies, procedures, and mechanisms for the centralized coordination and emergency management of response efforts and the effective collection, processing, and dissemination of pertinent information during potential or actual emergency situations. OEM coordinates the distribution of commodities between the county and municipal agencies and ensures all emergency management capabilities are tested, evaluated, and updated for immediate implementation.\nEmergency Medical Services.\nUniversity Hospital EMS (UH-EMS) operates the EMS system for the city. The department operates a fleet of six BLS units staffed with two EMTs 24/7, supplemented by four 12-hour \"power\" units (operated during peak demand time hours), five ALS units staffed with two paramedics (one of which is stationed at Newark International Airport and covers the airport and Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth), and a critical care unit staffed by a paramedic and an RN. With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck in the country, known as University EMS Rescue 1. The EMS system is one of the busiest systems per unit in the nation. On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20\u201325 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar and Southstar, which are the two NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one flight nurse and a flight medic around the clock. The EMS system in Newark handles upwards of 125,000 requests for service annually. The Ironbound Volunteer Ambulance Squad helps by handling BLS calls in the East Ward when members are on duty and has been in operation since 1969. The Vailsburg Volunteer Rescue Squad helps by handling BLS calls in the West Ward when members are on duty and has been in operation since 2019.\nCrime.\nIn 1996, \"Money\" magazine ranked Newark \"The Most Dangerous City in the Nation\". By 2007, the city recorded a total of 99 homicides for the year, representing a significant drop from the record of 161 murders set in 1981. The number of murders in 2008 dropped to 65, a decline of 30% from the previous year and the lowest in the city since 2002 when there were also 65 murders.\nIn 2010, Newark recorded 90 homicides. March 2010 was the first calendar month since 1966 in which the city had not recorded a homicide. Overall, there was a 6% increase in crime numbers over the previous year, including a rise in carjackings for the third straight year, with the 337 incidents raising concerns that the city was returning to its status as the \"car theft capital of the world\". Along with the increase in crime, the Newark Police Department increased its recovery of illegally owned guns in 2011 to 696, up from 278 in 2010. The Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded 94 homicides in 2011 and 95 in 2012. In 2012, CNNMoney ranked Newark as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States, based on numbers by FBI Crime in the United States 2011 report. The city had 10 murders in 10 days during the period ending September 6, 2013, a statistic largely attributed to a reduction of the police force. In 2013 Newark recorded 111 homicides, the first year ending in triple digits in seven years and the highest tally since 1990, accounting for 27% of all murders statewide. In 2014, the total number of homicides in Newark was 93, while Essex County as a whole had 117 murders. \"The Star-Ledger\" reported that there were 105 homicides in the city in 2015. The city had 72 homicides in 2017, a statistic described as a \"historic low\", and a sharp drop from the 96 murders recorded in the city in 2016. The Newark Police reported 69 homicides for 2018. As of August 13, 2019, after a period of 50 consecutive days without a homicide, a total of 34 had been recorded. In 2022, there were 51 homicides; in 2023, there were 47. A new \"historic low\" of 37 homicides were recorded in 2024, the lowest homicide rate since 1960. However, overall violent crime rose 21% after two years of consecutive declines in 2022 and 2023.\nWater contamination.\nIn Newark, lead concentrations in water accumulated for several years in the 2010s as a result of inaccurate testing and poor leadership. Newark's problem came from a negligence of officials who the city relied on to ensure clean water. The decrease in the quality of the water was due to several factors that were all somewhat interconnected with the primary cause being lead service pipes that carry water were installed throughout Newark.\nWhen this was recognized, the city had CDM Smith, a construction company that specializes in water systems, conduct a study to determine whether or not the water quality was safe enough to drink. The results revealed that the water was safe to drink, but the results were severely skewed. This is because the city receives water from two water supplies: the Pequannock Treatment Plant and the Wanaque Treatment Plant. In some sampling rounds, only areas served by Pequannock were sampled, and in other rounds, only areas served by Wanaque were sampled, and each had different contaminant control systems in place that varied in their effectiveness. The Pequannock supply uses pH adjustments and silica for its corrosion control method, which worked for two decades before losing its effectiveness in 2016, while the Wanaque supply uses orthophosphate, a much more effective precaution.\nOfficials in Newark denied that their water system had a widespread lead problem, declaring on their website that the water was absolutely safe to drink. Even after municipal water tests revealed the severity of the problem Mayor Ras Baraka mailed a brochure to the cities residents that the water meets all federal standards. Although the city called an emergency declaration to allow them to purchase and distribute water filters for faucets but many of these were faulty. The city has received three noncompliance notices for exceeding lead levels since 2017 and continues to fight its lead problem.\nIn October 2024, it was announced that the company contracted to replace a portion of the lead service lines in Newark, JAS Group Enterprise, Inc. lied and falsified reports while not conducting the work they were hired to do at 1,500 Newark properties. From 2020 to 2022, the company falsified reports by submitting photographs to inspectors of copper pipes and claimed that they were the new replacement pipes they had installed. The company \"deliberately instructed workers to leave lead pipes in the ground\" and where copper pipes already existed, workers were allegedly instructed to polish and clean them to make them look like newly installed replacement lines. Mayor Baraka claimed the health of Newark residents isn't in danger due to the orthophosphate that was added to the water to prevent lead leaching and that it is working as intended. City officials stated that they excavated 400 sites where the company claimed to have performed work and 28 of those sites still had lead pipes. The EPA stated that any lead pipes that were discovered have been replaced.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nNewark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and the Mid-Atlantic U.S.\nNewark Liberty International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the New York metro area and the 15th-busiest in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic). Newark Airport was the New York City area's first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on land reclaimed by the Port Authority.\nPort Newark, on Newark Bay, is the 15th-busiest port in the world and the largest container port on the East Coast of the United States. In 2003, the port moved over $100\u00a0billion in goods.\nEarly modes of transport.\nThe Morris Canal, stretching to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River, was completed in 1831 and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York metropolitan area. The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, its right of way was converted into the Newark City Subway, now known as the Newark Light Rail. Many of the subway stations still portray the canal in its original state, in the form of mosaic works.\nAs the city became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse. The trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.\nRoads and highways.\nAs of \u00a02010[ [update]], the city had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Essex County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.\nNewark is served by numerous highways including the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 280, Interstate 78, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, and Route 21. Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, which was first constructed in 1938 and recently underwent a $900\u00a0million renovation project.\nLocal streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.\nIn a city extensively served by mass transit, 44.2% of Newark residents did not have a car as of the 2000 Census, ranked second in the U.S. to New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile among cities with more than 250,000 people. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, the number of households without an automobile has decreased to 39.2%. The same year, the average Newark household owned .89 cars compared to a national average of 1.8 cars per household.\nPublic transportation.\nNewark Penn Station, situated just east of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the PATH's interurban Newark\u2013World Trade Center line to Jersey City and Manhattan, three NJ Transit Rail Operations (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak intercity rail service. It was designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is also served by three NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in the bed of the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark.\nBus service in Newark is provided by NJ Transit. Newark is served by NJ Transit bus routes 1, 5, 11, 13, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44, 59, 62, 65, 66, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 99, 107, 108, and 109. The 109 runs in North Newark. The 107 and 108 routes run to New York City. Bus route 319 is an express route to Atlantic City.\nThe \"go bus 25\" and \"go bus 28\" are bus rapid transit lines through the city to Irvington, Bloomfield and Newark Liberty International Airport.\nModal characteristics.\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 53.7% of working city of Newark residents commuted by driving alone, 9.3% carpooled, 27.3% used public transportation, and 6.5% walked. About 5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 5.7% of working Newark residents worked at home.\nHealthcare.\nNewark is home to five hospitals. University Hospital, an independent institution that is a teaching hospital of Rutgers Health, has been the busiest Level\u00a0I trauma center in the state. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is the largest hospital in the city and is a part of Barnabas Health, the state's largest system of hospital and health care facilities. Beth Israel is also one of the oldest hospitals in the city, dating back to 1901. This 669-bed regional facility is also home to the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Catholic Health East operates Saint Michael's Medical Center. Columbus Hospital LTACH is a longterm acute care hospital designed to focus on patients with serious and complex medical conditions that require intense specialized treatment for an extended period of recovery time. Hospitals which have been closed in recent years include the Saint James Hospital, Mount Carmel Guild Hospital and the United Hospitals Medical Center.\nLead water pipes.\nIn 2016, annual testing of the water in Newark's public schools revealed elevated lead levels; more than 30 schools shut off their water fountains and turned to bottled water. In August 2019 the crisis over lead contamination in drinking water resurfaced because of new warnings from federal environmental officials. It is believed that the contamination was caused by aging lead pipes and changes in the water supply that makes the water more corrosive, causing lead from the pipes to be spread to the water inside. In August 2019, New Jersey began supplying water bottles to Newark residents in certain designated neighborhoods. On August 26, 2019, Newark officials announced a $120 million plan to expedite replacing the city's lead service lines in under three years. The 29,000 families affected by the contaminated water were provided with filters and bottled water. After testing in September, it was found that the filters were successful in 97% of homes tested, though bottled water would still be made available to those who request it. Long term-plans include the replacement of lead service lines from the water supply to homes.\nInternational relations.\nThe Consulate-General of Ecuador in New Jersey is at 400 Market Street. The Consulate-General of Portugal in Newark is at the main floor of the Newark Legal Center at One Riverfront Plaza. The Consulate-General of Colombia is at 550 Broad Street. The Vice Consulate of Italy was at 1 Gateway Center, until it was closed in 2014 for economic reasons.\nPope John Paul\u00a0II visited the city in 1995, at which time he elevated the city's cathedral to a basilica to become the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In 2011, the Dalai Lama was guest of honor at the Newark Peace Education Summit.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nNewark has 15 sister cities listed by Sister Cities International in 2022:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther sources list additional sister cities:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn March 2023, the city held an official ceremony with its sister city in the Hindu nation of Kailaasa. It was later reported that that nation did not actually exist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The university's undergraduate schools\u2014Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, Katz School of Science and Health, and Sy Syms School of Business\u2014offer a dual curriculum inspired by Modern\u2013Centrist\u2013Orthodox Judaism's \"hashkafa\" (philosophy) of \"Torah Umadda\" (\"Torah and secular knowledge\"), which synthesizes a secular academic education with the study of the Torah.\nThe majority of students at the university identify as Modern Orthodox. Hillel International estimates that nearly all of the university's undergraduate students are Jewish, while most of the graduate students are not (excluding Rabbinical students at \"RIETS\", all of whom are Jewish). This is especially the case at the Cardozo School of Law, the Sy Syms School of Business, and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology.\nYeshiva University is an independent institution chartered by New York State. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\nHistory.\nYeshiva University has its roots in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva founded in 1886 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a cheder-style elementary school founded by Eastern European immigrants that offered study of Talmud along with some secular education, including instruction in English. The rabbinical seminary was chartered in 1897.\nWhen Lamm took office in 1976, Yeshiva was facing a serious financial crisis. As a result, some of the schools and programs had to be consolidated or closed. The renowned Belfer Graduate School of Science was closed in 1978. Once this was stabilized, additional divisions were added: For example, the Sy Syms School of Business, with divisions for both the undergraduate men and women was opened in 1988. At this time, many of the undergraduate students began to spend their first year (or more) studying in yeshivot and other schools in Israel, which has become an almost universal practice, and a Joint Israel Program regulating these studies was established to allow them to receive credit for this year at Yeshiva. RIETS also maintains a campus in Jerusalem, and many of the rabbinic students spend a year studying there as well. Over the course of Lamm's tenure, enrollment grew considerably to over 2000 undergraduate students. In addition to its undergraduate schools and affiliates, Yeshiva maintains graduate schools in Jewish studies, Jewish education and administration, social work, psychology, law, and medicine. There are over fifteen schools in total. In addition, numerous joint undergraduate-graduate programs with other schools in the New York area and beyond are maintained. The Yeshiva University Museum, an affiliate of the school, is now one of the components of the Center for Jewish History, located in downtown Manhattan.\nUnder Joel's leadership, Yeshiva University's endowment was invested in high-risk investments, including the funds of Bernard Madoff. Losses of at least $110 million resulted. In early 2014, Moody's lowered the school's bond rating by five steps to B1, junk bond level. To raise funds and cut costs, Yeshiva University has sold off real estate, and transferred control of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to Montefiore Medical Center.\nJoel created the Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future, folding other programs, both from within and from outside YU, into it.\nIn December 2012, Joel apologized over allegations that two rabbis at the college's high school campus abused boys there in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Investigations into these allegations by \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" and a law firm hired by the university found \"multiple instances in which the university either failed to appropriately act to protect the safety of its students or did not respond to the allegations at all.\" These allegations led to a 380 million dollar lawsuit by former students. The case has since been dismissed.\nIn 2012 the Middle States Commission on Higher Education warned the university \"that its accreditation may be in jeopardy because of insufficient evidence that the institution is currently in compliance with Standard 10 (Faculty) and Standard 14 (Assessment of Student Learning).\" On June 26, 2014, the Middle State Commission on Higher Education, which accredits the university \"reaffirmed accreditation\", but requested a progress report \"evidence that student learning assessment information is used to improve teaching and learning.\" This was accepted by the commission on November 17, 2016 (wherein the university met the minimum requirements for accreditation).\nIn January 2016, the university disclosed plans to cede almost half of its $1 billion endowment to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as the medical college enters a separate joint venture with Montefiore Health System.\nIn the 2020\u20132021 school year, Yeshiva University enrolled approximately 2,250 undergraduate students, and 2,700 graduate students. It is also home to affiliated high schools\u2014Yeshiva University High School for Boys and Yeshiva University High School for Girls\u2014and the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). It conferred 1,822 degrees in 2007 and offers community service projects serving New York, Jewish communities, the United States and Canada. As of 2015, the university had run an operating deficit for seven consecutive years. In 2014, it lost $84 million, and in 2013, it suffered a loss of $64 million.\nAcademics.\nSchools.\nThe university's academic programs are organized into the following schools:\nRankings.\nThe \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s 2025 \"America's Best Colleges\" ranked Yeshiva University 98th (tie) in National University.\nIn 2023, \"Forbes\" ranked Yeshiva University as: No. 226 in \"Top colleges 2023\", No. 118 in Private Colleges, No. 143 in Research Universities, and No. 82 in the Northeast. Nationally, Yeshiva was ranked 138th by the \"Times Higher Education\" World University Rankings, and internationally it is ranked in the 900s by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" and 369th in the world by the \"QS\u00a0World University Rankings\".\nCampuses.\nThe university's main campus, Wilf Campus, is located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan. Yeshiva University's main office is located within the Wilf Campus, at 500 West 185th St. A 1928 plan to build a spacious Moorish Revival campus around several gardens and courtyards was canceled by the Great Depression of 1929 after only one building had been erected. Building continued after the Depression in modern style and by the acquisition of existing neighborhood buildings.\nSince it was founded in 1886, Yeshiva University has expanded to comprise some twenty colleges, schools, affiliates, centers, and institutions, with several affiliated hospitals and healthcare institutions. It has campuses and facilities in Manhattan (Washington Heights, Murray Hill, Greenwich Village), the Bronx, Queens, and Israel.\nThe Yeshiva University Museum is a teaching museum and the cultural arm of Yeshiva University. Founded in 1973, Yeshiva University Museum is AAMG accredited and aims to provide a window into Jewish culture around the world and throughout history through multi-disciplinary exhibitions and publications.\nThe university's building in Jerusalem, in the Bayit VeGan neighborhood, contains a branch of the rabbinical seminary and an office coordinating the S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program. Under the latter, first year students studying in selected Israeli Yeshivot are considered YU undergraduates.\nStudent life.\nStudent publications.\nThe undergraduate university newspaper is \"The Commentator\", and the newspaper for Stern College is \"The Observer\". Law students at Cardozo also edit and publish five law journals. There are numerous other publications on a wide range of topics, both secular and religious, produced by the various councils and academic clubs, along with many official university publications and the university press. The call letters of the student radio station are WYUR, and it is currently an Internet-only station.\nLGBTQ+ club controversy and lawsuit.\nYeshiva University has been involved in legal proceedings since April 2021 after it blocked official recognition of a Pride Alliance club for undergraduate LGBTQ+ students and their allies.\nControversy over LGBTQ-supportive undergraduate groups has been ongoing since at least 2009, when students created a \"Tolerance Club.\" Its purpose was to promote acceptance of diversity of people within the Yeshiva University community. A founding member said that the group had \"determined that the school\u2019s lack of diversity has fostered significant insensitivity to those outside of the mainstream Y.U. culture\" and aimed to address that issue. The group's members included undergraduates at both the men's and women's campuses. Although not organized to address LGBTQ issues specifically, the group's promotion of tolerance for sexual and gender diversity generated controversy on the Yeshiva University campus; the student newspaper reported that the administration quashed a panel discussion because they objected to one of the speakers, a gay Orthodox rabbi. This controversy came to a head when the Tolerance Club sponsored a panel discussion entitled \"Being Gay in the Orthodox World\" in December, 2009. Several hundred people attended this panel discussion. Numerous Jewish news sources covered the panel and the conflict that enveloped the Yeshiva campus in its wake, and the Tolerance Club disbanded in May 2010.\nA decade later, in 2021, undergraduate students sued the university for refusing to recognize a new LGBTQ+ student group, YU Pride Alliance. The university has retained the pro-religious practice law firm Becket Law as its counsel. A New York court ruled in June 2022 that the university must recognize the undergraduate Pride Alliance. The university appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2022, and a temporary stay was issued by Justice Sotomayor. In a 5\u20134 decision the full court vacated the stay without prejudice, ruling the NY appeals process was incomplete and thus SCOTUS relief premature. In response, the university put all student clubs on hold in September 2022, pending resolution of their ongoing legal challenges. This lasted for a matter of weeks until an agreement was reached between the plaintiff and defense allowing other clubs to continue operating.\nYU-affiliated Cardozo School of Law and the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology have publicly supported their own students and voiced their disapproval of the university's position and legal response. At Cardozo School of Law, there has long been an officially recognized LGBTQ+ student group, and the Graduate School of Psychology also publicly supports the LGBTQ members of their communities.\nThe university announced on October 24, 2022 that they approved \"Kol Yisrael Areivim\", a new LGBTQ student group. According to the university, this new group will be the \"approved traditional Orthodox alternative to its current LGBTQ student group, the YU Pride Alliance\". There is still a dispute with the Pride Alliance who claimed the university's action as a stunt and distraction. Administrators later described Kol Yisrael Areivim as \"a framework within which we hope to eventually form a club\". Kol Yisrael Areivim is not included on official club lists, and it does not have any student members. On April 10, 2023, student journalist reported that Kol Yisrael Areivim was still yet to hold a single event.\nOn March 19, 2025, Yeshiva University announced that it would recognize the LGBT student club, bringing an end to the lawsuit. The club renamed itself to \"Hareni\". According to the agreement, five events were pre-approved for the coming year, and the club would \"operate consistent with all other student clubs at the University\" and \"not be required to submit to any approval or oversight procedures that are not required for all student Clubs.\" However, less than two months later, YU reversed itself and banned the club. \nUndergraduate clubs and activities.\nStudent groups include the Yeshiva University Dramatics Society (YCDS), which puts on a performance each semester. A student-run group known as the Heights Initiative sponsors several outreach programs that work with the schools and organizations of the Washington Heights community. Student Government is run through YSU, YCSA, SOY-JSC, and SYMS. Additionally, these groups run community events like the annual Hanukkah Concert and a carnival celebrating Israeli Independence Day.\nThe Yeshiva University Medical Ethics Society (MES) is an undergraduate student-run organization of Yeshiva University which was founded by students in the fall of 2005 with the help of the Center for the Jewish Future toward the goal of promoting education and awareness of Jewish medical ethics in the university itself and the community at large. In the first several years, the group hosted a program of on-campus lectures in the field of medical ethics and Halakha (Jewish law). They also host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various genetic diseases in the Jewish community.\nAthletics.\nYeshiva University includes a number of NCAA Division III-level sports teams. The teams, nicknamed \"The Maccabees\", include: men's baseball, basketball, golf, volleyball, wrestling, women's basketball, cross country, fencing, soccer, tennis, and volleyball.\nBecause of Yeshiva's dual curriculum, most of the sports teams practice at night, sometimes even as late as 11:00\u00a0pm. A few of the sports teams practice or work out before classes begin at 9:00\u00a0am; for example, the men's basketball team routinely practices at 6:00\u00a0am.\nTeams have participated in weekend tournaments outside of New York City, with athletes staying with local families in the area. This took place in Boston with the basketball and fencing teams, and in Hollywood, Florida with the baseball team in 2008. Some international students have participated in NCAA sports, with as many as nine different nationalities representing the school on the sports field.\nBaseball.\nTwo members of the Yeshiva Maccabees Baseball team were drafted out of college by professional teams of the Israeli Baseball League. Pitcher Aryeh Rosenbaum celebrated a championship with his team in the IBL's first year. From 2023 to 2025, the Maccabees went on a 100 game losing streak spanning three years. On April 8th, 2025, Yeshiva broke their streak with a 9\u20135 victory over Lehman College in the second game of a split doubleheader.\nBasketball.\nYeshiva's Men's Basketball team is an annual playoff contender. The most successful eras for Yeshiva basketball in recent history have been at the start and end of the 1990s, as well as the dawn of the 2020s. Banners hang in the Max Stern Athletic Center commemorating seasons from both eras. The 2007\u201308 season had particular note as Yeshiva was home to the Skyline Conference's Rookie of the Year. In 2018, the team won the Skyline Conference title in a game against SUNY Purchase, earning its first-ever NCAA berth and considerable media coverage. The current head coach of the team is Elliot Steinmetz, who has been with the team since 2014. Steinmetz succeeded Jonathan Halpert, the longest ever tenured NCAA men's basketball coach in New York City at 42 years. Steinmetz, a practicing lawyer, has been especially successful at attracting high caliber athletes, recognizing that Yeshiva's status in the Orthodox Jewish world means its athletics programs have unique access to a global talent pool from which to recruit players.\nIn the 2019\u201320 season, the men's basketball team's only loss was in the season opener, with the Maccabees going on to win the Skyline Conference championship. This was the second time in three years that the Maccabees made the NCAA Division III Tournament. They won the first two rounds, pushing them into the Sweet Sixteen (3rd round) for the first time in school history. Before they played in the third round, the NCAA tournament was canceled due to COVID-19. After a 7\u20130 season in 2020\u201321 also abbreviated by COVID-19, the Maccabees entered the 2021\u201322 season on a 36-game winning streak, the longest current streak in NCAA men's basketball in any division, and were ranked #2 in the preseason by the Division III basketball website \"D3hoops.com\". During this streak, the team was featured by media outlets as diverse as ESPN, CNN, the \"New York Daily News\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\". After previous #1 Randolph\u2013Macon lost in overtime, the Maccabees, with their winning streak having reached 44 games, inherited the #1 ranking in the \"D3hoops.com\" poll released on November 29, 2021, marking the first time any Yeshiva team had topped any national poll. The Maccabees received recognition from the ESPN and NBA Twitter accounts for their 50th straight win, the longest winning streak in NCAA Men's Division III Basketball.\nAs of December 29, 2021, the men's basketball team held the then-longest active winning streak in men's college basketball with 50 consecutive wins. On December 30, 2021, the men's basketball team lost their winning streak.\nFencing.\nOne of the most successful teams in Yeshiva University sports history is the fencing team, known as the \"Taubermen\", named after the coach of the team, Professor Arthur Tauber, who served as the head coach of the team from 1949 through 1985. \nTennis.\nIn 2014, the Men's Tennis team won the Skyline Conference championship, becoming the first team in school history to advance to the NCAA tournament in any sport. In 2015, the Men's Tennis team repeated as Skyline Conference champions and went back to the NCAA National Tournament, advancing to the second round. They lost to the defending National Champions Amherst College. In 2016, the Men's Tennis team won the Skyline Conference a third year in a row and advancing to the NCAA D3 National Tennis Tournament again. The Men's Tennis team repeated as Skyline Conference champions in 2017 and 2018 to extend this streak of success to five consecutive NCAA National Tournament appearances.\nWrestling.\nOlympic gold medalist Henry Wittenberg was at one time the coach of the wrestling team.\nOther sports.\nSince 2010, the Men's Cross Country and Men's Volleyball teams have won multiple championships. Many of the Maccabees have gained attention nationwide, like Sam Cohen won an individual championship as well as Capital One Academic honors. Other attention grabbers come from Women's Basketball and Women's Fencing.\nNotable alumni.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable staff.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67242", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67242", "title": "Bausch &amp; Lomb", "text": "American-Canadian eye health company\nBausch &amp; Lomb (since 2010 stylized as Bausch + Lomb) is an American-Canadian eye health products company based in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the world's largest suppliers of contact lenses, lens care products, pharmaceuticals, intraocular lenses, and other eye surgery products. The company was founded in Rochester, New York, in 1853 by optician John Bausch and cabinet maker turned financial backer Henry Lomb. Until its sale in 2013, Bausch + Lomb was one of the oldest continually operating companies in the United States.\nBausch + Lomb was a public company listed on the NYSE, until it was acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus in 2007. In May 2013, Canadian-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals announced that it would acquire Bausch + Lomb from Warburg Pincus for $4.5 billion in cash. The deal, which was approved by shareholders, closed on August 5, 2013. On May 6, 2022, the company completed an initial public offering and again became publicly traded. As of 2022, the company employs about 12,900 people, and manufactures and markets health care products directly or indirectly in approximately 100 countries.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nIn 1853, John Bausch and Henry Lomb, both German immigrants, established a small but ambitious workshop producing monocles in Rochester, New York. By 1861, their operation had expanded to manufacturing vulcanite rubber eyeglass frames and other precision vision products.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union blockade caused the price of gold and European horn to rise dramatically. This resulted in a growing demand for the Bausch + Lomb spectacles made from vulcanite.\nIn 1876, Ernst Gundlach joined the company as it began to manufacture microscopes. Later that year, the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company won a distinction at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company also produced photographic lenses (1883), spectacle lenses (1889), microtomes (1890), binoculars and telescopes (1893). From 1892 in cooperation with Zeiss in Germany, the company produced optical lenses. In this manner, at the end of the 19th century, the product range included eyeglasses, microscopes and binoculars, as well as projectors, camera lenses and camera diaphragms.\n20th century.\nWith the growth of the US army, under President Theodore Roosevelt and the buildup of the naval fleet, Bausch &amp; Lomb received the commission, through the supplier Saegmuller, to manufacture high-precision lenses for optical measurement and founded a joint venture with Saegmuller. At the same time as this new expansion, a research department with five members was started to develop new products and improve old ones. A new alliance with the Zeiss company in Germany ensured competitive advantages for the three participants, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Saegmuller and Zeiss, in terms of patent use and opening new markets. In 1902, William Bausch, the son of the founder, developed a process to create the desired lens shape directly by casting molten glass. Previously, the glass parts for the lenses had to be separated, ground and polished in a complicated process, and this brought significant savings in time and materials.\nThe company produced the first optical-quality glass in America during the early to mid-1900s. By the year 1903 the company began manufacturing microscopes, binoculars, and camera shutters.\nThe further development of the firm was affected by political events. Because of the World Wars and the consequent need for optical instruments such as field glasses, range finders, camera lenses, binocular telescopes, searchlight mirrors, torpedo tube sights, and periscopes, the product range could be considerably broadened. Until World War I, optical glass and the instruments made from it (including many military instruments) were often imported into most European and North American countries from Germany. The same was also true of chemical products and laboratory equipment. The outbreak of the war, with Germany's new enemy status, created a scramble to rapidly enhance the domestic industries. In 1933, Bausch + Lomb started to honor outstanding high school science students with the Bausch+Lomb Honorary Science Award. In the 1930s, military products represented 70% of total production. The Ray-Ban brand of sunglasses was developed for pilots in 1936.\nAt a time when the cinema was being superseded by television, Bausch &amp; Lomb developed improved optics for the CinemaScope process, which popularized the film-based anamorphic format and led most cinemas to double the widths of their screens.\nIn 1965 Bausch &amp; Lomb acquired the patent for the hydrogel contact lenses created by Czech scientists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav L\u00edm. In 1971, after three years of development work, two years for the medical approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration and an investment of three million USD, Bausch + Lomb launched contact lenses made of Poly-HEMA. In contrast to the contact lenses previously available, made of glass and Lucite (acrylic glass), the new lenses were softer. They were marketed under the brand name \"Soflens\".\nIn the 1970s, the company was a major producer of spectrophotometers for the dye and chemical business, such as the Spectronic 20.\nA massive restructuring of the company began in the mid-1980s. What had been the core divisions, the production of lenses for various purposes, were sold off. The sunglasses division was continued as Ray-Ban and kept selling well due to effective product placement. By the planned acquisition of other firms, such as Polymer Technology Corporation and Dr. Mann Pharma, existing business areas such as contact lens production were strengthened and new ones were initiated.\nIn 1997, as a result of a series of company acquisitions, the division for the manufacture of surgical products was established. The Ray-Ban brand was sold in 1999 to the Italian Luxottica Group.\n21st century.\nSince then, Bausch &amp; Lomb has developed into a globally operating company which is one of the largest producers of contact lenses. As of 2022, about 12,900 employees in approximately 100 countries work for the firm.\nCompetitors in the international eye care products market are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Allergan, Alcon, MSD-Chibret, CooperVision, Menicon Co., Hoya Corporation, EssilorLuxottica and Carl Zeiss Meditec.\nIn 2023, Bausch + Lomb Corp announced it would buy Xiidra from Novartis for $1.75 billion and pay additional $750 million in linked to future sales for Xiidra as well as two pipeline asset.\nIn 2025, Bausch + Lomb's subsidiaries closed an offering of $790.6 million. \nOperations.\nVision Care.\nIn the last few years, several business areas in the Vision Care division have been developed in the framework of product diversification. The vision care segment is its main business activity, making up 58% of their quarter one 2025 revenue leading with the manufacturing of contact lenses. The product assortment includes daily soft contact lens that are designed to be worn and discarded at the end of the day, such as the \"Biotrue ONEday\" or \"Bausch + Lomb ULTRA\" silicone hydrogel lenses which can be changed after seven days without being taken out at night. These newer lens ranges represent advancements in material science and design, offering enhanced comfort, moisture retention, and visual clarity for a variety of patients including those with astigmatism or presbyopia. \nConsumer Products &amp; Eye Care.\nAdditionally, Bausch + Lomb manufactures lens-care products including disinfectant solutions, eye drops and eye vitamins. For contact lens users, the company provides cleaning, disinfectant and rinsing solutions as well as rewetting drops. They have recently focused on expending their eye drops for individuals with dry eye symptoms, eye allergies or eye redness with products such as Lumify eye drops, launching in 2018, and Blink for dry eye relief. The entire Blink portfolio was acquired from Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2023. Lumify is the only redness reliever that's a selective alpha-2 AR agonist recommended by doctors for avoiding activity on the alpha-1 receptor which is associated with rebound redness. Their eye vitamins and supplements portfolio includes various formulations aimed at addressing overall eye health, dry eye symptoms and macular health and reducing the risk of progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). This began with the launch of PreserVision in 2001 following their collaboration with the National Eye Institute on an AREDS study and expanded recently with the launch of Blink NutriTears in 2024 intended to support tear film health.\nPharmaceuticals.\nThe Pharmaceuticals division manufactures pharmaceutical eye products, which accounted for about 26% of their 2025 quarter one revenue. This segment consists of prescription medicines for post-operative treatments and treatments for a number of eye conditions such as glaucoma, eye inflammation, ocular hypertension, dry eyes and retinal diseases. The company's engagement with specific dry eye disease treatments has developed in recent years launching Miebo in 2023 after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in May and acquiring Xiidra from Norvartis in September of that year. These prescription medications target different aspects of dry eye disease, with Miebo addressing tear evaporation and Xiidra focusing on inflammation.\nSurgicals.\nThe Surgicals division provides medical device equipment, consumables, and instrumental tools and technologies for the treatment of corneal, cataract, vitreous and retinal eye conditions. This includes interocular lenses and delivery systems, phacoemulsification equipment, and other surgical instruments and devices necessary for cataract surgery. \nOn July 2, 2004, the company announced that it had licensed the intellectual property of Novartis. Bausch &amp; Lomb will pay the Ciba Vision unit of Novartis a royalty on net U.S. sales of its PureVision brand contact lenses until 2014 and on net sales outside the U.S. until 2016. But as of now, the brand FreshLook comes under Bausch and Lomb and Ciba manufacturers it.\nLawsuits.\nIn 1994, several states in the US, including Texas, opened an investigation against Bausch &amp; Lomb. This investigation was based on the sale of duplicate contact lenses under different names and prices. Three different versions of the same contact lens were being sold under OptimaFW, Medalist lenses, and SeeQuence2. OptimaFW, the most expensive version, was available with a lifetime of one year, The mid-priced, Medalist lenses were sold with a lifetime of three months, and SeeQuence2, the least expensive, came with a lifetime of two to three weeks. By 1996, the company ensured that all three versions carried the OptimaFW tag and tried to standardize the packaging, but the pricing was still different. In 1996, the case was settled for $68 million. In 1997, 17 states pressured Bausch &amp; Lomb to stop the sale of duplicate lenses, deceptive practice stated in the court. The settlement also demanded the company to pay $1.7 million or $100,000 to each state to cover investigative costs.\nIn 2009, Bausch &amp; Lomb spent $250 million to settle six hundred lawsuits filed by consumers exposed to \"Fusarium\" keratitis, a fungal infection, after using its contact solution ReNu with MoistureLoc. Between June 2005 and September 2006, one hundred eighty cases were reported, out of which seven patients required eye removal and sixty required corneal transplants.\nBausch + Lomb was involved in a lawsuit with Novartis, which claimed to have patents on a Bausch + Lomb product called PureVision. On June 26, 2002, a federal judge ruled that Bausch &amp; Lomb did infringe on Ciba Vision (a subsidiary of Alcon) patents.\nReNu product recalls.\nOn April 11, 2006, Bausch &amp; Lomb stopped shipments of its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced there was a high correlation between use of the product and cases of suspected fungal keratitis. The Centers for Disease Control found that \"nearly all of the company's ReNu with MoistureLoc eye care products were linked to severe fungal eye infections\". Two class action lawsuits were filed against Bausch &amp; Lomb in relation to the eye fungus problems.\nReception.\nIn 2003, Bausch &amp; Lomb received a 100% rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known as the male half and primary songwriter of the pop rock duo Roxette, which he formed with Marie Fredriksson in 1986 and which was disbanded after her death in 2019. The duo achieved international success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with their albums \"Look Sharp!\" (1988) and \"Joyride\" (1991), and topped the charts in the US four times, most notably with \"It Must Have Been Love\" which was featured in the film \"Pretty Woman\". Prior to the formation of Roxette, he had a successful career in his native Sweden as the frontman for Gyllene Tider. The band released three number-one albums during the early 1980s but disbanded shortly after their fourth album, \"The Heartland Caf\u00e9\" (1984).\nIn-between periods in Roxette and Gyllene Tider reunions, Gessle recorded numerous solo albums, both in Swedish and English. After Fredriksson's illness in 2002 he released \"Mazarin\" (2003). The album was a critical and commercial success for Gessle and started the beginning of a long-term collaboration with the backing vocalist Helena Josefsson. With Fredriksson's continued treatment and recuperation he made three more albums, \"Son of a Plumber\" (2005), \"En h\u00e4ndig man\" (\"A handy man\", 2007) and \"Party Crasher\" (2008). After Roxette's Neverending World Tour finished in 2015 he produced another set of solo efforts, \"En vacker natt\" (2017), \"En vacker dag\" (2017) and \"Small Town Talk\" (2018). In 2016 he started using the pseudonym Mono Mind, first releasing a few singles before delivering a full album, \"Mind Control\", in 2019. Gessle was the main songwriter for both Roxette and Gyllene Tider.\nCareer.\nPer Gessle was a founding member of Gyllene Tider, in 1976. They quickly became a popular group in Sweden, but after their fourth album, \"The Heartland Caf\u00e9\" (1984), sold poorly compared to their previous albums, the group disbanded. Gessle wrote. \"We decided to put Gyllene Tider to rest... until further notice.\" In 1982, Gessle released his first solo album, \"Per Gessle\" and after Gyllene Tider split-up his second album, \"Scener\", quickly appeared in 1985.\nGessle and Marie Fredriksson had been friends for a few years before they came together as Roxette in 1986. After the success of their first hit \"Neverending Love\", which was written by Gessle, they quickly recorded \"Pearls of Passion\" using material which was originally intended for Per's third solo album. Roxette went on to achieve four U.S. #1's and two #2's, with their albums \"Look Sharp!\" and \"Joyride\" attaining platinum status in a number of countries. After Roxette's early nineties success, Per released a demo compilation album in 1992, \"P\u00e5 v\u00e4g, 1982\u201386\". After the release of \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\" and subsequent world tour, Roxette took a break.\nIn 1996, after a reunion and subsequent tour of Gyllene Tider, Gessle recorded his first English solo album, using Brainpool and Gyllene Tider as backing musicians. Christoffer Lundquist from Brainpool would also come to collaborate with Gessle on later releases. \"The World According to Gessle\", released in 1997, produced three singles, \"Do You Wanna Be My Baby?\", \"Kix\" and \"I Want You to Know\". The videos to all three songs were directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund. The album was re-released in 2008, with extra bonus material and demos. In 1997 \"Hj\u00e4rtats trakt \u2013 en samling\" was released as a best-of album.\nAfter Roxette released \"Have a Nice Day\" (1999) and \"Room Service\" (2001) to moderate success, Fredriksson collapsed and was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2002. While Fredriksson received treatment for her illness, Gessle continued with his solo work. The subsequent album \"Mazarin\" (2003), was a critical and commercial success in Sweden and started the beginning of a long-term collaboration with the backing vocalist Helena Josefsson. Lundquist, now Gessle's producer was looking for a female singer and picked Josefsson. She first came to the attention of Lundquist after she and her band Sandy Mouche wanted to record at Lundquist's Aerosol Grey Machine (AGM) studio. \"I remember driving a car between Lund and Lomma when Christoffer called and wondered if I was interested in starting singing with Per who wanted a girl for his solo projects.\", recalled Josefsson. \"Mazarin\" topped the charts in June that year, going five times platinum in 2004. The lead single from the album \"H\u00e4r kommer alla k\u00e4nslorna (p\u00e5 en och samma g\u00e5ng)\" (\"Here comes all the emotions (at the same time)\"), is Gessle's most successful song in his home country, spending two months at No. 1 and was certified platinum.\nFollowing the success of the album, Gessle won numerous awards; four Grammis awards: Best Artist, Best Male Pop Performer, Best Composer and Best Song, three Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards: Best Swedish Male Artist, Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Song, and a Guld\u00e4lgen (The Golden Moose) Award for Best Song.\nAlso in 2004, saw Gessle and Gyllene Tider reunite for a 25th-anniversary celebration that included the band's first album in 20 years, \"Finn 5 fel!\", and another very successful tour in Sweden. They beat the Ullevi stadium attendance record, which was later broken by fellow Swede H\u00e5kan Hellstr\u00f6m in 2016 (70,144), and the band played to almost half a million fans. As a result, the group was honoured with four awards in Sweden.\nWith \"Son of a Plumber\", he continued his association with other Swedish artists. Jens Jansson along with previous collaborators Josefsson and Lundquist, helped Gessle create his second English album. Released in November 2005, the album contains a song dedicated to Gessle's father who was a plumber, \"Kurt \u2013 The Fastest Plumber in the West\". The album which was certified platinum, was also released in several other European countries in April 2006. In June 2007, he released another solo album in Swedish with the name \"En h\u00e4ndig man\", which shipped three times platinum. A single of the same name was released; \"En h\u00e4ndig man\". Later on October a book of \"Att vara Per Gessle\" was published, telling some of the unknown facts about Gessle and his 30-year career.\n\"Party Crasher\" his seventh solo album and third in English was released in late 2008. The first single \"Silly Really\" gave him his fourth No. 1 hit. After that, Gessle started his \"Party Crasher Tour\", where Fredriksson joined him on stage twice, in Amsterdam and Stockholm. This was eight years after their last live performance together during Roxette's \"Room Service Tour\" in 2001. Following Fredriksson's guest appearance in Amsterdam, Roxette started to perform live again. Initially this was during the Night of the Proms concert series in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany in 2009, later followed by extensive concert tours in 2010, 2011 and 2012, performing over 100 shows on all 6 continents. In the summer of 2013, Gessle reunited with Gyllene Tider once more, performing some 20 shows in Sweden.\nAfter Roxette's Neverending World Tour finished in 2015 he produced another set of solo efforts, \"En vacker natt\" (2017), \"En vacker dag\" (2017) and \"Small Town Talk\" (2018). All three albums were recorded in Nashville after Gessle felt the need to do sessions abroad. The albums featured the use of local musicians, Dan Dugmore, Stuart Duncan and Mickey Raphael.\nIn 2016 he started using the pseudonym Mono Mind, first releasing a few singles before delivering a full album, \"Mind Control\", in 2019. In June 2022, Gessle released a single called \"The Loneliest Girl In The World\" under the name PG Roxette. The single previews an album Gessle has recorded with members of Roxette's live touring band called \"Pop-up Dynamo\".\nCollaborations.\nIn 1983 Gessle wrote the song \n\u201dStj\u00e4rnhimmel\u201d to Elisabeth Andreassen. \nHe wrote the song K\u00e4rleken \u00e4r evig which Lena Philipsson competed with in Melodifestivalen 1986, where the song finished in second place with 42 points. The song charted on the 6th place on the Swedish singles chart and became Philipsson's big breakthrough single.\nIn 1990, Gessle wrote a single, \"The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye\", for Thomas Anders (of Modern Talking fame); Roxette would release their version as the B-side of their single \"Spending My Time\". The song was also used by Laura Branigan featuring on her \"Over My Heart\" album. He has also participated with the Swedish singer Nisse Hellberg in the project The Lonely Boys. In 1996 he worked with Belinda Carlisle and wrote two songs for her album, \"A Woman and a Man\"; \"Always Breaking My Heart\" and \"Love Doesn't Live Here\". The former was released as a single, becoming a UK top 10 hit.\nHe sung duet with Nick Lowe on the title track for the \"Small Town Talk\" album.\nGessle was involved in the development of the Roxette jukebox musical \"Joyride the Musical\" which premiered at Malm\u00f6 Opera in 2024.\nPersonal life.\nGessle is the youngest son of plumber Kurt Gessle (1917\u20131978) and Elisabeth Gessle (1925-2013). He had an older brother, Bengt (1951-2014) and older sister Gunilla (1944-2016). Gessle married his long-time girlfriend \u00c5sa Nordin (born 1961) in 1993 at V\u00e4stra Str\u00f6 Church, Esl\u00f6v, Sweden. The wedding reception was held in nearby Trollen\u00e4s Castle. They have a son, Gabriel Titus, born on 5 August 1997.\nAlong with Bj\u00f6rn Nordstrand he also owns Hotel Tyl\u00f6sand on the Swedish westcoast, known for its vast art and photo collection as well as The Joyride Car Collection, Per Gessle's private collection of Ferrari cars.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it, in turn, alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\".\nA Grinnellian niche is determined by the habitat in which a species lives and its accompanying behavioral adaptations. An Eltonian niche emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment, it may also change the environment and its behavior as it grows. The Hutchinsonian niche uses mathematics and statistics to try to explain how species coexist within a given community.\nThe concept of ecological niche is central to ecological biogeography, which focuses on spatial patterns of ecological communities. \"Species distributions and their dynamics over time result from properties of the species, environmental variation..., and interactions between the two\u2014in particular the abilities of some species, especially our own, to modify their environments and alter the range dynamics of many other species.\" Alteration of an ecological niche by its inhabitants is the topic of niche construction.\nThe majority of species exist in a standard ecological niche, sharing behaviors, adaptations, and functional traits similar to the other closely related species within the same broad taxonomic class, but there are exceptions. A premier example of a non-standard niche filling species is the flightless, ground-dwelling kiwi bird of New Zealand, which feeds on worms and other ground creatures, and lives its life in a mammal-like niche. Island biogeography can help explain island species and associated unfilled niches.\nGrinnellian niche.\nThe ecological meaning of niche comes from the meaning of niche as a recess in a wall for a statue, which itself is probably derived from the Middle French word \"nicher\", meaning \"to nest\".\nThe term was coined by the naturalist Roswell Hill Johnson\nbut Joseph Grinnell was probably the first to use it in a research program in 1917, in his paper \"The niche relationships of the California Thrasher\".\nThe Grinnellian niche concept embodies the idea that the niche of a species is determined by the habitat in which it lives and its accompanying behavioral adaptations. In other words, the niche is the sum of the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow a species to persist and produce offspring. For example, the behavior of the California thrasher is consistent with the chaparral habitat it lives in\u2014it breeds and feeds in the underbrush and escapes from its predators by shuffling from underbrush to underbrush. Its 'niche' is defined by the felicitous complementing of the thrasher's behavior and physical traits (camouflaging color, short wings, strong legs) with this habitat.\nGrinnellian niches can be defined by non-interactive (abiotic) variables and environmental conditions on broad scales. Variables of interest in this niche class include average temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and terrain aspect which have become increasingly accessible across spatial scales. Most literature has focused on Grinnellian niche constructs, often from a climatic perspective, to explain distribution and abundance. Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions and an Eltonian perspective may be advantageous in explaining these processes.\nThis perspective of niche allows for the existence of both ecological equivalents and empty niches. An ecological equivalent to an organism is an organism from a different taxonomic group exhibiting similar adaptations in a similar habitat, an example being the different succulents found in American and African deserts, cactus and euphorbia, respectively. As another example, the anole lizards of the Greater Antilles are a rare example of convergent evolution, adaptive radiation, and the existence of ecological equivalents: the anole lizards evolved in similar microhabitats independently of each other and resulted in the same ecomorphs across all four islands.\nEltonian niche.\nIn 1927 Charles Sutherland Elton, a British ecologist, defined a niche as follows: \"The 'niche' of an animal means its place in the biotic environment, \"its relations to food and enemies\".\"\nElton classified niches according to foraging activities (\"food habits\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConceptually, the Eltonian niche introduces the idea of a species' \"response\" \"to\" and \"effect on\" the environment. Unlike other niche concepts, it emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment based on available resources, predators, and climatic conditions, but also changes the availability and behavior of those factors as it grows. In an extreme example, beavers require certain resources in order to survive and reproduce, but also construct dams that alter water flow in the river where the beaver lives. Thus, the beaver affects the biotic and abiotic conditions of other species that live in and near the watershed. In a more subtle case, competitors that consume resources at different rates can lead to cycles in resource density that differ between species. Not only do species grow differently with respect to resource density, but their own population growth can affect resource density over time.\nEltonian niches focus on biotic interactions and consumer\u2013resource dynamics (biotic variables) on local scales. Because of the narrow extent of focus, data sets characterizing Eltonian niches typically are in the form of detailed field studies of specific individual phenomena, as the dynamics of this class of niche are difficult to measure at a broad geographic scale. However, the Eltonian niche may be useful in the explanation of a species' endurance of global change. Because adjustments in biotic interactions inevitably change abiotic factors, Eltonian niches can be useful in describing the overall response of a species to new environments.\nHutchinsonian niche.\nThe Hutchinsonian niche is an \"n-dimensional hypervolume\", where the dimensions are environmental conditions and resources, that define the requirements of an individual or a species to practice its way of life, more particularly, for its population to persist. The \"hypervolume\" defines the multi-dimensional space of resources (e.g., light, nutrients, structure, etc.) available to (and specifically used by) organisms, and \"all species other than those under consideration are regarded as part of the coordinate system.\"\nThe niche concept was popularized by the zoologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson in 1957. Hutchinson inquired into the question of why there are so many types of organisms in any one habitat. His work inspired many others to develop models to explain how many and how similar coexisting species could be within a given community, and led to the concepts of 'niche breadth' (the variety of resources or habitats used by a given species), 'niche partitioning' (resource differentiation by coexisting species), and 'niche overlap' (overlap of resource use by different species).\nStatistics were introduced into the Hutchinson niche by Robert MacArthur and Richard Levins using the 'resource-utilization' niche employing histograms to describe the 'frequency of occurrence' as a function of a Hutchinson coordinate. So, for instance, a Gaussian might describe the frequency with which a species ate prey of a certain size, giving a more detailed niche description than simply specifying some median or average prey size. For such a bell-shaped distribution, the \"position\", \"width\" and \"form\" of the niche correspond to the \"mean\", \"standard deviation\" and the actual distribution itself. One advantage in using statistics is illustrated in the figure, where it is clear that for the narrower distributions (top) there is no competition for prey between the extreme left and extreme right species, while for the broader distribution (bottom), niche overlap indicates competition can occur between all species. The resource-utilization approach postulates that not only can competition occur, but that it \"does\" occur, and that overlap in resource utilization directly enables the estimation of the competition coefficients. This postulate, however, can be misguided, as it ignores the impacts that the resources of each category have on the organism and the impacts that the organism has on the resources of each category. For instance, the resource in the overlap region can be non-limiting, in which case there is no competition for this resource despite niche overlap.\nAn organism free of interference from other species could use the full range of conditions (biotic and abiotic) and resources in which it could survive and reproduce which is called its fundamental niche. However, as a result of pressure from, and interactions with, other organisms (i.e. inter-specific competition) species are usually forced to occupy a niche that is narrower than this, and to which they are mostly highly adapted; this is termed the realized niche. Hutchinson used the idea of competition for resources as the primary mechanism driving ecology, but overemphasis upon this focus has proved to be a handicap for the niche concept. In particular, overemphasis upon a species' dependence upon resources has led to too little emphasis upon the effects of organisms on their environment, for instance, colonization and invasions.\nThe term \"adaptive zone\" was coined by the paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson to explain how a population could jump from one niche to another that suited it, jump to an 'adaptive zone', made available by virtue of some modification, or possibly a change in the food chain, that made the adaptive zone available to it without a discontinuity in its way of life because the group was 'pre-adapted' to the new ecological opportunity.\nHutchinson's \"niche\" (a description of the ecological space occupied by a species) is subtly different from the \"niche\" as defined by Grinnell (an ecological role, that may or may not be actually filled by a species\u2014see vacant niches).\nA niche is a very specific segment of ecospace occupied by a single species. On the presumption that no two species are identical in all respects (called Hardin's 'axiom of inequality') and the competitive exclusion principle, \"some\" resource or adaptive dimension will provide a niche specific to each species. Species can however share a 'mode of life' or 'autecological strategy' which are broader definitions of ecospace. For example, Australian grasslands species, though different from those of the Great Plains grasslands, exhibit similar modes of life.\nOnce a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example, the niche that was left vacant by the extinction of the tarpan has been filled by other animals (in particular a small horse breed, the konik). Also, when plants and animals are introduced into a new environment, they have the potential to occupy or invade the niche or niches of native organisms, often outcompeting the indigenous species. Introduction of non-indigenous species to non-native habitats by humans often results in biological pollution by the exotic or invasive species.\nThe mathematical representation of a species' fundamental niche in ecological space, and its subsequent projection back into geographic space, is the domain of niche modelling.\nContemporary niche theory.\nContemporary niche theory (also called \"classic niche theory\" in some contexts) is a framework that was originally designed to reconcile different definitions of niches (see Grinnellian, Eltonian, and Hutchinsonian definitions above), and to help explain the underlying processes that affect Lotka\u2013Volterra relationships within an ecosystem. The framework centers around \"consumer-resource models\" which largely split a given ecosystem into resources (e.g. sunlight or available water in soil) and consumers (e.g. any living thing, including plants and animals), and attempts to define the scope of possible relationships that could exist between the two groups.\nIn contemporary niche theory, the \"impact niche\" is defined as the combination of effects that a given consumer has on both a). the resources that it uses, and b). the other consumers in the ecosystem. Therefore, the impact niche is equivalent to the Eltonian niche since both concepts are defined by the impact of a given species on its environment.\nThe range of environmental conditions where a species can successfully survive and reproduce (i.e. the Hutchinsonian definition of a realized niche) is also encompassed under contemporary niche theory, termed the \"requirement niche\". The requirement niche is bounded by both the availability of resources as well as the effects of coexisting consumers (e.g. competitors and predators).\nCoexistence under contemporary niche theory.\nContemporary niche theory provides three requirements that must be met in order for two species (consumers) to coexist:\nThese requirements are interesting and controversial because they require any two species to share a certain environment (have overlapping requirement niches) but fundamentally differ the ways that they use (or \"impact\") that environment. These requirements have repeatedly been violated by nonnative (i.e. introduced and invasive) species, which often coexist with new species in their nonnative ranges, but do not appear to be constricted these requirements. In other words, contemporary niche theory predicts that species will be unable to invade new environments outside of their requirement (i.e. realized) niche, yet many examples of this are well-documented. Additionally, contemporary niche theory predicts that species will be unable to establish in environments where other species already consume resources in the same ways as the incoming species, however examples of this are also numerous.\nNiche differentiation.\nIn ecology, niche differentiation (also known as niche segregation, niche separation and niche partitioning) refers to the process by which competing species use the environment differently in a way that helps them to coexist. The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species with identical niches (ecological roles) compete, then one will inevitably drive the other to extinction. This rule also states that two species cannot occupy the same exact niche in a habitat and coexist together, at least in a stable manner. When two species differentiate their niches, they tend to compete less strongly, and are thus more likely to coexist. Species can differentiate their niches in many ways, such as by consuming different foods, or using different areas of the environment.\nAs an example of niche partitioning, several anole lizards in the Caribbean islands share common diets\u2014mainly insects. They avoid competition by occupying different physical locations. Although these lizards might occupy different locations, some species can be found inhabiting the same range, with up to 15 in certain areas. For example, some live on the ground while others are arboreal. Species who live in different areas compete less for food and other resources, which minimizes competition between species. However, species who live in similar areas typically compete with each other.\nDetection and quantification.\nThe Lotka\u2013Volterra equation states that two competing species can coexist when intra-specific (within species) competition is greater than inter-specific (between species) competition. Since niche differentiation concentrates competition within-species, due to a decrease in between-species competition, the Lotka-Volterra model predicts that niche differentiation of any degree will result in coexistence.\nIn reality, this still leaves the question of how much differentiation is needed for coexistence. A vague answer to this question is that the more similar two species are, the more finely balanced the suitability of their environment must be in order to allow coexistence. There are limits to the amount of niche differentiation required for coexistence, and this can vary with the type of resource, the nature of the environment, and the amount of variation both within and between the species.\nTo answer questions about niche differentiation, it is necessary for ecologists to be able to detect, measure, and quantify the niches of different coexisting and competing species. This is often done through a combination of detailed ecological studies, controlled experiments (to determine the strength of competition), and mathematical models. To understand the mechanisms of niche differentiation and competition, much data must be gathered on how the two species interact, how they use their resources, and the type of ecosystem in which they exist, among other factors. In addition, several mathematical models exist to quantify niche breadth, competition, and coexistence (Bastolla et al. 2005). However, regardless of methods used, niches and competition can be distinctly difficult to measure quantitatively, and this makes detection and demonstration of niche differentiation difficult and complex.\nDevelopment.\nOver time, two competing species can either coexist, through niche differentiation or other means, or compete until one species becomes locally extinct. Several theories exist for how niche differentiation arises or evolves given these two possible outcomes.\nCurrent competition (The Ghost of Competition Present).\nNiche differentiation can arise from current competition. For instance, species X has a fundamental niche of the entire slope of a hillside, but its realized niche is only the top portion of the slope because species Y, which is a better competitor but cannot survive on the top portion of the slope, has excluded it from the lower portion of the slope. With this scenario, competition will continue indefinitely in the middle of the slope between these two species. Because of this, detection of the presence of niche differentiation (through competition) will be relatively easy. Importantly, there is no evolutionary change of the individual species in this case; rather this is an ecological effect of species Y out-competing species X within the bounds of species Y's fundamental niche.\nVia past extinctions (The Ghost of Competition Past).\nAnother way by which niche differentiation can arise is via the previous elimination of species without realized niches. This asserts that at some point in the past, several species inhabited an area, and all of these species had overlapping fundamental niches. However, through competitive exclusion, the less competitive species were eliminated, leaving only the species that were able to coexist (i.e. the most competitive species whose realized niches did not overlap). Again, this process does not include any evolutionary change of individual species, but it is merely the product of the competitive exclusion principle. Also, because no species is out-competing any other species in the final community, the presence of niche differentiation will be difficult or impossible to detect.\nEvolving differences.\nFinally, niche differentiation can arise as an evolutionary effect of competition. In this case, two competing species will evolve different patterns of resource use so as to avoid competition. Here too, current competition is absent or low, and therefore detection of niche differentiation is difficult or impossible.\nTypes.\nBelow is a list of ways that species can partition their niche. This list is not exhaustive, but illustrates several classic examples.\nResource partitioning.\nResource partitioning is the phenomenon where two or more species divides out resources like food, space, resting sites etc. to coexist. For example, some lizard species appear to coexist because they consume insects of differing sizes. Alternatively, species can coexist on the same resources if each species is limited by different resources, or differently able to capture resources. Different types of phytoplankton can coexist when different species are differently limited by nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and light. In the Galapagos Islands, finches with small beaks are more able to consume small seeds, and finches with large beaks are more able to consume large seeds. If a species' density declines, then the food it most depends on will become more abundant (since there are so few individuals to consume it). As a result, the remaining individuals will experience less competition for food.\nAlthough \"resource\" generally refers to food, species can partition other non-consumable objects, such as parts of the habitat. For example, warblers are thought to coexist because they nest in different parts of trees. Species can also partition habitat in a way that gives them access to different types of resources. As stated in the introduction, anole lizards appear to coexist because each uses different parts of the forests as perch locations. This likely gives them access to different species of insects as well.\nResearch has determined that plants can recognize each other's root systems and differentiate between a clone, a plant grown from the same mother plants seeds, and other species. Based on the root secretions, also called exudates, plants can make this determination. The communication between plants starts with the secretions from plant roots into the rhizosphere. If another plant that is kin is entering this area the plant will take up exudates. The exudate, being several different compounds, will enter the plants root cell and attach to a receptor for that chemical halting growth of the root meristem in that direction, if the interaction is kin.\nSimonsen discusses how plants accomplish root communication with the addition of beneficial rhizobia and fungal networks and the potential for different genotypes of the kin plants, such as the legume M. Lupulina, and specific strains of nitrogen fixing bacteria and rhizomes can alter relationships between kin and non-kin competition. This means there could be specific subsets of genotypes in kin plants that selects well with specific strains that could outcompete other kin. What might seem like an instance in kin competition could just be different genotypes of organisms at play in the soil that increase the symbiotic efficiency.\nPredator partitioning.\nPredator partitioning occurs when species are attacked differently by different predators (or natural enemies more generally). For example, trees could differentiate their niche if they are consumed by different species of specialist herbivores, such as herbivorous insects. If a species density declines, so too will the density of its natural enemies, giving it an advantage. Thus, if each species is constrained by different natural enemies, they will be able to coexist. Early work focused on specialist predators; however, more recent studies have shown that predators do not need to be pure specialists, they simply need to affect each prey species differently. The Janzen\u2013Connell hypothesis represents a form of predator partitioning.\nConditional differentiation.\nConditional differentiation (sometimes called temporal niche partitioning) occurs when species differ in their competitive abilities based on varying environmental conditions. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, some annual plants are more successful during wet years, while others are more successful during dry years. As a result, each species will have an advantage in some years, but not others. When environmental conditions are most favorable, individuals will tend to compete most strongly with member of the same species. For example, in a dry year, dry-adapted plants will tend to be most limited by other dry-adapted plants. This can help them to coexist through a storage effect.\nCompetition-predation trade-off.\nSpecies can differentiate their niche via a competition-predation trade-off if one species is a better competitor when predators are absent, and the other is better when predators are present. Defenses against predators, such as toxic compounds or hard shells, are often metabolically costly. As a result, species that produce such defenses are often poor competitors when predators are absent. Species can coexist through a competition-predation trade-off if predators are more abundant when the less defended species is common, and less abundant if the well-defended species is common. This effect has been criticized as being weak, because theoretical models suggest that only two species within a community can coexist because of this mechanism.\nSegregation versus restriction.\nTwo ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called \"classical\" ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because \"neighbouring\" species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of natural selection introduced by Darwin as an explanation for evolution.\nThe other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many vacant niches. It is based on many empirical studies and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993. Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.\nBoth paradigms agree that species are never \"universal\" in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, \"Toxoplasma\" (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, \"Enterobius vermicularis\" infects only humans.\nThe following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:\n\"Niche restriction\":\n\"Niche segregation\":\nRelative significance of the mechanisms.\nBoth paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. \u2013 Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that interspecific competition is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984) and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don't even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984) concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980) found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983), in his review of competition in \"Drosophila\" and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. \u2013 Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002) has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs. This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models. Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.\nFor a detailed discussion, especially of competition and reinforcement of reproductive barriers, see\nCoexistence without niche differentiation: exceptions to the rule.\nSome competing species have been shown to coexist on the same resource with no observable evidence of niche differentiation and in \"violation\" of the competitive exclusion principle. One instance is in a group of hispine beetle species. These beetle species, which eat the same food and occupy the same habitat, coexist without any evidence of segregation or exclusion. The beetles show no aggression either intra- or inter-specifically. Coexistence may be possible through a combination of non-limiting food and habitat resources and high rates of predation and parasitism, though this has not been demonstrated.\nThis example illustrates that the evidence for niche differentiation is by no means universal. Niche differentiation is also not the only means by which coexistence is possible between two competing species. However, niche differentiation is a critically important ecological idea which explains species coexistence, thus promoting the high biodiversity often seen in many of the world's biomes.\nResearch using mathematical modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers can serve as an example. The idea is that it is also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae. The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.\nNiche and Geographic Range.\nThe geographic range of a species can be viewed as a spatial reflection of its niche, along with characteristics of the geographic template and the species that influence its potential to colonize. The fundamental geographic range of a species is the area it occupies in which environmental conditions are favorable, without restriction from barriers to disperse or colonize. A species will be confined to its realized geographic range when confronting biotic interactions or abiotic barriers that limit dispersal, a more narrow subset of its larger fundamental geographic range.\nAn early study on ecological niches conducted by Joseph H. Connell analyzed the environmental factors that limit the range of a barnacle (\"Chthamalus stellatus\") on Scotland's Isle of Cumbrae. In his experiments, Connell described the dominant features of \"C. stellatus\" niches and provided explanation for their distribution on intertidal zone of the rocky coast of the Isle. Connell described the upper portion of C. stellatus's range is limited by the barnacle's ability to resist dehydration during periods of low tide. The lower portion of the range was limited by interspecific interactions, namely competition with a cohabiting barnacle species and predation by a snail. By removing the competing \"B. balanoides\", Connell showed that \"C. stellatus\" was able to extend the lower edge of its realized niche in the absence of competitive exclusion. These experiments demonstrate how biotic and abiotic factors limit the distribution of an organism.\nParameters.\nThe different dimensions, or \"plot axes\", of a niche represent different biotic and abiotic variables. These factors may include descriptions of the organism's life history, habitat, trophic position (place in the food chain), and geographic range. According to the competitive exclusion principle, no two species can occupy the same niche in the same environment for a long time. The parameters of a realized niche are described by the realized niche width of that species. Some plants and animals, called specialists, need specific habitats and surroundings to survive, such as the spotted owl, which lives specifically in old growth forests. Other plants and animals, called generalists, are not as particular and can survive in a range of conditions, for example the dandelion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He worked as a gardener, and explored the Scottish Highlands, North America and Hawaii, where he died. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation Douglas is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nEarly life.\nDouglas was born in Scone, Perthshire, the second son of John Douglas, a stonemason, and Jean Drummond. At around the age of seven, he attended a school in a neighboring parish, where he became known for his tardiness and truancy, preferring to explore the countryside during his two-mile walk to class. He attended school in Kinnoull, on the eastern banks of the River Tay, and upon leaving found work as an apprentice to William Beattie, head gardener at nearby Scone Palace, the seat of the Earl of Mansfield. He spent seven years in this position, completing his apprenticeship, and then spent a winter at a college in Perth to learn more of the scientific and mathematical aspects of plant culture. After a further spell of working at Valleyfield House in Fife (during which time he had access to a library of botanical and zoological books), he moved to the Botanical Gardens of Glasgow University and attended botany lectures. William Jackson Hooker, who was Garden Director and Professor of Botany, was greatly impressed with him and took him on an expedition to the Scottish Highlands before recommending him to the Royal Horticultural Society.\nExplorations.\nDouglas made three separate trips from Britain to North America. His first, to eastern North America, began on 3 June 1823, with a return in the late autumn of 1823. The second was to the Pacific Northwest, from July 1824 returning October 1827. His third and final trip started in England in October 1829. On that last journey he went first to the Columbia River, then to San Francisco, then in August 1832, to Hawaii. In October 1832, he returned to the Columbia River region. A year later, in October 1833, he returned to Hawaii, arriving on 2 January 1834. The second expedition starting in 1824 was his most successful. The Royal Horticultural Society sent him back on a plant-hunting expedition in the Pacific Northwest that ranks among the great botanical explorations.\nIn the spring of 1826, David Douglas was compelled to climb a peak (Mount Brown, of the mythical pair Hooker and Brown) near Athabasca Pass to take in the view. In so doing, he was perhaps one of the first Europeans to be a \"mountaineer\" in North America. He introduced the Douglas fir (Douglas-fir) into cultivation in 1827. Other notable introductions include Sitka Spruce, Sugar Pine, Western White Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Monterey Pine, Grand Fir, Noble Fir and several other conifers that transformed the British landscape and timber industry, as well as numerous garden shrubs and herbs such as the Flowering currant, Salal, Lupin, Penstemon and California poppy. His success was well beyond expectations; in one of his letters to Hooker, he wrote \"you will begin to think I manufacture pines at my pleasure\". Altogether he introduced about 240 species of plants to Britain.\nHe first briefly visited Hawaii in 1830 on his way to the Pacific Northwest. He returned again in December 1833 intending to spend three months of winter there. He was only the second European to reach the summit of the Mauna Loa volcano.\nDeath.\nDouglas died under mysterious circumstances while climbing Mauna Kea in Hawaii at the age of 35 in 1834. He apparently fell into a pit trap where he was mauled to death by a bull. He was last seen alive at the hut of Englishman Edward \"Ned\" Gurney, a bullock hunter and escaped convict. Gurney was suspected in Douglas's death, as Douglas was said to have been carrying more money than Gurney subsequently delivered with the body; others suggested he might have been robbed and murdered by two native Hawaiians. However, no evidence was found to contradict Gurney's story.\nIn 1856, a marker to Douglas was erected on an outside wall at Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church (Kawaiahao Church Cemetery). A monument was built, at the spot where Douglas died, by members of the Hilo Burns Society, including David McHattie Forbes. It is called \"Ka lua kauka\" (\"Doctor's Pit\" in the Hawaiian language), off M\u0101n\u0101 Road on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi (). A small stand of Douglas fir trees has been planted there.\nLegacy.\nAlthough the common name \"Douglas fir\" refers to him, the tree's scientific name, \"Pseudotsuga menziesii\", honours a rival botanist, Archibald Menzies. Several Hawaiian plants were named after him in earlier taxonomies, such as \"Pandanus tectorius\" known in Hawaiian as \"hala\", sometimes given the name \"Pandanus douglasii\". A species of \"horned toad\", \"Phrynosoma douglasii\", is named in honor of David Douglas. Over eighty species of plants and animals have \"douglasii\" in their scientific names, in his honour. He introduced several hundred plants to Great Britain and hence to Europe. There is a memorial to David Douglas in his birthplace of Scone. David Douglas High School and the David Douglas School District in Portland, Oregon are named after him. Remnants of a greenhouse built by David Douglas can be seen in Wood Street Village, Surrey.\nIn Vancouver, Washington, he is remembered via David Douglas Park which was used during World War II as interim housing for the Kaiser Shipyard workers living in little silver trailers, giving the area the brief nickname during the era of \"Trailer Terrace Park.\"\nThe David Douglas Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution was founded in Redmond, Washington in 1981.\nThe actor Alvy Moore was cast as Douglas in the 1962 episode \"The Grass Man\" of the television series \"Death Valley Days\".\nFamily.\nDavid Douglas had a son who was named David Finlay. David Finlay, who was recorded as being an interpreter, died in April 1850 at the hands of Black-feet raiders. He lived in Montana, an area where Douglas had spent long periods of time over 20 years previously, which would tie in with the age of his son, who died when he was around 22 years old. It is not known if David Douglas was aware that he had fathered a child.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus \"Betula\" contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are typically short-lived pioneer species and are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates. Birch wood is used for a wide range of purposes.\nDescription.\nBirch species are generally small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, mostly of northern temperate and boreal climates. The simple leaves are alternate, singly or doubly serrate, feather-veined, petiolate and stipulate. They often appear in pairs, but these pairs are really borne on spur-like, two-leaved, lateral branchlets. The fruit is a small samara, although the wings may be obscure in some species. They differ from the alders (\"Alnus\", another genus in the family) in that the female catkins are not woody and disintegrate at maturity, falling apart to release the seeds, unlike the woody, cone-like female alder catkins.\nThe bark of all birches is characteristically marked with long, horizontal lenticels, and often separates into thin, papery plates, especially upon the paper birch. Distinctive colors give the common names gray, white, black, silver and yellow birch to different species.\nThe buds, forming early and full-grown by midsummer, are all lateral, without a terminal bud forming; the branch is prolonged by the upper lateral bud. The wood of all the species is close-grained with a satiny texture and capable of taking a fine polish; its fuel value is fair.\nFlower and fruit.\nThe flowers are monoecious, and open with or before the leaves. Once fully grown, these leaves are usually long on three-flowered clusters in the axils of the scales of drooping or erect catkins or aments. Staminate catkins are pendulous, clustered, or solitary in the axils of the last leaves of the branch of the year or near the ends of the short lateral branchlets of the year. They form in early autumn and remain rigid during the winter. The scales of the mature staminate catkins are broadly ovate, rounded, yellow or orange colour below the middle and dark chestnut brown at apex. Each scale bears two bractlets and three sterile flowers, each flower consisting of a sessile, membranous, usually two-lobed, calyx. Each calyx bears four short filaments with one-celled anthers or strictly, two filaments divided into two branches, each bearing a half-anther. Anther cells open longitudinally. The pistillate segments are erect or pendulous, and solitary, terminal on the two-leaved lateral spur-like branchlets of the year. The pistillate scales are oblong-ovate, three-lobed, pale yellow-green often tinged with red, becoming brown at maturity. These scales bear two or three fertile flowers, each flower consisting of a naked ovary. The ovary is compressed, two-celled, and crowned with two slender styles; the ovule is solitary. Each scale bears a single small, winged nut that is oval, with two persistent stigmas at the apex.\nTaxonomy.\nSubdivision.\n\"Betula\" species are organised into five subgenera.\nNote: many American texts have \"B. pendula\" and \"B. pubescens\" confused, though they are distinct species with different chromosome numbers.\nEtymology.\nThe common name \"birch\" comes from Old English \"birce\", \"bierce\", from Proto-Germanic *\"berk-j\u014dn\" (cf. German \"Birke\", West Frisian \"bjirk\"), an adjectival formation from *\"berk\u014dn\" (cf. Dutch \"berk\", Low German \"Bark\", Danish \"birk\", Norwegian \"bj\u00f8rk\"), itself from the Proto-Indo-European root *\"b\u02b0erH\u01f5-\" ~ \"b\u02b0rH\u01f5\"-, which also gave Lithuanian \"b\u00e9r\u017eas\", Latvian \"B\u0113rzs\", Russian \"\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0437\u0430 (ber\u00ebza)\", Ukrainian \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430 (\"ber\u00e9za)\", Albanian \"bredh\" 'fir', Ossetian \"b\u00e6rz(\u00e6)\", Sanskrit \"bhurja\", Polish \"brzoza\", Latin \"fraxinus\" 'ash (tree)'. This root is presumably derived from *\"b\u02b0reh\u2081\u01f5-\" 'to shine, whiten', in reference to the birch's white bark. The Proto-Germanic rune \"berkanan\" is named after the birch.\nThe generic name \"Betula\" is from Latin, which is a diminutive borrowed from Gaulish \"betua\" (cf. Old Irish \"bethe\", Welsh \"bedw\").\nEvolutionary history.\nWithin Betulaceae, birches are most closely related to alder. The oldest known birch fossils are those of \"Betula leopoldae\" from the Klondike Mountain Formation in Washington State, US, which date to the early Eocene (Ypresian) around 49 million years ago.\nEcology.\nBirches often form even-aged stands on light, well-drained, particularly acidic soils. They are regarded as pioneer species, rapidly colonizing open ground especially in secondary successional sequences following a disturbance or fire. Birches are early tree species to become established in primary successions, and can become a threat to heathland if the seedlings and saplings are not suppressed by grazing or periodic burning. Birches are generally lowland species, but some species, such as \"Betula nana\", have a montane distribution. In the British Isles, there is some difference between the environments of \"Betula pendula\" and \"Betula pubescens\", and some hybridization, though both are \"opportunists in steady-state woodland systems\". Mycorrhizal fungi, including sheathing (ecto)mycorrhizas, are found in some cases to be beneficial to tree growth.\nA large number of lepidopteran insects feed on birch foliage.\nUses.\nBecause of the hardness of birch, it is easier to shape it with power tools; it is quite difficult to work it with hand tools.\nAs food.\nThe inner bark is considered edible as an emergency food, even when raw. It can be dried and ground into flour, as was done by Native Americans and early settlers. It can also be cut into strips and cooked like noodles.\nThe sap can be drunk or used to make syrup and birch beer. Tea can be made from the red inner bark of black birches.\nCultivation.\nWhite-barked birches in particular are cultivated as ornamental trees, largely for their appearance in winter. The Himalayan birch, \"Betula utilis\", especially the variety or subspecies \"jacquemontii\", is among the most widely planted for this purpose. It has been cultivated since the 1870s, and many cultivars are available, including 'Doorenbos', 'Grayswood Ghost' and 'Silver Shadow'; 'Knightshayes' has a slightly weeping habit. Other species with ornamental white bark include \"Betula ermanii\", \"Betula papyrifera\", \"Betula pendula\" and \"Betula raddeana\".\nMedical.\nApproved topical medicine.\nIn the European Union, a prescription gel containing birch bark extract (commercial name \"Episalvan\", betulae cortex dry extract (5\u201310 : 1); extraction solvent: \"n\"-heptane 95% (w/w)) was approved in 2016 for the topical treatment of minor skin wounds in adults. Although its mechanism of action in helping to heal injured skin is not fully understood, birch bark extract appears to stimulate the growth of keratinocytes which then fill the wound.\nResearch and traditional medicine.\nPreliminary research indicates that the phytochemicals, betulin and possibly other triterpenes, are active in \"Episalvan\" gel and wound healing properties of birch bark.\nOver centuries, birch bark was used in traditional medicine practices by North American indigenous people for treating superficial wounds by applying bark directly to the skin. Splints made with birch bark were used as casts for broken limbs in the 16th century.\nPaper.\nWood pulp made from birch gives relatively long and slender fibres for a hardwood. The thin walls cause the fibre to collapse upon drying, giving a paper with low bulk and low opacity. The birch fibres are, however, easily fibrillated and give about 75% of the tensile strength of softwood. The low opacity makes it suitable for making glassine.\nIn India, the birch (Sanskrit: \u092d\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091c, \"bhurja\") holds great historical significance in the culture of North India, where the thin bark coming off in winter was extensively used as writing paper. Birch paper (Sanskrit: \u092d\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091c \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930, \"bhurja patra\") is exceptionally durable and was the material used for many ancient Indian texts. The Roman period Vindolanda tablets also use birch as a material on which to write and birch bark was used widely in ancient Russia as notepaper (\"beresta\") and for decorative purposes and even making footwear (\"lapti\") and baskets.\nUse in musical instruments.\nBirch wood is sometimes used as a tonewood for semiacoustic and acoustic guitar bodies, and occasionally for solid-body guitar bodies. It is also a common material used in mallets for keyboard percussion. Drum manufacturers, such as Gretsch and Yamaha, have been known to use birch wood in the construction of drum shells, owing to its strength and colour which takes stain in an appealing way, and which can also amber over very well, while also giving the drums an appealing tone which changes depending on the type of birch used.\nCulture.\nBirches have spiritual importance in several religions, both modern and historical. In Celtic cultures, the birch symbolises growth, renewal, stability, initiation, and adaptability because it is highly adaptive and able to sustain harsh conditions with casual indifference. Proof of this adaptability is seen in its easy and eager ability to repopulate areas damaged by forest fires or clearings. Birches are also associated with \"T\u00edr na n\u00d3g\", the land of the dead and the \"Sidhe\", in Gaelic folklore, and as such frequently appear in Scottish, Irish, and English folksongs and ballads in association with death, or fairies, or returning from the grave. The leaves of the silver birch tree are used in the festival of St George, held in Novosej and other villages in Albania.\nThe birch is New Hampshire's state tree and the national tree of Finland and Russia. The yellow birch is the official tree of the province of Quebec (Canada). The birch is a very important element in Russian culture and represents the grace, strength, tenderness and natural beauty of Russian women as well as the closeness to nature of the Russians. It's associated with marriage and love. There are numerous folkloric Russian songs in which the birch tree occurs. The Orn\u00e4s birch is the national tree of Sweden. The Czech word for the month of March, B\u0159ezen, is derived from the Czech word b\u0159\u00edza meaning birch, as birch trees flower in March under local conditions. The silver birch tree is of special importance to the Swedish city of Ume\u00e5. In 1888, the Ume\u00e5 city fire spread all over the city and nearly burnt it down to the ground, but some birches, supposedly, halted the spread of the fire. To protect the city against future fires, wide avenues were created, and these were lined with silver birch trees all over the city. Ume\u00e5 later adopted the unofficial name of \"City of the Birches (\"Bj\u00f6rkarnas stad\")\". Also, the ice hockey team of Ume\u00e5 is called \"Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven\", translated to English \"The Birch Leaves\".\n\"Swinging\" birch trees was a common game for American children in the nineteenth century. American poet Lucy Larcom's \"Swinging on a Birch Tree\" celebrates the game. The poem inspired Robert Frost, who pays homage to the act of climbing birch trees in his more famous poem, \"Birches\". Frost once told \"it was almost sacrilegious climbing a birch tree till it bent, till it gave and swooped to the ground, but that's what boys did in those days\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67257", "revid": "7407280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67257", "title": "Chester Gould", "text": "American cartoonist (1900\u20131985)\nChester Gould (; November 20, 1900 \u2013 May 11, 1985) was an American cartoonist, best known as the creator of the \"Dick Tracy\" comic strip, which he wrote and drew from 1931 to 1977, incorporating numerous colorful and monstrous villains.\nEarly life and education.\nChester Gould was born to Gilbert R. Gould and Alice Maud (n\u00e9e Miller), in a log cabin outside Pawnee, Oklahoma. All four of his grandparents were pioneer settlers of Oklahoma. One grandfather was a minister, and Gould and his family were members of the United Brethren Church. \nA cousin, Henry W. Gould, is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at West Virginia University.\nGilbert Gould was an editor at the \"Pawnee Courier-Dispatch\", which Chester would later credit for becoming a cartoonist. When he was 8, a Supreme Court lawyer bought a drawing Gould had made when the lawyer was in town for a political event. Over the next few years he entered various contests and enrolled in a correspondence course in drawing. While still a senior in high school, he was discovered by the yearbook staff at Oklahoma A&amp;M University and was hired to make line drawings for the 1918 and 1919 editions.\nDevelopment.\nHe enrolled at A&amp;M himself in 1919 and drew editorial cartoons for the \"Tulsa Democrat\" and sports cartoons for \"The Daily Oklahoman\". He was an early member of Lambda Chi Alpha, the oldest fraternity on campus, becoming its 44th initiate. In 1921 he transferred to Northwestern University, drawn to Chicago by the \"Chicago Tribune\" and its support for syndicated cartoon strips.\nFor the next ten years, Gould submitted many ideas for comic strips to Joseph Patterson, publisher of the \"Tribune\", but none were accepted. To support himself, he drew ads and cartoons freelance for the \"Chicago Daily Journal\". After graduation, he was hired by the Hearst-owned \"Chicago Evening American\", and got his first comic strips into print: \"Fillum Fables\", a spoof of silent films, and \"Radio Catts\", featuring an anthropomorphic family of cats fascinated by the radio. The Hearst-owned King Features Syndicate syndicated both.\nGould met and married Edna Gauger in 1926, and their daughter was born the following year. In 1928, he joined the \"Chicago Daily News\" and launched his third comic strip, called \"The Girl Friends\", while continuing to send ideas to Patterson. In June 1931, by Gould's account, he was listening to a radio series based on Sherlock Holmes stories and reading a newspaper account of Chicago's most powerful mobster, Al Capone; he was inspired to create a strip about a heroic detective fighting organized crime and corruption in the city. After rejecting 60 submissions from Gould, Patterson accepted his 61st.\n\"Dick Tracy\".\nGould was hired as a cartoonist with the \"Tribune\" and introduced \"Dick Tracy\" in the \"Detroit Mirror\" on Sunday, October 4, 1931. He drew the comic strip for the next 46 years from his home in Woodstock, Illinois.\nIn order to keep informed of police methods, Gould took courses in forensics and investigative procedures. He was later proud of having introduced the two-way wrist radio for Tracy in 1946, and in 1947, the closed-circuit television, both of which were later invented, though in somewhat different forms.\nGould's stories were rarely pre-planned, since he preferred to improvise stories as he drew them. While fans praised this approach as producing exciting stories, it sometimes created awkward plot developments that were difficult to resolve. In one notorious case, Gould had Tracy in an inescapable deathtrap with a caisson. When Gould depicted Tracy addressing Gould personally and having the cartoonist magically extract him, publisher Joseph Patterson vetoed the sequence and ordered it redrawn. The strip also drew protests from those who felt that Gould's depiction of crime was too gruesome, that he poured on too much gore and carnage.\nLater in the strip's Gould period, \"Dick Tracy\" was widely criticized for being too right-wing in character and as excessively supportive of the police. A handful of critics thought Gould ignored the rights of the accused and failed to support his agenda with an adequate storyline. The late 1950s also saw a newspaper readership growing less indulgent of Gould's politics.\nFor instance, Gould introduced a malodorous, tobacco-spitting character, B.O. Plenty, with little significant complaint from readers in the 1940s. However, the 1960s introduction of crooked lawyer Flyface and his relatives, surrounded by swarming flies, created a negative reader reaction strong enough for papers to drop the strip in large numbers. There was then a dramatic change in the strip's setting, leaving behind the strip's origins as an urban crime drama for science fiction plot elements and regular visits to the Moon. An increasingly fantastic procession of enemies and stories ensued. The Apollo 11 Moon landing prompted Gould to abandon this phase. Finally, \"Dick Tracy\" was beset by the overall trend in newspaper comics away from strips with continuing storylines and toward those whose stories are largely resolved within one series of panels.\nGould, his characters, and improbable plots were satirized in Al Capp's comic strip \"Li'l Abner\" with the \"Fearless Fosdick\" sequences (supposedly drawn by \"Lester Gooch\"); a notable villain was Bomb Face, a gangster whose head was a bomb.\nGould retired in 1977, with his last \"Dick Tracy\" strip appearing in print on Christmas Day, December 25. The strip continued with Gould's longtime assistant artist, Rick Fletcher, producing the artwork and Max Allan Collins as writer.\nDeath.\nGould died of congestive heart failure on May 11, 1985 at his home in Woodstock. He was 84 years old. Gould is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Woodstock.\nAwards and exhibitions.\nChester Gould won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award in 1959 and 1977, and was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1978. The Mystery Writers of America honored Gould and his work with a Special Edgar Award in 1980. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative postage stamps and postcards.\n\"Dick Tracy: The Art of Chester Gould\" was an exhibition in Port Chester, New York, at the Museum of Cartoon Art from October 4 through November 30, 1978. The exhibition was curated by Bill Crouch, Jr.\nFrom 1991 until 2008, the art and artifacts of Gould's career were displayed in the Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum that operated from the Woodstock, Illinois, Old Courthouse on the Square. Visitors to the Museum saw original comic strips, correspondence, photographs, and much memorabilia, including Gould's drawing board and chair. In 2000, the Museum received a Superior Achievement Award from the Illinois Association of Museums, and in 2001, it was given an Award of Excellence from the Illinois State Historical Society. The museum continues today as a virtual museum online.\nIn 2005, Gould was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, by Michael Vance. The Oklahoma Cartoonists Collection, created by Vance, is located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.\nA graduate of Northwestern University, Gould was honored with the naming of the \"Chester Gould Society\" for the School of Professional Studies donors.\nBooks.\nIn 1983, two years before Gould's death, his only child, Jean Gould O'Connell, recorded extensive interviews with her father, who spoke at length about his early attempts during the 1920s to get syndicated and the birth of Dick Tracy. These interviews became a major source when she wrote his biography, \"Chester Gould: A Daughter's Biography of the Creator of Dick Tracy\", published by McFarland &amp; Company in 2007.\nThe entire run of \"Dick Tracy\" is being reprinted by IDW Publishing in a book series, \"The Complete Chester Gould's Dick Tracy\". The series began in 2006. The first volume includes the five sample strips that Gould used to sell his strip, followed by over 450 strips showing the series' beginning (from October 1931\u00a0\u2013 May 1933), along with a Gould interview, never previously published, by Max Allan Collins. The penultimate volume, Volume 28, ending with the strip for March 14, 1976, was published in 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located south of the Canada\u2013United States border and south of Montreal. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 44,743. It is the most populous city in Vermont. \nA regional college town, Burlington is home to the University of Vermont (UVM) and Champlain College. Vermont's largest hospital, the UVM Medical Center, is within the city limits. The City of Burlington owns Vermont's largest airport, the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, located in neighboring South Burlington. In 2015, Burlington became the first city in the U.S. to run entirely on renewable energy.\nHistory.\nBeginnings to early 20th century.\nKing George II of Great Britain placed the western border of the Province of New Hampshire east of the Hudson River. However, George III moved the Province of New York's border to the Connecticut River. He stated that the land claims of those currently in the area gained by New York were still valid, but New York courts ruled against the settlers. New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth continued to sell land in these areas in direct opposition to New York and royal demands. On June 7, 1763, the grant document for Burlington was awarded to Samuel Willis and 63 others. In the summer of 1775, settlers began clearing the land and built two or three log huts in 1775, but the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War delayed permanent settlement until after its conclusion. The first recorded town meeting was held on March 19, 1787.\nThe origins for the name Burlington is disputed. Benning Wentworth named many areas after rich people. Wealthy New Yorker Edward Burling who held land grants in Colchester, Vermont, or Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who died a decade before the land grant, are the two candidates for the origin of the name. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington. A settler from Burlington, Vermont, named Burlington, Iowa, in honor of it.\nIn 1808, the world's first lake-going steamboat was built in Burlington.\nThe War of 1812 was unpopular in Vermont and the rest of New England, which had numerous trading ties with Canada. Neither Vermont nor other New England states provided militia units or financial support. Vermont voters supported the Federalist Party, which opposed the war.\nAt one point during the war, the U.S. had 5,000 troops stationed in Burlington, outnumbering residents and putting a strain on resources. About 500 soldiers died of disease, which was always a problem due to poor sanitation in army camps. Some soldiers were quartered in the main building at the University of Vermont, where a memorial plaque commemorates them.\nIn a skirmish on August 2, 1813, British forces from Canada shelled Burlington. This is described as either a bold stroke by the British with an ineffectual response from the Americans or as a weak sally by the British, which was rightly ignored by the Americans. The cannonade lasted about 10 minutes and caused no casualties. The American troops involved were commanded by Naval Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, later a hero of the Battle of Lake Champlain.\nThe town's position on Lake Champlain helped it develop into a port of entry and center for trade, particularly after completion of the Champlain Canal in 1823, the Erie Canal in 1825, and the Chambly Canal in 1843. Wharves allowed steamboats to connect freight and passengers with the Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad and the Vermont Central Railroad. Burlington became a bustling lumbering and manufacturing center \u2013 for some time the third largest lumber market in the world \u2013 and was incorporated as a city in 1865. Its Victorian-era prosperity left behind much fine architecture, including buildings by Ammi B. Young, H.H. Richardson, and McKim, Mead &amp; White.\nOn September 5, 1901, U.S. vice president Theodore Roosevelt spoke to a Civil War fraternal group in Burlington. Nine days later, he became U.S. president when President William McKinley died.\nLate 20th century to present.\nIn 1870, the waterfront was extended by construction of the Pine Street Barge Canal. This became polluted over the years and was a focus for cleanup in 2009 under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program. In fact, the entire Burlington waterfront was a derelict wasteland as late as the mid-1980s, with rail yards, industrial uses and 90 oil storage tanks crowding the 60 acres of shoreline filled into the harbor during the lumbering era.\nIn 1980, two 18 story luxury condominium towers were proposed for the waterfront, just north of College Street. Opposition to that proposal led to the formation of the Citizens Waterfront Group to advocate for a bike path along the shore instead.\nIn 1987, former Mayor Bernie Sanders proposed a community boathouse to anchor public redevelopment at the waterfront. The land filled into the harbor was eventually redesigned for public use in a decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1989.\nBy 1990, the Burlington Bike Path was complete, from Oakledge Park in the south, to the Winooski River in the north. In 2004, Governor Howard Dean obtained funding for construction of a bike bridge across the Winooski River, allowing the bike path to be extended four miles out into the lake on the old railroad causeway to the Champlain Islands, now known as the Island Line Trail.\nIn 1978, the ice cream enterprise Ben &amp; Jerry's was founded in Burlington in a renovated gas station. It became a national brand, with retail outlets in numerous cities.\nThe local bicycle advocacy that emerged from this effort led to the formation of the non-profit Local Motion. They now run a bike ferry during the summer to get bicycles across a 200 yard gap in the railroad causeway, so they can get all the way out to the Lake Champlain islands.\nIn 2021, following the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, the city council scheduled a vote on a \"Resolution In Solidarity with the Palestinian People\" for September 13. The resolution called on the city council to \"express its solidarity with the Palestinian people, condemn anti-boycott legislation, and endorse the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls for nonviolent pressure on Israel.\" The authors' stated reasons for introducing the resolution were Israeli settlements in the West Bank, an ongoing \"military siege and an economic blockade\" of Gaza, and US military aid to Israel. They also cited reports by Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem that find Israel guilty of the crime of apartheid.\nThe American Jewish Committee condemned the resolution as \"deceptive and one-sided\" and criticized it for its sole focus on Israel. A coalition of local rabbis and community groups condemned the resolution as well, citing the timing of the vote during the Jewish High Holy Days, between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and fears that the resolution would fuel antisemitism. Former mayor Miro Weinberger called the resolution \"inappropriate and counterproductive\". In a 6\u20135 vote, the council decided to withdraw the resolution.\nIn 2023, three Palestinian-American students were shot and injured in an incident during Thanksgiving break.\nGeography.\nThe city of Burlington is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain, north of Shelburne Bay. It was built on a strip of land extending about south from the mouth of the Winooski River along the lake shore, and rises from the water's edge to a height of .\nA large ravine in what is now downtown was filled in with refuse and raw sewage in the 19th century to make way for further development.\nNeighborhoods.\nBurlington is characterized by its neighborhoods, which are generally recognized as follows:\nClimate.\nBurlington has a hot-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfa\"), with cold winters and warm to hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperatures range from in January to in July. The annual precipitation of is well-distributed throughout the year, but the summer months are the wettest. The city's location east of Lake Champlain sometimes accounts for localized snow squalls, producing up to in 12 hours on rare occasions. Annual snowfall averages , but this figure can fluctuate greatly from one year to another. Temperature extremes have ranged from on January 15, 1957, and February 12, 1979, to on August 11, 1944. The most recorded snowfall from a single storm is , which fell January 2\u20133, 2010.\nFor the Northeastern United States, a heat wave is defined as having three consecutive days of or more.

A new building was constructed in 1901\u201304 with funds provided by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, making it the first of the four Carnegie libraries in Vermont. It was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Walter R. B. Willcox of Burlington, who won a competition to receive the commission.\nThe building had major settling problems in 1973 where it had been built over a former railroad ravine, which had been improperly filled in, and the library's collection was moved elsewhere.

The city council has twelve seats. As of 2024, the city council is composed of six Democrats, five Progressives, and one independent. Ben Traverse, a Democrat, is the current Council President.\nU.S. senator and two-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders served as the mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989. His election in 1981 unseated longstanding mayor Gordon Paquette and drastically altered the political landscape of the city. Mayor Sanders created a government that was run by young Progressives, including Peter Clavelle, who was elected mayor of the city when Sanders stepped down to run for higher office. Peter Clavelle, Burlington's longest-serving mayor, held the office from 1989 to 1993, and again from 1995 to 2006.\nIn the 1980s, the successive reelections of a self-proclaimed \"socialist\" drew attention from the national media. Sanders has dispelled the notion that his first victory, secured by a narrow margin, was \"just a fluke\".\nThe large transient student population votes in local, state, and national elections, resulting in a considerable impact on local elections. The city signed up 2,527 new voters in the six weeks from September 1, 2008, the highest number for that time frame in over nine years.\nAs a nonprofit institution, the University of Vermont pays no real estate taxes; however, like many other educational institutions, it makes an annual payment in place of taxes. In 2007, the college agreed to raise this from $456,006 to $912,011 in 2010 plus a \"public works\" supplement rising from $180,040 to $191,004 over the same time frame.\nThe city maintains three parks on Lake Champlain. All three are free for public access, with two having parking fees.\nAlice B. Moore's election to the school commission from the second ward as a Republican in 1921 made her the first woman elected to office in Burlington.\nCity council members.\nIn March 2021, Burlington residents voted to implement ranked-choice voting for city councilors. It passed with 64% support. In March 2023, Burlington residents voted to expand ranked-choice voting in city elections, to include races for mayor, city councilors, School Commissioners, Ward Clerks, and Inspectors of Election. This passed with 64% support.\nEducation.\nPublic schools.\nBurlington School District operates the city's public schools.\nSchools:\nMagnet schools.\nIn Burlington, students have two choices of magnet schools: the Integrated Arts Academy at H.O. Wheeler (IAA) and the Sustainability Academy at Lawrence Barnes (SA).\nColleges and universities.\nThe University of Vermont (UVM) and Champlain College are located in Burlington. The UVM Medical Center is home to one of the ten most selective medical schools in the U.S., the Robert Larner College of Medicine. The Community College of Vermont had a site located in Burlington until 2010 when a new building in the adjacent city of Winooski was constructed for the college. Saint Michael's College and a satellite campus of Southern New Hampshire University are in the neighboring town of Colchester. Vermont Technical College also has a satellite campus in nearby Williston.\nMedia.\nNewspapers and other publications.\nBurlington is the media center of northern and central Vermont. It is served by:\nRadio.\nMajor radio stations that are based in Burlington and serve the region:\nTelevision.\nFive network-affiliated television stations serve the greater Burlington area. They include WFFF-TV channel 44 (Fox), its sister station WVNY channel 22 (ABC), WPTZ channel 5 (NBC, with Me-TV on DT3), its sister station WNNE channel 31 (CW), and WCAX-TV channel 3 (CBS). All of the stations (including WVNY and WNNE which share news departments with WFFF-TV and WPTZ, respectively) operate news departments. Although licensed to Burlington, WCAX is based in neighboring South Burlington, while WPTZ is licensed to Plattsburgh, New York (though also locating its main studio to South Burlington in 2019). WFFF and WVNY are also based in Colchester, while WNNE is licensed to Montpelier. Comcast is the metro area's major cable television service provider, although residents within the Burlington city limits are also served by municipally owned Burlington Telecom.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nBus.\nBurlington is the central focus of Green Mountain Transit (GMT), which provides bus service within the city and to and from surrounding municipalities.\nOn June 15, 2011, the Chittenden County Transportation Authority announced that it had changed its charter, effective July 1, 2011, to allow municipalities outside Chittenden County to join CCTA as member communities, thereby allowing CCTA to become Vermont's first regional transit authority. As part of its expansion, the CCTA merged with the Green Mountain Transit Authority (GMTA), which provided bus service in the Barre-Montpelier area and surrounding communities in central Vermont.\nGreyhound provides intercity bus service from the Downtown Transit Center bus station to other communities in Vermont, and to Montreal's Gare d'autocars de Montreal and Boston's South Station and Logan International Airport. Premier Coach's Vermont Translines also provides intercity bus service between Burlington and Albany, New York, along the U.S. Route 7 corridor in a partnership with Greyhound, also from the airport.\nRail.\nBurlington is connected to New York City via Amtrak's \"Ethan Allen Express\", which began serving the city in July 2022. Service is to Union Station, built on the city's waterfront in 1916. The extension to Burlington was first proposed in 2013 by Vermont governor Peter Shumlin. Prior to this, the nearest Amtrak station was located about to the east in Essex Junction, Vermont, which is served by the \"Vermonter\".\nRail service began in Burlington in 1849. From the late nineteenth century to 1953, the Rutland Railroad provided passenger service on the \"Green Mountain Flyer\" and the \"Mount Royal\" from Burlington to Troy, New York, with connecting service to New York City via the New York Central Railroad. The last passenger train to run north via the Burlington Tunnel to Alburgh, a town in the northwest extremity of Vermont, was in June 1938. From 2000 to 2003, the \"Champlain Flyer\" was a commuter service from Burlington south to the town of Charlotte, Vermont.\nAir.\nAir carriers at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (BTV) provide the area with commercial service to major regional hubs and international airports. While scheduled carriers have not traditionally offered scheduled commercial flights to destinations outside the United States, there is a Customs Port of Entry for unscheduled flights. From 2011 to 2018, the only available international commercial flights for BTV were via Porter Airlines' winter seasonal service to and from Billy Bishop Airport in Toronto.\nMajor roads.\nBurlington is served by one major Interstate highway, along with its spur route into the southern part of the city, and is at the junction of two U.S. highways. Several Vermont state highways also provide routes into and through the Burlington area.\nFerry service.\nBurlington is the headquarters of the Lake Champlain Transportation Company, a privately held company that offers ferry service for the North Country of New York state and the Champlain Valley region of Vermont. One line of year-round 24-hour service is provided from the nearby town of Grand Isle, Vermont, to Plattsburgh, New York, with another line of daily service from Charlotte, Vermont, to Essex, New York.\nInternet.\nThe city has municipal fiber broadband, which provides telephone, broadband internet, and television. In 2008, cable management tried to drop Al-Jazeera English from the lineup. This was successfully thwarted by protesters and the station was, in 2009, one of three \"small cable operators\" in the nation to carry this channel.\nElectricity.\nBurlington owns its own power company, Burlington Electric Department. In 2009, the department announced that it would purchase 40% of the output of the 40 MW Sheffield, Vermont, wind-generated electricity when it became available.\nRenewable energy.\nBurlington began operating on 100% renewable energy in 2014 after being a pioneer in the renewable energy sector for decades. The Burlington Electric Department, which began operating in 1903, originally used coal as a primary source of energy. However, after experiencing the effects of fluctuating coal prices throughout the second World War, the department slowly began using wood as an energy source because of the price and overall energy efficiency of wood. Since then, the city has experienced a sustainability boom, and today runs on 100% renewable energy. A succession of mayors in the city, along with corresponding public interest, are credited with this change. Gordon Paquette made the decision to completely transition from coal to wood at the McNeil Generating Station in 1977, and Bernie Sanders picked up this momentum of the environmental movement in the small city. This continued with Peter Clavelle, who mandated recycling in the city, and passed a number of bonds which funded energy improvements in infrastructure. In 1995, the city issued the Legacy Plan, which aimed to \"go beyond the branding and rhetoric and create actual examples that will resonate and make a difference in people's lives.\"\nToday, that plan has come to fruition in many ways. The city operates entirely on energy from the Winooski One Hydro Plant, a series of wind turbines and solar panels, as well as the sustainably sourced wood burning plant at McNeil Generating Station. This made Burlington the first city to run completely on sustainable energy sources: a landmark for green infrastructure. Along with keeping energy rates low for customers, sustainability in the city extends beyond energy infrastructure. A non-profit organization in the city started an incubator farm that produces 30,000 pounds of fresh, local food for those facing food insecurity. The city has also worked on drastic building restoration projects, installed bikeways for more efficient transportation, and prioritized energy saving in the downtown.\nIn September 2019, the former mayor Miro Weinberger announced plans to get the city to net zero status by 2030. This would mean that the city would produce and consume equal amounts of energy. In October 2020, Burlington Electric proposed an ordinance that would require all buildings in the city to switch to electric energy sources. This would put the city closer to that net-zero goal, and continues its legacy as a trailblazer for sustainable infrastructure.\nHealth and social services.\nBurlington is home to University of Vermont Medical Center, a tertiary referral hospital for Vermont and the North Country of New York, Level I Trauma Center, and teaching hospital.\nIn 2010, the government banned smoking within of the city's parks and recreational areas.\nHoward Center, headquartered in Burlington, provides social services to state residents, and runs Vermont's first and the area's only methadone maintenance program, the Chittenden Clinic.\nSignage.\nBurlington City Council unanimously voted on August 8, 2011 a resolution to promote the use of French in municipal public services, in restaurant menus and in second language courses in schools.\nSister cities.\nSister cities.\nBurlington's sister cities are:\nSister lakes.\nBurlington's sister lakes are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67260", "revid": "51024083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67260", "title": "Boris Karloff", "text": "British actor (1887\u20131969)\nWilliam Henry Pratt (23 November 1887 \u2013 2 February 1969), known professionally as Boris Karloff (), was a British actor. His portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in the horror film \"Frankenstein\" (1931), his 82nd film, established him as a horror icon, and he reprised the role for the sequels \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) and \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939). He also appeared as Imhotep in \"The Mummy\" (1932), and voiced the Grinch in, as well as narrating, the animated television special of Dr. Seuss' \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" (1966), which won him a Grammy Award.\nAside from his numerous film roles (174 films), Karloff acted in many live stage plays and appeared on dozens of radio and television programs as well. For his contribution to film and television, Karloff was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Henry Pratt was born on 23 November 1887, at 36 Forest Hill Road, Peckham. His parents were Edward John Pratt of the Indian Civil Service (where he worked for the salt revenue service), and Eliza Sara Millard. Both his parents died when Karloff was young, and he was primarily raised by a half-sister and his elder siblings. His brother, Sir John Thomas Pratt, was a British diplomat. Karloff's father Edward John Pratt was Anglo-Indian, with a British father and Indian mother, meaning that Karloff was at least a quarter Indian, while Karloff's mother also had some Indian ancestry; thus Karloff had a relatively dark complexion that differed from his peers at the time. His mother's maternal aunt was Anna Leonowens, whose tales about life in the royal court of Siam (now Thailand) were the basis of the novel \"Anna and the King of Siam\". Pratt was bow-legged, had a lisp, and stuttered as a young boy. He learned how to manage his stutter, but not his lisp, which was noticeable throughout his career in the film industry.\nPratt spent his childhood years in Enfield, in the County of Middlesex. He was the youngest of nine children, and following his mother's death was brought up by his elder siblings. After first attending Enfield Grammar School, he received a private education at Uppingham School and Merchant Taylors' School. Following this he attended King's College London, where he took studies aimed at a career with the British Government's Consular Service. However, in 1909, he left university without graduating and drifted, departing England for Canada, where he worked as a farm labourer, truck driver and did various odd jobs in Saskatchewan and British Columbia until happening upon stage acting in Prince Albert Saskatchewan, which led to a later film career.\nProfessional career.\nAdoption of stage name.\nPratt began appearing in theatrical performances in Canada in 1911. He was present in Regina, Saskatchewan in June 1912, the day the Regina Cyclone destroyed much of the city. The theatre group he was with gave a benefit performance that night at the Regina Theatre to assist in relief efforts. The next week, appearing in Saskatoon, they donated half of the receipts from their performances to Regina relief.\nDuring this period, he chose \"Boris Karloff\" as his stage name. Karloff always said he chose the first name \"Boris\" simply because it sounded foreign and exotic, and that \"Karloff\" was a family name. Karloff's daughter, Sara, publicly denied any knowledge of Slavic forebears, \"Karloff\" or otherwise. It has been speculated by film historians that he took the stage name from a mad scientist character named \"Boris Karlov\" in the novel \"The Drums of Jeopardy\" by Harold MacGrath, but the novel was not published until 1920, at least eight years after Karloff had been using the name on stage and in films. (Warner Oland played \"Boris Karlov\" in a film version in 1931.) Another possible influence was thought to be a character in the Edgar Rice Burroughs fantasy novel \"The Rider,\" which features a \"Prince Boris of Karlova\", but, because the novel was not published until 1915, the influence may be backward, that Burroughs saw Karloff in a play and adapted the name for the character.\nOne reason for the name change was to prevent embarrassment to the Pratt family. Whether or not his brothers (all dignified members of the British Foreign Service) actually considered young William the \"black sheep of the family\" for having become an actor, Karloff apparently worried they felt that way. He did not reunite with his family until he returned to Britain to make \"The Ghoul\" (1933), extremely worried that his siblings would disapprove of his new, macabre claim to world fame. Instead, his brothers jostled for position around him and happily posed for publicity photographs upon their reunion with him. After the photo was taken, Karloff's brothers immediately started asking about getting a copy of their own. The story of the photo became one of Karloff's favorites.\nCanadian and American stage work.\nKarloff joined the Jeanne Russell Company in 1911 and performed in towns including Kamloops (British Columbia) and Prince Albert (Saskatchewan). After the devastating tornado in Regina on 30 June 1912, Karloff, who was in the midst of an engagement at the Regina Theatre, and other performers helped with clean-up efforts. He later took a job as a railway baggage handler and joined the Harry St. Clair Company that performed in Minot, North Dakota, for a year in an opera house above a hardware store.\nWhile he was trying to establish his acting career, Karloff had to perform years of manual labour in Canada and the United States to make ends meet. Among this work, he spent one year laying track, digging ditches, shoveling coal, clearing land, and working with surveying parties for the B.C. Electric Railway Company, at the rate of $2.50 per day. From this gruelling work with the BCER and other employers, Karloff was left with back problems for the rest of his life. Because of his health, he did not serve in World War I.\nDuring this period, Karloff worked in various theatrical stock companies across the U.S. to hone his acting skills. Some acting companies mentioned were the Harry St. Clair Players and the Billie Bennett Touring Company. By early 1918 he was working with the Maud Amber Players in Vallejo, California, but because of the Spanish flu outbreak in the San Francisco area and the fear of infection, the troupe was disbanded. He was able to find work with the Haggerty Repertory for a while (according to the 1973 obituary of Joseph Paul Haggerty, he and Boris Karloff remained lifelong friends).\nEarly Hollywood career.\nOnce Karloff arrived in Hollywood, he appeared in small roles in dozens of silent films, but the work was sporadic and he often had to take up manual labour such as digging ditches or delivering construction plaster to make ends meet. (According to Karloff, his first film was a Frank Borzage picture at Universal for which he received $5 as an extra; the title of this film has never been traced.)\nHis first certain screen role was in a film serial, \"The Lightning Raider\" (1919) with Pearl White. He was in another serial that same year, \"The Masked Rider\" (1919), the earliest of his film appearances that has survived. Karloff could also be seen in \"His Majesty, the American\" (1919) with Douglas Fairbanks, \"The Prince and Betty\" (1919), \"The Deadlier Sex\" (1920) with Blanche Sweet, and \"The Courage of Marge O'Doone\" (1920). He played an Indian in \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1920) with Wallace Beery and he would often be cast as an Arab or Indian in his early films.\nKarloff's first major role came in a film serial, \"The Hope Diamond Mystery\" (1920). He was Indian in \"Without Benefit of Clergy\" (1921) and an Arab in \"Cheated Hearts\" (1921) and villainous in \"The Cave Girl\" (1921). He was a maharajah in \"The Man from Downing Street\" (1922), a Nabob in \"The Infidel\" (1922) and had roles in \"The Altar Stairs\" (1922), \"Omar the Tentmaker\" (1922) (as an Imam), \"The Woman Conquers\" (1922), \"The Gentleman from America\" (1923), \"The Prisoner\" (1923) and the serial \"Riders of the Plains\" (1923).\nKarloff did a Western, \"The Hellion\" (1923), and a drama, \"Dynamite Dan\" (1924). He could be seen in \"Parisian Nights\" (1925), \"Forbidden Cargo\" (1925), \"The Prairie Wife\" (1925) and the serial \"Perils of the Wild\" (1925). Karloff went back to bit part status in \"Never the Twain Shall Meet\" (1925), directed by Maurice Tourneur, but he had a good support part in \"Lady Robinhood\" (1925) starring Evelyn Brent in the titular role.\nKarloff went on to be in \"The Greater Glory\" (1926), \"Her Honor, the Governor\" (1926), \"The Bells\" (1926) (as a mesmerist), \"The Nickel-Hopper\" (1926) with Mabel Normand, \"The Golden Web\" (1926), \"The Eagle of the Sea\" (1926), \"Flames\" (1926), \"Old Ironsides\" (1926) with Wallace Beery and Esther Ralston, \"Flaming Fury\" (1926), \"Valencia\" (1926), \"The Man in the Saddle\" (1926) with Hoot Gibson, \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\" (1927) (as an African), \"Let It Rain\" (1927), \"The Meddlin' Stranger\" (1927), \"The Princess from Hoboken\" (1927), \"The Phantom Buster\" (1927) with Buddy Roosevelt, and \"Soft Cushions\" (1927).\nKarloff had roles in \"Two Arabian Knights\" (1927), \"The Love Mart\" (1927) with Noah Beery Sr., \"The Vanishing Rider\" (1928) (a serial), \"Burning the Wind\" (1928), \"Vultures of the Sea\" (1928), and \"The Little Wild Girl\" (1928).\nHe was in \"The Devil's Chaplain\" (1929), \"The Fatal Warning\" (1929) for Richard Thorpe, \"The Phantom of the North\" (1929), \"Two Sisters\" (1929), \"Anne Against the World\" (1929), \"Behind That Curtain\" (1929) with Warner Baxter, and \"The King of the Kongo\" (1929), a serial directed by Thorpe.\nWhile one day sitting at the bus stop in the pouring rain, Lon Chaney Sr., 'The Man of a Thousand Faces', spotted Karloff and offered him a ride. Chaney told him \"to find something different that will set you apart and is different from anything someone else has done or is willing to do and do it better\".\nKarloff had an uncredited bit part in \"The Unholy Night\" (1930) directed by Lionel Barrymore, and bigger parts in \"The Bad One\" (1930),\"The Sea Bat\" (1930) starring Charles Bickford and directed by Lionel Barrymore and Wesley Ruggles, and \"The Utah Kid\" (1930) directed by Thorpe.\nA film which brought Karloff recognition was \"The Criminal Code\" (1931), a prison drama directed by Howard Hawks in which he reprised a dramatic part he had played on stage. In the same period, Karloff had a supporting role as a mob boss in Hawks' gangster film \"Scarface\" starring Paul Muni and George Raft, but the film was not released until 1932 because of censorship problems.\nHe did another serial for Thorpe, \"King of the Wild\" (1931), then had support parts in \"Cracked Nuts\" (1931) with Wheeler and Woolsey, \"Young Donovan's Kid\" (1931) with Jackie Cooper, \"Smart Money\" (1931) with Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney in their only film together, \"The Public Defender\" (1931) with Richard Dix, \"I Like Your Nerve\" (1931) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Loretta Young, and \"Graft\" (1931) with Regis Toomey and future agent Sue Carol.\nAnother significant role in the autumn of 1931 saw Karloff play a key supporting part as an unethical newspaper reporter in \"Five Star Final\" with Edward G. Robinson, a film about tabloid journalism which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nHe could also be seen in \"The Yellow Ticket\" (1931) with Elissa Landi, Lionel Barrymore and Laurence Olivier during Olivier's memorable first round in Hollywood, \"The Mad Genius\" (1931) with John Barrymore, \"The Guilty Generation\" (1931) with Robert Young and \"Tonight or Never\" (1931) with Gloria Swanson.\nStardom.\nKarloff acted in eighty-one films before being discovered by James Whale and cast in \"Frankenstein\" (1931). Karloff's role as Frankenstein's monster was physically demanding \u2013 it necessitated a bulky costume with four-inch platform boots \u2013 but the costume and extensive makeup produced an iconic image. The costume was a job in itself for Karloff with the shoes weighing each, which further aggravated his back problems. Universal Studios quickly copyrighted the makeup design for the Frankenstein monster that Jack P. Pierce had created.\nIt took a while for Karloff's stardom to be established with the public \u2013 he had small roles in \"Behind the Mask\" (1932), \"Business and Pleasure\" (1932) and \"The Miracle Man\" (1932). As receipts for \"Frankenstein\" and \"Scarface\" flooded in, Universal gave Karloff third billing in \"Night World\" (1932), with Lew Ayres, Mae Clarke and George Raft.\nKarloff was reunited with Whale at Universal for \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), a horror film based on the novel \"Benighted\" by J. B. Priestley, in which he finally enjoyed top billing above Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart; he was billed simply as \"KARLOFF\", a custom that Universal continued for several years. He was loaned to MGM to play the titular role in \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (also 1932), for which he had top billing.\nBack at Universal, he was cast as Imhotep who is revived to life in \"The Mummy\" (1932), an original story inspired by the unsealing of Tutankhamun's tomb, conceived to continue the success of the \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" adaptations. \"The Mummy\" was as successful at the box-office as his other two films and Karloff was now established as a star of horror films. Like \"Frankenstein\", \"The Mummy\" would spawn a line of sequels, although Karloff would not reprise the iconic 1932 role.\nKarloff returned to England to star in \"The Ghoul\" (1933), then made a non-horror film for John Ford, \"The Lost Patrol\" (1934), for which his performance was highly acclaimed.\nKarloff was third billed in the Twentieth Century Pictures historical film \"The House of Rothschild\" (1934) with George Arliss, which was highly popular.\nHorror had become Karloff's primary genre, and he gave a string of lauded performances in Universal's horror films, including several with Bela Lugosi, his main rival as heir to Lon Chaney's status as the leading horror film star. While the long-standing, creative partnership between Karloff and Lugosi never led to a close friendship, it produced some of the actors' most revered and enduring productions, beginning with \"The Black Cat\" (1934) and continuing with \"Gift of Gab\" (1934), in which both had cameos. Karloff reprised the role of Frankenstein's monster in \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) for James Whale. Then he and Lugosi were reunited for \"The Raven\" (1935). Billed only by his last name during this period, Karloff had top billing above Lugosi in all their films together despite Lugosi having the larger role in \"The Raven\".\nFor Columbia, Karloff made \"The Black Room\" (1935) then he returned to Universal for \"The Invisible Ray\" (1936) with Lugosi, more a science fiction film. Karloff was then cast in a Warner Bros. horror film, \"The Walking Dead\" (1936).\nBecause the Motion Picture Production Code (known as the Hays Code) began to be seriously enforced in 1934, horror films declined in the second half of the 1930s. Karloff worked in other genres, making two films in Britain, \"Juggernaut\" (1936) and \"The Man Who Changed His Mind\" (1936) which was released in the U.S. as \"The Man Who Lived Again\".\nHe returned to Hollywood to play a supporting role in \"Charlie Chan at the Opera\" (1936), then starred in a crime drama, \"Night Key\" (1937). At Warners, he did two films with John Farrow, playing a Chinese warlord in \"West of Shanghai\" (1937) and a murder suspect in \"The Invisible Menace\" (1938).\nKarloff went to Monogram to play the title role of a Chinese detective in \"Mr. Wong, Detective\" (1938), which led to a series. Karloff's portrayal of the character is an example of Hollywood's use of yellowface and its portrayal of East Asians in the earlier half of the 20th century. He had another heroic role in \"Devil's Island\" (1939).\nUniversal found reissuing \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" led to success at the box-office and began to produce horror films again starting with \"Son of Frankenstein\" (1939). Karloff reprised his role, with Lugosi also starring as Ygor and top-billed Basil Rathbone as Dr. Frankenstein. This was Karloff's first Universal film since the original \"Frankenstein\" in which Karloff was not top billed as \"KARLOFF\", a custom that the studio had used for eight films in a row while Karloff was at the height of his career. Basil Rathbone held top billing for \"Son of Frankenstein\", and since Rathbone, Karloff and Lugosi were all billed above the title, billing Basil, Boris and Bela was hard to resist. Karloff was never billed by simply his last name again. Regarding \"Son of Frankenstein\", the film's director Rowland V. Lee said his crew let Lugosi \"work on the characterization; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected\u00a0... when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that he stole the show. Karloff's monster was weak by comparison.\"\nAfter \"The Mystery of Mr. Wong\" (1939) and \"Mr. Wong in Chinatown\" (1939) he signed a three-picture deal with Columbia, starting with \"The Man They Could Not Hang\" (1939). Karloff returned to Universal to make \"Tower of London\" (1939) with Rathbone, playing the murderous henchman of King Richard III.\nKarloff made a fourth Mr Wong film at Monogram \"The Fatal Hour\" (1940). At Warners he was in \"British Intelligence\" (1940), then he went to Universal to do \"Black Friday\" (1940) with Lugosi.\nKarloff's second and third films for Columbia were \"The Man with Nine Lives\" (1940) and \"Before I Hang\" (1940). In between he did a fifth and final Mr Wong film, \"Doomed to Die\" (1940).\nKarloff appeared at a celebrity baseball game as Frankenstein's monster in 1940, hitting a gag home run and making catcher Buster Keaton fall into an acrobatic dead faint as the monster stomped into home plate.\nKarloff finished a six-picture commitment with Monogram with \"The Ape\" (1940). He and Lugosi appeared with Peter Lorre in a comedy at RKO, \"You'll Find Out\" (1941), then he went to Columbia for \"The Devil Commands\" (1941) and \"The Boogie Man Will Get You\" (1941).\nProfessional expansion and further success.\nAn enthusiastic performer, he returned to the Broadway stage in the original production of \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" in 1941, in which he played a homicidal gangster enraged to be frequently mistaken for Karloff. Frank Capra cast Raymond Massey in the 1944 film, which was shot in 1941, while Karloff was still appearing in the role on Broadway. The play's producers allowed the film to be made conditionally: it was not to be released until the production closed. (Karloff reprised his role on television in the anthology series \"The Best of Broadway\" (1955), and with Tony Randall and Tom Bosley in a 1962 production on the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\". He also starred in a radio adaptation produced by Screen Guild Theatre in 1946.)\nIn 1944, he underwent a spinal operation to relieve a chronic arthritic condition.\nKarloff returned to film roles in \"The Climax\" (1944), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of \"Phantom of the Opera\" (1943). More liked was \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944), marking Karloff's \"retirement\" from playing the Monster, where instead, he comes full circle to play the villainous Dr. Niemann, a mad scientist fixated on life-experiments much like Henry Frankenstein, and pass the torch to actor Glenn Strange, who would play the Monster in subsequent films.\nKarloff made three films for producer Val Lewton at RKO: \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945), his last teaming with Lugosi, \"Isle of the Dead\" (1945) and \"Bedlam\" (1946).\nIn a 1946 interview with Louis Berg of the \"Los Angeles Times\", Karloff discussed his arrangement with RKO, working with Lewton and his reasons for leaving Universal. Karloff left Universal because he thought the Frankenstein franchise had run its course; the entries in the series after \"Son of Frankenstein\" were B-pictures. Berg wrote that the last installment in which Karloff appeared\u2014\"House of Frankenstein\"\u2014was what he called a \" 'monster clambake,' with everything thrown in\u2014Frankenstein, Dracula, a hunchback and a 'man-beast' that howled in the night. It was too much. Karloff thought it was ridiculous and said so.\" Berg explained that the actor had \"great love and respect for\" Lewton, who was \"the man who rescued him from the living dead and restored, so to speak, his soul.\"\nHorror films experienced a decline in popularity after the war, and Karloff found himself working in other genres.\nFor the Danny Kaye comedy \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" (1947), Karloff appeared in a brief but starring role as Dr. Hugo Hollingshead, a psychiatrist. Director Norman Z. McLeod shot a sequence with Karloff in the Frankenstein monster make-up, but it was deleted from the finished film.\nKarloff appeared in a film noir, \"Lured\" (1947), and as an Indian in \"Unconquered\" (1947). He had support roles in \"Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome\" (1947), \"Tap Roots\" (1948), and \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff\" (1949).\nDuring this period, Karloff was a frequent guest on radio programmes, whether it was starring in Arch Oboler's Chicago-based \"Lights Out\" productions (including the episode \"Cat Wife\") or spoofing his horror image with Fred Allen or Jack Benny. In 1949, he was the host and star of \"Starring Boris Karloff,\" a radio and television anthology series for the ABC broadcasting network.\nHe appeared as the villainous Captain Hook in \"Peter Pan\" in a 1950 stage musical adaptation which also featured Jean Arthur.\nKarloff returned to horror films with \"The Strange Door\" (1951) and \"The Black Castle\" (1952).\nHe was nominated for a Tony Award for his work opposite Julie Harris in \"The Lark,\" by the French playwright Jean Anouilh, about Joan of Arc, which he reprised years later on TV's \"Hallmark Hall of Fame.\"\nDuring the 1950s, he appeared on British television in the series \"Colonel March of Scotland Yard,\" in which he portrayed John Dickson Carr's fictional detective Colonel March, who was known for solving apparently impossible crimes. Christopher Lee appeared alongside Karloff in the episode \"At Night, All Cats are Grey\" broadcast in 1955. A little later, Karloff co-starred with Lee in the film \"Corridors of Blood\" (1958).\nKarloff appeared in \"Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1952) and visited Italy for \"The Island Monster\" (1954) and then returned to Hollywood to appear in \"Sabaka\" (1954).\nKarloff, along with H. V. Kaltenborn, was a regular panelist on the NBC game show, \"Who Said That?\" which aired between 1948 and 1955. Later, as a guest on NBC's \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\", Karloff sang \"Those Were the Good Old Days\" from \"Damn Yankees\" while Gisele MacKenzie performed the solo, \"Give Me the Simple Life\". On \"The Red Skelton Show,\" Karloff guest starred along with actor Vincent Price in a parody of Frankenstein, with Red Skelton as \"Klem Kadiddle Monster\". He served as host and one of the stars of the anthology series \"The Veil\" (1958), a 12-episode Hal Roach TV series which was never broadcast at all due to financial problems at the producing studio; the complete series was later rediscovered in the 1990s and eventually released on DVD.\nKarloff made some horror films in the late 1950s: \"Voodoo Island\" (1957), \"The Haunted Strangler\" (1958), \"Frankenstein 1970\" (1958) (this time as the Baron), and \"Corridors of Blood\" (1958). Karloff donned the Frankenstein Monster make-up for the last time in 1962 for a Halloween episode of the TV series \"Route 66\", which also featured Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr.\nDuring this period, he hosted and acted in a number of television series, including \"Thriller\" and Britain's \"Out of This World\".\nSpoken word recordings and horror anthologies.\nHe recorded the title role of Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline\" for the Shakespeare Recording Society (Caedmon Audio 1962). He also recorded the narration for Sergei Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" with the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under Mario Rossi.\nRecords he made for the children's market included \"Three Little Pigs and Other Fairy Stories\", \"Tales of the Frightened\" (volume 1 and 2), Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So Stories\" and, with Cyril Ritchard and Celeste Holm, \"Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes\", and Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark\".\nKarloff was credited for editing several horror anthologies, commencing with \"Tales of Terror\" (Cleveland and NY: World Publishing Co, 1943) (compiled with the help of Edmond Speare). This wartime-published anthology went through at least five printings to September 1945. It has been reprinted recently (Orange NJ: Idea Men, 2007). Karloff's name was also attached to \"And the Darkness Falls\" (Cleveland and NY: World Publishing Co, 1946); and \"The Boris Karloff Horror Anthology\" (London: Souvenir Press, 1965; simultaneous publication in Canada - Toronto: The Ryerson Press; US pbk reprint NY: Avon Books, 1965 retitled as \"Boris Karloff's Favourite Horror Stories\"; UK pbk reprints London: Corgi, 1969 and London: Everest, 1975, both under the original title), though it is less clear whether Karloff himself actually edited these.\n\"Tales of the Frightened\" (Belmont Books, 1963), though based on the recordings by Karloff of the same title, and featuring his image on the book cover, contained stories written by Michael Avallone; the second volume, \"More Tales of the Frightened\", contained stories authored by Robert Lory. Both Avallone and Lory worked closely with Canadian editor and book packager Lyle Kenyon Engel, who also ghost-edited a horror story anthology for horror film star Basil Rathbone.\nFinal roles and work.\nKarloff went to Italy to appear in \"Black Sabbath\" (1963) directed by Mario Bava. He made \"The Raven\" (1963) for Roger Corman and American International Pictures (AIP). When \"The Raven\" had successfully wrapped shooting with time left in Karloff's contract, Corman conscribed a new story with the same sets to feature Karloff in \"The Terror\" (1963), with Jack Nicholson in the leading role and Karloff playing a baron who murdered his wife. He made a cameo in AIP's \"Bikini Beach\" (1964) and had a bigger role in that studio's \"The Comedy of Terrors\" (1964), directed by Jacques Tourneur, and travelled to England to make \"Die, Monster, Die!\" (1965) co-starring Nick Adams. British actress Suzan Farmer, who played his daughter in the film, later recalled Karloff was aloof during production \"and wasn't the charming personality people perceived him to be\", probably because he was in such intense pain in the 1960s.\nIn 1966, Karloff also appeared with Robert Vaughn and Stefanie Powers in the spy series \"The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.\", in the episode \"The Mother Muffin Affair\", Karloff performing in drag as the titular character. That same year, he also played an Indian Maharajah on the installment of the adventure series \"The Wild Wild West\" titled \"The Night of the Golden Cobra\". Karloff's last film for AIP was \"The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini\" (1966).\nIn 1967, he played an eccentric Spanish professor who believes himself to be Don Quixote in a whimsical episode of \"I Spy\" titled \"Mainly on the Plains\", which he filmed in Spain. \"Cauldron of Blood\", shot in Spain around the same time, and co-starring Viveca Lindfors, was only released in 1970 after Karloff's death.\nIn the mid-1960s, he enjoyed a late-career surge in the United States when he narrated the made-for-television animated film of Dr. Seuss' \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\", and also provided the voice of the Grinch, although the song \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" was sung by the American voice actor Thurl Ravenscroft. The film was first broadcast on CBS-TV in 1966. Karloff later received a Grammy Award for \"Best Recording For Children\" after the recording was commercially released. Because Ravenscroft (who never met Karloff in the course of their work on the show) was uncredited for his contribution to \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\", his performance of the song was at times misattributed to Karloff.\nHe appeared in \"Mad Monster Party?\" (1967) and went to England to star in the second feature film of the British director Michael Reeves, \"The Sorcerers\" (1967).\nKarloff starred in \"Targets\" (1968), the first feature film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, featuring two separate plotlines that converge into one. In one, a disturbed young man kills his family, then embarks on a killing spree. In the other, a famous horror-film actor confirms his retirement, agreeing to one last appearance at a drive-in cinema. Karloff starred as the retired horror film actor, Byron Orlok, a thinly disguised version of himself; Orlok (named both for Karloff himself and Count Orlok) was facing an end-of-life crisis, which he resolves through a confrontation with the crazed gunman at the drive-in cinema.\nAround the same time, he played the occult expert Professor Marsh in a British production titled \"The Crimson Cult\" (\"Curse of the Crimson Altar\", also 1968), which was the last Karloff film to be released during his lifetime.\nHe ended his career by appearing in four low-budget Mexican horror films: \"Isle of the Snake People\", \"The Incredible Invasion\", \"Fear Chamber\" and \"House of Evil\". This was a package deal with Mexican producer Luis Enrique Vergara. Karloff's scenes for all four films were directed by Jack Hill and shot back-to-back within one month in Los Angeles in the spring of 1968. The films were later completed in Mexico and theatrically released in the early 1970s. Karloff was originally slated to travel to Mexico to shoot the films, but he had emphysema and crippling arthritis. Only half of one lung was still functioning and he required oxygen between takes, so Hill arranged for Karloff to film his scenes in California.\nDue to the unexpected sudden death of the producer Vergara, all four Mexican films were embroiled for a while in legal actions and were only released posthumously in 1971, with the last, \"The Incredible Invasion\", not released until 1972, more than two years after Karloff's death.\nDeath.\nUpon returning to Britain to live in 1959, his address was 43 Cadogan Square, London. In 1966, he bought 25 Campden House (at 29 Sheffield Terrace), Kensington W8, and Roundabout Cottage in the Hampshire village of Bramshott. A longtime heavy smoker, he had emphysema, which left him with only half of one lung still functioning. He contracted bronchitis in late 1968 and was hospitalised at University College Hospital. He died of pneumonia at King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, in Sussex, on 2 February 1969, at the age of 81.\nHis body was cremated following a requested modest service at Guildford Crematorium, Godalming, Surrey, where he is commemorated by a plaque in the Garden of Remembrance. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden (\"the Actors' Church\"), London, where there is also a plaque.\nPersonal life.\nKarloff married six times. His wives included stage actress Grace Harding (married from 1910 to 1913), actress Olive de Wilton (from 1916 to 1919), musician Montana Laurena Williams (from 1920 to 1922) and actress Helen Vivian Soule (from 1924 to 1928).\nHis fifth marriage to Dorothy Stine lasted from 1930 until 1946. This union resulted in Karloff's only child, daughter Sara Karloff, born on November 23, 1938 (Karloff's own 51st birthday).\nHis sixth and final marriage, to Evelyn Hope Helmore, was in April 1946, immediately after his fifth divorce. They were happily married 23 years at the time of his death.\nIn 1958, Karloff's niece Diana Bromley was charged with murdering her 10-year-old and 13-year-old sons in Haslemere, England but was found insane and unfit to plead. She was the daughter of Karloff's brother Sir John Thomas Pratt.\nBeginning in 1940, Karloff dressed as Father Christmas every Christmas to hand out presents to physically disabled children in a Baltimore hospital.\nHe never legally changed his name to \"Boris Karloff\". He signed official documents \"William H. Pratt, a.k.a. Boris Karloff\".\nHe was a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild, and he was especially outspoken due to the long hours he spent in makeup while playing Frankenstein's Monster and the Mummy. He was an early member of the Hollywood Cricket Club.\nLegacy.\nDuring the run of \"Thriller,\" Karloff lent his name and likeness to a comic book for Gold Key Comics based upon the series. After \"Thriller\" was cancelled, the comic was retitled \"Boris Karloff's Tales of Mystery\". An illustrated likeness of Karloff continued to introduce each issue of this publication for more than a decade after his death (he was not involved however in writing or drawing the stories); the comic book lasted until the early 1980s. (A Gold Key comic book series based upon \"The Twilight Zone\" that ran concurrently with Karloff's did the same thing with host Rod Serling's likeness after his death.) In 2009, Dark Horse Comics began publishing reprints of \"Boris Karloff's Tales of Mystery\" in a hardcover edition.\nFor his contribution to film and television, Karloff was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1737 Vine Street for motion pictures, and 6664 Hollywood Boulevard for television. He was featured by the U.S. Postal Service as Frankenstein's Monster and the Mummy in its series \"Classic Monster Movie Stamps\" issued in September 1997. In 1998, an English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled in his hometown in London. The British film magazine \"Empire\" in 2016 ranked Karloff's portrayal as Frankenstein's monster the sixth-greatest horror movie character of all time.\nA street called Karloff Way, near Rochester, England, is named in his honour.\nRadio appearances (1932\u20131968).\nAppearances on \"Lights Out!\".\nKarloff acted in 7 episodes of the \"Lights Out!\" NBC anthology radio series from 1938 to 1947:\nAppearances on \"Inner Sanctum\".\nKarloff acted in 22 episodes of the \"Inner Sanctum\" ABC anthology radio series from 1941 to 1952:\nAppearances on \"Creeps By Night\".\nKarloff acted in ten episodes on this 1944 radio anthology series\nAppearances on \"Starring Boris Karloff\".\nKarloff acted in 13 episodes of the \"Starring Boris Karloff\" anthology TV/ radio series in 1949: this show was broadcast as both a TV show and a radio show simultaneously\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
