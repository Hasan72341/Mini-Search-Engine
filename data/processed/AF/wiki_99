{"id": "73828", "revid": "1318410354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73828", "title": "Basil I", "text": "Byzantine emperor from 867 to 886\nBasil I, nicknamed \"the Macedonian\" (; 811 \u2013 29 August 886), was Byzantine emperor from 867 to 886. Born to a peasant family in Macedonia, he rose to prominence in the imperial court after gaining the favour of Emperor Michael III, whose mistress he married on his emperor's orders. In 866, Michael proclaimed him co-emperor. Fearing a loss of influence, Basil orchestrated Michael's assassination the next year and installed himself as sole ruler of the empire. He was the first ruler of the Macedonian dynasty.\nDespite his humble origins, Basil was an effective and respected monarch. He initiated a complete overhaul of Byzantine law, an effort continued by his successor that ultimately became the \"Basilika\". On the foreign front, he achieved military success against the heretical Paulicians, whom he subjugated in 872. He also pursued an active policy in the west, allying with Carolingian emperor Louis II against the Arabs, which led to a new period of Byzantine domination in Italy. Upon his death in a hunting accident in 886, he was succeeded by his son Leo VI, also rumoured to have been the son of Michael III.\nFrom peasant to emperor.\nBasil was born to peasant parents in late 811 (or sometime in the 830s in the estimation of some scholars) at Chariopolis in the Byzantine theme of Macedonia (an administrative division corresponding to the area of Adrianople in Thrace). The theory that Basil may have been born in the 830's might better explain that the young Emperor Michael III later chose him as his favorite. His father was named Bardas/Constantine, his mother Pankalo, and his paternal grandfather Maiktes/Leo. His paternal grandmother's father was named Leo/Maiktes. His ethnic origin is unknown and has been a subject of debate.\nDuring Basil's reign, an elaborate genealogy was produced that purported that his ancestors were not mere peasants, as everyone believed, but descendants of the Arsacid (Arshakuni) kings of Armenia, Alexander the Great and also of Constantine the Great. The Armenian historians Samuel of Ani and Stephen of Taron record that he hailed from the village of Thil in Taron. In contrast, Persian writers such as Hamza al-Isfahani, or al-Tabari, call both Basil and his mother \"Saqlabi\", an ethnogeographic term that usually denoted the Slavs, but can also be interpreted as a generic term encompassing the inhabitants of the region between Constantinople and Bulgaria. Claims have therefore been made for an Armenian, Slavic, or indeed \"Armeno-Slavonic\" origin for Basil's father. The name of his mother points to a Greek origin on the maternal side. The general scholarly consensus is that Basil's father was \"probably\" of Armenian origin, and settled in Byzantine Thrace. His close associates and friends were mostly Armenians and, besides Greek, he might have spoken Armenian as well. Norman Tobias, the author of the only dedicated biography of Basil I in English, concluded that it is impossible to be certain what the ethnic origins of the emperor were, though Basil was definitely reliant on the support of Armenians in prominent positions within the Byzantine Empire.\nOne story asserts that he had spent a part of his childhood in captivity in Bulgaria, where his family had, allegedly, been carried off as captives of the Khan Krum (r. 803\u2013814) in 813. Basil lived there until 836, when he and several others escaped to Byzantine-held territory in Thrace. Basil was ultimately lucky enough to enter the service of Theophilitzes, a relative of the Caesar Bardas (the uncle of Emperor Michael III), as a groom. While serving Theophilitzes, he visited the city of Patras, where he gained the favour of Danielis, a wealthy woman who took him into her household and endowed him with a fortune. He also earned the notice of Michael III by his abilities as a horse tamer and in winning a victory over a Bulgarian champion in a wrestling match; he soon became the Byzantine Emperor's companion, confidant, and bodyguard (\"parakoimomenos\"). Symeon Magister describes Basil as \"... most outstanding in bodily form and heavy set; his eyebrows grew together, he had large eyes and a broad chest, and a rather downcast expression\".\nOn Emperor Michael's orders, Basil divorced his wife Maria and married Eudokia Ingerina, Michael's favourite mistress, in around 865. Around the same time, Michael III offered him his sister Thekla as a mistress. Basil had an affair with her until 870, when he discovered that she was being unfaithful to him and, for this reason, he sent her back to the convent she had been immured in previously. During an expedition against the Arabs, Basil convinced Michael III that his uncle Bardas coveted the Byzantine throne, and subsequently murdered Bardas with Michael's approval on 21 April 866. Basil then became the leading personality at court and was invested in the now vacant dignity of \"kaisar\" (Caesar), before being crowned co-emperor on 26 May 866. This promotion may have included Basil's adoption by Michael III, himself a much younger man. It was commonly believed that Leo VI, Basil's successor and reputed son, was really the son of Michael. Although Basil seems to have shared this belief (and hated Leo), the subsequent promotion of Basil to caesar and then co-emperor provided the child with a legitimate and Imperial parent and secured his succession to the Byzantine throne. When Leo was born, Michael III celebrated the event with public chariot races, whilst he pointedly instructed Basil not to presume on his new position as junior emperor.\nWhen Michael III started to favour another courtier, Basiliskianos, Basil felt that his position was being undermined. Michael threatened to invest Basiliskianos with the Imperial title and this induced Basil to pre-empt events by organizing the assassination of Michael on the night of 24 September 867. Michael and Basiliskianos were insensibly drunk following a banquet at the palace of Anthimos when Basil, with a small group of companions (including his father Bardas, brother Marinos, and cousin Ayleon), gained entry. The locks to the chamber doors had been tampered with and the chamberlain had not posted guards; both victims were then put to the sword. On Michael III's death, Basil, as an already acclaimed co-emperor, automatically became the ruling \"basileus\".\nReign.\nBasil I became an effective and respected monarch despite being a man with no formal education and little military or administrative experience. Moreover, he had been the boon companion of a debauched monarch and had achieved power through a series of calculated murders. That there was little political reaction to the murder of Michael III is probably due to his unpopularity with the bureaucrats of Constantinople because of his disinterest in the administrative duties of the Imperial office. Also, Michael's public displays of impiety had alienated the Byzantine populace in general. Once in power Basil soon showed that he intended to rule effectively and as early as his coronation he displayed an overt religiosity by formally dedicating his crown to Christ. He maintained a reputation for conventional piety and orthodoxy throughout his 19-year-long reign.\nDomestic policies.\nBecause of the great legislative work which Basil I undertook, he is often called the \"second Justinian\". Basil's laws were collected in the \"Basilika\", consisting of sixty books, and smaller legal manuals known as the \"Eisagoge\". Leo VI was responsible for completing these legal works. The \"Basilika\" remained the law of the Byzantine Empire down to its conquest by the Ottomans. Ironically, this codification of laws seems to have begun under the direction of the \"caesar\" Bardas who was murdered by Basil. Basil personally oversaw the construction of the \"Nea Ekklesia\" cathedral and his palatine hall the Kainourgion. His ecclesiastical policy was marked by good relations with Rome. One of his first acts was to exile the Patriarch of Constantinople, Photios, and restore his rival Ignatios, whose claims were supported by Pope Adrian II.\nForeign affairs.\nEmperor Basil's reign was marked by the troublesome ongoing war with the heretical Paulicians, centered on Tephrike on the upper Euphrates, who rebelled, allied with the Arabs, and raided as far as Nicaea, sacking Ephesus. Basil's general, Christopher, defeated the Paulicians in 872, and the death of their leader, Chrysocheir, led to the definite subjection of their state. Basil was the first Byzantine emperor since Constans II (r. 641\u2013668) to pursue an active policy to restore the Empire's power in the West. Basil allied with Holy Roman Emperor Louis II (r. 850\u2013875) against the Arabs and sent a fleet of 139 ships to clear the Adriatic Sea of their raids. With Byzantine help, Louis II captured Bari from the Arabs in 871. The city eventually became Byzantine territory in 876. However, the Byzantine position in Sicily deteriorated, and Syracuse fell to the Emirate of Sicily in 878. This was ultimately Basil's fault as he had diverted a relief fleet from Sicily to haul marble for a church instead. Although most of Sicily was lost, the general Nikephoros Phokas (the Elder) succeeded in taking Taranto and much of Calabria in 880. The successes in the Italian peninsula opened a new period of Byzantine domination there. Above all, the Byzantines were beginning to establish a strong presence in the Mediterranean Sea, and especially the Adriatic.\nLast years and succession.\nBasil's spirits declined in 879, when his eldest and favourite son, Constantine, died. Basil now raised his youngest son, Alexander, to the rank of co-emperor. Basil disliked the bookish Leo, on occasion physically beating him; he probably suspected Leo of being the son of Michael III. In his later years, Basil's relationship with Leo was clouded by the suspicion that the latter might wish to avenge the murder of Michael III. Leo was eventually imprisoned by Basil after Theodore Santabarenos informed him of a plot against him, but the imprisonment resulted in public rioting; Basil threatened to blind Leo but was dissuaded by Patriarch Photios. Leo was eventually released after the passage of three years. Basil died on 29 August 886, from a fever contracted after a serious hunting accident when his belt was caught in the antlers of a deer, and he was allegedly dragged through the woods. He was saved by an attendant who cut him loose with a knife, but he suspected the attendant of trying to assassinate him and had the man executed shortly before he himself died. One of the first acts of Leo VI as ruling emperor was to rebury, with great ceremony, the remains of Michael III in the Imperial Mausoleum within the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. This did much to confirm in public opinion the view that Leo considered himself to have been Michael's son.\nFamily.\nSome modern controversy and historical ambiguity surrounds Basil I's personal life, especially given a lack of contemporaneous sources. One question that has emerged in modern scholarship is whether or not Basil was involved in same-sex relationships and if such relationships played a role in his unlikely rise to power. Historian Shaun Fitzroy Tougher cites a history written by George the Monk that uses the Greek word \"pothos\" to describe Basil's relationship with Michael, a word which had historically been used in some Greek Christian sources to describe the desire between a wife and a husband. However, within the law code, the \"Basilika\", inaugurated by Basil I, the illegal nature of male homosexuality and its, largely theoretical, capital punishment were retained in full.\nAspects of the family relationships of Basil I are likewise uncertain and open to a variety of interpretations.\nTherefore, the information given below should not be treated as comprehensive or definite:\nLeo VI's son Constantine VII wrote a biography of his grandfather, the \"Vita Basilii\", around 950.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\nRecent years have seen the first translations into English of a number of primary sources about Basil I and his times.\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Produced by United Productions of America (UPA), it was given a wide release by Columbia Pictures on November 4, 1950. The story was adapted by Phil Eastman and Bill Scott from a story by Dr. Seuss. Robert Cannon directed the short film, with John Hubley (also a producer) as the supervising director; Stephen Bosustow served as an executive producer. Marvin Miller was the narrator.\n\"Gerald McBoing-Boing\" won the 1950 Oscar for Best Animated Short. In 1994, it was voted #9 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, making it the highest ranked UPA cartoon on the list. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nOriginal recording and UPA film.\nDr. Seuss's story had originally appeared on a children's record, scored by Billy May, issued by Capitol Records, and read by radio veteran Harold Peary as \"The Great Gildersleeve\".\nThis film was the first successful theatrical cartoon produced by UPA after their initial experiments with a short series of cartoons featuring Columbia Pictures stalwarts the Fox and the Crow. It was an artistic attempt to break away from the strict realism in animation that had been developed and perfected by Walt Disney. Cartoons did not have to obey the rules of the real world (as the short films of Tex Avery and their cartoon physics proved), and so UPA experimented with a non-realistic style that depicted caricatures rather than lifelike representations.\nThis was a major step in the development of limited animation, which had the added advantage of being much less expensive to produce.\nThe story describes Gerald McCloy, a two-year-old boy who begins \"talking\" in the form of sound effects, his first word being the titular \"boing boing\". Panicked, his father calls the doctor, who informs him that there is nothing he can do about it. As the boy grows up, he picks up more sounds and is able to make communicative gestures, but is still unable to utter a single word of the English language. In spite of this, he is admitted to a general public school, but more problems arise when he is chided by his peers and given the derogatory name \"Gerald McBoing-Boing\". After startling (and enraging) his father, he has no choice but to run away and hop a train to an unknown location. Just before he catches the train, however, a talent scout from the NBC Radio Network (as identified by the NBC chimes) discovers Gerald and hires him as NBC's foley artist, performing shows for a division of the company labeled \"XYZ\" on the microphones, and Gerald becomes very famous.\nSequels.\nUPA produced three follow-up shorts: \"Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony\" (1953), \"How Now Boing Boing\" (1954), and \"Gerald McBoing! Boing! on Planet Moo\" (1956), an Academy Award nominee. The second and third films maintained the Dr. Seuss-style rhyming narration, but were not based on his work. The final film abandoned this approach.\nAll four \"Gerald McBoing Boing\" shorts were released in 1980 on home video under the title \"Columbia Pictures Presents Cartoon Adventures Starring Gerald McBoing Boing\". The shorts were presented in sub-par quality, especially \"Planet Moo\", which was squeezed to fit the CinemaScope frame to standard TV screen size. It was reissued in 1985 as part of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video's \"Magic Window\" series of children's videotapes and went out of print in 1995.\nThe second short was included as a special feature on Sony's 2001 DVD release of \"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.\". All but the second were included in the special features of the two-disc special edition of the DVD \"Hellboy\" (released on July 27, 2004), as the cartoon can be seen playing on TV monitors in the background in several scenes. In January 2006, Sony re-issued the four shorts on DVD, featuring cleaned-up prints and all presented in their original aspect ratio.\nTelevision.\nUPA.\nThe Gerald McBoing-Boing Show (1956\u201357)\nIn 1956, CBS created a half-hour \"Gerald McBoing-Boing Show\", with well-known radio announcer Bill Goodwin narrating. Broadcast at 5:30\u00a0p.m. on Sunday evenings, it was a showcase for UPA's cartoons, including \"Dusty of the Circus\", \"The Twirlinger Twins\", and \"Punch and Judy\". The program proved too expensive to continue and lasted only three months.\nThe episodes were repeated on Friday nights in the summer of 1957. Thus, \"The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show\" apparently became the first cartoon series broadcast regularly during prime time, preceding \"The Flintstones\" by two seasons.\nTV specials\nA character similar to Gerald McBoing-Boing appeared as Tiny Tim in the 1962 TV special \"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\", now as a speaking character. A bonus feature of the 2001 \"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\" DVD features Gerald McBoing-Boing being babysat by the nearsighted Magoo, also a UPA character. The short is titled \"Magoo Meets McBoing-Boing\".\n\"Gerald McBoing-Boing\" (2005\u20132007).\nA series based on the original cartoon started airing on Cartoon Network (United States) on August 22, 2005, as part of their short-lived \"Tickle-U\" programming block, and aired on Teletoon/T\u00e9l\u00e9toon (Canada) on August 29 the same year. It uses the same basic art style as the original except more detailed: each 11-minute episode features a series of vignettes with Gerald, of which the \"fantasy tales\" are done in Seussian rhyme. Sound checks, gags, and \"real-life\" portions of the show are also included. It was also broadcast on ABC in Australia.\nGerald still only makes sounds (but is praised for it instead), but now has two speaking friends, Janine and Jacob, as well as a dog named Burp, who only burps. Gerald's parents (names unknown) complete the regular cast, although his mother has black hair in this series instead of blonde. The series was produced in Canada by Cookie Jar Entertainment, and directed by Robin Budd and story edited/written by John Derevlany. The animation was done by Mercury Filmworks in Ottawa.\nIn print.\nA children's picture book illustrated by Mel Crawford was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1952 and as of 2024 was still in print in multiple formats.\nCrawford also illustrated a comic book adaptation of the story for the first issue of the Dell Comics series \"Gerald McBoing-Boing and the Nearsighted Mr. Magoo\", also in 1952. Further adventures of the character were portrayed in four more issues of the series published through 1953.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the nephew of Justinian I and the husband of Sophia, the niece of Justinian's wife Theodora.\nJustin II inherited a greatly enlarged but overextended empire, with far fewer resources at his disposal compared to Justinian I. He ended the payment of tributes and adopted a hardline stance against the empire's neighbors, which resulted in rekindling of war with the Sassanid Empire, and in a Lombard invasion which cost the Romans much of their territory in Italy. His later reign was marked by severe mental illness.\nFamily.\nHe was a son of Vigilantia and Dulcidio (sometimes rendered as Dulcissimus), respectively the sister and brother-in-law of Justinian. His siblings included Marcellus and Praejecta. With Sophia he had a daughter Arabia and possibly a son, Justus, who died young. He also had a niece named Helena.\nEarly life.\nJustin's early years are largely obscure. A thirteenth-century chronicle suggests 511 as Justin's birth date, but its reliability is not known with certainty. Historian Ernst Stein assumes he was born by 520 at the latest, as his contemporary Corippus compliments his \"excellent\" age at his accession in 565. At some point, he married Sophia, possibly in the 540s.\nDuring Justinian's reign, he served in the position of \"curopalates\" at the court. He is first attested in the contemporary sources from 552 and 553 as being part of the embassy to Pope Vigilius during the Three-Chapter Controversy. \nIn 559, he was sent by Justinian to escort the Kutrigur raiders retreating across the Danube. In 562 and 563, he was in charge of dissipating the urban riots caused by the Blues and Greens in Constantinople. \nOver time, he built a network of supporters in the court. In the early 560s, his wife Sophia and his supporters were said to have pleaded with Justinian to name him \"caesar\", albeit unsuccessfully. Historian Sihong Lin writes that early on, Justin was seen as an \"energetic, even well-liked individual.\"\nReign.\nAccession.\nJustinian I died childless on 14 November 565. Callinicus, the \"praepositus sacri cubiculi\", seems to have been the only witness to his dying moments, and claimed that Justinian had designated Justin, his nephew, as his heir in a deathbed decision. This sidelined another relative and candidate for the throne, also named Justin, who was son of Germanus, cousin of Justinian. Modern historians suspect Callinicus may have fabricated the last words of Justinian to secure the succession for his political ally. As historian Robert Browning observed: \"Did Justinian really bring himself in the end to make a choice, or did Callinicus make it for him? Only Callinicus knew.\"\nIn any case, Callinicus started alerting those most interested in the succession, originally various members of the Senate. Then they jointly informed Justin and Sophia, offering the throne. Justin accepted after the traditional token show of reluctance, and with his wife Sophia, he was escorted to the Great Palace of Constantinople. The Excubitors blocked the palace entrances during the night, and early in the morning, John Scholasticus, Patriarch of Constantinople, crowned the new \"Augustus\". Only then was the death of Justinian and the succession of Justin publicly announced in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. Justin's coronation was written in detail by Corippus in his panegyric \"In laudem lustini Augusti minoris (In praise of Justin the Younger)\".\nBoth the Patriarch and Tiberius, commander of the Excubitors, had been recently appointed, with Justin having played a part in their respective appointments, in his role as Justinian's \"curopalates\". It is thus seen that they were willing to elevate their patron and ally to the throne.\nJustin's first address to the senate contained criticisms of Justinian: \"Let the world rejoice that whatever was not done or put into practice because of our father's old age has been corrected in the time of Justin.\" In the speech, he vowed to repay debts, restore the emptied treasury and promised not to confiscate senatorial properties.\nEarly reign.\nIn the early days of his reign, Justin took a sharp about-turn from his uncle's policies. He repaid the treasury's debts and took a more reconciliatory stance toward the senatorial class. On 1 January 566, he became a consul, thereby reviving a post Justinian had discontinued since 541. Justin and Sophia initially promised to make peace with Justin's cousin and rival to the throne, Justin (son of Germanus), but had him assassinated in Alexandria not long after. According to a hostile source, the imperial couple kicked his severed head.\nIn 566 he reversed Justinian's ban on divorce by mutual consent, declaring that it resulted in spouses hating each other. Under the pretext of not understanding the fragile human nature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mankind has nothing more admirable than marriage: from it stem children and successive generations, the peopling of villages and cities, and society's best bond. Hence, it is our prayer that marriage should be so successful for those contracting it as never to be the work of an unlucky daemon, and that married couples should not split up without just cause for their marriage to be dissolved. But as it is difficult for this to be maintained for all mankind \u2013 in such a large population, it is outside the realms of possibility that some unreasonable enmities should not supervene \u2013 we have thought it appropriate to devise some remedy for this, in particular where the consequences of pettiness have escalated so far as to engender real, irreconcilable hatred between the partners.\nAdministration and financial policy.\nAfter Justin paid off the debts, he burned the bonds of the treasury. He additionally remitted his subjects' tax arrears back to 560. The contemporary John of Ephesus notes a rumour that his successor Tiberius II discovered piles of money Justin and Sophia gathered, possibly meaning that his reign generated a surplus.\nHe conceded greater control to the provincial elites. In 569, he allowed them to nominate their own governors, and if the nominees pleased the court, eliminated their appointment fees, resulting in decreased imperial oversight of the provinces.\nForeign policy.\nHe discontinued Justinian's practice of buying off potential enemies. Immediately after his accession, Justin halted the payment of subsidies to the Avars, ending a truce that had existed since 558. This move upset the delicate balance of power in the Pannonian Basin, since the Avar elites were forced to seek new sources of wealth to maintain their position and client networks. At first, this was agreeable for the Romans, since the Avars decided to raid the Franks instead of going into the Roman territory. But after the Avars and the neighbouring tribe of the Lombards had combined to destroy the Gepids, from whom Justin had obtained the Danube fortress of Sirmium and the Gepid treasury, Avar pressure caused the Lombards to migrate West, and in 568 they invaded Italy under their king Alboin. They quickly overran the Po Valley, and within a few years acquired a vast share of the Italian peninsula. The Avars themselves crossed the Danube in 573 or 574, when the Empire's attention was distracted by troubles on the Persian frontier. They were only placated by the payment of a subsidy of 80,000 solidi by Justin's successor Tiberius.\nThe North and East frontiers were the main focus of Justin's attention. Justin began to cement an alliance with the Turks, the new Central Asian power that threatened both the Avars and Persia from the mid 6th century. In line with his policies against subsidies, he rejected Arab demands of payments. In 572 his refusal to pay tribute to the Persians in combination with overtures to the Turks led to a war with the Sassanid Empire. After two disastrous campaigns, in which the Persians under Khosrow I overran Syria and captured the strategically important fortress of Dara, Justin became inflicted with a severe mental illness. During his incapacitation, his wife Sophia reversed his tributary policy by attaining a one-year truce from Persia with a payment of 45,000 gold coins. This was followed by a three-year truce when Tiberius reached an agreement to pay 30,000 coins annually. Further negotiations had the Romans recognizing Persian dominance of Eastern Armenia and Iberia, though the wars continued in Armenia.\nShortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Ist\u00e4mi, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Ist\u00e4mi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned to death. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Ist\u00e4mi to send an embassy directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Justin, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.\nHis foreign policy has received unfavorable modern assessments. In 1937, historian Previte-Orton criticized Justin as lacking realism, having overestimated Roman strength against foreign enemies.\nSuccession and death.\nAfter 572, Justin was reported to have fits of insanity. John of Ephesus, whose Monophysite sect suffered persecutions under Justin, offered a vivid description of Justin's madness, in which he behaved like a wild animal, was wheeled about on a mobile throne and required organ music to be played day and night.\nDespite moments of clarity, Justin was no longer able to govern. Eastern Roman sources report that Tiberius, the commander of the Excubitors, directed the government from this point, alongside Sophia. In 574, about a year after his incapacitation, Justin elevated Tiberius as \"caesar\" at Sophia's suggestion and adopted him as his son. On 7 December, according to Theophylact Simocatta, Justin remained sufficiently clear-minded to make an eloquent speech as he passed the crown:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You behold the ensigns of supreme power. You are about to receive them, not from my hand, but from the hand of God. Honor them, and from them you will derive honor. Respect the empress your mother: you are now her son; before, you were her servant. Delight not in blood; abstain from revenge; avoid those actions by which I have incurred the public hatred; and consult the experience, rather than the example, of your predecessor. As a man, I have sinned; as a sinner, even in this life, I have been severely punished: but these servants (and he pointed to his ministers), who have abused my confidence, and inflamed my passions, will appear with me before the tribunal of Christ. I have been dazzled by the splendor of the diadem: be thou wise and modest; remember what you have been, remember what you are. You see around us your slaves, and your children: with the authority, assume the tenderness, of a parent. Love your people like yourself; cultivate the affections, maintain the discipline, of the army; protect the fortunes of the rich, relieve the necessities of the poor.\nFour years later, on 26 September 578, he elevated Tiberius as \"Augustus\". Justin died only nine days later, on 5 October 578.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

McCay's employer William Randolph Hearst curtailed his vaudeville activities, prompting McCay to add a live-action introductory sequence to the film for its theatrical release, which was renamed Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist, and Gertie. McCay abandoned a sequel, \"Gertie on Tour\" (c.\u20091921), after producing about a minute of footage.\nAlthough \"Gertie\" is popularly thought to be the earliest animated film, McCay had previously made \"Little Nemo\" (1911) and \"How a Mosquito Operates\" (1912). The American J. Stuart Blackton and the French \u00c9mile Cohl had experimented with animation even earlier. Gertie being a character with an appealing personality distinguished McCay's film from these earlier \"trick films\". \"Gertie\" was the first film to employ several animation techniques, like keyframes, registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and animation loops. It influenced the next generation of animators, including the Fleischer brothers, Otto Messmer, Paul Terry, Walter Lantz, and Walt Disney. John Randolph Bray unsuccessfully tried to patent many of McCay's animation techniques. It is said to have been behind a plagiarized version of \"Gertie\" that appeared a year or two after the original. \"Gertie\" is the best preserved of McCay's films, some of which have been lost or survive only in fragments. In 1991, the U.S. Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nWinsor McCay\u00a0(c.\u20091867/1871\u00a0\u2013 1934) had already worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist by the time he began creating newspaper comic strips such as \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\"\u00a0(1904\u20131911) and his signature strip \"Little Nemo\" (1905\u20131914). In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit as well, doing chalk talks\u2014performances in which he drew pictures before live audiences.\nInspired by the flip books his son brought home, McCay recognized the potential to create \"moving pictures\" from his cartoons. He claimed to be the first man in the world to make animated cartoons, but he was preceded by the American James Stuart Blackton and the French \u00c9mile Cohl. McCay's first film starred his \"Little Nemo\" characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911; he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act. He followed it in 1912 with \"How a Mosquito Operates\", in which a giant, naturalistically animated mosquito sucks the blood of a sleeping man. McCay gave the mosquito a personality and balanced humor with the horror of the nightmarish situation. His animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced the characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires. To show that he had not, McCay chose for his next film a creature that could not have been photographed.\nIn 1912, McCay consulted with the American Historical Society and announced plans to create a presentation featuring depictions of the great monsters that once roamed the earth. He spoke of the \"serious and educational work\" that the animation process could enable. McCay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work, like the March 4, 1905, episode of \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" in which a \"Brontosaurus\" skeleton took part in a horse race, and the May 25, 1913, \"Rarebit Fiend\" episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur; the layout of the background to the latter bore a strong resemblance to what later appeared in \"Gertie\". In the September 21, 1913, episode of McCay's \"Little Nemo\" strip \"In the Land of Wonderful Dreams\", titled \"In the Land of the Antediluvians\", Nemo meets a blue dinosaur named Bessie which has the same design as that of Gertie.\nMcCay considered several names before settling on \"Gertie\"; his production notebooks used \"Jessie the Dinosaurus\". Disney animator Paul Satterfield recalled hearing McCay in 1915 relate how he had chosen the name \"Gertie\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He heard a couple of \"sweet boys\" [gay men] out in the hall talking to each other, and one of them said, \"Oh, Bertie, wait a minute!\" in a very sweet voice. He thought it was a good name, but wanted it to be a girl's name instead of a boy's, so he called it \"Gertie\".\u2014\u200a\nContent.\n\"Gertie the Dinosaur\" is the earliest animated film to feature a dinosaur. Its star, Gertie, performs tricks much like a trained elephant. She is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for the time: she breathes rhythmically, shifts her weight as she moves, and her abdominal muscles undulate as she draws water. McCay imbued her with a personality\u2014while friendly, she could be capricious, ignoring or rebelling against her master's commands.\nSynopsis.\nThe frisky, childlike Gertie appears from a cave after being called by her master McCay, eating a boulder and a tree on the way. The whip-wielding McCay orders her to do tricks like raising her foot or bowing to the audience. After being distracted by a sea serpent, Gertie nips back at her master. McCay scolds Gertie for this, which makes her cry, and he subsequently placates her with a pumpkin. Gertie eats the leftover tree trunk, and tosses a mammoth named Jumbo into the lake; when Jumbo teases her by spraying her with water, she hurls a boulder at it as it swims away. After a flying lizard catches Gertie's attention, she quenches her thirst by draining the lake. McCay then has her carry him offstage while he bows to the audience.\nIn the live-action framing story added for later distribution, McCay and friends suffer a flat tire in front of the American Museum of Natural History. They enter the museum and, while viewing a \"Brontosaurus\" skeleton, McCay wagers a dinner that he can bring a dinosaur to life with his animation skills. The animation process and its \"10,000 drawings, each a little different from the one preceding it\" is put on display, with humorous scenes of mountains of paper, some of which an assistant drops. When the film is finished, the friends gather to view it in a restaurant.\nProduction.\n\"Gertie\" was McCay's first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds. Main production began in mid-1913. Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on sheets of mulberry paper, a medium good for drawing as it did not absorb ink. Since it was translucent, it was also ideal for the laborious retracing of backgrounds, a job that fell to art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons. The drawings themselves occupied a area of the paper, marked with registration marks in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed. They were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard.\nMcCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion; he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gertie's breathing, and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gertie's weight. McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie's movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in a scene in which Gertie stood up, McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers' attention. When the drawings were finished, they were photographed at Vitagraph Studios in early 1914.\nMcCay pioneered the \"McCay Split System\" of animation, in which major poses or positions were drawn first and the intervening frames drawn after. This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film's actions. McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying: \"Any idiot that wants to make a couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club.\" During production of \"Gertie\", he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, as well as the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued\u2014he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.\nRelease.\n\"Gertie the Dinosaur\" first appeared as part of McCay's vaudeville act in early 1914. It appeared in movie theaters in an edition with a live-action prologue, distributed by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company from December 28. Dinosaurs were still new to the public imagination at the time of Gertie's release\u2014a \"Brontosaurus\" skeleton was put on public display for the first time in 1905. Advertisements reflected this by trying to educate audiences: \"According to science this monster once ruled this planet\u00a0 ... Skeletons [are] now being unearthed measuring from 90 ft. to 160 ft. in length. An elephant should be a mouse beside Gertie.\"\nVaudeville.\nMcCay originally used a version of the film as part of his vaudeville act. The first performance was on February 8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with \"How a Mosquito Operates\". He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. Standing to the right of the film screen, he introduced \"the only dinosaur in captivity\". As the film started, Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he \"reappeared\" in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.\nThe show soon moved to New York. Though reviews were positive, McCay's employer at the \"New York American\", newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, was displeased that his star cartoonist's vaudeville schedule interrupted his work illustrating editorials. At Hearst's orders, reviews of McCay's shows disappeared from the \"American\"'s pages. Shortly after, Hearst refused to run paid advertisements from the Victoria Theater, where McCay performed in New York. On March 8, Hearst announced a ban on artists in his employ from performing in vaudeville. McCay's contract did not prohibit him from his vaudeville performances, but Hearst was able to pressure McCay and his agents to cancel bookings, and eventually McCay signed a new contract barring him from performing outside of greater New York.\nMovie theaters.\nIn November 1914, film producer William Fox offered to market \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" to moving-picture theaters for \"spot cash and highest prices\". McCay accepted, and extended the film to include a live-action prologue and intertitles to replace his stage patter. The film successfully traveled the country and had reached the west coast by December.\nThe live-action sequence was likely shot on November 19, 1914. It features McCay with several of his friends, such as cartoonists George McManus and Tad Dorgan, writer Roy McCardell, and actor Tom Powers; McCay's son Robert had a cameo as a camera-room assistant. McCay used a bet as a plot device, as he had previously in the \"Little Nemo\" film.\n2018 reconstruction of McCay's vaudeville act.\nUsing extant original drawings by McCay, David L. Nathan reconstructed the lost \"Encore\" sequence from McCay's original vaudeville version. He initiated a restoration of the entire film and, with animation historian Donald Crafton, proposed a reconstruction of McCay's vaudeville performance. Crafton, Nathan and Marco de Blois of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise worked with a team of professionals from the National Film Board of Canada to complete the project, which premiered live during the closing ceremony of the 2018 Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France.\nMcCay and animation after \"Gertie\".\nMcCay's working method was laborious, and animators developed methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films. Within a few years of \"Nemo\"'s release, Canadian Raoul Barr\u00e9's registration pegs combined with American Earl Hurd's cel technology became near-universal methods in animation studios. McCay used cel technology in his follow-up to \"Gertie\", \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\" (1918). It was his most ambitious film at 25,000 drawings, and took nearly two years to complete, but was not a commercial success.\nAround 1921, McCay worked on a second animated film featuring Gertie, titled \"Gertie on Tour\". The film was to have Gertie bouncing on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, attempting to eat the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., wading in on the Atlantic City shore, and other scenes. The film exists only in concept sketches and in two minutes of film footage in which Gertie plays with a trolley and dances before other dinosaurs.\nMcCay made six more films, though three of them were never made commercially available. After 1921, McCay was made to give up animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations. Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with \"Jungle Imps\" author George Randolph Chester, a musical film called \"The Barnyard Band\", and a film about the Americans' role in World War I.\nIn 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York. After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer. McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated them, saying: \"Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. \"Bad Luck!\"\" That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 Frank Craven interviewed him for \"The Evening Journal\"'s \"Woman's Hour\". During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation. McCay died on July 26, 1934, of a cerebral embolism.\nReception and legacy.\nReviews.\n\"Gertie\" pleased audiences and reviewers. It won the praise of drama critic Ashton Stevens in Chicago, where the act opened. On February 22, 1914, before Hearst had barred the \"New York American\" from mentioning McCay's vaudeville work, a columnist in the paper called the act \"a laugh from start to finish ... far funnier than his noted mosquito drawings\". On February 28, the \"New York Evening Journal\" called it \"the greatest act in the history of motion picture cartoonists\". \u00c9mile Cohl praised McCay's \"admirably drawn\" films, and \"Gertie\" in particular, after seeing them in New York before he returned to Europe. Upon its theatrical release, \"Variety\" magazine wrote the film had \"plenty of comedy throughout\" and that it would \"always be remarked upon as exceptionally clever\". In 1994, \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" was voted number six of the 50 Greatest Cartoons by members of the animation field.\n\"New York Times\" film critic Richard Eder, on seeing a retrospective of McCay's animation at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1975, wrote of \"Gertie\" that \"Disney ... struggled mightily to recapture\" the qualities in McCay's animation, but that \"Disney's magic, though sometimes scary, was always contained; McCay's approached necromancy\". Eder compared McCay's artistic vision to that of poet William Blake, saying that \"it was too strange and personal to be generalized or to have any children\".\n\"Gertie\" has been written about in numerous books and articles. Animation historian Donald Crafton called \"Gertie\" \"the enduring masterpiece of pre-Disney animation\". Brothers Simon and Kim Deitch loosely based their graphic novel \"The Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" (2002) on McCay's disillusionment with the animation industry in the 1920s. The story features an aged cartoonist named Winsor Newton, who in his younger years had a \"Gertie\"-like stage act featuring a mastodon named Milton. \"Gertie\" has been selected for preservation in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry.\nLegacy.\nA fake version of \"Gertie the Dinosaur\" appeared a year or two after the original; it features a dinosaur performing most of Gertie's tricks, but with less skillful animation, using cels on a static background. It is not known for certain who produced the film, though its style is believed to be that of Bray Productions. Filmmaker Buster Keaton rode the back of a clay-animated dinosaur in homage to \"Gertie\" in \"Three Ages\" (1923).\nMcCay's first three films were the earliest animated works to have a commercial impact; their success motivated film studios to join the infant animation industry. Other studios used McCay's combination of live action with animation, such as the Fleischer Studios series \"Out of the Inkwell\" (1918\u20131929) and Walt Disney's \"Alice Comedies\" series (1923\u20131927). McCay's clean-line, high-contrast, realistic style set the pattern for American animation to come, and set it apart from the abstract, open forms of animation in Europe. This legacy is most apparent in the feature films of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, such as \"Fantasia\" (1940), which included anthropomorphic dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style with careful attention to timing and weight. Shamus Culhane, Dave and Max Fleischer, Walter Lantz, Otto Messmer, Pat Sullivan, Paul Terry, and Bill Tytla were among the generation of American animators who drew inspiration from the films they saw in McCay's vaudeville act. \"Gertie\"'s reputation was such that animation histories long named it as the first animated film.\nSince his death, McCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. Much was destroyed in a late-1930s house fire, and more was sold off when the McCays needed money. About 400 original drawings from the film have been preserved, discovered by animator Robert Brotherton in disarray in Irving Mendelsohn's fabric shop, into whose care McCay's films and artwork had been entrusted in the 1940s. Besides some cels from \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\", these \"Gertie\" drawings are the only original animation artwork of McCay's to have survived. McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what he kept, not much has survived, as it was photographed on nitrate film, which deteriorates and is flammable. A pair of young animators discovered the film in 1947 and preserved what they could. In many cases only fragments could be saved, if anything at all. Of all of McCay's films, \"Gertie\" is the best preserved, and has been kept in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" since 1991. Mendelsohn and Brotherton tried fruitlessly to find an institution to store McCay's films until the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, a Canadian film conservatory, approached them in 1967 on the occasion of that year's World Animation Film Exposition in Montreal. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise has since curated McCay's films. Of the surviving drawings, fifteen have been determined not to appear in extant copies of the film. They appear to come from a single sequence, likely at the close of the film, and have Gertie showing her head from the audience's right and giving a bow.\nMcCay's son Robert unsuccessfully attempted to revive Gertie with a comic strip called \"Dino\". He and Disney animator Richard Huemer recreated the original vaudeville performance for the \"Disneyland\" television program in 1955; this was the first exposure the film had for that generation. Walt Disney expressed to the younger McCay his feeling of debt, and gestured to the Disney studios saying, \"Bob, all this should be your father's.\" An ice cream shop in the shape of Gertie sits by Echo Lake in Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World. The first known specimen of the dinosaur \"Chindesaurus\", discovered in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park in 1985, has been nicknamed Gertie after the cartoon, although unlike Gertie, \"Chindesaurus\" is not a sauropod.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals and magazines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNewspapers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like his namesake, Justinian I, Justinian II was an ambitious and passionate ruler who was keen to restore the Roman Empire to its former glories. However, he responded brutally to any opposition to his will and lacked the finesse of his father, Constantine IV. Consequently, he generated enormous opposition to his reign, resulting in his deposition in 695 in a popular uprising. He only returned to the throne in 705 with the help of a Bulgarian army. His second reign was even more despotic than the first, and in 711 he was killed by mutinous soldiers.\nFirst reign.\nJustinian II was the eldest son of Emperor Constantine IV and Anastasia. His father appointed him as his heir sometime after October 682, upon the deposition of his uncles Heraclius and Tiberius. In 685, at the age of sixteen, Justinian II succeeded his father as sole emperor.\nAs a result of Constantine IV's victories, the political situation in the Eastern provinces of the Empire was stable when Justinian ascended the throne. After a preliminary strike against the Arabs in Armenia, Justinian managed to augment the sum paid by the Umayyad Caliphs as an annual tribute, and to regain control of part of Cyprus. The incomes of the provinces of Armenia and Iberia were divided among the two empires. In 687, as part of his agreements with the Caliphate, Justinian removed from their native Lebanon 12,000 Christian Mardaites, who continually resisted the Arabs. Additional resettlement efforts, aimed at the Mardaites and inhabitants of Cyprus, allowed Justinian to reinforce naval forces depleted by earlier conflicts. In 688, Justinian signed a treaty with the Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan which rendered Cyprus neutral ground, with its tax revenue split.\nThis enabled Justinian to turn his attention to the Balkans, where much imperial territory had been lost to Slavic tribes. In 687 Justinian transferred cavalry troops from Anatolia to Thrace. With a great military campaign in 688\u2013689, Justinian defeated the Slavs of Macedonia and was finally able to enter Thessalonica, the second most important Byzantine city in Europe.\nThe subdued Slavs were resettled in Anatolia, where they were to provide a military force of 30,000 men. Emboldened by the increase of his forces in Anatolia, Justinian now renewed the war against the Arabs, winning a battle in Armenia in 693. The Arabs met the challenge by bribing the new army to revolt. Most of the Slavic troops defected during the subsequent Battle of Sebastopolis, where Justinian was comprehensively defeated and compelled to flee to the Propontis. There, according to Theophanes, he vented his frustration by slaughtering as many of the Slavs in and around Opsikion as he could lay his hands on. Meanwhile, a Patrician named Symbatius rebelled in Armenia and opened up the province to the Arabs, who proceeded to conquer it in 694\u2013695.\nIn domestic affairs, the Emperor's bloody persecution of the Manichaeans, and his suppression of the popular traditions of those who were not of Chalcedonian origin, caused dissension within the Church. In 692 Justinian convened the so-called Quinisext Council at Constantinople to put his religious policies into effect. The Council expanded and clarified the rulings of the Fifth and Sixth ecumenical councils, but by highlighting differences between the Eastern and Western observances (such as the marriage of priests and the Catholic practice of fasting on Saturdays) it also compromised Byzantine relations with the Catholic Church. The emperor ordered Pope Sergius I arrested, but the militias of Rome and Ravenna sided with the Pope and rebelled.\nJustinian contributed to the development of the thematic organization of the Empire, creating a new theme of Hellas in southern Greece and numbering the heads of the four major themes of the Opsikion, Anatolikon, Thracesion and Armeniakon, and the naval Karabisianoi corps, among the senior administrators of the Empire. He also sought to protect the rights of peasant freeholders (who served as the main recruitment pool for the imperial armies) against attempts by the aristocracy to acquire their land. This put him in direct conflict with some of the largest landholders in the Empire.\nWhile his land policies threatened the aristocracy, his tax policy was very unpopular with the common people. Through his agents Stephen and Theodotos, the emperor raised the funds to gratify his sumptuous tastes and his mania for erecting costly buildings. This, plus ongoing religious discontent, conflicts with the aristocracy, and displeasure with his resettlement policy eventually drove his subjects into rebellion. In 695 the population rose under the leadership of Leontius, the \"strategos\" of Hellas, and proclaimed him Emperor. Justinian was deposed and his nose was cut off (later to be replaced by a solid gold replica of his original) to prevent his again seeking the throne: such mutilation was common in Byzantine culture. He was exiled to Cherson in the Crimea. Leontius, after a reign of three years, was in turn dethroned and imprisoned by Apsimarus, who then assumed the throne.\nExile.\nWhile in exile, Justinian began to plot and gather supporters for an attempt to retake the throne. Justinian became a liability to Cherson and the authorities decided to return him to Constantinople in 702 or 703. He escaped from Cherson and received help from Busir, the khagan of the Khazars, who received him enthusiastically and gave him his sister as a bride. Justinian renamed her Theodora, after the wife of Justinian I. They were given a home in the town of Phanagoria, at the entrance to the sea of Azov. Busir was offered a bribe by Tiberius to kill his brother-in-law, and dispatched two Khazar officials, Papatzys and Balgitzin, to do the deed. Warned by his wife, Justinian executed Papatzys and Balgitzin. He sailed in a fishing boat to Cherson, summoned his supporters, and they all sailed westwards across the Black Sea.\nAs the ship bearing Justinian sailed along the northern coast of the Black Sea, he and his crew became caught up in a storm somewhere between the mouths of the Dniester and the Dnieper Rivers. While it was raging, one of his companions reached out to Justinian saying that if he promised God that he would be magnanimous, and not seek revenge on his enemies when he was returned to the throne, they would all be spared. Justinian retorted: \"If I spare a single one of them, may God drown me here\".\nHaving survived the storm, Justinian next approached Tervel of Bulgaria. Tervel agreed to provide all the military assistance necessary for Justinian to regain his throne in exchange for financial considerations, the award of a \"Caesar\"'s crown, and the hand of Justinian's daughter, Anastasia, in marriage. In spring 705, with an army of 15,000 Bulgar and Slav horsemen, Justinian appeared before the walls of Constantinople. For three days, Justinian tried to convince the citizens of Constantinople to open the gates, but to no avail. Unable to take the city by force, he and some companions entered through an unused water conduit under the walls of the city, roused their supporters, and seized control of the city in a midnight coup d'\u00e9tat. On 21 August, Justinian regained the throne, breaking the tradition preventing the mutilated from Imperial rule. After tracking down his predecessors, he had his rivals Leontius and Tiberius brought before him in chains in the Hippodrome. There, before a jeering populace, Justinian, now wearing a golden nasal prosthesis, placed his feet on the necks of Tiberius and Leontius in a symbolic gesture of subjugation before ordering their execution by beheading, followed by many of their partisans, as well as deposing, blinding and exiling Patriarch Callinicus I to Rome.\nSecond reign.\nJustinian's second reign was marked by unsuccessful warfare against Bulgaria and the Caliphate, and by cruel suppression of opposition at home. In 708 Justinian turned on Bulgarian Khan Tervel, whom he had earlier crowned \"caesar\", and invaded Bulgaria, apparently seeking to recover the territories ceded to Tervel as a reward for his support in 705. The Emperor was defeated, blockaded in Anchialus, and forced to retreat. Peace between Bulgaria and Byzantium was quickly restored. This defeat was followed by Arab victories in Asia Minor, where the cities of Cilicia fell into the hands of the enemy, who penetrated into Cappadocia in 709\u2013711.\nHe ordered Pope John VII to recognize the decisions of the Quinisext Council and simultaneously fitted out a punitive expedition against Ravenna in 709 under the command of the Patrician Theodore. The expedition was led to reinstate the Western Church's authority over Ravenna, which was taken as a sign of disobedience to the emperor, and revolutionary sentiment. The repression succeeded, and the new Pope Constantine visited Constantinople in 710. Justinian, after receiving Holy Communion at the hands of the pope, renewed all the privileges of the Roman Church. Exactly what passed between them on the subject of the Quinisext Council is not known. It would appear, however, that Constantine approved most of the canons. This would be the last time a Pope visited the city until the visit of Pope Paul VI to Istanbul in 1967.\nJustinian's rule provoked another uprising against him. Cherson revolted, and under the leadership of the exiled general Bardanes the city held out against a counter-attack. Soon, the forces sent to suppress the rebellion joined it. The rebels then seized the capital and proclaimed Bardanes as Emperor Philippicus; Justinian had been on his way to Armenia, and was unable to return to Constantinople in time to defend it. He was arrested and executed in November 711, his head being exhibited in Rome and Ravenna.\nOn hearing the news of his death, Justinian's mother took his six-year-old son and co-emperor, Tiberius, to sanctuary at St. Mary's Church in Blachernae, but was pursued by Philippicus' henchmen, who dragged the child from the altar and, once outside the church, murdered him, thus eradicating the line of Heraclius.\nLegacy.\nJustinian's reign saw the continued slow and ongoing process of transformation of the Byzantine Empire, as the traditions inherited from the ancient Latin Roman state were gradually being eroded. This is most clearly seen in the coinage of Justinian's reign, which saw the reintroduction of the Loros, the traditional consular costume that had not been seen on Imperial coinage for a century, while the office itself had not been celebrated for nearly half a century. This was linked to Justinian's decision to unify the office of consul with that of emperor, thus making the Emperor the head of state not only de facto but also de jure. Although the office of the consulate continued to exist until Emperor Leo VI the Wise formally abolished it with Novel 94, it was Justinian who effectively ended its status as a separate political entity. He was formally appointed as Consul in 686, subsequently adopting the title for all the Julian years of his reign, consecutively numbered.\nThough at times undermined by his own despotic tendencies, Justinian was a talented and perceptive ruler who succeeded in improving the standing of the Byzantine Empire. A pious ruler, Justinian was the first emperor to include the image of Christ on coinage issued in his name and attempted to outlaw various pagan festivals and practices that persisted in the Empire. He may have self-consciously modelled himself on his namesake, Justinian I, as seen in his enthusiasm for large-scale construction projects and the renaming of his Khazar wife as Theodora. Among the building projects he undertook was the creation of the \"triklinos\", an extension to the imperial palace, a decorative cascade fountain located at the \"Augusteum\", and a new Church of the Virgin at Petrion.\nVeneration.\nThe veneration of Justinian II in the Orthodox Church is the subject of debate and confusion, as there are discrepancies in different Synaxarions. The Synaxarion of Constantinople from the 10th century lists the commemoration of the \"Emperor Justinian\", giving no reference of the emperor's life or whether it is Justinian I or II. Contemporary footnotes comment that this must be Justinian II, since Justinian I died in heresy, a position not held by the Orthodox Church today. According to Saint Nikodemos the Hagiorite, Emperor Justinian II was a bad man who lived a bad life, and he could not imagine that he would be commemorated as a saint, since in the Synaxarion of Saint Kallinikos of Constantinople on August 23, it does not say he died in repentance. Saint Nikodemos suggests this must be Justinian I, who is also celebrated the 15th of November with his wife Theodora.\nModern English translations and some Greek Synaxarions now list either Justinian I on August 2 or make no reference to either Justinian I or II. However, there are some Greek Synaxarions that list Justinian II.\nFamily.\nWith his first wife Eudokia, Justinian II had at least one daughter, Anastasia, who was betrothed to the Bulgarian ruler Tervel. With his second wife, Theodora of Khazaria, Justinian II had a son, Tiberius, co-emperor from 706 to 711.\nFictional account.\n\"Justinian\", a 1998 novel by Byzantine scholar Harry Turtledove, writing under the name H. N. Turteltaub, gives a fictionalized version of Justinian's life as retold by a fictionalized lifelong companion, the soldier Myakes. In the novel, Turtledove speculates that while in exile Justinian had reconstructive surgery done by an itinerant Indian plastic surgeon to repair his damaged nose.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "73875", "revid": "15679236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73875", "title": "The Godfather Part II", "text": "1974 epic crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola\nThe Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, loosely based on the 1969 novel \"The Godfather\" by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. It is both a sequel and a prequel to the 1972 film \"The Godfather\", presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the new Don of the Corleone family, protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the other covers the journey of his father, Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The ensemble cast also features Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Morgana King, John Cazale, Marianna Hill and Lee Strasberg.\nFollowing the first film's success, Paramount Pictures began developing a follow-up, with many of the cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more creative control, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to \"The Godfather\" that would tell the story of Vito's rise and Michael's fall. Principal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. \"The Godfather Part II\" premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974. It grossed $48 million in the United States and Canada and up to $93\u00a0million worldwide on a $13\u00a0million budget. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and became the first sequel to win Best Picture. Its six Oscar wins also included Best Director for Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won Best Actor at the BAFTAs and was nominated at the Oscars.\n\"The Godfather Part II\" is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, as well as a rare example of a sequel that rivals its predecessor. Like its predecessor, \"Part II\" remains a highly influential film, especially in the gangster genre. In 1997, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 32nd-greatest film in American film history and it retained this position 10 years later. It was selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \nPauline Kael wrote: \"\"The Godfather\" was the greatest gangster picture ever made, and had metaphorical overtones that took it far beyond the gangster genre. In Part II, the wider themes are no longer merely implied. The second film shows the consequences of the actions in the first; it\u2019s all one movie, in two great big pieces, and it comes together in your head while you watch.\"\n\"The Godfather Part III\", the final installment in the trilogy, was released 16 years later in 1990.\nPlot.\nThe film interweaves events some time after \"The Godfather\" (1972) and the early life of Vito Corleone.\nVito.\nIn 1901, nine-year-old Vito Andolini escapes from Corleone, Sicily in the Kingdom of Italy to New York City after mafia chieftain Don Ciccio kills the rest of his family. An immigration officer registers him as Vito Corleone. By 1917 Vito is married in Little Italy and has an infant son, Sonny. Black Hand extortionist Don Fanucci preys on the neighborhood, costing Vito his grocery store job. He begins stealing for a living with his neighbor Peter Clemenza and has two more children: Fredo and Michael. \nVito, Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio sell stolen dresses door-to-door. Fanucci demands payoffs of $200 from Vito and his partners. Vito doubts Fanucci's muscle and decides to offer less. He meets Fanucci and offers $100, which Fanucci grudgingly accepts. Emboldened, Vito tracks Fanucci back to his apartment and kills him. Vito's reputation spreads, and neighbors ask him to defend them from other predatory figures. In 1922, Vito and his family travel to Sicily to start an olive oil importing business. He and business partner Don Tommasino visit an elderly Don Ciccio. He obtains Ciccio's blessing for their business, then reveals his identity and slices Ciccio's stomach, killing him and avenging the Andolini family.\nMichael.\nIn 1958, Don Michael Corleone has several meetings at his Lake Tahoe compound during the First Communion of his son Anthony. Johnny Ola, representing Jewish Mob boss Hyman Roth, promises support in taking over a Las Vegas casino. Corleone \"capo\" Frank Pentangeli asks for help defending Bronx territory from Roth affiliates, the Rosato brothers. Michael refuses, frustrating Pentangeli. Senator Pat Geary demands a bribe to secure the casino license and insults Michael's Italian heritage. That night, Michael narrowly escapes an assassination attempt. Suspecting a traitor in the family, he leaves \"consigliere\" Tom Hagen in charge and leaves the compound.\nMichael separately tells Pentangeli and Roth that he suspects the other of planning the hit, and arranges a peace meeting between Pentangeli and the Rosatos. At the meeting the brothers attempt to strangle Pentangeli. A police officer drops in, forcing the brothers to flee. Hagen blackmails Geary into cooperating with the Corleones by having him framed for the death of a prostitute. Roth invites Michael to Havana to invest in his activities under the Batista government. Michael expresses reservations, given the growing Cuban Revolution. Later Roth becomes angry when Michael asks who ordered the Rosatos to kill Pentangeli. Michael and Ola attend a New Year's Eve party where Fredo pretends not to know Ola but later slips. Michael realizes that Fredo is a traitor and has Ola strangled to death. He sends an assassin to the hospital where Roth resides to choke him with a pillow but he fails and is killed by Roth's guard. Batista resigns and flees amid rebel advances, and Michael, Fredo and Roth separately escape Cuba. Back home, Hagen tells Michael that his wife Kay miscarried.\nRoth uses his connections to arrange for a special senate committee to ruin Michael\u2019s reputation. Pentangeli agrees to testify against the family and is placed under witness protection. On returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he did not realize Roth was planning an assassination, then lashes out over being excluded from the family business. Michael disowns Fredo but orders that he should not be harmed while their mother Carmela is alive. Michael attends the committee hearing with Hagen and Pentangeli's brother Vincenzo. Humiliated, Pentangeli retracts his testimony, and the hearing dissolves in an uproar. Kay tells Michael that she had an abortion and intends to leave him and take their children. Michael strikes her in rage and banishes her.\nNot long afterwards, Carmela passes away. At Carmela's funeral, Fredo hugs a reluctant Michael and befriends Anthony over fishing. Roth returns to the United States after being refused entry to Israel. Corleone \"capo\" Rocco Lampone assassinates him at the airport and is shot dead trying to escape. Hagen visits Pentangeli at the army barracks where he is held and remarks that conspirators against a Roman emperor could commit suicide to save their families. Pentangeli is later found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. Corleone enforcer Al Neri takes Fredo fishing on the lake and executes him as Michael watches from the compound. Michael recalls Vito's 50th birthday party on December 7, 1941. While the family waits for Vito, Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and joined the Marines, angering Sonny and surprising Hagen. Only Fredo supports his decision. When Vito is heard arriving, Michael sits alone at the table while the others welcome him in surprise. After Fredo's death, Michael sits pensively, alone, by the lake.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Al Pacino as Michael Corleone\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nMario Puzo started writing a script for a sequel in December 1971, before \"The Godfather\" was even released; its initial title was \"The Death of Michael Corleone\". Francis Ford Coppola's idea for the sequel would be to \"juxtapose the ascension of the family under Vito Corleone with the decline of the family under his son Michael... I had always wanted to write a screenplay that told the story of a father and a son at the same age. They were both in their thirties and I would integrate the two stories... In order not to merely make \"Godfather I\" over again, I gave \"Godfather II\" this double structure by extending the story in both the past and in the present\". Coppola met with Martin Scorsese about directing the film, but Paramount Pictures refused. Coppola also, in his director's commentary on \"The Godfather Part II\", mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Frank Pentangeli are based on the Joseph Valachi federal hearings and that Pentangeli is a Valachi-like figure.\nProduction, however, nearly ended before it began when Al Pacino's lawyers told Coppola that he had grave misgivings with the script and was not coming. Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.\nThe film's original budget was $6\u00a0million but costs increased to over $11\u00a0million, with \"Variety\"'s review claiming it was over $15\u00a0million.\nCasting.\nSeveral actors from the first film did not return for the sequel. Marlon Brando initially agreed to return for the birthday flashback sequence, but the actor, feeling mistreated by the board at Paramount, failed to show up for the single day's shooting. Coppola then rewrote the scene that same day. Richard S. Castellano, who portrayed Peter Clemenza in the first film, also declined to return, as he and the producers could not reach an agreement on his demands that he be allowed to write the character's dialogue in the film, though this claim was disputed by Castellano's widow in a 1991 letter to \"People\" magazine. The part in the plot originally intended for the latter-day Clemenza was then filled by the character of Frank Pentangeli, played by Michael V. Gazzo.\nCoppola offered James Cagney the role of Hyman Roth, but he refused as he had retired from acting. James Caan agreed to reprise the role of Sonny in the birthday flashback sequence, demanding he be paid the same amount he received for the entire previous film for the single scene in \"Part II\", which he received. Among the actors depicting Senators in the hearing committee are film producer/director Roger Corman, writer/producer William Bowers, producer Phil Feldman, and actor Peter Donat.\nFilming.\n\"The Godfather Part II\" was shot between October 1, 1973, and June 19, 1974. The scenes that took place in Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Charles Bluhdorn, whose Gulf+Western conglomerate owned Paramount, felt strongly about developing the Dominican Republic as a movie-making site. Forza d'Agr\u00f2 was the Sicilian town featured in the film.\nUnlike with the first film, Coppola was given near-complete control over production. In his commentary, he said this resulted in a shoot that ran very smoothly despite multiple locations and two narratives running parallel within one film. Coppola discusses his decision to make this the first major US motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title in the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film released in 2002. Paramount was initially opposed because they believed the audience would not be interested in an addition to a story they had already seen. But the director prevailed, and the film's success began the common practice of numbered sequels. Only three weeks prior to the release, film critics and journalists pronounced \"Part\u00a0II\" a disaster. The cross-cutting between Vito and Michael's parallel stories were judged too frequent, not allowing enough time to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Coppola and the editors returned to the cutting room to change the film's narrative structure, but could not complete the work in time, leaving the final scenes poorly timed at the opening. It was the last major American motion picture to have release prints made with Technicolor's dye imbibition process until the late 1990s.\nMusic.\nThe score is by Nino Rota with additions by Carmine Coppola. It won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\n\"The Godfather Part II\" premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974.\nHome media.\nCoppola created \"The Godfather Saga\" expressly for American television in a 1975 release that combined \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part\u00a0II\" with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the \"Godfather Epic\" VHS box set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from \"The Godfather Part\u00a0III\" and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title \"The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980\", had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".\n\"The Godfather DVD Collection\" was released on October 9, 2001, in a package that contained all three films\u2014each with a commentary track by Coppola\u2014and a bonus disc that featured a 73-minute documentary from 1991 entitled \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\" and other miscellany about the film: the additional scenes originally contained in \"The Godfather Saga\"; \"Francis Coppola's Notebook\" (a look inside a notebook the director kept with him at all times during the production of the film); rehearsal footage; a promotional featurette from 1971; and video segments on Gordon Willis's cinematography, Nino Rota's and Carmine Coppola's music, the director, the locations and Mario Puzo's screenplays. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches. The restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for \"The Godfather Part\u00a0III\", when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".\nRestoration.\nAfter a careful restoration by Robert A. Harris of Film Preserve, the first two \"Godfather\" films were released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2008, under the title \"The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration\". The Blu-ray Disc box set (four discs) includes high-definition extra features on the restoration and film. They are included on Disc 5 of the DVD box set (five discs).\nOther extras are ported over from Paramount's 2001 DVD release. There are slight differences between the repurposed extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets, with the HD box having more content.\nParamount Pictures restored and remastered \"The Godfather\", \"The Godfather Part II\", and \"\" (a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere of \"The Godfather\". The disc editions were released on March 22, 2022.\nVideo game.\nA video game based on the film was released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in April 2009 by Electronic Arts. It received mixed or average reviews and sold poorly, leading Electronic Arts to cancel plans for a game based on \"The Godfather Part III.\"\nReception.\nBox office.\nAlthough \"The Godfather Part II\" did not surpass the original film commercially, it grossed $47.5 million in the United States and Canada. and was Paramount Pictures' highest-grossing film of 1974, and the seventh-highest-grossing picture in the United States. According to its international distributor, the film had grossed $45.3 million internationally by 1994, for a worldwide total of $93 million.\nCritical response.\nPauline Kael in \"The New Yorker\" was an early champion of the film, writing that it was visually \"far more complexly beautiful than the first, just as it's thematically richer, more shadowed, more full.\" She writes: \"Twice I almost cried out at the acts of violence that De Niro's Vito committed. I didn't look away from the images, as I sometimes do in routine action pictures. I wanted to see the worst; there is a powerful need to see it. You need these moments as you need the terrible climaxes in a Tolstoy novel. A great novelist does not spare our feelings (as the historical romancer does); he intensifies them, and so does Coppola.\" However, while the film's cinematography and acting were immediately acclaimed, many criticized it as overly slow-paced and convoluted. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" viewed the film unfavorably, describing it as \"stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own... The plot defies any rational synopsis.\" \"Variety\" noted that Canby had been downbeat on the original too and claimed that he was in a minority of one and reported that the film had drawn mostly strongly admiring reviews. In A.D. Murphy's review in \"Variety\" he described it as a \"masterful sequel\" and \"outstanding in all respects\".\nWilliam Pechter of \"Commentary\", while admiring the movie, regretted what he saw as its archness and self-importance, calling it an \"overly deliberate and self-conscious attempt to make a film that's unmistakably a serious work of art,\" and professing to \"know of no one except movie critics who likes \"Part II\" as much as part one.\" Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" cited what he called \"gaps and distentions\" in the story.\nRoger Ebert awarded three out of four and wrote that the flashbacks \"give Coppola the greatest difficulty in maintaining his pace and narrative force. The story of Michael, told chronologically and without the other material, would have had really substantial impact, but Coppola prevents our complete involvement by breaking the tension.\" Though praising Pacino's performance and lauding Coppola as \"a master of mood, atmosphere, and period\", Ebert considered the chronological shifts of its narrative \"a structural weakness from which the film never recovers\". Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, writing that it was at times \"as beautiful, as harrowing, and as exciting as the original. In fact, \"The Godfather, Part II\" may be the \"second\" best gangster movie ever made. But it's not the same. Sequels can never be the same. It's like being forced to go to a funeral the second time\u2014the tears just don't flow as easily.\"\nCritical re-assessment.\nThe film quickly became the subject of a critical re-evaluation. Whether considered separately or with its predecessor as one work, \"The Godfather Part II\" is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema. Many critics compare it favorably with the original\u00a0\u2013 although it is rarely ranked higher on lists of \"greatest\" films. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 96% approval rating based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 9.7/10. The consensus reads, \"Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nMichael Sragow's conclusion in his 2002 essay, selected for the National Film Registry website, is that \"[a]lthough \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" depict an American family's moral defeat, as a mammoth, pioneering work of art it remains a national creative triumph.\" In his 2014 review of the film, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" wrote \"Francis Coppola's breathtakingly ambitious prequel-sequel to his first \"Godfather\" movie is as gripping as ever. It is even better than the first film, and has the greatest single final scene in Hollywood history, a real\u00a0coup de cin\u00e9ma.\"\n\"The Godfather Part II\" was featured on \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s Director's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1992 (ranked at No. 9) and 2002 (where it was ranked at No. 2. The critics ranked it at No. 4) On the 2012 list by the same magazine the film was ranked at No. 31 by critics and at No. 30 by directors. In 2006, Writers Guild of America ranked the film's screenplay (Written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) the 10th greatest ever. It ranked No. 7 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\", and #1 on \"TV Guide\"'s 1999 list of the \"50 Greatest Movies of All Time on TV and Video\". \"The Village Voice\" ranked \"The Godfather Part II\" at No. 31 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. In January 2002, the film (along with \"The Godfather\") made the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2017, it ranked No. 12 on Empire magazine's reader's poll of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\". In an earlier poll held by the same magazine in 2008, it was voted 19th on the list of 'The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'. In 2015, it was tenth in the BBC's list of the 100 greatest American films.\nMany believe Pacino's performance in \"The Godfather Part II\" is his finest acting work. It is now regarded as one of the greatest performances in film history. In 2006, \"Premiere\" issued its list of \"The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time\", putting Pacino's performance at #20. Later in 2009, \"Total Film\" issued \"The 150 Greatest Performances of All Time\", ranking Pacino's performance fourth place.\nEbert added the film to his Great Movies canon, noting he \"would not change a word\" of his original review but praising the work as \"grippingly written, directed with confidence and artistry, photographed by Gordon Willis... in rich, warm tones.\" He praises the score: \"More than ever, I am convinced it is instrumental to the power and emotional effect of the films. I cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota scores. Against all our objective reason, they instruct us how to feel about the films. Now listen very carefully to the first notes as the big car drives into Miami.

Along with \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Godfather Trilogy\" shares the distinction that all of its installments were nominated for Best Picture; additionally, \"The Godfather Part II\" and \"\" are so far the only sequels to win Best Picture. Al Pacino became the third actor to be Oscar-nominated twice for playing the same character.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film also stars Chaplin in his Little Tramp persona, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain, Tom Murray, Henry Bergman and Malcolm Waite.\nChaplin drew inspiration from photographs of the Klondike Gold Rush as well as from the story of the Donner Party who, when snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, were driven to cannibalism or eating leather from their shoes. Chaplin, who believed tragedies and comedies were not far from each other, decided to combine these stories of deprivation and horror in comedy. He decided that his famous rogue figure should become a gold-digger who joins a brave optimist determined to face all the pitfalls associated with the search for gold, such as sickness, hunger, cold, loneliness or the possibility that he may at any time be attacked by a grizzly. The film features scenes like Chaplin cooking and eating his shoe, or how his starving friend Big Jim sees him as a chicken.\n\"The Gold Rush\" was critically acclaimed upon its release, and continues to be one of Chaplin's most celebrated works; Chaplin himself cited it several times as the film for which he most wanted to be remembered. In 1942, Chaplin re-released a version with sound effects, music, and narration, which received Academy Award nominations for Best Music Score and Best Sound Recording. In 1958, the film was voted number 2 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo, by a margin of only five votes behind \"Battleship Potemkin\". In 1992, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 1953, the original 1925 version of the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\nPlot.\n\"The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release:\"\nDuring the Klondike Gold Rush, in Alaska, gold prospector Big Jim finds an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a blizzard strikes. The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw the Prospector out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to a truce allowing them all to stay in the cabin.\nWhen the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.\nMeanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. A bear then enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.\nAfter the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen dies in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, having lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he found a large gold deposit, that it was close to a cabin, and that he stayed there with the Prospector. But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin, and so looks for the Prospector, hoping that he can lead him to the cabin.\nThe Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl, and falls in love with her. To irritate Jack, a man who is making aggressive advances toward Georgia and is pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with \"the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall\", the Prospector. After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a New Year's Eve dinner, but does not take it seriously and forgets about it. On New Year's Eve, while waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of bread rolls on forks. When she does not arrive by midnight, he listens out his front door and hears the community singing Auld Lang Syne down at the dance hall. He walks alone through the streets, lonely and forgotten. Meanwhile, Georgia remembers his invitation and brings her friends to visit him. Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she is guilt-ridden and decides to stop toying with him. She writes him a note apologizing. When he receives the note he goes looking for her. \nJim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to tell Georgia that he will return to her as a millionaire. Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night. Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim's gold deposit. The next morning the cabin is rocking dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape. Jim eventually gets out and pulls the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls off the cliff.\nOne year later, both have become wealthy, but the Prospector never could find Georgia. They return to the contiguous United States on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also traveling. When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more. After she mistakenly thinks he is a stowaway and tries to save him from the ship's crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.\nProduction.\nChaplin attempted to film many of the scenes on location near Truckee, California in early 1924. He retained only the film's opening scene. For two weeks the unit shot on location at Truckee in the snow country of the Sierra Nevada. Here Chaplin faithfully recreated the historic image of the prospectors struggling up the Chilkoot Pass. Six hundred extras clambered up the 2300-feet pass dug through the mountain snow.\nThe rest of the film was shot on the back lot and stages at Chaplin's Hollywood studio, where elaborate Klondike sets were constructed.\nLita Grey, whom Chaplin married in November 1924, was originally cast as the leading lady but due to her pregnancy was replaced by Georgia Hale. Grey appeared in the film as an extra.\nDiscussing the making of the film in the documentary series \"Unknown Chaplin\", Hale revealed that the marriage had collapsed during production of the film; the final scene of the original version, in which the two kiss, reflected the state of his relationship with Hale by that time.\nBox office.\n\"The Gold Rush\" was a huge success in the US and worldwide. It is the fifth-highest-grossing silent film in cinema history, earning more than $4,250,000 at the box office in 1926 (~$ in 2024). Chaplin proclaimed at the time of its release that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered.\nIt earned United Artists $1 million and Chaplin himself a profit of $2 million.\nCritical reception.\nCritics generally praised the original 1925 release of \"The Gold Rush\". Mordaunt Hall wrote in \"The New York Times:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here is a comedy with streaks of poetry, pathos, tenderness, linked with brusqueness and boisterousness. It is the outstanding gem of all Chaplin's pictures, as it has more thought and originality than even such masterpieces of mirth as \"The Kid\" and \"Shoulder Arms\".\n\"Variety\" also published a rave review, saying that it was \"the greatest and most elaborate comedy ever filmed, and will stand for years as the biggest hit in its field, just as \"The Birth of a Nation\" still withstands the many competitors in the dramatic class.\"\n\"The New Yorker\" published a mixed review, believing that the dramatic elements of the film did not work well alongside Chaplin's familiar slapstick:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One might be given to expect wonders of Gold Rush burlesque with the old Chaplin at the receiving end of the Klondike equivalent of custard. But one is doomed to disappoint, for Chaplin has seen fit to turn on his onion juices in a Pierrot's endeavor to draw your tears... Instead of the rush of tears called for, one reaches for his glycerine bottle... We do not wish to deride Chaplin. He is as deft as ever and far and away a brilliant screen master. He has made a serviceable picture in \"The Gold Rush\" but it seems that he is not as funny as he once was.\nNevertheless, \"The New Yorker\" included \"The Gold Rush\" in its year-end list of the ten best films of 1925.\nAt the 1958 Brussels World Fair, critics rated it the second greatest film in history, behind only Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\". In 1992, \"The Gold Rush\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nChaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance considers \"The Gold Rush\" to be Chaplin's greatest work of the silent-film era. He writes: \"\"The Gold Rush\" is arguably his greatest and most ambitious silent film; it was the longest and most expensive comedy produced up to that time. The film contains many of Chaplin's most celebrated comedy sequences, including the boiling and eating of his shoe, the dance of the rolls, and the teetering cabin. However, the greatness of \"The Gold Rush\" does not rest solely on its comedy sequences but on the fact that they are integrated so fully into a character-driven narrative. Chaplin had no reservations about the finished product. Indeed, in the contemporary publicity for the film, he is quoted, 'This is the picture that I want to be remembered by.'\"\nThe Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited \"The Gold Rush\" as one of his favorite films.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\"The Village Voice\" ranked \"The Gold Rush\" at No. 49 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. \"Entertainment Weekly\" voted it at No.15 on their list of \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\". The film was voted at No. 97 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\" in 2008. In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll, it was ranked the 91st-greatest film ever made in the directors' poll. In 2015, \"The Gold Rush\" ranked 17th on BBC's \"The 100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world. The film was voted at No. 25 on the list of \"The 100 greatest comedies of all time\" by a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 87 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A delightful blend of slapstick humor, poignant emotion, and social commentary, \"The Gold Rush\" encapsulates Chaplin's strengths as a writer, director, and star.\"\n1942 re-release.\nIn 1942, Chaplin released a new version of \"The Gold Rush\", modifying the original silent 1925 film by adding a recorded musical score, adding a narration which he recorded himself and tightening the editing, which reduced the film's running time by several minutes. The film was further shortened by being run at the 24 frames per second rate of sound films. Like most silent movies it was originally shot and exhibited at a slower speed. Chaplin also changed some plot points. Besides removing the ending kiss, another edit eliminated a subplot in which the Lone Prospector is tricked into believing Georgia is in love with him by Georgia's paramour, Jack. In the original 1925 version, Georgia and Jack go to the lone prospector's cabin while he is out. Georgia, seeing the nice dinner he had prepared for her, is guilt-ridden over having stood him up on New Year's Eve. Jack, oblivious to her distress, makes advances but she refuses to kiss him. He forces himself on her and she strikes him. The following day she writes Jack a note apologizing. \"I'm sorry for what I did last night. Please forgive me. I love you, Georgia\" She asks a waiter to hand the note to Jack. She watches his callous reaction from afar, and is crushed by it. \nWhen the Prospector enters the dance hall, Jack decides to play a prank on him. He tells the waiter \"Hand this note to that bum, but don't tell him it's from me.\" When the Prospector reads Georgia's note, believing she wrote it to him, he is overcome with joy and rushes around the dance hall searching for her. \nLiterary critic Manny Farber, writing in \"The New Republic\", on the 1942 re-release of \"The Gold Rush\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; You see things that are so peculiarly a result of Chaplin's genius you can't explain them\u2026These situations begin with something absurd: a dancer's feet represented by two bread rolls, a house half on, half off a cliff, a meal made of a shoe. But Chaplin's pantomime changes the absurdity into something significant with human feeling\u2014the rolls come alive with the personality of a dancer, the house, for all its triteness, becomes a stirring reality, and what happens to the shoes is unbelievable. An absurdity has been made real and enormously significant, and this is where you feel whatever emotion was intended by Chaplin\u2026\nThe new music score by Max Terr and the sound recording by James L. Fields were nominated for Academy Awards in 1943.\n\"The Gold Rush\" was the first of Chaplin's classic silent films that he converted to sound. The 2012 Blu-ray release revealed that the reissue of \"The Gold Rush\" preserved most of the footage from the original film. Even the restored print of the 1925 original shows noticeable degradation of image and missing frames, artifacts not seen in the 1942 version.\nCopyright and home media.\nIn 1953, the original 1925 film may have entered the public domain in the US, as Chaplin did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication in accordance with American law at the time. As such, the film was once widely available on home video in the US. After 1995, Chaplin's estate blocked unauthorized releases of \"The Gold Rush\" in the United States by arguing that the film's U.S. copyright had been restored by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Regardless, in 2021, the original film definitively entered the public domain in the United States as 95 years had passed since its release.\nIn 2012, both the reconstruction of the 1925 silent version and the 1942 narrated reissue version were released on Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection. This set included a new audio commentary track by Chaplin biographer and scholar Jeffrey Vance.\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"roll dance\" that the Little Tramp character performs in the film is considered one of the more memorable scenes in film history; however, Roscoe Arbuckle did something similar in the 1917 movie \"The Rough House\" which co-starred Buster Keaton. Curly Howard made a brief homage to the bit in the 1935 Three Stooges film \"Pardon My Scotch\". Anna Karina's character in \"Bande \u00e0 part\" makes references to it before the famous dance scene. It was replicated by Robert Downey Jr. in his lead role as Charles Chaplin in the 1992 \"Chaplin\", which briefly depicts the production of the film; Johnny Depp's character in the 1993 film \"Benny and Joon\"; Grampa Simpson in the 1994 \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Lady Bouvier's Lover\"; and Amy Adams's character in \"The Muppets\". The \"hanging cabin on the edge of the cliff\" sequence (starting at 1:19 in video inserted above) has been used in two Indian movies: \"Michael Madana Kama Rajan\" and \"Welcome\".\nLegacy.\nA new 4K restoration of \"The Gold Rush\" enjoyed its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in celebration of the film's centennial. The audience included two of Chaplin's grandchildren: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.\nOn the exact 100th anniversary date, June 26, 2025, the restoration screened in cinemas worldwide. Its exclusive U.S. premiere took place at Hollywood's iconic Egyptian Theatre, where \"The Gold Rush\" had its original world premiere a century earlier. The event was introduced by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance.\nOver 500 screenings in 70 countries are planned as part of the global centennial celebration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father had stipulated in his will that both of his sons, Heraclonas and Constantine III, should rule jointly upon his death. Heraclius also specified that his wife, Martina, was to be called \"Mother and Empress\" insofar as she might have influence at court as well. The emperor Heraclius died in February 641 from edema. When Martina made the late Emperor's will public she faced staunch resistance to her playing any active role in government, but both Heraclonas and Constantine were proclaimed joint-emperors in February 641 without incident. After Constantine died of tuberculosis in May 641, Heraclonas became sole emperor, under the regency of his mother due to his young age. He reigned until October or November 641, when he was overthrown by Valentinus, a general and usurper of Armenian extract, who installed Constans II, the son of Constantine III. Valentinus had Heraclonas' nose cut off, then exiled him to Rhodes, where he is believed to have died in the following year.\nEarly life and family.\nHeraclonas was born in 626, in the suburban Palace of Sophianae. He was the son of Emperor Heraclius, and his niece-wife Martina, and was born while Heraclius campaigned in the east against the Persians.\nUnder Heraclius, the Byzantine Empire was invaded in 639 by the Arabs, due to the failure of the Theme of Mesopotamia to pay tribute. The cities of Edessa and Dara were quickly captured. In the same year, another group of Arabs, led by 'Amr ibn al-'As, invaded Byzantine Egypt. He quickly occupied the coastal towns of Egypt, but was unable to cross the Nile, due to stiff resistance by Byzantine forces led by John (Prefect of Egypt). After a bloody battle between John and 'Amr, in which John perished, 'Amr was forced to appeal to the Rashidun Caliph Umar for more troops. John was replaced by another general, Theodore, who gathered his forces around Babylon Fortress, a major fortress in Egypt. By summer 640, 'Amr's forces had swelled to around 15,000 men. With these men, 'Amr decisively defeated Theodore north of Babylon, before laying siege to the fortress itself.\nLife.\nHeraclonas was made by Heraclius on 1 January 632, and further elevated to (co-emperor) on 4 July 638, at a ceremony in the chapel of Saint Stephen at the Palace of Daphne, alongside his younger brother David, who was made . A description of the ceremony is preserved in \"De Ceremoniis\" which says that the \"kamelaukion\" (caesar cap) of Heraclonas was removed from his head and replaced with the imperial crown. The same \"kamelaukion\" was then placed on David's head.\nHeraclius died of edema on 11 February 641, leaving the Empire jointly to his eldest son, Constantine III, and Heraclonas, who were both proclaimed emperor in late May 641. At the time of his elevation to co-emperor, Heraclonas was only 15 years old, whereas Constantine was 28, which effectively gave the real power to Constantine. Much of the Byzantine public objected to Heraclius' will, as Heraclonas was the result of an avunculate marriage\u2014a marriage between an uncle and niece\u2014which many felt was illegal, thereby making Heraclonas a bastard. Also considered objectionable was the fact that Constantine's ten-year-old son, Constans II, was not elevated alongside Constantine and Heraclonas, breaking the tradition of the succession of senior emperorship from father to eldest son, when possible. It was also thought that the lack of elevation could have precluded him from the succession entirely.\nShortly after Constantine took the throne, he was informed by his finance minister, Philagrius, that Heraclius had created a secret fund for Martina, administered by Patriarch Pyrrhus. Constantine confiscated this account, using it to help meet the budget for the spring military payroll, which, along with the traditional accessional donatives that comprised half of the payroll, totaled 2,016,000 nomisma. Constantine appointed Valentinus as the commander of the main eastern army, in the hopes of retaining at least the Egyptian coastline. However the Byzantine general Theodore was still unable to repel the Arab attacks. Constantine summoned Cyrus of Alexandria, made him Prefect of Egypt, and instructed him to prepare to reinforce Alexandria. Before this invasion could take place, Babylon surrendered to the Arabs, allowing them to besiege Alexandria.\nHeraclius' will also stated that Martina should serve as mother and empress-regent (sharing significant power), but this part was rejected by the Senate. Because of Heraclonas' young age, Martina ruled through him, consistently opposing the policies of Constantine, leading to the creation of two different political factions. Constantine's faction was initially the more powerful of the two, but this control was weakened by a flagging economy and the loss of Egypt to the Arabs. Shortly after, on 25 May 641, Constantine died of an advanced case of tuberculosis, although some supporters of Constantine alleged Martina had him poisoned, leaving Heraclonas as the sole ruler, under the regency of Martina.\nSole rule and fall.\nMartina maintained the plans of Constantine, and sent Cyrus to Alexandria, with much of the praesental army. She then summoned the Thracian army to Constantinople, to replace them. Around this time, the Patriarch Pyrrhus, an influential advisor of Martina, succeeded in reviving the policy of Monothelitism. As a result of this policy, Kyros, a monothelete, regained control of the see of Alexandria, giving him both religious and secular control. Martina instructed Kyros to attempt to negotiate with the Arabs, as they believed that they were unable to defeat them militarily. Kyros met with 'Amr at the Babylon Fortress and there agreed upon the surrender of Egypt.\nMartina was opposed by Valentinus, who was beyond her reach in Anatolia, although she exiled his patron, Philagrius, to Africa. Heraclonas and Martina lost the support of the Byzantine Senate and people due to the rumors that Martina had poisoned Constantine and their support for Monothelitism. Also at this time, both Heraclonas and Martina's relations with the army suffered as a result of Martina's inability to raise enough funds to match the donative given by Constantine.\nIn August 641, Valentinus marched his troops to Chalcedon, to force Martina to elevate Constans II to co-emperor. While Valentinus was encamped across the Bosphorus from Constantinople, a mob rose up in the city, demanding that Pyrrhus crown Constans II as emperor, and then abdicate, to be replaced by his steward Paul II. Martina, now in a truly desperate situation, offered the military further donatives, recalled Philagrius from Africa, and offered Valentinus the title of Count of the Excubitors. In late September/October, Martina elevated Constans to co-emperor, but also crowned Heraclonas' brother David. Despite these offers, Valentinus entered the city in October/November, deposed Heraclonas and Martina, and then elevated Constans to emperor. Valentinus was unwilling to kill a woman and child, but had Martina's tongue slit and Heraclonas' nose cut off in January 642, then exiled them to Rhodes; this is believed to be the first time that the political mutilation of Byzantine prisoners was utilized to signify that the person could no longer hold political power. After this, nothing is known of them, although it is believed that Heraclonas died in 642, likely in Rhodes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "73887", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73887", "title": "Bloody Sunday (1939)", "text": "Massacre in Poland during the 1939 invasion by Nazi Germany\nBloody Sunday (; ) was a sequence of violent events that took place in Bydgoszcz (), a Polish city with a sizable German minority, between 3 and 4 September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland.\nStanding in the path of the German army's advance during the early days of the invasion, tensions quickly escalated in Bydgoszcz between the city's sizable German-speaking minority and its Polish majority. On 3 September, as the Wehrmacht was preparing to assault the city, members of the German minority working in conjunction with the German intelligence agency (Abwehr) attacked the Polish garrison. Polish soldiers and civilians reacted with violent reprisals against ethnic Germans, who in turn reacted with more violence. A Polish investigation concluded in 2004 that approximately 40\u201350 Poles and between 100 and 300 Germans were killed. \nThe term \"Bloody Sunday\" was applied to the events by Nazi propaganda officials, who highlighted and exaggerated German casualties. An instruction issued to the press said, \"... must show news on the barbarism of Poles against Germans in Bromberg. The expression 'Bloody Sunday' must enter as a permanent term in the dictionary and circumnavigate the globe. For that reason, this term must be continuously underlined.\"\nApproximately 200\u2013400 Polish hostages were shot in a mass execution in the aftermath of the fall of the city on 5 September. Additionally, fifty Polish prisoners of war from Bydgoszcz were accused by Nazi summary courts of taking part in \"Bloody Sunday\" and shot. The reprisals compounded violence stemming from the German attempts to pacify the city, and the premeditated murder of notable Poles as part of Operation Tannenberg. As part of the latter, the Germans murdered 1,200\u20133,000 Polish civilians in Bydgoszcz, in a part of the city that became known as the Valley of Death.\nBackground.\nBydgoszcz (Bromberg) was part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland. As a part of Prussia, the city was affected by the unification of Germany in 1871 and became part of the German Empire. It would remain a part of the German Empire until the end of World War I. In February 1920, the Treaty of Versailles awarded the city and the surrounding region to the Second Polish Republic (the administrative region of Pomeranian Voivodeship). This resulted in a number of ethnic Germans leaving the region for Germany. Over the interwar period, the German population decreased even further.\nThe emergence of the Nazi Party in Germany had an important impact on the city. Adolf Hitler revitalized the V\u00f6lkisch movement, making an appeal to the German minority living outside of Germany's post-World War I borders and recruiting its members for Nazi intelligence. It was Hitler's explicit goal to create a Greater German State by annexing territories of other countries inhabited by German minorities. By March 1939, these ambitions, charges of atrocities on both sides of the German-Polish border, distrust, and rising nationalist sentiment in Nazi Germany led to the complete deterioration of Polish-German relations. Hitler's demands for the Polish inhabited Polish Corridor and Polish resistance to Nazi annexation fueled ethnic tensions. For months prior to the 1939 German invasion of Poland, German newspapers and politicians like Adolf Hitler had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland.\nAfter armed conflict erupted on 1 September 1939, ethnic Germans living in Poland were in many places subjected to attacks, and the Polish government arrested ten to fifteen thousand on suspicion of being loyal to Germany, marching them toward the east of the country. Eventually, around 2000 ethnic Germans died in such actions. Nazi propagandists used these incidents to claim that the invasion was justified, and the events in Bydgoszcz became emblematic of this.\nThe incident.\nBeginning with the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September, fighting broke out in Bydgoszcz between Polish troops and ethnic Germans in the city, many of whom were later revealed to belonged to clandestine groups organized by the Nazi party. As the Wehrmacht's Fourth Army prepared to storm the city of Bydgoszcz on 3 September, the violence intensified, resulting in the deaths of up to 300 ethnic Germans and 40 to 50 Poles. Sources differ on the circumstances of the killings, but it is apparent that at least some were killed in an anti-German pogrom.\nThe killings were incited by fifth column attacks by ethnic German partisans against the Polish garrison. According to historian Jochen B\u00f6hler, recently unearthed German documents confirm that the violence was sparked when Polish soldiers were attacked by agents of the Nazi intelligence organization Abwehr recruited from among the city's German minority.\nBeginning in early September, the Abwehr reported in documents prepared by general Erwin von Lahousen that German armed saboteurs conducting operations behind the front line in Bydgoszcz suffered heavy losses. Their operations coordinated by Abwehr residents in Bydgoszcz-Grischner are documented in operational reports and plans in Abwehr archives. Among the tasks allocated to armed saboteur groups documented in German archives were: blowing up the main office of the German organization Deutsche Vereinigung, the passport office Deutsche\nPa\u00dfstelle, the German private school, and setting fire to the German theater and offices of the Jungdeutsche Partei. These operations are documented as coordinated and organized by Schutzstaffel SS.\nAdditionally a special Abwehr sabotage group was located in Bydgoszcz according to German records from Abwehr Breslau department, called Sabotage-Organisationen Gruppe 12 whose task was to disable a local power-plant and cut phone communications between Inowroc\u0142aw and Toru\u0144.\nBesides these sabotage groups in Bydgoszcz, the Abwehr also recorded in its documents paramilitary groups that were formed in the city. According to German records stored in Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv in Freiburg they counted 150 members in Kampf-Organisation under leadership of a local German named Kleiss and were part of a larger military formation coordinated from Poznan which altogether had 2,077 members. In addition to this group a 10-member combat unit under command of a German named Otto Meister was also formed in Bydgoszcz and received orders from Wroc\u0142aw local office of Abwehr. By the end of August just before the invasion took place Polish police conducted several arrests during which they found explosives, armbands and guns.\nDuring the night between 2 and 3 September a number of German saboteurs dressed up in Polish uniforms woke up inhabitants of two districts in Bydgoszcz telling them to run as Poland has been defeated, and as a result a significant number of civilians panicked and started fleeing the city. The chaotic flight disrupted and restricted movements of the Polish military on the roads.\nBy the morning of 3 September a certain few Germans who were in good relationship with their Polish neighbors started warning them to hide as \"something bad will happen in the city\", offering them shelter under the condition that they must hide by 10 AM, but stated they could not disclose details on what would take place.\nAs a contingent of the Polish Army (Army Pomorze's 9th, 15th, and 27th Infantry Division) was withdrawing through Bydgoszcz it was attacked by German irregulars from within the city. According to a British witness, a retreating Polish artillery unit was shot at by Germans from within a house; the Poles returned fire and were subsequently shot at from a Jesuit church. In the ensuing fight both sides suffered some casualties; captured German nonuniformed armed insurgents were executed on the spot and some mob lynching was also reported. A Polish investigation concluded in 2004 that Polish troops had been shot at by members of the German minority and German military intelligence (Abwehr) agents; around 40\u201350 Poles and between 100 and 300 Germans were killed.\nThe German forces which entered the city also encountered resistance from members of the paramilitary Citizen Watch (\"Stra\u017c Obywatelska\"), particularly in the Szwederowo neighborhood, which was predominantly inhabited by working-class individuals. The Citizen Watch in Bydgoszcz relinquished its weapons after receiving assurances from General Eccard von Gablenz, commander of the \"Kampgruppe \"Netze\"\", that its members would be treated in accordance with international law as POWs.\nGerman propaganda.\nGoebbels' Propaganda Ministry heavily exploited the events to try to gain support in Germany for the invasion. As British historian Ian Kershaw wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For German propaganda, the attacks on ethnic Germans were exploited as an apparent justification for a policy of 'ethnic cleansing' that had surpassed in its first days anything that could be regarded as retaliation. The Germans claimed in November 1939 5,400 had been killed in the 'September Murders' (including what they dubbed the 'Bromberg Bloody Sunday'). Then, in February 1940, on Hitler's own instructions (it was later claimed) this was simply multiplied by around ten-fold and a figure of 58,000 German dead invented. The most reliable estimates put the total number of ethnic Germans killed in outrages, forced marches, bombing and shelling at around 4,000. Terrible though these atrocities were, they were more or less spontaneous outbursts of hatred that took place in the context of panic and fear following the German invasion. They did not remotely compare with, let alone provide any justification for, the calculated savagery of the treatment meted out by the German masters, directed at wiping out anything other than a slave existence for the Polish people.\nHitler's secret decree of 4 October 1939 stated that all crimes committed by the Germans between 1 September 1939 and 4 October 1939 were not to be prosecuted.\nThe Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau investigation in 1939\u20131940 claimed that the events were a result of panic and confusion among the Polish troops. The Wehrmacht investigation included the interrogation of captive Polish soldiers, ethnic Germans from Bydgoszcz and surrounding villages, and Polish civilians. The bodies of the victims were exhumed and the cause of death and the possible involvement of military rifles was assessed.\nGerman reprisals and atrocities.\nThe events were followed by German reprisals and mass executions of Polish civilians. In an act of retaliation for Bloody Sunday, a number of Polish civilians were executed by German military units of the Einsatzgruppen, Waffen SS, and Wehrmacht. According to German historian Christian Raitz von Frentz, 876 Poles were tried by German tribunal for involvement in the events of Bloody Sunday before the end of 1939. 87 men and 13 women were sentenced without the right to appeal. Polish historian Czes\u0142aw Madajczyk notes 120 executions in relation to Bloody Sunday, and the execution of 20 hostages after a German soldier was allegedly attacked by a Polish sniper.\nThe assurances issued to the Citizen Watch which surrendered after being promised that they were to be treated in accordance with international law as POWs were not upheld by the Germans. The captured Citizen Watch members were handed over by the Wehrmacht to members of Einsatzgruppe IV. Approximately 40 prisoners were subjected to fatal beatings by SS men using metal rods. The remaining POWs, which included the leaders of the Citizen Watch, Konrad Fiedler and Marian Maczuga, were executed by gunfire in the Bielawki neighborhood of Bydgoszcz.\nAdditionally, in the Boryszew massacre fifty Polish prisoners of war from Bydgoszcz were accused by Nazi summary courts for taking part in \"Bloody Sunday\" and shot. \nAccording to a German version, Polish snipers attacked German troops in Bydgoszcz for several days (Polish sources and witnesses do not confirm this). The German governor, General Walter Braemer, (the commander of the rear army area), ordered the execution of 80 Polish hostages over the next few days. By September 8, between 200 and 400 Polish civilians had been killed. According to Richard Rhodes, a number of Boy Scouts were set up in the marketplace against a wall and shot; a devoted priest who rushed to administer the last sacrament was shot too, receiving five wounds. Murders continued all week; 34 of the leading tradespeople and merchants of the town were shot, as well as many other leading citizens.\nMany Poles, particularly members of the intelligentsia and the Jews, were singled out for deportation, or killed outright. By December 1939 the Germans killed 5,000 Polish civilians from the Bydgoszcz County (about a third from Bydgoszcz itself). These victims included the mayor of Bydgoszcz, Leon Barciszewski Many of those killings took place in a part of the city that became known as the Valley of Death. More broadly, they were also related to the wider Operation Tannenberg, a large scale anti-Polish extermination actions. More than 20,000 Polish citizens of Bydgoszcz (14% of the population) were either shot or died in concentration camps during the occupation.\nThe debate in scholarship.\nThe exact number of victims of Bloody Sunday is disputed. Peter Aurich (a pseudonym of the German journalist Peter Nasarski) put the number of German civilian deaths in Bydgoszcz at 366, while Hugo Rasmus estimates it as at least 415. Two Polish historians, W\u0142odzimierz Jastrz\u0119bski and Czes\u0142aw Madajczyk, estimate ethnic German deaths at 103 (Jastrz\u0119bski), and about 300 (150 on September 3, the rest in the days after). The Polish historians point out that since these losses occurred during actual combat, most of the civilian losses should be attributed to accidents common in urban combat conditions; they argue that civilian losses might have occurred when the town was attacked by the German air force (Luftwaffe). Strafing of civilians in the town by the Luftwaffe is confirmed by German witnesses. Nazi propaganda reinforced Polish perceptions of the German minority as hostile, and during the invasion reported that the German minority was aiding the forces. This contributed to Polish misconceptions, as the Poles were expecting the German minority to be actively hostile.\nAn even bigger debate in the scholarship concerned the question whether\u2014as the Polish historiography suggests\u2014there were indeed any members of a German fifth column in the city who opened fire on the Polish troops (and if so, whether they were composed of members of the Bydgoszcz German minority or not), or whether\u2014as critics among the German historiography argue\u2014Polish troops (or panicking civilians) overreacted in the confusion and targeted innocent German civilians. This debate has been resolved by investigation of German archives, which confirmed existence of several diversion and saboteur groups in Bydgoszcz overseen by intelligence organizations by Nazi Germany. Among the Germans killed in the fighting historians identified Otto Niefeldt who was an Abwehr agent from Szczecin.\nThe account of Peter Nasarski alias Aurich has been called by Harry Gordon one of the most thorough German accounts; his work is however generally rejected in Poland, perhaps because he indiscriminately used witness statements collected by Nazi officials. According to Nasarski, after police forces retreated from Bydgoszcz, agitated Polish civilians accused many Germans of assaulting Polish soldiers and executed them and any Poles who stood up in their defence. Rasmus attributes the situation to confusion and the disorganised state of the Polish forces in the city.\nVon Frentz wrote that \"In Bydgoszcz, the event was probably caused by confusion among the rapidly retreating soldiers, a general breakdown in public order and panic among the Polish majority after two German air raids and the discovery of a small reconnaissance group of the German Army on the previous day.\" He quotes Nazi German reports about the civilian victims and atrocities, later corroborated by a Red Cross commission that the Nazis invited to the scene. Von Frentz also noted that eyewitness accounts of atrocities committed against the German population are as unreliable as Polish accounts of the fifth columnists. While authors like Blanke write that no ethnic Germans are known to have spoken of participation in that event, by 2007 Nazi documents were uncovered confirming that assistance, supplies and aid were given to both German saboteurs and their families. In the post-war collaboration trials, no ethnic German was charged in relation to Bloody Sunday. Another counterargument that was made to the fifth column theory is that Polish troops were being targeted by advance units of the German regular army (Heer), or that the shots were fired by Polish soldiers in the confusion of the mass withdrawal. Von Frentz claims that Polish troops and civilians massacred German civilians due to confusion.\nPolish historians, such as Madajczyk, Jastrz\u0119bski, Karol Marian Pospieszalski and Ryszard Wojan claim that the killings were triggered when the ethnic Germans, dressed as civilians, opened fire on the Polish troops (Jastrzebski later changed his views after starting to work with German expellee organizations). The Poles retaliated, killing many and executing prisoners afterwards. Polish historians Pospieszalski and Janusz Kutta point to a Nazi top secret false flag Operation Himmler (which took place on August 31\u00a0\u2013 September 1) and was designed to create an illusion of Polish aggression against Germany. Thus it is argued that actions like the Gleiwitz incident and events in Bydgoszcz were all part of a larger Nazi plan to discredit the Poles. Pospieszalski and Wojan argue that the German fifth column agents (or their higher-ups) might have been deliberately aiming to produce a situation likely to result in German civilian casualties as a way to fuel Nazi propaganda. This argument has been criticized: Harry Gordon questions whether the Germans were willing to sacrifice their citizens for propaganda gains.\nRecent discussion.\nThe modern consensus among Polish historians is that the events constituted an attack on the Polish population and military by German militia.\nIn 2004, historian Tomasz Chinci\u0144ski in a publication of Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) summarized recent research related to Bloody Sunday, confirming that the majority of historians agree that an \"insurrection\" by agents who had arrived from the Third Reich as well as some German inhabitants of Bydgoszcz took place. He has published a work detailing new evidence of German diversionary activity in September 1939 in Poland. There are numerous Polish eyewitness accounts of action of a German fifth column which included members of local minority; Pospieszalski cited multiple witnesses for at least 46 cases of German civilians opening fire on Polish troops. There are numerous Polish Army reports and German documents confirming the saboteur actions of armed German Poles in other cities. According to German historians, any members of the fifth column, if present in the city, were infiltrators from Germany, not natives of Bydgoszcz. Eyewitness accounts have been criticised by Richard Blanke. In 2004, Chinci\u0144ski discussed previously unpublished reports of Polish Army Pomorze, which reported \"a large scale diversion\" in Bydgoszcz on September 3 and numerous smaller incidents in surrounding area around that time.\nA number of Polish and German historians discussed the problem on September 4, 2006, at the German Historical Institute in Warsaw. Chinci\u0144ski discussed newly discovered documents of the Abwehr that show that there were indeed plans for fifth column and diversion activities in Bydgoszcz; several paramilitary groups were organized by Germany in the city, he discussed the bias of the Polish communist era historiography, which minimized cases of Polish mob lynching of ethnic Germans, which did occur in Bydgoszcz. German historian Hans-Erich Volkmann noted problems with German historiography, outlining some of the unreliability inherent in early post-war studies, which were still significantly affected by the Nazi era, and that the Bydgoszcz events were and still are used for political purposes. By 2007 after several years of studying German archives, documents were uncovered in which General Erwin Lahousen praised action of German saboteurs in Bydgoszcz and organized delivery of supplies and medical help to them. German historian Jochen B\u00f6hler, in his publication about the invasion of Poland, published in 2006, wrote that new documents uncovered from the German archives proved that Polish soldiers were attacked by Abwehr agents and members of the German minority.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is no archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in the ancient Americas.\nReformed Egyptian and the Book of Mormon.\nThe Book of Mormon uses the term \"reformed Egyptian\" in which says that \"the characters which are called among us the reformed Egyptian, [were] handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech\" and that \"none other people knoweth our language\" (). The book also says that its first author, Nephi, used the \"learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians\" () to write his record which constitutes the first two books of the Book of Mormon. The abridgment that the Book of Mormon says was prepared by Mormon and Moroni nearly a thousand years later in approximately 380 AD, containing most of the balance of the book, was said to have been written in \"reformed Egyptian\" because it supposedly took up less space than Hebrew.\nLatter-day Saint apologists contend that \"reformed Egyptian\" is a form of Egyptian writing similar to other modified Egyptian scripts such as hieratic, a handwritten form of hieroglyphics thousands of years old by the first millennium BC, or early Demotic, a simplified derivative of hieratic, which was used in northern Egypt.\nAccording to believers, Smith translated reformed Egyptian characters engraved on gold plates into English through various means, including the use of a seer stone or the interpreter stones, or both. Smith said when he had finished the translation, he returned the plates to the angel Moroni and as such they were unavailable for study, meaning all examples of the script are due solely to Smith and his associates' transcriptions.\nThe \"Anthon Transcript\".\nThe \"Anthon Transcript\" is a piece of paper on which Joseph Smith said he transcribed reformed Egyptian characters from the golden plates\u2014the ancient record from which Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon. A manuscript known as the \"Caractors\" document was previously thought to be this transcript. However, handwriting analysis suggests the document was most likely written by John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses. This handwriting analysis casts doubt on the idea that \"Caractors\" document was the Anthon Transcript because John Whitmer was not affiliated with the Church until June 1829, while the Anthon Transcript was taken to New York in the winter of 1828.\nSmith said that when this sample was presented by Smith's colleague Martin Harris to Columbia College professor Charles Anthon, a noted classical scholar, that Anthon had attested to the characters' authenticity in writing but had then ripped up his certification after hearing that the plates had been revealed by an angel. Anthon wrote, to the contrary, that he had believed from the first that Harris was the victim of fraud.\nIn 1844, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints published a broadside about the Book of Mormon called \"The Stick of Joseph\" that reprinted some \"reformed Egyptian\" characters that resemble those on the first three lines of the \"Caractors\" document. The broadside said that the characters were those that had been shown to Anthon. However, it is unlikely that the characters on the broadside came directly from the \"Caractors\" document because Whitmer was excommunicated in 1838 and took his papers with him.\nScholarly view of reformed Egyptian.\nStandard language reference works contain no reference to \"reformed Egyptian\" and it is described with this term only in the Book of Mormon. No non-Mormon scholars acknowledge the existence of either a \"reformed Egyptian\" language or a \"reformed Egyptian\" script as it has been described in Mormon belief. For instance, in 1966, John A. Wilson, professor of Egyptology at the University of Chicago, wrote, \"From time to time there are allegations that picture writing has been found in America[...] In no case has a professional Egyptologist been able to recognize these characters as Egyptian hieroglyphs. From our standpoint there is no such language as 'reformed Egyptian'.\" Anthropologist Michael D. Coe of Yale University, an expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican studies, wrote, \"Of all the peoples of the pre-Columbian New World, only the ancient Maya had a complete script.\" Fifteen examples of distinct writing systems have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] and no non-Mormon linguists have recognized any direct contact between New World and Old World languages.\u2014\u200a\nMormon studies of reformed Egyptian.\nSince no outside evidence exists, Mormon studies of reformed Egyptian are limited to whatever linguistic evidence can be obtained from the text of the Book of Mormon plus the extant seven-line \"Caractors\" document believed by some to be the symbols copied from the gold plates. Four Mormon non-linguist translators with varying levels of education have attempted to decipher the \"Caractors\" document. According to Brigham Young University Egyptologist John Gee, \"the corpus is not large enough to render decipherment feasible.\"\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is considered one of the earliest ethnographic documentary films. In 1997, \"Grass\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nProduction.\nThe film was directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with intertitles by Richard Carver and Terry Ramsaye. It was the first film produced by the team of Cooper and Schoedsack, who went on to produce \"King Kong\" and many other films. Cooper was a writer performing research for the American Geographical Society and Schoedsack was a cameraman.\nReporter and former spy Marguerite Harrison was an instrumental member of the production team. Harrison had met Cooper at a ball in Warsaw, and she provided him with food, books and blankets when he was taken prisoner by the Russians in 1920 and sent to work in a prison camp. Harrison also appears in the film as herself. Years later, Schoedsack commented that Harrison had not done \"a damn thing\" during the expedition.\nFunding was provided by a loan of $5,000 from Cooper's father and brother, and Harrison contributed an additional $5,000.\nIn filming the journey, Cooper, Schoedsack, and Harrison became the first Westerners to make the migration with the Bakhtiari. The only previous ethnographic documentary was Robert Flaherty's \"Nanook of the North\" (1922). According to Cooper, the filmmakers were unaware of \"Nanook\" until their return to New York City from filming in Persia.\nSummary.\nThe film's producers were mainly concerned with documenting a way of life that was unknown to all those outside the Bakhtiari realm. The film highlights the extreme hardships faced by nomadic peoples, as well as the bravery and ingenuity of the Bakhtiari on their migration in search of grass, which meant abundant seasonal pasture for their animals.\n\"Grass\" documents the caravan route from Angora (modern-day Ankara, Turkey) to the Bakhtiari lands in Persia (western Iran in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province and the eastern part of Khuzestan). The film then follows Haidar Khan as he leads 50,000 of his people and countless animals on a harrowing trek across the Karun River and over Zard Kuh, a subrange of the Zagros Mountains.\nReception.\nIn a contemporary review for \"The New York Times,\" critic Mordaunt Hall wrote: \"It is an unusual and remarkable film offering, one that is instructive and compelling but in no way a story. There is drama interspersed with captivating comedy, and the audience last night applauded some of the wonderful photographic sequences and at other times they were moved to laughter by the antics of the animals.\"\nThe film was first shown at The Explorers Club annual dinner held at the Hotel McAlpin in New York City on January 24, 1925, along with a lecture by Cooper. The \"Explorers Journal\" reported: \"It is Mr. Cooper's happy achievement to have portrayed poignantly and comprehensively the drama of a people in their primitive struggle with inexorable forces of nature. The pictures were a fitting climax to an evening of thrilling entertainment.\"\"Grass\" was later purchased for distribution by Paramount Pictures. Its theatrical debut took place at the Criterion Theatre in New York on March 30, 1925.\nPlanned remake.\nIn 1947, Merian C. Cooper sought to remake \"Grass,\" which he called a \"damned half picture,\" and he said: \"One man and one woman, and their children, will exemplify for the audience the whole of this struggle for survival which breeds a race that is proud and strong, rugged individuals all, meeting bravely the moods of natural forces seemingly bent upon their destruction.\" Ernest B. Schoedsack told him to forget the idea because his Persian friends had informed him that a rail line now ran through the country, and much of the Bakhtiari's trek was now performed using cars and trucks.\nReissue.\n\"Grass\" was reissued theatrically in the early 1990s. Rights to \"Grass\" had been donated to the Museum of Modern Art, and Milestone Film and Video obtained the rights in 1990. Dennis Doros of Milestone said:\nOut of the one hundred and fifty to two hundred films we've done, \"Grass\" and \"\" are among the ones I am most proud of distributing. \"Chang\" is a national treasure in Thailand. \"Grass\" has images of race and culture that don't exist anymore, it's been called the greatest migration in modern history, and I agree. The journey of the Bakhtiari is so astonishing, the power of those images is like a dream, the way they're constantly moving and climbing.\n\"Grass\" has been issued in videocassette and DVD format. It is also available for streaming on the Criterion Channel.\nIn 2009, author Bahman Maghsoudlou published a book titled \"Grass: Untold Stories\" that includes background information and historical references related to the making of the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the seat of Nipissing District and takes its name from its position on the shore of Lake Nipissing. It developed as a railroad centre and its airport was an important military location during the Cold War.\nHistory.\nThe site of North Bay is part of a historic canoe route where Samuel de Champlain took a party up the Ottawa River, through present-day Mattawa, on to Trout Lake and via the La Vase Creek to Lake Nipissing.\nApart from Indigenous people, voyageurs and surveyors, there was little activity in the Lake Nipissing area until the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1882.\nThat was the point where the Canada Central Railway (CCR) extension ended. The CCR was owned by Duncan McIntyre who amalgamated it with the CPR and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivi\u00e8res, and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers. It then proceeded cross-country toward its final destination, Bonfield. Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CCR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year until he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson, who staked out future North Bay after getting assurance from his uncle and Worthington that it would be the divisional headquarters and a location of some importance.\nIn 1882, John Ferguson decided that the north bay of Lake Nipissing was a promising spot for settlement. North Bay was incorporated as a town in 1891. The first mayor was John Bourke. More importantly, Bourke developed the western portion of North Bay after purchasing the interest of the Murray Brothers from Pembroke, who were large landholders in the new community. The land west of Klock Avenue (Algonquin Avenue) was known as the Murray block. Bourke Street is named after John Bourke. Murray Street is named after the Murrays.\nNorth Bay was selected as the southern terminus of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (T&amp;NO) in 1902, when the Ross government took the bold move to establish a development road to serve the Haileybury settlement. During construction of the T&amp;NO, silver was discovered at Cobalt and started a mining frenzy in the northern part of the province that continued for many years. The Canadian Northern Railway was subsequently built to North Bay in 1913.\nIn July 1894, an Act to Charter the Montreal, Ottawa and Georgian Bay Canal passed without a ripple of concern in North Bay. The Georgian Bay Canal was a mammoth transportation system that proposed to connect the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The entire passageway from the Ottawa River to Lake Nipissing and down the French River to Georgian Bay was surveyed in the first decade of the 20th century. Financing was a large obstacle and, as time passed, transportation patterns changed and interfered with the earlier practicality of the giant venture. Despite this, there were groups who still hoped it would happen as late as 1930.\nNorth Bay grew through a strong lumbering sector, mining and the three railways in the early days. The town benefited from strong community leadership and people like Richardson, Milne, McNamara, Englands, Browning, McDougal, Carruthers, McGaughey, George W. Lee, Senator Gordon, T. J. Patton, Charlie Harrison and many others are responsible for its development. In 1919, John Ferguson was elected mayor of North Bay and continued to serve as mayor until 1922. North Bay was incorporated as a city in August 1925.\nThe Dionne Quintuplets were born in Corbeil, Ontario, on the southern outskirts of North Bay in 1934. Their births had a tremendous impact on tourism in the area. For a province struggling against economic strangulation they were as valuable a resource as gold, nickel, pulpwood or hydro power. They saved an entire region from bankruptcy. They launched Northern Ontario's flourishing tourist industry. At their peak they represented a $500 million asset. North Bay and the surrounding area lived off this legacy well into the 1960s. Many visitors to the area discovered lakes and summer retreats that were easily accessible, and the businesses thrived on the tourist dollars.\nIn January 1968, the City of North Bay amalgamated with West Ferris and Widdifield townships.\nIn 1951, as a result of rising tensions in the Cold War, the Royal Canadian Air Force established an air base at North Bay, part of an expanding national air defence network to counter the threat of nuclear attack against North America by Soviet bombers. Construction of RCAF Station North Bay (in 1966 retitled \"Canadian Forces Base North Bay\" and in 1993 as \"22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay\") took three years, during which it became the largest industry in the community: a status it held for more than four decades. In October 1963, the North American Air Defence Command (NORAD) opened its Canadian operations centre at the base. Staffed by American as well as Canadian military personnel, the centre, situated 60 storeys underground to withstand a nuclear strike, monitored Canada's northern, east-central and Atlantic airspace, identifying and tracking all air traffic in this airspace, and responding to airborne emergencies, crime, and suspicious, unknown and potentially hostile aircraft. In 1983 this responsibility was expanded to all of Canada, and in October 2006 the base's NORAD operations (as of 1981, called North American Aerospace Defence Command) moved into a new, state-of-the-art facility above ground, where it continues to provide surveillance, identification and tracking of aircraft, and warning and response to emergencies, attacks and other crises, for the air sovereignty of Canada and North America. In summer of 2013, the base commenced surveillance of space via SAPPHIRE, Canada's first military satellite, that was launched into orbit from India in February.\nBeginning in the 1990s, the base weathered a series of massive cuts by the federal government, and at one point was earmarked to close. Subsequently, a large portion of its infrastructure, including all of its airfield assets, such as hangars, fuel depot and control tower, were sold or demolished. By the 21st century, the base was no longer the city's top industry.\nOne by-product of the air base's creation in 1951 was the extension of the existing airport's runways to handle the largest military aircraft. The long runways at North Bay have been maintained as an alternate landing site for Toronto's Pearson International Airport and were used during the September 11 crisis as an emergency landing site for several international aircraft. It was also a designated emergency field for NASA's Space Transportation System, better known as the Space Shuttle.\nOn March 17, 2007, North Bay was announced as the winner of 2007 Kraft Hockeyville contest. North Bay received $50,000 to upgrade their local arena, Memorial Gardens, and also hosted an NHL pre-season game between the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Thrashers.\nGeography.\nNorth Bay is located approximately north of Toronto, and differs in geography from Southern Ontario in that North Bay is situated on the Canadian Shield. This gives rise to a different and more rugged landscape.\nNorth Bay is geographically unique in that it straddles both the Ottawa River watershed to the east and the Great Lakes Basin to the west. The city's urban core is located between Lake Nipissing and the smaller Trout Lake.\nNorth Bay, critically situated at the junctions of Highway 11 and Highway 17, remains a major transportation centre for Northern Ontario. It is the southern terminus of the Ontario Northland Railway, and is served by the Jack Garland Airport.\nThe area of North Bay contains a number of ancient volcanic pipes, including the Manitou Islands and Callander Bay and many exposed dykes and five named batholiths (Timber Lake, Mulock, West Arm, Powassan and Bonfield).\nNeighbourhoods.\nThe city includes the neighbourhoods of:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nThe climate in North Bay is common to most places in Northern Ontario. North Bay tends to be a less humid climate than that found in Southern Ontario due somewhat to the distance from the Great Lakes and less warm than some other locations in Northern Ontario due to cooling from Lake Nipissing. On May 31, 2002, a tornado caused minor damage near the city. Two more tornadoes touched down on Lake Nipissing on August 20, 2009. This storm was a part of a chain of tornadoes that caused large amounts of damage in other parts of Ontario. The weather box below shows climate normals for the airport, at an elevation of 358\u00a0m, but the majority of the city, including the downtown core, sits at an elevation of 201\u00a0m.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in North Bay was on 1 July 1931. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 26 January 1892.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, North Bay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.\nIn 2021, 11.7% of the population was Indigenous, compared to 5.0% nationally. 4.4% of residents were visible minorities compared to 26.5% nationally. The remaining 83.9% of the population was white/European. The largest visible minority groups in North Bay were South Asian (1.4%), Black (1.1%), and Chinese (0.5%).\nIn 2021, 81.1% of the population spoke English as their mother tongue. French was the first language of 11.3% of residents, compared to 3.3% in all of Ontario. In terms of non-official languages, the most common were Italian (0.6%), Chinese languages (0.3%), German (0.3%), and Spanish (0.3%). 2.2% of residents listed both English and French as mother tongues, while 0.7% listed both English and a non-official language.\n56.3% of residents were Christian, down from 73.2% in 2011. 35.2% were Catholic, 13.2% were Protestant, 4.1% were Christian n.o.s and 3.8% belonged to other Christian denominations and Christian-related traditions. 41.6% of the population were non-religious or secular, up from 25.4% in 2011. All other religions made up 2.0% of the population. The largest non-Christian religion was Hinduism (0.5%).\nNorth Bay census agglomeration population was 71,736 as of 2021, with a land area of .\nEconomy.\nNorth Bay is more economically diverse than many other Northern Ontario communities, although a large percentage of the city's jobs are public sector in nature with health, education and government dominating the list of the city's top employers.\nNorth Bay is the home of Nipissing University, founded in 1992 (previous name North Bay Normal School 1909\u20131953, North Bay Teachers College 1953\u20131973, Nipissing University affiliated to Laurentian University 1973\u20131992, independent public university separated from Laurentian University in 1992), and of Canadore College, founded in 1967. Approximately 10,000 full-time students (and thousands more part-time students) are enrolled at the two post-secondary institutions, which share a campus in the northwest end of the city.\nBetween the early 1950s and 1990s, 22 Wing/Canadian Forces Base North Bay was the community's leading industry. The cuts to the base by the federal government mentioned above, plus dramatic reductions in the number of its personnel \u2014 at one time, there were 2,200 military members and civilian employees; in 2013, about 750 remained \u2014 has resulted in a loss of tens of millions of dollars to the community, an impact felt by all North Bay's business sectors.\nNorth Bay is also home to The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers), A Coy, a Canadian Force Army Reserve unit. B Coy of The Algonquin Regiment (Northern Pioneers) is located in Timmins.\nThe service industry, tourism, and transportation also play a significant role in the city's economy, as well as primary industry companies. It is estimated that North Bay has more than 65 companies that offer mining supplies and services, employing almost 3,000 residents.\nArts and culture.\nIn recent years, the city's cultural scene has expanded due to its community of artists, musicians, actors and writers. In 2004, the TVOntario program \"Studio 2\" named North Bay as one of the top three most artistically talented communities in the province.\nFilm and television.\nThe city has hosted film productions. In 1942, \"Captains of the Clouds\" was filmed in North Bay at the height of the Second World War. The film starred James Cagney as a Canadian bush pilot and also featured an appearance of famed fighter pilot Billy Bishop. The city has continued to host film productions, including the 2013 horror film \"The Colony\" starring Laurence Fishburne and Bill Paxton, and the drama \"Still Mine\", featuring James Cromwell in an award-winning role. Another film production that occurred in North Bay was the 2014 thriller film \"Backcountry\".\nIn August 2009, the comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall began filming their mini-series \"Death Comes to Town\" on location in North Bay. More recently, the city hosted production of the third season of \"Hard Rock Medical\".\nThe city is fictionalised as \"Algonquin Bay\" in the mystery novels of North Bay native Giles Blunt, beginning with \"Forty Words for Sorrow\". The television series adaptation \"Cardinal\" was filmed in both North Bay and Sudbury in 2016.\nIn 2017, the crime drama series \"Carter\" was filmed in the city.\nIn 2021, the reality series \"Call Me Mother\" was filmed in North Bay.\nIn 2022, North Star Studios announced the acquisition of a building in the West Ferris Industrial Park, which will provide 68,000 square feet of film and television studio space.\nAttractions.\nNorth Bay has many areas available for recreation and leisure, including over 72 sports fields and parks, a marina on Lake Nipissing that holds 270 boats, a plethora of trails and 42 beach access points on both Lake Nipissing and Trout Lake.\nRecreation and leisure services:\nWaterfront development.\nIn the 1980s a mile-long waterfront park/promenade was developed along the Lake Nipissing shoreline adjacent to the downtown core. Eventually, such attractions as a mini-train ride and two antique carousels (largely crafted by local artisans) were installed and quickly became very popular with tourists and locals alike. Now, work is beginning on a large new multi-faceted community park that will be developed on the former Canadian Pacific Railway yards that separated the downtown core from the existing waterfront park. In August 2009, a new pedestrian underpass opened connecting the downtown core to the waterfront for the first time since the CPR laid down tracks. In 2019 the city constructed a multi-phase community space centering on a Splash Pad behind the CPR museum.\nSports.\nLocal teams:\nKraft Hockeyville 2007.\nNorth Bay was crowned the winner of the Kraft Hockeyville competition in 2007. The New York Islanders and Atlanta Thrashers played an exhibition game at Memorial Gardens to a near-capacity crowd.\nNorth Bay Battalion.\nThe North Bay Battalion is a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League based in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. The franchise was founded as the Brampton Battalion on December 3, 1996, and began play in 1998. Due to consistently poor attendance, the team relocated to North Bay before the 2013\u201314 OHL season.\nNipissing Lakers Hockey.\nThe Nipissing Lakers are North Bay's newest hockey team. The Lakers are the 19th member of the Ontario University Athletics' Men's Hockey League (founded in 2009 in a partnership with Nipissing University and private investors). The Lakers play in historic Memorial Gardens (circa 1955) and share the building with the North Bay Trappers. Like their Northern Ontario counterparts in Thunder Bay (the Lakehead Thunderwolves), the Lakers attract an impressive number of local hockey supporters for their games in the OUA.\nNorth Bay Trappers Junior \"A\".\nThe North Bay Trappers (formerly the North Bay Skyhawks) were relocated from Sturgeon Falls in 2002 (following the departure of the OHL's North Bay Centennials to Saginaw, Michigan). The Trappers are members of the 8 team NOJHL Junior \"A\" circuit (Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League). The Skyhawks/Trappers franchise has won 3 NOJHL championship titles (2002\u201303, 2003\u201304 &amp; 2004\u201305). In April 2014 the Trappers were sold to become the Mattawa Blackhawks\nNorth Bay Bulldogs.\nThe North Bay Bulldogs compete in the nine-team, Ontario-based NFC (Northern Football Conference). The Bulldogs were relocated from Brampton in 1991 to the Gateway City.\nThe North Bay Bulldogs were welcomed into the Ontario Varsity Football League while losing all eight games (0\u20138) in their 2013 inaugural season.\nTransportation.\nNorth Bay is located at the easternmost junction of Highway 11 and Highway 17, which are both segments of the Trans-Canada Highway. The two highways share a single route through the city core, between Algonquin Avenue and an interchange at Twin Lakes, along an urban limited-access road with reduced but not fully controlled access. Major arterial streets intersect directly with the highway, while minor streets end at a network of service roads connecting them to the arterials. At Algonquin Avenue, Highway 17 continues westward to Sturgeon Falls and Sudbury, while Highway 11 heads north toward Temiskaming Shores. At the eastern interchange, Highway 17 heads eastward toward Mattawa, Pembroke and Ottawa, while Highway 11 widens into a freeway and heads southerly toward Barrie and Toronto.\nHighway 11 and Highway 17 both formerly had business spur routes through downtown North Bay, Highway 11B and Highway 17B, although both have been decommissioned by the province and are now designated only as city streets. North Bay is also served by Highway 63, a route which extends northeasterly from the city toward Thorne, where it crosses the Ottawa River and becomes Quebec Route 101.\nDue to the steep incline of Algonquin Avenue/Highway 11 as it enters North Bay from the north on Thibeault Hill, the southbound lanes are equipped with the only runaway truck ramp on Ontario's provincial highway system.\nNorth Bay is served by the North Bay/Jack Garland Airport, which also receives and services military flights on behalf of the adjacent CFB North Bay, is home to Canadore College Aviation Campus, and site of numerous aviation companies, including Voyageur Airways and the Bombardier Aerospace CL-415 water bomber final assembly and flight testing facility.\nIntercity bus service in the city operates from the North Bay railway station on Station Road.\nThe city operates a public transit system, North Bay Transit.\nPolice.\nThe North Bay Police Service was founded in 1882, and is overseen by the North Bay City Council's Police Services Board. In 2018, it had a budget of C$18.6 Million.\nEducation.\nNorth Bay has educational programs ranging from pre-school to university.\nMedia.\nThe local newspaper is the \"North Bay Nugget\", which is published in print form from Tuesday through Saturday.\nBayToday.ca is an online local news source in North Bay, offering news, weather updates, entertainment, sports and business features.\nCKNY-DT is an owned-and-operated television station of CTV. Part of the CTV Northern Ontario subsystem, CKNY functions largely as a rebroadcaster of CICI-TV in Greater Sudbury, although news reporters in North Bay provide content to CTV Northern Ontario's newscasts. In May 2020, its local studio on Oak Street was closed, and its staff was reduced to two reporters and a cameraman/editor, all of whom now working remotely. The local Cogeco Cable system operates a community channel under the YourTV branding, which produces a slate of local newscasts under the \"Cogeco News\" branding.\nIn radio, North Bay effectively acts as a single market with the nearby town of Sturgeon Falls, with virtually all stations in both communities serving the whole region.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Porter\nThe Great Train Robbery is a 1903 American silent Western action film made by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. It follows a gang of outlaws who hold up and rob a steam train at a station in the American West, flee across mountainous terrain, and are finally defeated by a posse of locals. The short film draws on many sources, including a robust existing tradition of Western films, recent European innovations in film technique, the play of the same name by Scott Marble, the popularity of train-themed films, and possibly real-life incidents involving outlaws such as Butch Cassidy.\nPorter supervised and photographed the film in New York and New Jersey in November 1903; the Edison studio began selling it to vaudeville houses and other venues in the following month. The cast included Justus D. Barnes and G. M. Anderson, who may have also helped with planning and staging. Porter's storytelling approach, though not particularly innovative or unusual for 1903, allowed him to include many popular techniques of the time, including scenes staged in wide shots, a matte effect, and an attempt to indicate simultaneous action across multiple scenes. Camera pans, location shooting, and moments of violent action helped give \"The Great Train Robbery\" a sense of rough-edged immediacy. A special close-up shot, which was unconnected to the story and could either begin or end the film depending on the projectionist's whim, showed Barnes, as the outlaw leader, firing his gun directly into the camera.\nDue in part to its popular and accessible subject matter, as well as to its dynamic action and violence, \"The Great Train Robbery\" was an unprecedented commercial success. Though it did not significantly influence or advance the Western film genre upon release, it was widely distributed and copied, including in a parody by Porter himself. During the twentieth century, inaccurate legends about \"The Great Train Robbery\" developed, claiming it was the first Western or even the first film to include a plot. However, its commercial success and mythical status in film history nonetheless remain undisputed; the film has since become one of the greatest and most influential Westerns of all time, appearing in numerous film and television references and homages. In 1990, \"The Great Train Robbery\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nTwo bandits break into a railroad telegraph office, where they force the operator at gunpoint to stop a train and order its engineer to fill the locomotive's tender at the station's water tank. They then knock the operator out and tie him up. It is boarded by the bandits. Two bandits enter an express car and open a box of valuables with dynamite. The others kill the fireman and force the engineer to halt the train and disconnect its locomotive. The bandits then force the passengers off the train and rifle them for their belongings. One passenger tries to escape but is instantly shot down. The bandits escape in the locomotive.\nThe bound operator awakens but collapses again. His daughter arrives and she restores him to consciousness by dousing him with water. There is some comic relief at a dance hall, where an Eastern stranger is forced to dance while the locals fire at his feet. The door suddenly opens and the telegraph operator rushes in to tell them of the robbery. The men quickly form a posse and chase the bandits through the mountains. The posse finally overtakes the bandits and kills them all and recovers the stolen mail.\nA standalone scene titled \"Realism\" presents a medium close-up of the leader of the outlaws, who fires his pistol point-blank directly into the camera.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nIn the years leading up to \"The Great Train Robbery\", the film industry was marked by much innovation and variety. Some studios, such as the Edison Manufacturing Company and the Lumi\u00e8re company, were best known for short sketches and actuality films presented in a straightforward style, often only a single shot long. However, other filmmakers aimed for more elaborate productions; Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's films, such as the 1902 international success \"A Trip to the Moon\", became acclaimed for their visual storytelling, often encompassing multiple scenes and involving careful editing and complicated special effects. Meanwhile, British filmmakers working in and around Brighton, a group later nicknamed the \"Brighton School\", made many innovations in narrative film grammar, developing framing and cutting conventions that would become industry standards.\nEdwin S. Porter had won acclaim making cameras, film printers, and projectors; however, after his workshop was destroyed by a fire, he accepted a special commission for the Edison Manufacturing Company in 1901. His task to improve Edison's existing projecting equipment was a marked success, and Porter was given a regular job as the cameraman for Edison's New York film studio; at the time being a cameraman meant operating the camera as well as exercising creative control in a way that would later be called film directing. His early films were sketches and actualities in the simple style used by other Edison employees. However, his job also gave him the chance to view the many foreign films the Edison company were distributing and pirating, and around 1901 or 1902 he discovered the more complex works being made by M\u00e9li\u00e8s and the Brighton School. Porter began attempts to bring Edison films to a similar level of achievement, later recalling, \"From laboratory examination of some of the popular films of the French pioneer director, George M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2014trick films like \"A Trip to the Moon\"\u2014I came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres, and set to work in this direction.\"\nThe Edison studio, facing growing competition from other American companies, welcomed Porter's ambitious plans. His first major attempts at elaborate storytelling films included a 1902 adaptation of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" in imitation of M\u00e9li\u00e8s, and a 1903 \"Life of an American Fireman\" in the style of a notable Brighton School film, \"Fire!\" His films did well and were influential, bolstered by his status as the leading filmmaker at the most important American studio. In October 1903 Porter joined forces with a new Edison hire, Max Aronson, who was a young stage actor billed as G. M. Anderson. Anderson's initial jobs for the studio were inventing sight gags and playing occasional roles, but he was soon working with Porter on creative collaborations. Porter's next major film was \"The Great Train Robbery\"; Porter was in charge of production and photography, while Anderson may have assisted on staging.\nInspirations.\nPorter (and possibly Anderson) drew on various sources when planning the scenario for \"The Great Train Robbery\". Western themes were already popular in films and other entertainment, reflecting the wide public interest in stories about the past and present of the American West. Many American films before 1900 can be classified as Westerns, such as actuality views of cowboy life, staged Western anecdotes like \"A Bluff from a Tenderfoot\" and \"Cripple Creek Bar-Room Scene\" (both 1899), and shots of Annie Oakley and of Oglala and Brul\u00e9 dancers from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show (both 1894). Studios abroad also began telling Western stories early on, with Mitchell and Kenyon's 1899 British film \"Kidnapping by Indians\" the first known example. Edison's 1901 film \"Stage Coach Hold-up\", based on Buffalo Bill's \"Hold-up of the Deadwood Stage\" act, probably influenced Porter directly. Porter may have also been inspired by recent real events related to the American West: in August 1900, Butch Cassidy and his gang had robbed a Union Pacific Railroad train and escaped capture, and in September 1903, Bill Miner's gang made an unsuccessful holdup of an Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company train.\nFor the film's title and basic concept, Porter looked to Scott Marble's \"The Great Train Robbery\", a popular stage melodrama that had premiered in Chicago in 1896 and had been revived in New York in 1902. The play covers the adventures of a Texas criminal gang who attempt to steal a $50,000 gold shipment from a Wells Fargo office in Missouri. Their initial scheme is for a mole planted in the company to make off with the gold before it leaves Missouri by train; this plan goes awry, and only leads to an innocent man's arrest. However, using information received at a Texas mountain saloon, the gang are still able to stop the train, blast open the car containing the gold, and bring it back to their secret hideout in a Red River canyon. The United States Marshals Service tracks down the gang and finally defeats them in a climactic fight, with cowboys and Native Americans drawn into the fray.\nFor the narrative style, Porter likely drew freely on various recent popular films, made by filmmakers experimenting with elaborate storytelling. \"A Daring Daylight Burglary\", a British chase drama from the Sheffield Photo Company, has frequently been cited as particularly influential; it and another British film, \"Desperate Poaching Affray\", were successfully imported to America and started a decade-long vogue for films centered on chases. \"A Daring Daylight Burglary\"'s story and editing appear to have supplied the overall narrative structure for \"The Great Train Robbery\", though in the latter film the chase is only made explicit in one shot, the twelfth. Porter's plot also profited from the booming popularity of railroad-related film attractions, such as phantom rides and standalone comic scenes set on trains. \"The Great Train Robbery\" would treat the rail theme more elaborately than was common, showing its train from various angles and involving it in a dramatic adventure.\nFilming.\nPorter filmed \"The Great Train Robbery\" in November 1903. Some scenes were photographed at the Edison studio in New York, and others were done in New Jersey, in Essex County Park and along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The stream-crossing scene was filmed at Thistle Mill Ford in the South Mountain Reservation of Essex County Park. The cast included Justus D. Barnes as the leader of the outlaws, Walter Cameron as the sheriff and G. M. Anderson in three small roles (the murdered passenger, the dancing tenderfoot, and one of the robbers). Many Edison workers were among the extras. Edison filmmaker J. Blair Smith was one of the camera operators.\nAccording to rumors in a contemporary \"New York Times\" piece on the film, the Edison Company initially attempted to get the railroad company to lend their tracks and cars for free, arguing that it would be good publicity for the line; the railroad directors disagreed, but eventually allowed their resources to be used if Edison also made a more straightforward advertising film for them. The article adds that a real fireman and engineer play those respective parts in the film, and that the filming caused some disturbance when the dummy thrown off the locomotive was mistaken by passersby for a real accident victim.\nPorter's visual style for \"The Great Train Robbery\" was not cutting edge for 1903; it is comparable to numerous other films released around the same time, such as \"The Escaped Lunatic\", a popular Biograph Studios comedy about wardens chasing an escapee from a mental institution, and \"Runaway Match\", a British Gaumont film featuring an extended car chase sequence. \"Mary Jane's Mishap\", a landmark dark comedy made by Brighton pioneers G. A. Smith and Laura Bayley and released months before \"The Great Train Robbery\", is far more sophisticated in its editing and framing. Porter's style heavily prioritized action over character, with most figures remaining indistinguishable in wide shots; the staging inconsistently mixes stylized theatrical blocking with more naturalistic action. The film also leaves many narrative points ambiguous, requiring explanations to be filled in by a live narrator or by audience imaginations.\nHowever, \"The Great Train Robbery\" successfully collected many popular themes and prevalent techniques of the time into a single accessible narrative. Porter cut his shots together to suggest action happening simultaneously in different locations, as he had done (albeit less efficiently) in \"Life of an American Fireman\". The use of real outdoor locations and violent action helped keep the film dynamic, as did technical strategies such as a matte combining a studio scene with outdoor footage, and three shots in which the camera moves. These three shots add an edge of realism and immediacy, with the frame following the action as if recording real life in a documentary style; one of these shots, showing the robbers making off with their loot, even requires the mounted camera to attempt a tricky diagonal pan, creating a jagged effect.\nThe final shot, in which Barnes fires at the camera in a framing reminiscent of a wanted poster, is the film's only close-up, and does not function as part of the plot. Porter rarely used close-ups, especially in his later years, preferring to save them for special standalone effects like this one. Edison's promotional leaflet about the film describes this scene as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Scene 14\u2014REALISM. A life size picture of Barnes, leader of the outlaw band, taking aim and firing point blank at each individual in the audience. (This effect is gained by foreshortening in making the picture.) The resulting excitement is great. This section of the scene can be used either to begin the subject or to end it, as the operator may choose.\nThe catalogue's informal approach to where the scene should be placed was not unique to \"The Great Train Robbery\"; Porter's film \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", released earlier in 1903, had included a boat race scene that was variously advertised as Scene 5 (where it would make some narrative sense) or as Scene 10 (where it would not). Such shots, designed primarily for spectacle rather than for narrative coherency, characterize a popular early-film style later dubbed the \"cinema of attractions\".\nRelease and reception.\nIn 1903, the most common American film venue was vaudeville houses, where films were exhibited as part of a varied bill of entertainment; other informal venues also sometimes showed films. The Edison Manufacturing Company announced \"The Great Train Robbery\" to exhibitors in early November 1903, calling it a \"highly sensationalized Headliner\". To secure copyright, they submitted a rough cut of the film (about fifteen feet longer than the final cut) to the Library of Congress, where it survives as a paper print. The final release print was made available in early December 1903. Edison sold it to exhibitors for US$111, as a 740-foot reel. The first known showing of \"The Great Train Robbery\" was at a New York City dime museum, Huber's Museum. By the following week it was appearing at eleven venues in the city area, including the Eden Mus\u00e9e, a major amusement center. Edison advertisements touted the film as \"absolutely the superior of any moving picture ever made\" and a \"faithful imitation of the genuine 'Hold Ups' made famous by various outlaw bands in the far West\". A number of prints of \"The Great Train Robbery\" survive; a few of these were heavily edited and altered by their owners, but most are in their release state, and at least one is hand-colored.\n\"The Great Train Robbery\" was a major commercial success for the Edison company. It played as the headlining attraction in many vaudeville houses, and showed up frequently at two other entertainment venues that proliferated across the country in the following years: immersive venues where the spectator took simulated railroad journeys, such as Hale's Tours of the World, and a new kind of film venue, the nickelodeon, where \"The Great Train Robbery\" was often the first attraction shown. It was the first film shown at Harry Davis and John P. Harris' Nickelodeon theater. Overall, it may have had the biggest success of any film made before 1905. Its popularity was helped by its timely subject matter (as train robberies were still a familiar news item), as well as its striking depictions of action and violence. Unusually for the time, the film was even described in detail in \"The\" \"New York Times\"; the anonymous reviewer criticized most of the players, but praised the horse riding and stunts, concluding: \"All this is the result of poor acting, but the results are certainly astounding.\"\nThe film was also widely imitated and copied; the Lubin Manufacturing Company made a shot-for-shot remake in August 1904, changing only small details. (Film copyright was legally murky until 1912, so despite the film's Library of Congress registration, unauthorized remakes and adaptations could be made with impunity.) Porter himself directed a 1905 parody of the film, \"The Little Train Robbery\", with children robbing candy and dolls from a miniature railroad car. But despite its wide success and imitators, \"The Great Train Robbery\" did not lead to a significant increase in Western films; instead, the genre continued essentially as it had before, in a scattered mix of short actualities and longer stories. The Western genre would not proliferate in earnest until 1908; one of the leading contributors to this boom was G. M. Anderson, now billed as Broncho Billy Anderson. Porter continued to make films for more than a decade after, usually in a similar editing style to \"The Great Train Robbery\", with few additional technical innovations. One historian commented that later efforts like \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1913) were \"if anything a retrogression from \"The Great Train Robbery\" and had less innate cinema sense.\" However, some of Porter's post-\"Robbery\" works continued to be imaginative in content, including \"The Kleptomaniac\", a notable 1905 social justice film.\nLegacy.\nIn the decades after \"The Great Train Robbery\", various inaccurate legends developed, exaggerating its historical significance. By mid-century, mistaken claims that it was the \"first Western\" or even the \"first story film\" were common. Critiquing these inaccurate legends and citing the film's actual lack of impact on the Western genre, historian Scott Simmon comments that in fact the film's \"main surprise in retrospect is how it led nowhere, either for its creator or the genre, beyond serving loosely as a narrative model for gun-wielding crime and horse-chase retribution.\" Claims about historical priority continued to be repeated by general-audience writers into the early twenty-first century.\nLater film critics, abandoning the exaggerated claims, have tended to explain the film's significance mostly in terms of its wide popularity and Porter's influential action-driven storytelling. William Everson and George Fenin dubbed it \"the first dramatically creative American film\", while Robert Sklar praised the film's capacity \"to unite motion picture spectacle with myth and stories about America that were shared by people throughout the world.\" Historians have cited \"The Great Train Robbery\" as Porter's most important film, and noted it as a popular early film that collects numerous important Western tropes, such as \"elements of fisticuffs, horseback pursuit and gunplay\". Film historian Pamela Hutchinson highlights especially the iconic close-up scene, \"a jolt of terror as disconcerting as a hand bursting from a grave\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's an especially violent act, both in real terms, and cinematic ones. The narrative momentum of the film is cast aside, then the fourth wall of the screen is broken by his gaze, only to be further ruptured by his bullets. Placed at the opening of the film, it might act as a trailer for the shoot-'em-up action to come. As a coda, it's a warning to the audience that it's a wild world out there, and the violence continues even after the train robber case has been closed.\n\"The Great Train Robbery\" was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1990. In popular culture, numerous films and television shows have referenced the film and the iconic Barnes close-up:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars Gibson Gowland as Dr. John McTeague; ZaSu Pitts as Trina Sieppe, his wife; and Jean Hersholt as McTeague's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a San Francisco dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina.\n\"Greed\" was one of the few films of its time to be shot entirely on location, with von Stroheim shooting approximately 85 hours of footage before editing. Two months alone were spent shooting in Death Valley for the film's final sequence, and many of the cast and crew became ill. Von Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as deep focus cinematography and montage editing. He considered \"Greed\" to be a Greek tragedy, in which environment and heredity controlled the characters' fates and reduced them to primitive \"b\u00eates humaines\" (human beasts), a naturalistic concept in the vein of Zola.\nDuring editing, the production company merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), putting Irving Thalberg in charge of post-production. Thalberg had fired von Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures. Originally over nine hours long, \"Greed\" was edited against von Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Von Stroheim later called \"Greed\" his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.\nThe uncut version has been called the \"holy grail\" for film archivists, amid false claims of the discovery of the missing footage. In 1999, Turner Entertainment created a four-hour version that used stills of cut scenes to reconstruct the film. \"Greed\" was a critical and financial failure upon its initial release, but, by the 1950s, it began to be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made; film makers and scholars have noted its influence on subsequent films. In 1958, the film was voted number 6 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.\nIn 1991, \"Greed\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI never truckled, I never took off the hat to fashion and held it out for pennies. By God, I told them the truth. They liked it or they didn't like it. What had that to do with me? I told them the truth; I knew it for the truth then and I know it for the truth now.\n\u2014Frank Norris, quoted from his essay \"The True Reward of the Novelist\", in a title card at the beginning of \"Greed\".\nIn 1908, John McTeague works in a gold mine in Placer County, California. A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. \"Painless\" Potter visits the town, and McTeague's mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on Polk Street in San Francisco.\nMarcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fianc\u00e9e, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine Trina. As they wait for an opening, she buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court her. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between him and McTeague. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.\nSchouler leaves San Francisco to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license to ruin him. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is still unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).\nTrina's bitten fingers become infected and have to be amputated. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.\nMcTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.\nThe oppressive heat slows McTeague's progress. Schouler's progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor but Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. Finally, McTeague is left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.\nSub-plots.\nStroheim's original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible results of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted the lives of the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and having lost his mind, leaps into San Francisco Bay.\nThe second sub-plot depicts the lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina but this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nBackground and writing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI intended to show men and women as they are all over the world, none of them perfect, with their good and bad qualities, their noble and idealistic sides and their jealous, vicious, mean and greedy sides. I was not going to compromise. I felt that after the last war, the motion picture going public had tired of the cinematographic 'chocolate \u00e9clairs' which had been stuffed down their throats and which had in a large degree figuratively ruined their stomachs with this overdose of Saccharose in pictures. Now, I felt, they were ready for a large bowl of plebeian but honest corned beef and cabbage'.\n\u2014Erich von Stroheim.\n\"Greed\" is based on the American author Frank Norris's 1899 novel \"McTeague: A Story of San Francisco\". Von Stroheim's interest in \"McTeague\" can be traced back to January 1920, when he told a journalist that he wanted to film the novel. He had lived in San Francisco in the early 1910s, living there in poverty like that of the story's characters. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, and worked his way up in the film industry from extra to acting in villainous or aristocratic roles in films. By 1919, von Stroheim had finally become a successful director in his own right at Universal Film Manufacturing Company, although one with a reputation of going over budget and over schedule.\nUpon the appointment of Irving Thalberg as general manager at Universal, von Stroheim's defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of \"Foolish Wives\" in 1921 (which had been shooting non-stop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on \"Merry-Go-Round\", von Stroheim was fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding a new era in which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. By this time von Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the Goldwyn Company on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.\nVon Stroheim chose his new studio because of the level of artistic freedom he was offered, which he had been denied at Universal under Thalberg. In March of that year, Frank Joseph (Joe) Godsol was elected president of Goldwyn Pictures. Board of Directors member Abe Lehr publicly promised that \"each director will have his own staff and will be given every facility in putting into production his own individuality and personality.\" Von Stroheim signed a one-year, three-feature deal with Goldwyn on November 20, 1922. The deal stipulated that each feature would be between long, cost no more than $175,000 and be completed in fourteen weeks. It also promised von Stroheim $30,000 for each completed film.\nLehr initially hired von Stroheim in order to film a big-budget version of the operetta \"The Merry Widow\", which the producer saw as a guaranteed hit; von Stroheim, convinced Lehr to let him make \"Greed\" first, promising low costs. A press release of February 1923 said that although von Stroheim had \"run rather freely to large sets in the past, [he] seems to have reformed\u2014or surrendered\u2014for it is announced that he will not build any sets at all.\"\nVon Stroheim wrote a highly detailed 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and tint cues. Among the changes that he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris's anti-Semitism. \"McTeague\" had been filmed once before as \"Life's Whirlpool\", a five-reel short by William A. Brady's World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and von Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance. According to the film historian, Kevin Brownlow, \"Life's Whirlpool\" was also shot on location in Death Valley.\nVon Stroheim was known for his perfectionism and his insolence towards studio executives. Working on \"Greed\", von Stroheim set out to make a realistic film about everyday people and rejected the Hollywood tropes of glamor, happy endings and upper-class characters. Before shooting began, von Stroheim told a reporter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is possible to tell a great story in motion pictures in such a way that the spectator forgets he is looking at beauteous Gertie Gefelta, the producer's pet and discovers himself intensely interested, just as if he were looking out of a window at life itself. He will come to believe that what he is gazing at is real\u2014a cameraman was present in the household and nobody knew it. They went on in their daily life with their joys, fun and tragedies and the camera stole it all, holding it up afterward for all to see.\nIn early January 1923, von Stroheim arrived in San Francisco, where he scouted locations and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for \"Greed\", he attended society functions in town and met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and his sister-in-law Kathleen. To capture the authentic spirit of the story, von Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.\nNorris had similarly scouted settings for his novel and chose the upstairs of a building on the corner of Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Von Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, von Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.\nDespite the strict conditions of von Stroheim's initial contract, Goldwyn approved the lengthy shooting script before filming began. Production Manager J. J. Cohn later explained that \"they thought they could control him when the time comes.\"\nCasting.\nWith the exception of Jean Hersholt, all of the main actors in \"Greed\" were regulars of von Stroheim's earlier films, a group dubbed the \"Stroheim Stock Company\". Gibson Gowland had previously appeared in \"Blind Husbands\" and returned to the U.S. from Scotland for the role of John McTeague. Cesare Gravina, who played the junkman Zerkow, and Dale Fuller, the lottery-ticket seller Maria, had both appeared in \"Foolish Wives\" and would later appear in \"The Merry Widow\". Other actors in von Stroheim's Stock Company included Sidney Bracey, Mae Busch, George Fawcett, Maude George, Hughie Mack and George Nichols.\nTrina was the most difficult role to cast, and ZaSu Pitts was hired at the last minute, after von Stroheim had rejected both Claire Windsor and Colleen Moore. Pitts had previously acted only in comedic roles; \"Greed\" was her first dramatic part. The actress later appeared in both \"The Wedding March\" and \"Hello, Sister!\" Von Stroheim said that Pitts was \"the greatest psychopathological actress in the American cinema\" and that \"she should not be in comedy, for she is the greatest of all tragediennes.\"\nVon Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt to discuss the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was initially reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, von Stroheim changed his mind on the spot. With the exception of Gowland, von Stroheim shot extensive screen tests of all the other actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. A scene from the Goldwyn film \"Souls for Sale\" is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of von Stroheim directing \"Greed\", but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.\nFilming.\nFilming commenced in San Francisco on March 13, 1923 and concluded in October, for a total of 198 days, producing about 85 hours of footage. The San Francisco location shooting wrapped in late June. Despite the initial contract between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed to double the film's budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began. Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set after a few days of filming. He remained in good health for the remainder of the shoot. This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina developed double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly ashamed that Gravina's entire performance was later cut from the film, despite the actor's dedication to the role. Hersholt was knocked unconscious by Gowland during the picnic scene (later cut) in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was nearly run over by a trolley. In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that \"it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio.\"\nOne scene that von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence depicted a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is too embarrassed to examine the teeth of a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gowland's head; Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to participate in such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was created instead.\nAfter filming in San Francisco finished in June, the production traveled to Death Valley. Most Hollywood films that required desert scenes settled for the local Oxnard dunes north of Los Angeles, but von Stroheim insisted on authenticity. Death Valley had no roads, hotels, services or running water and was teeming with tarantulas, scorpions, rattlesnakes and black widow spiders. The nearest populated area to the shoot was around away, and insurance coverage was denied. Filming in Death Valley lasted through July and August 1923, allowing Gowland and Hersholt to grow the beards necessary for the sequence. During production, the highest temperature officially recorded in Death Valley was . Of the forty-three members of the cast and crew who worked on the Death Valley sequence, one cook died of heatstroke and fourteen others became ill and were sent back to Los Angeles Heat exhaustion was a daily occurrence for members of the crew. Hersholt spent a week in the hospital after shooting was completed, suffering from internal bleeding. He claimed to have lost , and was covered in blisters due to severe sunburn by the end of filming. (Despite the hardship, Hersholt later stated that he considered his role in \"Greed\" to be the best of his career.) In order to motivate Hersholt and Gibson during the scene where they fight, von Stroheim yelled at them, \"Fight, fight! Try to hate each other as much as you both hate me!\"\nThroughout filming, von Stroheim brought musicians on set to help create the appropriate mood for the actors. For the Death Valley scenes, he employed a harmonium and a violin player. A theme inspired by the music of Italian operatic composer Ruggero Leoncavallo was composed and played throughout production. Other music included the popular songs \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", \"Hearts and Flowers\", \"Oh Promise Me\", and \"Call Me Thine Own\".\nFilming moved to Placer County on September 13 and continued for less than a month. The Big Dipper Mine had been closed for ten years, so von Stroheim convinced the Goldwyn Company to lease and renovate it for filming. While first visiting Placer County during pre-production, von Stroheim had met Harold Henderson, a local resident and fan of Norris's whose brother had worked in the mine in the 1890s. Von Stroheim hired Henderson to oversee the renovation of the mine and other locations in Iowa Hill. Von Stroheim also wanted to restore the local cemetery for a newly invented scene depicting McTeague's mother's funeral, but the Goldwyn Company turned down this proposal. Inside the mine, von Stroheim usually shot at night between 9\u00a0pm and 6\u00a0am. Cinematographer William H. Daniels later said that von Stroheim insisted on descending underground for realism, even though the setting would have looked exactly the same at . Filming of \"Greed\" was completed on October 6, 1923, after 198 days. Despite his original contract stipulating that all films be under , von Stroheim shot a total of of footage for the film, running approximately 85 hours.\nStyle.\nVon Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig compared the director's visual style to that of pioneering filmmaker D. W. Griffith but felt that \"unlike Griffith, who viewed scenes as though through a fourth wall, von Stroheim shot from many sides and from different angles; he also used deep focus, meaningful foregrounds and effective camera movement.\" \"Greed\"'s lighting included high contrast, chiaroscuro techniques with pools or shafts of lights illuminating an otherwise dark space. Examples of this technique include the scene where McTeague begs Trina for money in a pool of moonlight and the merry-go-round scene in which characters alternate between appearing only as dark silhouettes and being fully lit.\nDaniels was especially proud of the wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible through the window and was difficult to light properly. \"Greed\" has often been praised for its use of deep focus cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in \"Citizen Kane\". Daniels sometimes used incandescent lights instead of studio arc lights, due to the constraints of his locations. He later said that von Stroheim \"was one of the first to insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes\u00a0 ... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown\" to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints. Although not officially credited, Ernest B. Schoedsack worked on the picture as a camera operator.\nVon Stroheim favored \"Soviet-style\" montage editing. \"Greed\" often uses dramatic close-ups and cuts instead of long takes. One exception to this is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Von Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called von Stroheim a montage director, stating that \"each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact.\" In the 1950s film critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin praised von Stroheim's use of \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" and noted his \"one simple rule for directing. Take a close look at the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness.\"\nDespite von Stroheim's reputation as a perfectionist, \"Greed\" contains several anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Von Stroheim did his best to avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era \"Greed\" was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, von Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.\nThemes.\nFrank Norris's novel belongs to the literary school of naturalism founded by French author \u00c9mile Zola. \"McTeague\" depicts the fate of its lower-class characters in terms of heredity and their environment, with the belief that \"man's nature, despite free will, is determined by genetic and environmental factors\" and that heredity controls fate, despite efforts at upward mobility. This literary style was influenced by Charles Darwin and portrayed characters whose higher states of being, the rational and compassionate, are in conflict with their lower states, the \"b\u00eate humaine\" (human beast). \"McTeague\" was first published in 1899 and was inspired by an October 1893 murder case in which Patrick Collins, a poor husband with a history of beating his wife Sarah, finally stole her money and stabbed her to death at her San Francisco workplace. Sarah Collins worked at the Lest Norris kindergarten, which was financed by Norris's family.\nVon Stroheim did not see \"Greed\" as political and told a journalist that he considered it to be like a Greek tragedy. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.\nOne of the cinematic techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In \"Greed\" McTeague is associated with a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual \"leitmotif\". For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.\nThroughout his career von Stroheim used grotesque imagery and characters. This is most apparent in the wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity and a sense of communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.\nAs in his other films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often depicted in von Stroheim's films and was close to the date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom \"Greed\" is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.\nEditing.\nInitial editing.\nEditing \"Greed\" took almost a year and von Stroheim's contract did not include payment for his post-production work. He and his chief film cutter Frank Hull worked on the film for several months before completing a rough cut. Von Stroheim was indecisive during editing. He felt restricted by his contract's limitation on the length of the film. Von Stroheim colored certain scenes with gold tinting by using the Handschiegl Color Process, in which individual frames are hand colored with stencils. Von Stroheim credited himself in the beginning titles with \"Personally directed by Erich von Stroheim.\"\nOther than studio personnel, only twelve people saw the original 42-reel version of \"Greed\" at a special screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made and that it was unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he \"saw a wonderful picture the other day\u2014that no one else will ever see\u00a0 ... I can't imagine what they are going to do with it. It is like \"Les Miserables\". Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's \"Out 1\". Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared \"Greed\" to \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" and \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\". However, Welford Beaton of \"The Film Spectator\" disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.\nMany sources claim that the 42-reel version was only ever intended to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, \"I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture.\" Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream. While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who was the head of the Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of \"Greed\" by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of \"Ben-Hur\" and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.\nAfter having completed the 24-reel cut of \"Greed\", von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives that he could not cut another frame. Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, Grant Whytock. Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on \"The Devil's Pass Key\" and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels. His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was \"very distasteful\". Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out of quick \"flash\" shots that only lasted a few frames. However, Whytock's version of \"Greed\" retained the prologue and other subplots, as well as much of the humor that was later cut out of it.\nWhytock and Ingram screened their version of \"Greed\" to studio executives, who responded favorably to it but worried that the tragic ending would be hard to sell to the public. Ingram then sent the 18-reel version to von Stroheim and told him, \"If you cut one more frame I shall never speak to you again.\" On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim's nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of \"Greed\". Von Stroheim and Louis B. Mayer had a lengthy confrontation over the film's editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism, or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.\nStudio editing.\nMGM executives screened \"Greed\" at full length once to meet contractual obligations. Idwal Jones, a San Francisco critic, attended the all-day screening and wrote that while some of the scenes were compelling, von Stroheim's desire that \"every comma of the book [be] put in\" was ultimately negative. MGM then took control and re-edited it. The studio ordered June Mathis to cut it down further; she assigned the job to Joseph W. Farnham, a well-known \"titles editor\", who patched scenes together using title cards to keep continuity. His contributions to \"Greed\" include the notorious title cards \"\"Such was McTeague\" and \"Let's go over and sit on the sewer\"\", which were snickered at for years. Eventually, Farnham reduced \"Greed\" to 10 reels, totaling . Von Stroheim said that the film \"was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat.\" He later bitterly lamented that \"Greed\" was made before the financial success of Eugene O'Neill's five-hour play \"Strange Interlude\" in 1928. Von Stroheim angrily disowned the final version, blaming Mathis for destroying his masterpiece.\nOne week before \"Greed\"'s release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. These cuts included the administration of ether in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although these cuts were made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage was kept in many other prints.\nDifference between von Stroheim's cut and MGM's cut.\nThe main cuts to \"Greed\" were the elimination of its two sub-plots and other entire sequences, while individual scenes were often not touched. Commenting about the cuts made in the film to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Thalberg stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This whole story is about greed\u2014a progressive greed. It is the story of the way greed grew in Trina's heart until it obsessed her. I found that the junk dealer's greed was so much greater than hers that it almost destroyed the theme. His intense greed drowned out Trina's greed just as a steam whistle drowns out a small street noise. Instead of hurting the picture, throwing out this junk dealer's story made the picture stronger.\nThalberg also stated that he \"took no chances in cutting it. We took it around to different theaters in the suburbs, ran it at its enormous length, and then we took note of the places at which interest seemed to droop.\"\nIndividual scenes or sequences that were cut include McTeague and Trina's early, happy years of marriage, the sequence showing McTeague and Trina eventually moving into their shack, the family life of the Sieppe family before Trina's marriage, the prologue depicting McTeague's mother and father at the Big Dipper mine and McTeague's apprenticeship. Other cuts included the more suggestive and sexual close-up shots depicting McTeague and Trina's physical attraction to each other, the scenes after McTeague has murdered Trina and roams around San Francisco and Placer County, additional footage of Death Valley, additional footage of Trina with her money, and a more gradual version of Trina's descent into greed and miserly obsession.\nReception.\nRelease and critical reviews.\n\"Greed\" premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in Columbus Circle, New York City, which was owned by William Randolph Hearst. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign correspondent during the Spanish\u2013American War and Hearst praised \"Greed\", calling it the greatest film he had ever seen. Hearst's newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At the time of the release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on \"The Merry Widow\" on December 1. In May 1926 \"Greed\" was released in Berlin, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling Nazi party.\n\"Greed\" received mostly negative reviews. The trade paper \"Harrison's Report\" said that \"[i]f a contest were to be held to determine which has been the filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture in the history of the motion picture business, I am sure that \"Greed\" would win.\" \"Variety Weekly\" called it \"an out-and-out box office flop\" only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that \"nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time\" and that despite its \"excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story\u00a0 ... it does not entertain.\" In its December 1924 \u2013 January 1925 issue, \"Exceptional Photoplays\" called it \"one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture.\" In the February 1925 issue of \"Theatre Magazine\", Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that \"the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types\u2014they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism.\" Mordaunt Hall of the \"New York Times\" gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM \"clipped this production as much as they dared\u00a0 ... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning.\" In a \"Life Magazine\" article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim \"a genius\u00a0 ... badly in need of a stopwatch.\" Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying \"a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in.\" A March 1925 review in \"Pictureplay\" magazine stated, \"perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice.\"\nA more favorable review came from Richard Watts, Jr. of the \"New York Herald Tribune\", who called \"Greed\" \"the most important picture yet produced in America\u00a0 ... It is the one picture of the season that can hold its own as a work of dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as \"What Price Glory?\" and \"Desire Under the Elms\".\" The April 20, 1925 edition of \"The Montreal Gazette\" claimed it \"impresses as a powerful film\" and described the \"capacity audience\" screening as \"one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration ... which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down to the level of the groundlings.\" The review went on to describe the direction as \"masterly\", citing \"its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life's realities.\" A review in \"Exceptional Photoplays\" stated that \"Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in \"Greed\" he has given us an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, \"Greed\" is a terrible and wonderful thing.\"\nBox office.\n\"Greed\" was a financial disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $224,500 in the United States, $3,063 in Canada and $47,264 in other markets. In total it earned $274,827. Von Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig stated that according to MGM's records the final cost of \"Greed\" was $546,883. Another biographer, Richard Koszarski, stated that its final cost was $665,603: $585,250 for the production, $30,000 for von Stroheim's personal fee, $54,971 for processing and editing, $53,654 for advertising and $1,726 for Motion Picture dues.\nArthur Lennig asserted that MGM's official budget for \"Greed\" was suspiciously high for a film with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive \"The Merry Widow\" in order to prevent von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. \"The Merry Widow\" ended up being a hit and earned more profits than \"Greed\" had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.\nLegacy.\nIn his final years, von Stroheim said that \"of all my films, only \"Greed\" was a fully realized work; only \"Greed\" had a total validity.\" In 1926 a British foundation of arts and sciences requested a copy of the original version of \"Greed\" to keep in their archive, but their request was denied by MGM. Henri Langlois screened the studio version of \"Greed\" for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, \"It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone.\" He went on to say that \"It was as if a man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue. Of course, he still loves her but it's only the memory of her that he can love\u2014because he doesn't recognize her anymore.\"\nIn the early 1950s \"Greed\"'s reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the \"Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique\", \"Greed\" was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Billy Wilder voting for it. Later in 1952, \"Sight and Sound\" magazine published its first list of the \"ten greatest films ever made\". \"Greed\" was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, Lotte Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Penelope Houston and Gavin Lambert voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The \"Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique\" released a list of \"the most important and misappreciated American films of all time\" in 1978. \"Greed\" was third on its list after \"Citizen Kane\" and \"\". In a University of Southern California list of the \"50 Most Significant American Films\" made by the school's Performing Arts Council, \"Greed\" was listed as number 21. In 1991, \"Greed\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nInfluence.\nAmong those who have praised \"Greed\" over the years are Sergei Eisenstein; Joseph von Sternberg, who said, \"We were all influenced by \"Greed\"\"; Jean Renoir, who called it \"the film of films\"; and Ernst Lubitsch, who called von Stroheim \"the only true 'novelist'\" in films. More recently Guillermo del Toro called it \"a perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanization that was to come\", and Norbert Pfaffenbichler said that \"the last shot of the movie is unforgettable.\" American writer and critic Susan Sontag named \"Greed\" one of her favorite films. Jonathan Rosenbaum has stated that \"Greed\" was a major influence on the style and content of many films. Von Stroheim's shots filming the sun predated Akira Kurosawa's better-known uses of the technique in \"Rashomon\" (1950). Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in \"Greed\" to shots in King Vidor's \"The Crowd\", Jean Renoir's \"Le Crime de Monsieur Lange\", Orson Welles's \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", Howard Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" and Michelangelo Antonioni's \"L'Avventura\". In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in \"Greed\" to John Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\" (1954), Claude Chabrol's \"Les Bonnes Femmes\" (1960) and Elaine May's \"Mikey and Nicky\" (1975). Rosenbaum singled out von Stroheim's influence on May, an American director, with \"Mikey and Nicky\" centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles's use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in \"the spirit of von Stroheim\".\nThe two films most commonly compared to \"Greed\" are Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and Welles's \"The Magnificent Ambersons\". Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being lost in the desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and \"Greed\" both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. \"Ambersons\" was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that \"Greed\" influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to the intentions of the original novels. In the first chapter of the 1966 serial film \"Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates\", the uncut version of \"Greed\" is used as a plot device. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film \"Greedy\" pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.\nReconstruction.\nAttempts to reconstruct the uncut version of \"Greed\" without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the \"Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique\" named \"Greed\" as one of the twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for \"Greed\", which came directly from von Stroheim's copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three books that used von Stroheim's script to reconstruct the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book used 400 individual stills and production photos to reconstruct the uncut version of \"Greed\", the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.\nIn 1999, Turner Entertainment decided to recreate, as closely as possible, the original version by combining the existing footage with over 650 still photographs of the lost scenes (many of which had been used in Weinberg's book), in accordance with an original continuity outline written by von Stroheim. All materials were provided by the Margaret Herrick Library. This restoration runs almost four hours. It was produced by film preservationist Rick Schmidlin and edited by Glenn Morgan. Schmidlin restored many characters and sub-plots from the original version. A new musical score was composed by Robert Israel. The reconstruction cost $100,000 to produce. Schmidlin called the finished product \"a reconstruction of Von Stroheim's lost narrative.\" It premiered at the 1999 Telluride Film Festival and was later screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Pordenone Silent Film Festival before being aired on Turner Classic Movies on December 5, 1999. Film critic Todd McCarthy called the restored version of \"Greed\" a triumph. Roger Ebert called \"Greed\" a masterpiece and said that the restored Schmidlin cut illustrates the \"prudish sensibilities [that] went into MGM's chop job.\" Rosenbaum praised the project, but claimed it could only be considered a \"study version\". The reconstruction won a special citation from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards.\nMyths and misconceptions.\nVon Stroheim was known to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and spurious military record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, he had found a copy of \"McTeague\" in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that von Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.\nClaims that von Stroheim's original cut was a completely unabridged version of \"McTeague\" are not accurate. Von Stroheim's 300-page script was almost as long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In von Stroheim's original \"Greed\", this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Von Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.\n\"Greed\" has sometimes been said to be over 100 reels long. Von Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several of the people who saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that von Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of \"Greed\" was 70 reels.\nJune Mathis is credited with co-writing the script due to her work on the 10-reel version. Mathis was the head of the Story Department at MGM and her contract stipulated that she would receive writing credit for all MGM films. She did not actually write any part of the screenplay. Mathis is said to have changed the film's title from \"McTeague\" to \"Greed\" during post-production; however, a publicity still of the cast and crew taken during production clearly indicates that the film was titled \"Greed\" before the MGM merger even took place. The film's working title was \"Greedy Wives\", a nod towards von Stroheim's previous film \"Foolish Wives\"; this working title never was considered as the film's actual title.\nThe original, uncut version of \"Greed\" has been called the \"holy grail\" for film archivists. Over the years, various reports of the original version being uncovered have proved to be unfounded. Among them is a claim that a copy existed in a vault in South America that was screened once a year for invited guests on New Year's Eve. Another claim was that a copy in the possession of a Texan millionaire was sold to Henri Langlois of \"Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise\". A film society in Boston supposedly held a private screening of a print discovered by a World War II veteran in Berlin. Other stories held that David Shepherd of the American Film Institute had found a copy at a garage sale, and that the head of a film society in Redwood City, California, owned \"the longest existing version of \"Greed\" (purchased in Europe).\" Von Stroheim himself once stated that Benito Mussolini owned a personal copy of the film. His son, Joseph von Stroheim, once claimed that when he was in the Army during World War II, he saw a version of the film that took two nights to fully screen, although he could not remember exactly how long it was.\nThere were several reports that MGM had retained a copy of the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that John Houseman had a private screening at MGM and that the studio owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine. Lotte Eisner once claimed that sometime during the 1950s and 1960s, several film cans labeled \"McTeague\" were found in MGM's vaults and destroyed by executives who did not know that it was footage from \"Greed\". MGM executive Al Lewin said that several years after the film's release, von Stroheim asked him for the cut footage; Lewin and editor Margaret Booth supposedly searched MGM's vault but could not find any missing footage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He took power in a coup against the unpopular emperor Justinian II, and was deposed in a similarly violent manner nineteen months later. During his brief reign, Philippicus supported monothelitism in Byzantine theological disputes, and saw conflict with the First Bulgarian Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate.\nBiography.\nPhilippicus was originally named Bardanes (; ); he was the son of the patrician Nicephorus, who was of Armenian extraction from an Armenian colony in Pergamum. The Armenian background of Philippicus has been supported by Byzantinist historians Peter Charanis and Nicholas Adontz, and disputed by Anthony Kaldellis. Kaldellis adds that Bardanes was probably born and raised in the Byzantine realm, as his father Nicephorus possibly was. Contemporaneous sources attest to Bardanes' tutoring, scholarly interests, learning and eloquence, all of which were in Greek. Byzantine historians Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon suggested Bardanes had some connection or affiliation with the Armenian Mamikonian family, which Kaldellis also denies. Byzantine researcher Toby Bromige felt Kaldellis was too dismissive of the Armenian ancestry of certain Byzantine individuals. \nRelying on the support of the Monothelite party, he made some pretensions to the throne on the outbreak of the first great rebellion against Emperor Justinian II. Instead, the position of emperor was taken first by Leontius and then by Tiberius III, who relegated Bardanes to Cephalonia. When Justinian regained power Bardanes was banished to Cherson, where he took the name Philippicus and incited the inhabitants to revolt with the help of the Khazars. The successful rebels drove Justinian out of Constantinople, and Philippicus took the throne. Justinian was subsequently seized and beheaded; his son Tiberius was likewise apprehended by Philippicus's officers, Ioannes and Mauros, and killed in a church. Justinian's principal officers, such as Barasbakourios, were also massacred. \nReign.\nAmong the first acts of Philippicus were the deposition of Cyrus (the orthodox patriarch of Constantinople) in favour of John VI (a member of his own sect), and the summoning of a conciliabulum of Eastern bishops, which abolished the canons of the Sixth Ecumenical Council. In response, the Roman Church refused to recognize the new emperor and his patriarch. Meanwhile, the Bulgarian ruler Tervel plundered up to the walls of Constantinople in 712. When Philippicus transferred an army from the Opsikion theme to police the Balkans, the Umayyad Caliphate under Al-Walid I made inroads across the weakened defenses of Asia Minor.\nIn late May 713 the Opsikion troops rebelled in Thrace. Several of their officers penetrated the city and blinded Philippicus on June 3, 713 while he was in the hippodrome. He was succeeded for a short while by his principal secretary, Artemius, who was raised to the purple as Emperor Anastasius II. He died in the same year.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lewis\nGun Crazy (originally titled Deadly Is the Female) is a 1950 American crime film noir starring Peggy Cummins and John Dall in a story about the crime spree of a gun-toting husband and wife. It was directed by Joseph H. Lewis and produced by Frank and Maurice King. The screenplay by blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo (credited to the pseudonym of Millard Kaufman) and MacKinlay Kantor was based upon a short story written by Kantor that was published in 1940 in \"The Saturday Evening Post\".\n\"Gun Crazy\" is a rare example of a film that was retitled during its initial release cycle. It was titled \"Deadly Is the Female\" from the film's premiere in January 1950 until March 1950, when the King brothers changed the title to \"Gun Crazy\" to more accurately reflect the character of the film.\nIn 1998, \"Gun Crazy\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nTeenager Barton \"Bart\" Tare is caught breaking a hardware-store window to steal a gun. He is sent to reform school for four years despite the supportive testimony of his friends Dave and Clyde, his older sister Ruby and others. They claim that he would never kill any living creature, even though he has had a lifelong fascination with guns. After killing a young chick with a BB gun at age seven, he became hesitant to shoot at anything, even a mountain lion with a bounty on its head.\nAfter reform school and a stint in the army teaching marksmanship, Bart returns home. At a carnival, Bart challenges sharpshooter Laurie Starr to a contest and wins. Laurie arranges a job for Bart with the carnival and he becomes smitten with her. Their mutual attraction inflames the jealousy of their boss Packett, who wants Laurie for himself. When Packett tries to force himself on her, Bart fires a warning shot within an inch of his nose. Packett fires them and they leave together. Before they marry, Laurie warns Bart that she is \"bad, but will try to be good\". They embark on a carefree honeymoon on Bart's savings, but when the money is spent, she warns Bart that because she wants the finer things in life, he must join her in a career of crime or she will leave him. They rob stores and gas stations, but their paltry proceeds do not last long.\nWhile fleeing from the law, Laurie orders Bart to shoot at the pursuing police car. He shoots the tire of the police car, causing it to crash. Later that day at another robbery, Laurie intends to shoot and kill a grocer, but Bart stops her in time. They have now been identified in national newspapers as notorious robbers.\nBart proclaims that he wants to abandon his life of crime. Laurie persuades him to participate in one last large robbery so that they can flee the country and live in peace and comfort. They take jobs at a meat-processing plant and devise detailed plans. When they rob the payroll department, the office manager pulls the burglar alarm and Laurie shoots her dead. While fleeing the plant, Laurie also kills a security guard. Bart does not realize that both victims are dead, but he later learns about it in the newspaper. Laurie discloses that she had killed a man in St. Louis during one of their holdups. She claims that these murders happened because her fear renders her unable to think clearly in the heat of the moment.\nTo minimize the chance of being caught, Laurie and Bart separate, but they cannot bear to be away from each other. The FBI becomes involved in the pursuit, and Laurie and Bart become the targets of an intense manhunt. In California, Bart arranges for their passage to Mexico, but the FBI finds them in a dance hall. Forced to run, they leave all of their loot behind. With roadblocks everywhere, they jump on a train and disembark near Ruby's house. Clyde, now the local sheriff, notices that the house's curtains are drawn and that the children are not in school. He informs Dave, and they plead with Bart to surrender. Laurie and Bart instead flee to the mountains. Pursued by police dogs, they are surrounded in reed grass the next morning. In dense fog, Dave and Clyde approach to try to reason with them. When Bart sees that Laurie preparing to shoot them, he shoots her and is then killed by the police.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nThe screenplay was credited to Kantor and Millard Kaufman; however, Kaufman was a front for Hollywood Ten outcast Dalton Trumbo, who considerably reworked the story into a doomed love affair.\nThe King brothers originally announced that they had wanted Veronica Lake for the lead.\nThe film was budgeted at $400,000, and principal photography took 30 days. It was originally slated to be released by Monogram Studios, but King Brothers Productions chose United Artists as the distributor, affording the film wider exposure.\nThe bank-heist sequence was shot entirely in one long take in Montrose, California, with no one except the principal actors and people inside the bank alerted to the operation. The shot includes the sequence of driving into town to the bank, distracting and then incapacitating a patrolman and effecting a getaway. This was executed by simulating the interior of a sedan with a stretch Cadillac with room to mount the camera and a jockey's saddle for the cameraman on a greased two-by-twelve board in the back. Lewis kept the onscreen conversations fresh by having the actors improvise their dialogue.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered in Springfield, Massachusetts on January 23, 1950 under its original title of \"Deadly Is the Female\". After opening in several cities under that title, the film was retitled as \"Gun Crazy\", the title of the original story by MacKinlay Kantor, in early March.\nReception.\nIn a contemporary review for \"The New York Times\", critic Howard Thompson called \"Gun Crazy\" \"pretty cheap stuff\" and wrote: \"[T]his spurious concoction is basically on par with the most humdrum pulp fiction. ... The main drawbacks are the stars themselves, who look more like fugitives from a 4-H Club than from the law. Just why two such clean-cut youngsters as Miss Cummins and Mr. Dall should be so cast is something for the Sphinx, but they certainly give it the works. ... At the risk of being drilled between the eyes by one of these sureshots, we must say that it takes more than crime and the King Brothers to make sows\u2019 ears out of silk purses.\"\nReviewing the film after its Springfield, Massachusetts premiere, \"Springfield Daily News\" critic W. Harley Rudkin wrote: \"A tawdry piece of cheap theatrics that starts with a thin premise and winds up with absolutely nothing at all is 'Deadly Is the Female' ... Stripped down to its essentials, a revelation it cannot very well stand, this is a typical, warmed-over cops and robbers story, wrapped around the dubious moral that if you are a rather nice guy it does not do to get mixed up with a woman who likes to rob banks and kill guards.\"\nReviewer Mae Tin\u00e9e of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote: \"John Dall does fine acting in this crime melodrama, which is frequently better than many of the more elaborate and expensive film son the same subject. ... Miss Cummins struck me as a bit miscast as the hardened little sadist, but on the whole the performances are good, and if it does nothing else, this film should convince anyone that earning a living with a gun is certainly doing it the hard way.\"\nIn his 1998 book \"Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir\", critic and film historian Eddie Muller commended the production, writing: \"Joseph H. Lewis's direction is propulsive, possessed of a confident, vigorous simplicity that all the frantic editing and visual pyrotechnics of the filmmaking progeny never quite surpassed.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the early 1980s, she worked with the Afro rock group Osibisa. She is best known for her hit single \"Say I'm Your Number One\" which made the UK top 10 in 1985. Three of Princess' other songs also made the UK top 40 - \"After the Love Has Gone\", \"I'll Keep On Loving You\" and \"Tell Me Tomorrow\". The latter was re-mixed for the soundtrack of the film \"Knights &amp; Emeralds\" in 1986.\nCareer.\nPrincess was born as Desiree Carole Heslop on 28 November 1961. Her father, James Lloyd Heslop, had previously had a hit song in the 1970s, \"Keep On Smiling\".

Situated at the crossroads of the East and West, Bulgaria has been home to many civilizations: Thracians, Greeks, Romans, Eastern Romans or Byzantines, Slavs, Bulgars, and Ottomans. The country is rich in tourist sights and historical artifacts, scattered through a relatively small and easily accessible territory. Bulgaria is internationally known for its seaside and winter resorts.\nBulgaria attracted over 13 million foreign tourists in 2024, according to the latest data from the National Statistics Institute. Tourists from five countries (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Germany and United Kingdom) account for approximately 50% of all visitors. The sector contributed to 15% of GDP and supported 150,000 workplaces in 2014.\nStatistics.\nArrivals by country.\nMost visitors arriving in Bulgaria on short-term basis came from the following countries of nationality:\nTourist attractions.\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites and Intangible Cultural Heritage List.\nThere are ten UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Bulgaria. The first four properties were inscribed in the World Heritage List in 1979, and the last in 2017. Bulgaria currently has sixteen additional properties on the Tentative List. Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nEthnic, cultural and historical tourism.\nThe Bulgarian cultural heritage has many faces and manifestations - archaeological reserves and monuments, museums, galleries, rich cultural calendar, preserved folklore and magnificent architectural monuments.\nThracian treasures.\nThracians made beautifully ornate golden and silver objects such as various kinds of vessels, rhytons, facial masks, pectorals, jewelry, weapons, etc. They used to bury rich hoards of precious objects both to hide them in times of enemy invasions and unrest as well as for ritual purposes. To date, more than 80 Thracian treasures have been excavated in Bulgaria which was the cradle of the Thracian civilization. \nRural tourism.\nThe Bulgarian town house is an embodiment of the owner's social status, craft and traditions. Many old buildings that demonstrate this type of architecture\u2014e.g. in the villages of Arbanasi, Leshten, Kovachevitsa, Melnik\u2014have been preserved to the present day.\nMonasteries.\nDuring the 13th and especially during the 14th centuries the construction of monasteries thrived. Due to the troubled times many monasteries resembled fortresses. They usually had rectangular shape, the buildings surrounded a yard in which the main church was located. From the outside they had high stone walls reinforced with counterforts, and from the inside there were galleries with several stores which led towards the dwellings of the monks.\nResorts and nature tourism.\nSeaside resorts.\nThe Bulgarian Black Sea Coast is picturesque and diverse. White and golden sandy beaches occupy approximately 130\u00a0km of the 378\u00a0km long coast. The temperatures during the summer months are very suitable for marine tourism and the water temperature allows sea bathing from May to October. Prior to 1989 the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was internationally known as the Red Riviera. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, however, its nickname has been changed to the Bulgarian Riviera.\nHiking and skiing.\nThe country has several ski areas which offer excellent conditions for skiing, snowboarding, ski running and other winter sports.\nNational Parks.\nBulgaria has 3 national parks, 11 nature parks and 55 nature reserves. The first nature park in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula is Vitosha Nature Park, established in 1934.\nCaves and waterfalls.\nAs of 2002, there are around 4,500 discovered underground formations in Bulgaria. The earliest written records about the caves in Bulgaria are found in the manuscripts of the 17th century Bulgarian National Revival figure and historian Petar Bogdan. The first Bulgarian speleological society was established in 1929. The caves in the country are inhabited by more than 700 invertebrate species and 32 of the 37 species of bats found in Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is chiefly remembered for ending the decade-long war with the Bulgars, as well as initiating the second period of Byzantine iconoclasm.\nA senior general of Armenian origin, Leo distinguished himself under Nikephoros I and Michael I Rhangabe, eventually becoming the \"strat\u0113gos\" of the Anatolic Theme. Taking advantage of Michael's defeat at the Battle of Versinikia, he forced the emperor to abdicate in his favour. He was able to withhold the blockade of Constantinople by Krum of Bulgaria and, after Krum's death, concluded a 30-year peace with his successor Omurtag.\nIn 815, Leo deposed Patriarch Nikephoros and reinstituted iconoclasm. He was assassinated by supporters of Michael the Amorian, one of his most trusted generals, who succeeded him on the throne in 820.\nBackground.\nLeo was born c.\u2009775 in Umayyad Arminiya,431, 438 the son of the patrician Bardas, who was of Armenian descent. According to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo was also of Assyrian/Syrian descent. In his youth he fled with his family to the Byzantine Empire and enrolled in the army of the Anatolic Theme. In 802, the general Bardanes Tourkos took over the theme and married one of his daughters to Leo. When Bardanes rebelled, Leo deserted to Emperor Nikephoros I who promoted him to the position of \"strat\u0113gos\" of the Armeniac Theme. In 811, when Nikephoros was planning his major campaign against the Bulgars (which was to end disastrously), Arab raiders captured and destroyed the city of Euchaita in the Armeniac Theme\u2014a humiliating defeat in which the salaries of the thematic units were also lost. Nikephoros blamed this on Leo and exiled him. Punishment also included deprivation of his military rank, beating and hair cutting. However, a modern scholar suggests this \"Leo\" mentioned in the contemporary sources as being punished by Nikephoros was not the same as the later Emperor Leo.\nReign.\nRecalled by Michael I Rhangabe in 811, Leo became governor of the Anatolic Theme and conducted himself well in a war against the Arabs in 812, defeating the forces of the Cilician \"thughur\" under Thabit ibn Nasr. Leo survived the Battle of Versinikia in 813 by abandoning the battlefield, but nevertheless took advantage of this defeat to force the abdication of Michael I in his favor on 11 July 813. It was at this time that people assembled at the tomb of Constantine V, an emperor who was victorious against the Bulgars, and cried out to it: \"Arise and help the state which is perishing!\"257\nIn a diplomatic move, Leo wrote a letter to Patriarch Nikephoros in order to reassure him of his orthodoxy (Nikephoros being obviously afraid of a possible iconoclast revival). A further step in preventing future usurpations was the castration of Michael I's sons. One month later, during his entrance to the Palace quarter, he kneeled before the icon of Christ at the Chalke Gate, which was erected by Empress Irene.131\nLeo inherited a precarious situation. Within a week of his coronation, Khan Krum of Bulgaria blockaded both Adrianople and Constantinople by land. He agreed to negotiate in person with Krum but used the opportunity to attempt to have him assassinated. The stratagem failed, enraging Krum who sacked the suburbs of Constantinople and towns in southern Thrace. However, he abandoned his siege of the capital, and withdrew to capture and depopulate Adrianople. With this moment of respite, Leo divorced his allegedly adulterous wife and married the daughter of the \"patrikios\" Arsaber, the well-regarded Armenian noblewoman Theodosia, crowning her first son, the ten-year-old Symbatios, co-emperor, and renaming him Constantine, recalling the militarily successful iconoclast emperors of the eighth century, Leo III the Isaurian and Constantine V. In 814, Krum sacked Arcadiopolis and other Thracian towns, and planned a full-scale siege of Constantinople, but died of a stroke before he could begin, causing the Bulgar threat to finally recede.272\nThe beginning of the second iconoclasm.\nThe motives for the second iconoclasm appear to be more straightforward than in the first, and are much less contested among scholars. Like Emperor Philippikos' (r.\u2009711\u00a0\u2013\u00a0713) re-introduction of monothelitism in 711, Leo's adoption of iconoclasm was a strategy for imperial survival and a means of bolstering imperial authority (although it is noted that pragmatism and genuine conviction are not mutually exclusive, i.e., Leo may have had genuinely iconoclastic convictions). And just as Patriarch Nikephoros I and Theodore the Stoudite opposed imperial intervention in dogmatic matters, so too did Maximos the Confessor oppose the monothelite policies of Constans II (r.\u2009641\u00a0\u2013\u00a0688). In turn, Constans and Leo appealed to the legacy of Constantine the Great in convoking the First Council of Nicaea, and believed their actions were only a re-assertion of this legitimate imperial authority in spiritual matters.\nLeo informed his advisers of his opinion that recent emperors had suffered defeat because of their veneration of icons (or \"iconodulia\"), unlike the iconoclast emperors Leo III and Constantine V who were victorious against the Arabs and Bulgars. He appointed a theological commission led by the monk John the Grammarian (later Patriarch of Constantinople John VII). When called to comment, the iconodule Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople rejected the report and argued that the biblical passages quoted as condemning iconodulia were not dealing with \"holy images\" but with idols. Leo asked the commission to produce a more carefully researched document, and enlisted the help of a major bishop, Antony, later Patriarch of Constantinople from 821. In the second document, the commission stated that, since the military blamed their defeats by the Bulgars on iconodulia, a compromise must be sought in which only images hanging low in churches (which are therefore able to be venerated) would be removed, but Nikephoros resisted again. Leo asked Nikephoros to provide biblical proof-texts for iconodulia but he appealed instead to the notion of the long-standing tradition of iconodulia. Leo then proposed a debate with the commission, but Nikephoros refused to participate. While Leo was attempting to present himself as a just arbitrator of a debate, rather than as a tyrant imposing iconoclasm for secular reasons (as was the characterisation of many iconodule accounts), debate among clergy only resulted in a stalemate. Some soldiers of the imperial guard threw stones and mud at the icon of Christ over the Chalke Gate, shouting iconoclastic slogans, prompting Leo to have it replaced with a cross.432\nThis caused alarm among the clergy who met in the patriarchal palace on Christmas Eve 814. Patriarch Nikephoros refuted the document produced by the commission and had the clergy sign a pledge to oppose iconoclasm with their lives. The next day, Leo requested the iconodule clergy to engage in a debate with the commission, and kissed a small icon to demonstrate his desire for compromise. The influential iconodule abbot,Theodore the Stoudite, asked the Emperor not to involve himself in theological matters. After several weeks of correspondence and attempts by Leo to persuade clergy of the compromise proposal, Nikephoros remained unwavering in his views. At the beginning of Lent, he once again refused to discuss the issue and was deposed and exiled. Leo appointed the layman iconoclast Theodotos I, who held a synod to overturn the Second Council of Nicaea (787) and reaffirm the Council of Hieria (754) as the seventh ecumenical council. The \"Acts\" of the Council of Constantinople (815) differ from those of Hieria in that they do not charge the iconodules with idolatry, but rather \"folly\" and \"recklessness\": \"we determine that the making of images is neither venerable nor useful, but we refrain from calling them idols, because even in evil exist different degrees\". The central argument was that holy images were unsuitable if placed in areas that would implicitly or explicitly earn them the devotion and adoration which is due to God alone. Empress Irene was criticised for introducing the veneration of images, which are said to circumscribe the uncircumscribable and separate Christ's humanity from his divinity. In this sense, images are also called \"falsely-named\" in that they do not truly represent what they are said to, since they do not share in the essence of the person depicted. Images are also not said to be endowed with divine grace.\nLeo's compromise policy resulted in great success, and Theodore of Stoudion reports in a letter that virtually the whole clergy of Constantinople adopted the imperial position, along with many bishops and laymen throughout the Empire. Those who refused to take communion with Patriarch Theodotos were forced into exile, and opponents of iconoclasm were often sentenced to flogging. However, Theodore also refers to \"orthodox\" churches which commemorated the name of the iconoclast Patriarch but still practiced the veneration of icons. The Emperor seized the properties of iconodules and monasteries, such as the rich Monastery of Stoudios, exiling Theodore the Stoudite. He also exiled other bishops that opposed him such as Anthony the Confessor and Theophanes the Confessor.432289\nLeo likely realised that it was impossible to force everyone to agree with him, and so, similar to Constans II, was less concerned with convincing his opponents of iconoclasm than with convincing them to compromise and not pursue the matter further. In other words, he was more interested in ecclesiastical unity rather than strict iconoclasm. For example, in the \"Life\" of Nicetas of Medikion, it is reported that Patriarch Theodotos gave communion to iconodule monks while they were proclaiming \"Anathema to those who do not venerate the icon of Christ\". Icons were not tolerated in prominent public spaces but were allowed in private, so long as people recognised the iconoclast Patriarch.380\nLater years.\nShortly after the reinstitution of iconoclasm, the new Khan of Bulgaria, Omurtag, executed his Byzantine captives who refused to renounce Christianity, raided Thrace and ignored an imperial embassy, forcing Leo to fight. In the Battle of Mesembria of spring 816, Leo marched to the environs of Mesembria (Nesebar), camping near the Bulgars, pretending to flee and then ambushing them as they pursued him. He decisively defeated the Bulgar army and raided Bulgar territory, then concluding a 30-year peace treaty with Omurtag which restored the frontier of 780. According to some sources, Krum participated in the battle and abandoned the battlefield heavily injured.\nWhile Leo was successful on the Bulgar front, relations with the Franks and the Papacy were difficult. Theodotos attempted to establish friendly relations with Pope Paschal I (817\u2013824) but was rebuffed. Theodore the Stoudite pre-empted these efforts through his correspondence with Paschal beforehand, in which he criticised the iconoclast patriarch and directly appealed to the papacy to restore orthodoxy in the Byzantine Empire. \nLeo then worked to consolidate the Empire by rebuilding the Thracesian and Macedonian Themes. In 817, he sent fleets to raid the weakened Abbasid Caliphate and led an army to retake the frontier fortress of Kamachon which was lost under Constantine VI. In 818, the Rus' raided the Empire for the first time, specifically the northern coast of Anatolia, which Leo responded to by reinforcing the Armeniac Theme with naval squadrons. There was also mounting underground opposition to Leo's reign and iconoclasm especially among monastic communities, one of the leaders of which was Theodore the Stoudite. In 820, Leo uncovered and punished a conspiracy against him. Nevertheless, it appeared to Leo, his iconoclast supporters and even some iconodules that the Empire was now in God's favour with the reinstitution of iconoclasm, which had coincided with victory over the Bulgars as it had with Constantine V.433282 Even sources vehemently hostile to Leo (e.g., Theophanes Continuatus and Patriarch Nikephoros) acknowledge his competence in managing state affairs. Although, as with all iconoclast emperors, his actions and intentions cannot be easily reconstructed due to the extreme bias of the iconodule sources (there are no surviving contemporary iconoclast sources of any kind). \nAssassination.\nThe conspiracy which was to overthrow Leo was led by the Domestic of the Excubitors, Michael the Amorian, who disapproved of Leo's divorce and remarriage (he was married to the sister of the divorc\u00e9e). In late 820, agents of the Postal Logothete uncovered the plot. Leo imprisoned him and sentenced him to death by burning, but Empress consort Theodosia arranged a postponement of the execution until after Christmas.433 This allowed Michael to organise plotters to carry out the assassination of the Emperor in the palace chapel of St. Stephen on Christmas Eve. Leo was attending the \"matins\" service when a group of assassins disguised as members of the choir due to sing in the service suddenly threw off their robes and drew their weapons.\nIn the dim light they mistook the officiating priest for the Emperor and the confusion allowed Leo to snatch a heavy cross from the altar and defend himself. He called for his guards, but the conspirators had barred the doors and within a few moments a sword stroke had severed his arm, and he fell before the communion-table, where his body was hewed in pieces. His remains were dumped unceremoniously in the snow and the assassins hurried to the dungeons to free Michael. \nUnfortunately for them Leo had hidden the key on his person, and since it was too early in the morning to find a blacksmith, Michael was hastily crowned as emperor with the iron clasps still around his legs. Leo's family (including his mother and his wife, Theodosia) was exiled to monasteries on the Princes' Islands. His four sons (including ex co-emperor Symbatios) were castrated, a procedure so brutally carried out that one of them died during the \"operation\".\nAssessment and legacy.\nWhile the Byzantine bureaucracy preferred the new emperor Michael II (r.\u2009820\u00a0\u2013\u00a0829) to Leo, who reinitiated the iconoclast controversy, Leo was popular with the army due to his military victories. Upon news of his assassination, the Anatolic Theme proclaimed Thomas the Slav, who had served with Leo and Michael under Bardanes Tourkos, rightful emperor and avenger of Leo. The Bucellarian, Paphlagonian and Cibyrrhaeot Themes immediately sided with the Anatolics, leading to the outbreak of civil war in 821.434 Despite overthrowing Leo, Michael continued his iconoclast policies.289\nThe second Byzantine iconoclasm was more moderate than the first. Images that were not actively venerated were permitted and iconodules were not accused of idolatry. There is no substantial evidence that Leo was a fierce persecutor of iconodules as some accounts claim. And further, it is most likely that the second iconoclasm was a genuine reflection of anxiety in the military and the Constantinopolitan population. The military especially was clearly inspired by the heroic image of the iconoclast Constantine V. Leo found more allies in the clergy, especially the learned figure of John VII of Constantinople, his appointee. By the reign of Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842), Theodore the Stoudite and most iconodule bishops had died. However, iconoclasm never had a strong base in the Church, and was easily abolished after Theophilos' death by Empress regent Theodora. John VII was replaced by the iconodule Methodios I. After the institution of the liturgical Feast of Orthodoxy on 11 March 843, now a symbol of the Eastern Orthodox faith, iconoclasm was very rarely defended by any Byzantine clergy. The efforts of the church to affirm its autonomy against imperial authority permanently excluded the Byzantine emperors from ruling on matters of dogma and established the Patriarch of Constantinople as the uncontested head of the church.553\nLeo resembled the emperors of Isaurian dynasty in ways besides his iconoclasm. By later chroniclers, he was given the reputation of being populist and eager to both pursue justice and undo injustices carried out by the Byzantine bureaucracy.275 He was a particularly active military leader, going on campaign almost every year.273\nPossible descendants.\nNicholas Adontz, in his book \"The age and origins of the emperor Basil I\" (1933), expressed a theory that Leo V and Theodosia were ancestors of Basil I. The theory was partly based on the account of his ancestry given by Constantine VII, a grandson of Basil I, as well as the accounts given by Theophanes Continuatus. Basil I, according to these accounts, was a son of peasants. His mother is named by Constantine VII as \"Pankalo\". The name of his father was not recorded, but the names Symbatios (Smbat) and Constantine have been suggested; both were names used by the eldest sons of Basil, with eldest sons of Byzantines typically named after their grandfathers. The paternal grandfather of Basil is named as Maiactes (or Hmayeak in Armenian). Basil's paternal grandmother was not named but was identified as a daughter of \"Leo\", a citizen of Constantinople. Adontz identified this Leo as Leo V, which would make Leo V and Theodosia great-grandparents of Basil I. \nThe scholar Chris Bennett has hypothesised that, for this theory to be true, Leo's daughter would have to have been of marriageable age between the years 780 to 797, which given the ages of her brothers (all born after 800) is unlikely. However, as a counter-argument Bennett has also suggested that Constantine VII may have made a mistake when determining the years separating Maiactes and Basil, and that the latter may have been born at least 20 years after his reported birth date of c. 811. This would indicate that it was Basil's father, rather than Basil himself, who was born at this time and had witnessed the wars with Krum of Bulgaria, and that Leo's daughter could therefore have been born (rather than married) in the 790s, which would make Adontz' theory possible.\nAdontz' theory has been accepted by several genealogists, including Christian Settipani in his search for descent from antiquity. The name \"Anna\" has been suggested for the daughter of Leo V and Theodosia, because it was given to daughters of Basil I, Leo VI the Wise, Constantine VII and Romanos II \u2013 almost every emperor that would claim descent from this woman.\nFamily.\nAll known children of Leo V are traditionally attributed to his wife Theodosia, a daughter of the patrician Arsaber. Genesius records four sons:\nThe existence of a daughter has been debated by historians and genealogists. The tentative name \"Anna\" has been suggested (see above). She married Hmayeak, a Mamikonian prince (died c. 797), by whom she had Konstantinos, an officer at the court of Emperor Michael III.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are commonly referred to as Koopas, a more broad classification of creatures that includes Bowser, his Koopalings, and Lakitu. Predecessors to Koopa Troopas, first appeared in the 1983 game \"Mario Bros.\", while Koopa Troopas themselves debuted two years later in \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985). Koopa Troopas are a common staple in most \"Super Mario\" and spinoff games. When defeated, they may flee from or retreat inside their shells, which can usually be used as weapons. Koopa shells are a recurring weapon in the franchise, particularly popularized in the \"Mario Kart\" series, in which they can be fired as projectiles against other racers. Despite making up the bulk of Bowser's army, Koopa Troopas are often shown to be peaceful, sometimes even teaming up with protagonist Mario.\nConcept and creation.\nAfter the release and success of the arcade game \"Donkey Kong\" (1981), Nintendo began work on a follow-up game more prominently focusing on the character of Mario, which released as \"Mario Bros.\" (1983). The idea of creating a turtle enemy came as a result of developing its core gameplay mechanics. After designers Gunpei Yokoi and Shigeru Miyamoto established that the game would revolve around Mario possessing superhuman jumping abilities that were to be used to jump between different floors or platforms, they approached how enemies would be attacked. They came up with the idea of the player attacking enemies from one level below, making Mario hit his ceiling so that it would bump the enemy's floor and defeat them. However, this method of defeating enemies was deemed too easy in playtesting, so they instead implemented a two-step approach of having to stun the enemies first. When thinking about what types of enemies it would make sense to stun like this, they came up with the idea of a turtle getting stuck after getting knocked upside down on its shell. So the gameplay was set up so that the player would now hit the turtle from below, knocking it on its back, and then jump directly on it to defeat it before it was able to correct itself.\nWith the premise established, they turned to creating the turtle character itself. Miyamoto initially dictated what he wanted it to look like to a Nintendo designer, but the initial draft came out looking like a very realistic looking turtle that Miyamoto felt did not fit in well with the rest of the \"Mario\" art style. Instead, Miyamoto drew the concept art himself, emphasizing a cartoonish large head and more of a tortoise-like shape. With discussing the anatomy of turtles with fellow Nintendo staffer Hirokazu Tanaka, they came up with the idea of the turtle character getting knocked out of its shell entirely. While conceding that this is not how turtle shells work, Miyamoto liked the idea because it helped with visualizing when the turtle was still in a stunned state; out of its shell, it was stunned, and once it returned, it was active again. While initially wondered if this was a form of \"lying to children\", in the end, he decided that the ability to entirely remove the body from the shell would be a key difference between a turtle and a Koopa Troopa.\nFor the \"Mario Bros.\" game the character would be named \"Shellcreepers\", but in subsequent \"Super Mario\" games, the character would be renamed Koopa Troopa. Up until very late pre-release builds of its follow up game, \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1985), Koopa Troopa was the only enemy in the game; however, playtesting found that his 2-step process of defeating him was too difficult for early stages of the game. Rather than change Koopa Troopa, this led to the creation of another long-running \"Mario\" character \u2013 the Goomba. Similarly, when developer Takashi Tezuka wished to create a new enemy character that could fly, he found himself unable to due to size and memory restrictions of the Nintendo Entertainment System hardware. Instead, to save on memory he decided to build off of the established Koopa Troopa design by adding wings to the top of his shell. While Miyamoto expressed hesitation at first, he was convinced when he saw the final design, and thus, the Koopa Paratroopa was born and implemented into the game. As Nintendo progressed with developing games for more powerful hardware, this allowed for further developments on the evolution of Koopa Troopas. \"Super Mario World\" (1991), the first \"Super Mario\" game for the more powerful Super Nintendo platform, allowed for more advanced movement and animations, including unshelled Koopa Troopas who flew around in capes and slid down hills. This later influenced the development of \"Super Mario Bros. Wonder\" (2023) as well; when developers were looking for ways to update old character designs with new animations and designs, the Rolla Koopa \u2013 a Koopa Troopa who moves around on roller skates, was created. More powerful hardware also lead to a more vibrant yellow and green color scheme for the character.\nAppearances.\nVideo games.\nSince their creation and first appearances in \"Mario Bros.\" and \"Super Mario Bros.\", Koopa Troopa have become a staple in the \"Mario\" series and subseries. Koopa Troopa has reappeared in most entries of the \"Super Mario\" line of platform games. They commonly retain their original traits of wandering aimlessly through levels, and requiring to be knocked out of their shell prior to their defeat. After defeat, their shells often remain, and can be grabbed, thrown, or bumped as a projectile to attack other enemies or alter the game environment.\nThey are also featured prominently in many spinoff series as well. They have been included as a playable character in most entries in the \"Mario Kart\" racing series. Koopa Shells are used as an obtainable projectile weapon to shoot at other players in every entry as well. Similarly, Koopa Shells are used in the same manner in entries of the \"Mario Tennis\" and \"Mario Strikers\" (soccer) series as well, with playable character options sporadically occurring across entries. They are playable in some \"Mario Golf\" entries as well. While not present as playable characters in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, their shells have appeared as projectile weapons to be launched at other characters in every entry of the series. Koopa Troopas appear as hosts or extra minor characters across all entries of the \"Mario Party\" board game/minigame series, and is a playable character in \"Mario Party 9\" and \"Super Mario Party\".\nIn other media.\nKoopa Troopas commonly appear in other \"Mario\" media as well. They were featured prominently in the 2023 \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" as part of Bowser's army. The film introduced the Spiny shell Koopa Troopa; \"Mario Kart\" has prominently feature the infamous blue shell item, but the film was first to see the shell used on actual characters. They largely retain their roles from the game as minions in Bowser's army, and general appearance from the modern games, albeit with wearing armor and spiked shells. Toys of a Koopa Troopa riding a bike were released in promotion of the 2023 film as well. In addition to toys, they were also featured in multiple toys-to-life iterations, including getting his own Amiibo in 2017. They appear in the Wii U version of \"\", being summoned by Bowser during one of his special moves. Their signature shell was included as a player piece in the Nintendo version of the \"Monopoly\" board game.\nReception and legacy.\nKoopa Troopa has gone on to become one of the most commonly recognizable enemies in the \"Mario\" franchise alongside Goomba. \"IGN\"'s Audrey Drake listed Koopa Troopa as one of the best \"Mario\" enemies, saying that it is one of the most \"iconic \"Mario\" enemies out there. In fact, they're pretty much synonymous with the franchise.\" In October 2022, \"The Daily Dot\" reported that a Koopa Troopa video clip from a \"New Super Mario Bros.\" game went viral on TikTok. In the video, two Koopa Troopas running in unison slowly make progress in crossing a spinning circular platform. However, in this game, Koopa Troopas always stop and briefly dance whenever a \"bah bah\" sound clip plays in the game's background music. In the clip, they stop and dance, and it cancels all of their progress on traversing the spinning platform, keeping them stuck in a loop. The video elicited much commentary on Koopa Troopas being forced to dance at inopportune times. The Koopa Troopa clip amassed 20 million views in under a month, and inspired over 20,000 similar videos related to Koopa Troopas dancing to the sound clip.\nThe design of Koopa Troopa would influence and impact the creation of other \"Mario\" characters as well. In creating a second playable character for \"Mario Bros.\", the developers decided to make a palette swapped version of Mario, and due to hardware limitations regarding how many different colors could be appearing on screen, they decided to use the green color used for Koopa Troopa, eventually leading to the creation of Luigi and his trademark green color scheme. Koopa Troopa's design also influenced Bowser's final design. Miyamoto's initial instructions to character designer Yoichi Kotabe resulted in more of an ox-like character design, and their efforts to revise his art to make him look more like Koopa Troopas resulted in Bowser's final design.\nKoopa Troopa has later been used by Nintendo in larger scale promotions outside of video games as well. In 2015, the character was part of Nintendo's float at the Toronto Santa Claus Parade. They've also become an integral part of the Super Nintendo World theme park area in Universal parks. Koopa Troopa animatronics are found wandering throughout the park, while restaurants serve up Koopa Troopa calzones. A Koopa Troopa also serves as one of the bosses of their real world adventure games, while a Koopa Troopa and its shell are central one of the parks central games, \"Koopa Troopa POWer Punch\". In it, players in real life attempt to hit POW Blocks to knock over Koopa Troopas, similar to early \"Mario\" games.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its eponymous character is an Indian water-carrier (a \"bhishti\") who, after the narrator is wounded in battle, saves his life, only to be shot and killed. In the final three lines, the soldier regrets the abuse that he dealt to Din and admits that Din is the better man. The poem was published as part of a set of martial poems called the \"Barrack-Room Ballads\".\nIn contrast to Kipling's later poem \"The White Man's Burden\", \"Gunga Din\" is named after the Indian and portrays him as a heroic character who is not afraid to face danger on the battlefield as he tends to wounded men. The English soldiers who order Din around and beat him for not bringing water to them fast enough are presented as being callous and shallow and ultimately inferior to him.\nAlthough \"Din\" is frequently pronounced to rhyme with \"pin\", the rhymes within the poem make it clear that it should be pronounced , to rhyme with \"green\".\nT. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection \"A Choice of Kipling's Verse\".\nActor Clifton Crawford was a famous performer of the poem; first doing so in the Broadway musical \"Three Twins\" (1908-1909) and later as a monologist.\nAdaptations and references in popular culture.\nIn the 1968 film \"The Party\", starring Peter Sellers as the main character Hrundi V Bakshi, there is a beginning segment that references Gunga Din. Hrundi (Sellers) portrays the \"Son of Gunga Din\".\nGrantland Rice's 1917 column describing Heinie Zimmerman's infamous World Series gaffe wherein Zimmerman futilely chased speedster Eddie Collins across home plate (rather than initiating a rundown by tossing the ball to a player covering home) ended with \"I'm a faster man than you are, Heinie Zim.\"\nThe poem inspired the 1939 adventure film \"Gunga Din\" from RKO Pictures, starring Sam Jaffe in the title role, along with Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Joan Fontaine. This movie was remade in 1961 as \"Sergeants 3\", starring the Rat Pack with Sammy Davis Jr. as the Gunga Din character, in which the locale was moved from British-colonial India to the old West. Many elements of the 1939 film were also incorporated into \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". The film \"Three Kings\", set during the Gulf War of 1990\u20131991, also has many resemblances, including a \"heist theme\", to the film \"Gunga Din\".\nRobert Sheckley's short story \"Human Man's Burden\" (1956, anthologized in \"Pilgrimage to Earth\") alludes to the story by featuring a robotic servant named Gunga Sam, programmed to behave in a manner similar to the stereotypical colonial native servant. While stated to have no soul, he ultimately proves to be no less human and wise than his owner in actions.\nIn 1958, Bobby Darin wrote and recorded the song \"That's the Way Love Is\" in which, referring to the unsolved riddle of love, he sings \"And if ya come up with the answer, You're a better man, sir, than I ... Gunga Din\".\nIn 1964 Duane Hiatt and the group The 3Ds released an album of classic poetry set to music, including Gunga Din, with lyrics almost word for word from Kipling's poem.\nSongwriter Jim Croce set the words to music as \"The Ballad of Gunga Din\" and released it on his 1966 \"Facets\" album.\nIn \"Carry On Up the Khyber\" (1968), part of the \"Carry On\" series of British comedy films, the rebel warrior chief is called Bungdit Din (Bernard Bresslaw), a parody of Gunga Din. In a scene where he boasts of wiping out the Khyber Pass garrison, the \"Khazi of Kalabar\" (Kenneth Williams) replies: \"You're a better man than me, Bungdit Din.\"\nGunga Din is the only fictional person, out of more than twenty individuals mentioned, in the 1970 Neil Diamond song \"Done Too Soon\".\nIn 1996, the animated television series \"Animaniacs\" featured a segment called \"Gunga Dot\", in which the \"Warner Sister\" Dot has a job serving water to the patrons of a resort in a boiling hot desert near Bombay. After growing tired of the constant complaining, she releases the valve on the Warner Bros. Water Tower, which placates the guests and somehow creates the Indian Ocean.\nIn The Sopranos Season 1 Episode 6 'Pax Soprana' Livia Soprano states the woman living next door is constantly running water and states \"Water, water, water. It's like I'm living next to Gunga Din!\"\nIn 2015, The Libertines, an English rock band, composed the single \"Gunga Din\" for their comeback album \"Anthems for Doomed Youth\". The verse \"You are a better man than I am\" is used throughout the lyrics.\nIn the song by Australian Paul Kelly, \"Forty miles to Saturday night\", there is a line, \"And a band down there called Gunga Din\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born to Emperor Constantine V and Empress Tzitzak in 750. He was elevated to co-emperor in the next year, in 751, and married to Irene of Athens in 769. When Constantine V died in September 775, while campaigning against the Bulgars, Leo IV became senior emperor. In 778 Leo raided Abbasid Syria, decisively defeating the Abbasid army outside of Germanikeia. Leo died on 8 September 780, of tuberculosis. He was succeeded by his underage son Constantine VI, with Irene serving as regent.\nBiography.\nLeo IV was born on 25 January 750AD, to Emperor Constantine V and his first wife, Empress Tzitzak who had been given the Christian name Eirene. Because his mother was a Khazar, Leo was given the epithet 'the Khazar'. Leo was elevated to co-emperor in 751, while still an infant. He became emperor on 14 September 775, after Constantine V died while campaigning against the Bulgarian Empire.\nLeo was by this point suffering from tuberculosis, which, combined with the infancy of his son, Constantine VI, gave two of Leo's half-brothers, the \"caesares\" Nikephoros and Christopher, hope of attaining the throne. These hopes were crushed when, in 776, Leo elevated Constantine to \"caesar\", declaring him to be his successor. Shortly after this, Nikephoros and Christopher were discovered conspiring against Leo. Despite public opinion supporting the execution of the pair, Leo instead chose to pardon them, although he did exile several other plotters to Cherson.\nIn 776\u2013777, Khan Telerig of Bulgaria sought refuge in Constantinople, was baptized in the presence of Leo and married a relation of the empress consort Irene of Athens. This demonstrates close relations between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgars during Leo's reign, which were facilitated by his father Constantine V's successful campaigns against them between 760 and 775, establishing a state of peace.\nLeo continued with his father's resettlement policies, relocating prisoners from cities on the Arab border (Germanikeia, Melitene and Theodosioupolis) to newly-constructed military encampments or fortresses (\"castra\") in Thrace.\nCampaigns against the Abbasid Caliphate.\nCaliph al-Mahdi (r.\u2009775\u00a0\u2013\u00a0785) of the Abbasids launched an invasion of the Byzantine Empire in 776 with himself present. The Byzantines retaliated in 778, invading Syria with a force made up of the armies of the multiple themes, including: the Opsikion Theme, led by Gregory; the Anatolic Theme, led by Artabasdos; the Armeniac Theme, led by Karisterotzes; the Bucellarian Theme, led by Tatzates; and the Thracesian Theme, led by the favourite commander of the Isaurian dynasty, Michael Lachanodrakon. Lachanodrakon besieged Germanikeia for a time, then lifted the siege (according to Theophanes the Confessor, he was bribed to do so) and began to raid the surrounding countryside, deporting many Jacobite Christians to Thrace. The Abbasids attacked Lachanodrakon while he was raiding, but were decisively defeated by several Byzantine armies. The Byzantine generals who led troops during this battle were given a triumphal entry when they returned to Constantinople. In 779, Leo successfully repelled an attack by the Abbasids against Asia Minor.\nDeath and succession.\nLeo died of a violent fever, due to his tuberculosis, on 8 September 780. Nine-year-old Constantine became the new emperor with Irene as his regent.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73956", "revid": "34360570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73956", "title": "Adobe FrameMaker", "text": "Software for writing complex documents\nAdobe FrameMaker is a document processor designed for writing and editing large or complex documents, including structured documents. It was originally developed by Frame Technology Corporation, which was bought by Adobe.\nOverview.\nFrameMaker became an Adobe product in October 1995 when Adobe purchased Frame Technology Corp. Adobe added SGML support, which was eventually adapted into XML support. In April 2004, Adobe stopped supporting FrameMaker for the Macintosh.\nThis reinvigorated rumors surfacing in 2001 that product development and support for FrameMaker were being wound down. Adobe denied these rumors in 2001, later releasing FrameMaker 8 at the end of July 2007, FrameMaker 9 in 2009, FrameMaker 10 in 2011, FrameMaker 11 in 2012, FrameMaker 12 in 2014, FrameMaker (2015 release - confusingly, internal version 13.0) in June 2015, FrameMaker 2017 (internal version 14.0) in January 2017, FrameMaker 2019 (internal version 15.0) in August 2018, FrameMaker 2020 (internal version 16.0) in 2020, and FrameMaker 2022 (internal version 17.0) in 2022.\nFrameMaker has two ways of approaching documents: structured and unstructured.\nWhen a user opens a structured file in unstructured FrameMaker, the structure is lost.\nMIF.\nMIF (Maker Interchange Format) is a markup language that functions as a companion to FrameMaker. MIF always had 3 purposes. The first was to represent FrameMaker documents in a relatively simple ASCII-based format, which can be produced or understood by other software systems and also by human operators. The second was to ensure any version of FrameMaker could read a document produced by any other version, at least to the extent it had the same features. While every version of FrameMaker could read the last couple of version's documents, reading them all took too much software effort and testing, so reading MIF was sufficient. The third was to ensure that FrameMaker would never lose a writer's work. If FrameMaker crashed, it would first write out the current document in MIF.\nAny document that can be created interactively in FrameMaker can also be represented, exactly and completely, in MIF (the reverse, however, is not true: a few FrameMaker features are available only through MIF). All versions of FrameMaker can export documents in MIF, and can also read MIF documents, including documents created by an earlier version or by another program.\nHistory.\nFrame Technology was founded in 1986 by David Murray, Charles Corfield, Steven Kirsch, and Vickie Blackslee.\nWhile working on his doctorate in astrophysics at Columbia University, Corfield, a mathematician alumnus of the St John's College, Cambridge, decided to write a WYSIWYG document editor on a Sun-2 workstation. \nThe only substantial DTP product at the time of FrameMaker's conception was Interleaf, which also ran on Sun workstations.\nAfter only a few months, Corfield had completed a functional prototype he called /etc/publisher. The prototype caught the eye of salesmen at the fledgling Sun Microsystems, which lacked commercial applications to showcase the graphics capabilities of their workstations. They got permission from Corfield to use the prototype of /etc/publisher as demoware for their computers.\nKirsch and Blakeslee were founding members of Mouse Systems, where they brought on Murray as Director of Application Software Development. In early 1986, Kirsch and Murray were visiting Sun Microsystems where they were given a demonstration of /etc/publisher. They thought there was a great opportunity for this and contacted Corfield. After several days of meetings they decided to form a company together. Kirsch, Murray, and Blakeslee left Mouse Systems and Corfield moved from New York to join them.\nOriginally written for SunOS (a variant of UNIX) on Sun machines, FrameMaker was a popular technical writing tool, and the company was profitable early on. Because of the flourishing desktop publishing market on the Apple Macintosh, the software was ported to the Mac as its second platform.\nIn the early 1990s, a wave of UNIX workstation vendors\u2014Apollo, Data General, MIPS, Motorola and Sony\u2014provided funding to Frame Technology for an OEM version for their platforms.\nAt the height of its success, FrameMaker ran on more than thirteen UNIX platforms, including NeXT Computer's NeXTSTEP, Dell's System V Release 4 UNIX and IBM's AIX operating systems.\nSun Microsystems and AT&amp;T were promoting the OPEN LOOK GUI standard to win over Motif, so Sun contracted Frame Technology to implement a version of FrameMaker on their PostScript-based NeWS windowing system. The NeWS version of FrameMaker was successfully released to those customers adopting the OPEN LOOK standards.\nAt this point, FrameMaker was considered an extraordinary product for its day, not only enabling authors to produce highly structured documents with relative ease, but also giving users a great deal of typographical control in a reasonably intuitive and totally WYSIWYG way. The output documents could be of very high typographical quality.\nFrame Technology later ported FrameMaker to Microsoft Windows, but the company lost direction soon after its release. Up to this point, FrameMaker had been targeting a professional market for highly technical publications, such as the maintenance manuals for the Boeing 777 project, and licensed each copy for $2,500. But the Windows version brought the product to the $500 price range, which cannibalized its own non-Windows customer base.\nThe company's attempt to sell sophisticated technical publishing software to the home DTP market was a disaster. A tool designed for a 1,000-page manual was too cumbersome and difficult for an average home user to type a one-page letter.\nAdobe Systems acquired the product and returned the focus to the professional market. Then, they released a new version under the name Adobe FrameMaker 5.1 in 1996. Today, Adobe FrameMaker is still a widely used publication tool for technical writers, although no version has been released for the Mac OS X operating system, limiting use of the product. The decision to cancel FrameMaker for OS X caused considerable friction between Adobe and Mac users, including Apple itself, which relied on it for creating documentation. As late as 2008, Apple manuals for OS X Leopard and the iPhone were still being developed on FrameMaker 7 in Classic mode; Apple has since switched to using InDesign.\nFrameMaker versions 5.x through 7.2 (from mid-1995 to 2005) did not contain updates to major parts of the program (including its general user interface, table editing, and illustration editing), concentrating instead on bug fixes and the integration of XML-oriented features (previously part of the FrameMaker+SGML premium product). FrameMaker did not feature multiple undo until version 7.2 (its 2005 release).\nFrameMaker 8 (2007) introduced Unicode, Flash, 3D, and built-in DITA support. Platform support included Windows (2000, XP, and Vista) and Sun Solaris (8, 9, and 10).\nFrameMaker 9 (2009) introduced a redesigned user interface and several enhancements, including: full support for DITA, support for more media types, better PDF output, and enhanced WebDAV-based CMS integration. Platform support for Sun Solaris and Windows 2000 was dropped, leaving Windows XP and Windows Vista as the sole remaining platforms.\nFrameMaker 10 (2011) again refined the user interface and introduced several changes, including: integration with content management systems via EMC Documentum 6.5 with Service Pack 1 and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 with Service Pack 2.\nAlternatives and competition.\nThere were several major competitors in the technical publishing market, such as Arbortext, Interleaf, and Corel Ventura. Many academic users now use LaTeX, because modern editors have made that system increasingly user-friendly, and LyX allows LaTeX to be generated with little or no knowledge of LaTeX. Several formats, including DocBook XML, target authors of technical documents about computer hardware and software. Lastly, alternatives to FrameMaker for technical writing include Help authoring tools and XML editors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

AD 50), called Ukk\u0101m\u0101 (meaning \"the Black\" in Syriac and other dialects of Aramaic), was the King of Osroene with his capital at Edessa.\nBackground.\nAbgar was described as \"king of the Arabs\" by the Roman historian Tacitus, a near-contemporary source. The 5th-century Armenian historian Moses of Chorene depicted Abgar as an Armenian, but modern scholarly consensus agree that the Abgarids were in fact an Arab dynasty.\nMoses of Chorene notes that Abgar V's chief wife was Queen Helena of Adiabene, but according to the contemporary Jewish historian Josephus she was the wife of King Monobaz I of Adiabene.\nLetter of Abgar to Jesus.\nAbgar V is said to be one of the first Christian kings, having been converted to the faith by Thaddeus of Edessa, one of the seventy disciples.\nThe church historian Eusebius recorded that the Edessan archives contained a copy of a correspondence exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus. The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. On 15 August 944, the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae in Constantinople received the letter and the Mandylion. Both relics were then moved to the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.\nThis account enjoyed great popularity in the East and in the West during the Middle Ages. Jesus' letter was copied on parchment, inscribed in marble and metal, and used as a talisman or an amulet. Of this correspondence, there survives not only a Syriac text, but an Armenian translation as well, two independent Greek versions, shorter than the Syriac, and several inscriptions on stone.\nScholars have disputed many aspects of this account such as whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, or whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus.\nThe text of the letter was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJesus gave the messenger the reply to return to Abgar:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Blessed are you who hast believed in me without having seen me. For it is written concerning me, that they who have seen me will not believe in me, and that they who have not seen me will believe and be saved. But in regard to what you have written me, that I should come to you, it is necessary for me to fulfill all things here for which I have been sent, and after I have fulfilled them, thus to be taken up again to him that sent me. But after I have been taken up, I will send to you one of my disciples, that he may heal your disease and give life to you and yours.\nEgeria wrote of the letter in her account of her pilgrimage in Edessa. She read the letter during her stay around 384, and remarked that the copy in Edessa was \"fuller\" than the copies in her home (which was likely France).\nIn addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to it; the \"Liber Hymnorum\", a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches.\nThis event has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches. Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on 11 May and 28 October in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Thursday of the Third Week of Lent (Mid-Lent) in the Syriac Orthodox Church, and daily in the Mass of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nCritical scholarship.\nA number of contemporary scholars have suggested origins of the tradition of Abgar's conversion apart from historical record. Walter Bauer argued the legend was written without sources to reinforce group cohesiveness, orthodoxy, and apostolic succession against heretical schismatics. However, several distinct sources, known to have not been in contact with one another, claimed to have seen the letters in the archives, so his claim is suspect.\nSignificant advances in scholarship on the topic have been made including Desreumaux's translation with commentary, M. Illert's collection of textual witnesses to the legend, and detailed studies of the ideology of the sources by Brock, Griffith and Mirkovic. The majority of scholars now claim the goal of the authors and editors of texts regarding the conversion of Abgar were not so much concerned with historical reconstruction of the Christianisation of Edessa as the relationships between church and state power, based on the political and ecclesiological ideas of Ephraem the Syrian. However, the origins of the story are still far from certain, although the stories as recorded seem to have been shaped by the controversies of the third century CE, especially as a response to Bardaisan.\nLetters of Abgar to Tiberius.\nLetters between Abgar V and the Roman Emperor Tiberius are also recorded in history, by for instance the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, scholars as Ilaria Ramelli have argued for the core of these being essentially authentic based on:\n This work seems to preserve very ancient material, such as the information on the friendship between Abgar, correctly called toparkh\u00eas of Edessa, and the prefect of Egypt, in my view probably A. Avillius Flaccus, who ruled Egypt AD 32 to 38\u2014just the years of Vitellius\u2019 mandate in the Near East and of the Abgar-Tiberius correspondence\u2014and is well known to us thanks to Philo, \"In Flaccum\", 1-3; 25; 40; 116; 158. He was one of the most intimate friends of Tiberius; he was born and grew up in Rome with Augustus\u2019 nieces, obtained the government of Egypt, a direct possession of the emperor, and probably helped the good relationship between Abgar and Tiberius that is evident in their correspondence.\nAbgar's initial letter to Tiberius read:\nAbgar, king of Armenia, to my Lord Tiberius, emperor of the Romans, greeting:\u2014\nI know that nothing is unknown to your Majesty, but, as your friend, I would make you better acquainted with the facts by writing. The Jews who dwell in the cantons of Palestine have crucified Jesus: Jesus without sin, Jesus after so many acts of kindness, so many wonders and miracles wrought for their good, even to the raising of the dead. Be assured that these are not the effects of the power of a simple mortal, but of God. During the time that they were crucifying Him, the sun was darkened, the earth was moved, shaken; Jesus Himself, three days afterwards, rose from the dead and appeared to many. Now, everywhere, His name alone, invoked by His disciples, produces the greatest miracles: what has happened to myself is the most evident proof of it. Your august Majesty knows henceforth what ought to be done in future with respect to the Jewish nation, which has committed this crime; your Majesty knows whether a command should not be published through the whole universe to worship Christ as the true God. Safety and health.\nTiberius' reply read:\nTiberius, emperor of the Romans, to Abgar, king of the Armenians, greeting:\u2014\nYour kind letter has been read to me, and I wish that thanks should be given to you from me. Though we had already heard several persons relate these facts, Pilate has officially informed us of the miracles of Jesus. He has certified to us that after His resurrection from the dead He was acknowledged by many to be God. Therefore I myself also wished to do what you propose; but, as it is the custom of the Romans not to admit a god merely by the command of the sovereign, but only when the admission has been discussed and examined in full senate, I proposed the affair to the senate, and they rejected it with contempt, doubtless because it had not been considered by them first. But we have commanded all those whom Jesus suits, to receive him among the gods. We have threatened with death any one who shall speak evil of the Christians. As to the Jewish nation which has dared to crucify Jesus, who, as I hear, far from deserving the cross and death, was worthy of honour, worthy of the adoration of men \u2014 when I am free from the war with rebellious Spain, I will examine into the matter, and will treat the Jews as they deserve.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Developed and published by Nintendo, it is the second installment in the \"Mario Kart\" series after 1992's \"Super Mario Kart\". The game retains the gameplay of its predecessor: the player, controlling a \"Mario\" franchise character, races opponents around tracks based on locales from the \"Super Mario\" platform games. Tracks contain obstacles to slow the player down and item boxes which give the player power-ups to aid in their progress. \"Mario Kart 64\" contains different single-player and local multiplayer game modes, including a Grand Prix racing mode and a last man standing battle mode.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" was first revealed in 1995 alongside the N64. The development team focused on best utilising the console's technology for smooth gameplay, rather than innovating significantly on its predecessor, in order to appeal to a wide audience. Developers were bounded by the N64's processing power and made use of rendering techniques to save on memory, and used car physics simulations to aid the game's kart design. \"Mario Kart 64\" was released in late 1996 in Japan and in 1997 worldwide, months after the launch of the N64.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" was received positively by critics. The track designs, multiplayer, and presentation were lauded, while criticism was directed towards its technical issues and difficulty. The game sold 9.87\u00a0million copies worldwide, making it the second-best-selling N64 game. \"Mario Kart 64\" was nominated for awards following its release, and retrospectively has been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The game has a notable speedrunning presence online. \"Mario Kart 64\" was rereleased digitally for the Virtual Console line on the Wii in 2007 and the Wii U in 2016, and for the Nintendo Classics service in 2021.\nGameplay.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" is a kart racing video game featuring characters and elements from the \"Mario\" franchise largely similar in gameplay to its predecessor \"Super Mario Kart\" (1992). The player controls one of eight \"Mario\" franchise characters and races opponents in karts around tracks based on locales from the \"Super Mario\" platform games. The game's 20 courses are populated with obstacles to slow the player down, shortcuts letting the player skip sections, and boxes labeled with question marks which give the player a random item based on elements from the \"Super Mario\" series. Items can be either power-ups, such as giving the player a speed boost, or offensive, such as causing an opponent to spin out. The player can also drift around corners or enter an opponent's slipstream to receive a speed boost. Playable characters are divided into three weight classes which determine characteristics such as speed, acceleration, and handling. Princess Peach, Toad, and Yoshi are lightweights; Luigi and Mario are middleweights; and Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Wario are heavyweights. There are three difficulty levels based on engine classes\u201450cc, 100cc, or 150cc\u2014with the harder difficulties' more powerful engine classes providing increased maximum speeds and control difficulty.\nThere are two single-player game mode options in \"Mario Kart 64\": Grand Prix (GP) and Time Trials. Time Trials is a solely single-player mode, and GP can be played in single-player or with two players. In GP, the game's main mode, the player races seven computer opponents (or six if playing in two-player mode) in one of four \"cups\" consisting of four tracks, with the objective of achieving the highest points across all four three-lap races. The player must race on every track in the cup, and points are given out at the end of each race based on position\u2014nine for first place, six for second, three for third, and one for fourth. The player must come in at least fourth place in each race to continue racing for a trophy. Achieving the maximum number of points (i.e., winning all four races) on all cups in the 150cc difficulty unlocks a \"mirror\" mode in which all tracks are flipped left-to-right. In Time Trials, the player races on any of the 16 tracks with the aim of achieving the lowest time across three laps. There are no opponents or items on the track; the player is given three speed boosts to use across the whole race. The player can race against another player's time by sharing \"ghost\" data using the Controller Pak, a memory card that plugs into the back of the Nintendo 64 (N64) controller.\nThree local multiplayer modes are present in \"Mario Kart 64\": GP, Versus (VS), and Battle. The game utilises a split screen to display each player's gameplay. GP is unchanged from its single-player version, but allows for two players. In VS mode, two to four players race around any track without computer opponents. Battle mode sees two to four players compete in one of four arenas rather than tracks. The player begins with three balloons over their character, with the objective of popping other players' balloons using items. Players are knocked out upon losing all their balloons\u2014though can control a bomb with wheels to attack remaining players afterwards\u2014and the winner is whoever remains the last man standing.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was provisionally titled \"Super Mario Kart R\" during development\u2014the \"R\" being short for \"rendered\". \"Mario Kart 64\" was developed concurrently with \"Super Mario 64\" (1996) and \"\" (1998) by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development division. The game was revealed alongside the N64 console itself in November 1995 at the Shoshinkai trade show via a videotape given out to journalists. The game was reportedly considered \"95% complete\" at the time of the show. \"Mario Kart 64\" was intended to be released alongside the N64 itself in mid-1996 but was delayed after development resources were directed towards \"Super Mario 64\", itself a launch title for the system.\nDevelopers did not focus on innovating significantly on the gameplay of its predecessor \"Super Mario Kart\", intending for the game to appeal to a wide audience. Nintendo instead focused on the game's use of technology and internal processes through using the full extent of the N64's processing capabilities, especially in regards to the performance of multiplayer gameplay. Hideki Konno, the director of \"Mario Kart 64\", stated that developers wanted a racing environment in the game where all players were \"in it until the end\". Konno claimed that they were not able to achieve this in part due to the processing capabilities of the N64 not allowing eight players on the screen at all times. Developers created a simulation of remote-controlled vehicles and did research on the physics of cars to aid in designing the game's kart mechanics. Ultimately, it was decided the gameplay derived from this research was too \"realistic\" and unenjoyable for game testers, and developers settled on a more straightforward approach to controls in the final release. Game designers wanted freedom in regards to where the player can race on tracks. This caused programmers to struggle with collision detection, trying to find a balance between not overloading the processor and not wanting to cut corners such as by letting players overlap each other.\nThe game uses a rendering technique known as billboarding to represent characters. Characters are represented by a two-dimensional image kept perpendicular to the camera rather than being rendered in 3D. This technique allowed developers to save on memory\u2014the game's Battle mode and ability to render eight players on the track at once were made possible by this. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto credited the game's technical performance to the N64's use of ROM cartridges over disc-based CD-ROMs for game media, due to the way they handle pre-loading data to the game system. During development, a hard disk failure resulted in designers remaking \"about 80%\" of the game's character models. An early alpha version of the game appeared in the Nintendo Gigaleak, a 2020 data leak of internal material at Nintendo. The alpha used assets from \"Super Mario Kart\" as placeholders. A pre-release version of the game originally featured Kamek, a villain in the \"Yoshi\" series, before being replaced by Donkey Kong. Other features cut during development include a racing game mode without items\u2014scrapped due to disinterest from game testers\u2014and two tracks. The cut tracks were based on a parking garage and a large city, respectively.\nRelease.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" was released in Japan on December 14, 1996, in the United States on February 10, 1997, and in Europe on June 24\u2014the American release of the game was moved forward a week from the initially announced date. It was the second entry in the \"Mario Kart\" series after \"Super Mario Kart\". Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the difference in time between the Japanese and American releases of the game was due to the company's desire to release the game during the holiday season in Japan, considering a lack of N64 releases in the region. Marketing for the game included a US$5 million advertising campaign. Coinciding with the game's release in Japan, Nintendo released a special edition of \"Mario Kart 64\" which came with a specially-styled black-and-grey N64 controller. It was released in China on December 25, 2003 on the iQue Player through the Chinese localization company iQue. \"Mario Kart 64\" was digitally rereleased on the Wii and the Wii U through the Virtual Console, releasing on the Wii worldwide across January 2007. On the Wii U, the game released on January 21, 2016 in Europe and on December 29 in the United States. \"Mario Kart 64\" was also rereleased as part of the digital Nintendo Classics service on October 25, 2021.\nThe \"Mario Kart 64\" soundtrack, composed by Kenta Nagata, was released on CD several times across 1997 in Japan and the United States. The American releases were published by Nintendo on March 1, 1997 and April 1 respectively, and the Japanese release was published by Pony Canyon on September 19. The releases include the game's songs as well as different sound effects and remixes of songs from the game, and each includes a different track listing. A remix album containing club remixes of the game's soundtrack, \"Mario Kart 64 on Club Circuit\", was published by Tokuma Japan Communications on December 26, 1997. The soundtrack was also released as an album on the Nintendo Music streaming service on July 15, 2025.\nReception.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. The game was commercially successful, selling 9.87\u00a0million copies worldwide\u2014the second-bestselling game on the N64. It was the highest selling game in the United States over the first three months of 1997, and reached over one million sales within two months of its release in the region. By 1999, \"Mario Kart 64\" had sold 6.23\u00a0million copies in the United States and 2.06\u00a0million units in Japan, the highest and third-highest selling N64 game in those regions respectively.\nCritics debated the game's presentation and visuals. Supporters felt the game adequately used the power of the N64, made the game stand out from others in the racing genre and in the Mario series, and was an improvement over its 16-bit predecessor. The French \"Officiel Nintendo Magazine\" enjoyed the game's colourful and fluid visuals, adding that its overall presentation likened a \"magical\" experience. Detractors of the graphics felt they lacked detail, were not a sufficient improvement over the previous 16-bit entry, and failed to fully benefit from the N64's power. The use of 2D sprites was a common critique, with \"Next Generation\" arguing that it made the game look outdated.\n\"Mario Kart 64\"'s track design and gameplay polarised critics. The game was panned for being un-innovative, too easy, and simple and monotonous. \"Computer and Video Games\" and \"N64 Magazine\" felt that success was too dependent on getting the right power-ups. \"Cubed3\" disliked \"Mario Kart 64\"'s wide, motorway-like track design, saying that it did not provide an \"adrenaline filled\" experience which the player might have hoped for. Critics also found fault in the game's use of rubberband difficulty balancing, recognizing that it gave the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) an unfair advantage. Technical issues such as poor collision detection and lag in the four-player \"Battle Mode\" were also noted.\nThe gameplay did have supporters, who noted its large amount of courses, found its track designs more detailed and impressive than \"Super Mario Kart\", and thought it had a lot of replay value. \"Hyper\" and \"N64 Magazine\" highlighted the flexible turning control with the multiple-angled analog stick, calling it \"perfect\" and true to real-life karts. \"N64 Magazine\" enjoyed the amount of focus and fast reflexes demanded from the player. \"Hyper\" reported having many unexpected moments while playing the game due to its \"ingeniously fiendish AI\" and the boxes containing different power-ups each time they're collected. Reviewers, even those lukewarm towards the graphics, positively noted touches such as the 180-degree turns in Bowser's Castle, the train tracks on Kalimari Desert, the trucks in Toad's Turnpike, the cows in Moo Moo Farm, Peach's castle on Royal Raceway, and the sliding penguins in Sherbet Land as highlights, as well as smoke puffs coming out of the kart.\nCritics found the multiplayer mode to be better than the single player, with \"IGN\" calling it \"multi-player mayhem at its best\". \"Game Informer\" described the game as \"one of the best multiplayer games ever made\", citing the game's vehicle dynamics and items as aiding the multiplayer experience. Some reviewers criticized the four-player split screen mode for making gameplay difficult to see due to the small size of quadrants, and \"GameFan\" noted a poor frame rate performance playing the multiplayer modes compared to single-player.\nIn 1998, \"Mario Kart 64\" was nominated for Console Racing Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences during the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named it a runner-up for \"Multiplayer Game of the Year\" (behind \"Saturn Bomberman\") at their 1997 Editors' Choice Awards.\nLegacy.\n\"Mario Kart 64\" placed 17th in \"Official Nintendo Magazine\"'s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time and 49th in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s 1997 list of the 100 best console games of all time. It has been placed by several reviewers on \"greatest video games of all time\" lists, including \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Polygon\", \"Hyper\", and \"Gameswelt\". The game has also attracted a significant speedrunning scene of players competing to set time records on the game's 16 tracks through separate Grand Prix, three-lap, single-lap, or all-cups time rankings. Times are recorded on the unofficial \"Mario Kart 64 Players' Page\" website, which tracks records starting from 1997.\nCritics have been mixed in regards to the game's ranking on retrospective lists of the best \"Mario Kart\" games. Some critics praised it for defining the direction of the series, noting its utilisation of 3D graphics and expansion of local multiplayer content. \"Kotaku\" and \"Game Informer\", however, believed \"Mario Kart 64\" to fall short compared to other games in the series, with the former panning \"empty\" tracks and a less palatable art style. It has also been retrospectively described by some reviewers as one of the best N64 games, with \"IGN\" declaring the game's tracks to be \"some of the most memorable\" in the kart racing genre. The blue shell item, which directly targets the player in first place, was first introduced in \"Mario Kart 64\". \"GameSpot\"'s Steve Watts described the item as \"synonymous with \"Mario Kart\"\" and an icon of video game history, while \"The Guardian\" placed it on its list of the \"11 greatest video game objects\".\nIn 2025, \"Mario Kart 64\" was successfully decompiled, allowing independent developers to port the game to other systems. An unofficial PC port of the game named \"SpaghettiKart\", developed by the team behind the \"Ship of Harkinian\" port of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\", was released in June 2025. The port includes features such as ultrawide display support, adjustable game framerates, and the ability to add custom tracks. Another unofficial port is being created for the Dreamcast by the same developer who ported \"Doom 64\" (1997) and \"Wipeout\" (1995) to the console.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before rising to power and seizing the throne of the Byzantine Empire, he was a tax collector in Adramyttium. In 715, the Byzantine navy and the troops of the Opsician Theme, one of the Byzantine provinces, revolted against Emperor Anastasius II (r.\u2009713\u00a0\u2013\u00a0715), acclaiming the reluctant Theodosius as emperor. Theodosius led his troops to Chrysopolis and then Constantinople, the capital, seizing the city in November 715. Anastasius did not surrender until several months later, accepting exile in a monastery in return for safety. Many themes viewed Theodosius to be a puppet of the troops of the Opsician Theme, and his legitimacy was denied by the Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their respective (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos.\nLeo declared himself emperor in the summer of 716 and allied himself with the Umayyad Caliphate, the Islamic empire; Theodosius sought aid from the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel (r.\u2009700\u00a0\u2013\u00a0721), setting a firm border at Thrace and ceding the Zagoria region to the Bulgarians, as well as stipulating the payment of tribute to them. Leo then marched his troops to Constantinople, seizing the city of Nicomedia, and capturing many officials, including Theodosius' son, also named Theodosius. With his son in captivity, Theodosius took the advice of Patriarch Germanus and the Byzantine Senate, and negotiated with Leo, agreeing to abdicate and recognize Leo as emperor. Leo entered Constantinople and definitively seized power on 25 March 717, allowing Theodosius and his son to retire to a monastery. Exactly when Theodosius died is uncertain, but it may have been on 24 July 754.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAfter the Umayyad Caliphate was repelled at the first Arab siege of Constantinople (674\u2013678), the Arabs and Byzantines experienced a period of peace between each other. Hostilities were resumed by Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (r.\u2009685\u00a0\u2013\u00a0695,\u00a0705\u00a0\u2013\u00a0711), resulting in a string of Arab victories. As a consequence, the Byzantines lost control over Armenia and the Caucasian principalities, and the Arabs gradually encroached upon the Byzantine borderlands. Annually, generals from the Caliphate would launch raids into Byzantine territory, seizing fortresses and towns. After 712, the defenses of the Byzantine Empire weakened, as Arab raids penetrated deeper into Byzantine Asia Minor, and Byzantine response to these raids became less common; much of the frontier became depopulated, as the inhabitants were either killed, enslaved, or driven away, a result of this was that many frontier forts, especially in Cilicia, were gradually abandoned. The success of these raids emboldened the Arabs, who prepared for a second assault against Constantinople as early as the reign of Caliph al-Walid I (r.\u2009705\u00a0\u2013\u00a0715). After his death, his successor, Sulayman (r.\u2009715\u00a0\u2013\u00a0717) continued planning the campaign, Sulayman began assembling his forces in late 716, on the plain of Dabiq, north of Aleppo, entrusting the command of these forces to his brother, Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik.\nThe Slavs and Bulgars also formed a growing threat to the northern frontier of the Byzantine Empire, threatening Byzantine control in the Balkans. During the rule of Byzantine Emperor Philippicus (r.\u2009711\u00a0\u2013\u00a0713), in 712, the Bulgarians under Khan Tervel advanced as far as the walls of Constantinople itself, plundering the surrounding country, including villas and estates near the capital, where the Byzantine elites often summered.\nTheodosius came to power during a period called the Twenty Years' Anarchy, defined by struggles between the emperors and the elites, and political instability, with a rapid succession of emperors. The nobles of this time were often natives of Asia Minor, and rarely had a strong agenda beyond preventing the emperors from growing stronger and disrupting the status quo. The Twenty Years' Anarchy began when Emperor Justinian II was overthrown by Leontius (r.\u2009695\u00a0\u2013\u00a0698) in 695, ending the Heraclian dynasty, which had retained power for eighty years. During this period of anarchy, seven different emperors took the throne, including a restored Justinian for a time. The modern historian Romilly Jenkins states that between 695 and 717 the only competent emperors were Tiberius III (r.\u2009698\u00a0\u2013\u00a0705) and Anastasius II (r.\u2009713\u00a0\u2013\u00a0715). The crisis was ended by Emperor Leo III (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741), who overthrew Theodosius, and whose dynasty reigned for 85 years.\nRise to the throne.\nSulayman's preparations, including his construction of a war fleet, were quickly noticed by the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Anastasius II began making preparations to defend against this new onslaught. This included sending the patrician and urban prefect, Daniel of Sinope, to spy on the Arabs, under the pretense of a diplomatic embassy, as well as shoring up the defences of Constantinople, and strengthening the Byzantine navy. The 9th-century Byzantine historian Theophanes states that in early 715 Anastasius II had commanded the navy to gather at Rhodes to then advance to Phoenix. It was there that the troops of the Opsician Theme mutinied against their commander, John the Deacon, killing him before sailing for Adramyttium, in southwestern Asia Minor, and there declared Theodosius, a tax collector, as Emperor Theodosius III. The \"Zuqnin Chronicle\" states that Theodosius ruled under the regnal name Constantine, his full name being \"Theodosius Constantinus\". The historian J. B. Bury suggests that he was selected at random for little more than the fact that he already had an imperial-sounding name, was inoffensive, obscure but respectable, and could easily be controlled by the Opsicians. Graham Sumner, a Byzantologist, suggests that Theodosius might be the same person as Theodosius, the son of Emperor Tiberius III, therefore explaining why he might have been chosen by the troops, as he would have legitimacy from his father, himself made emperor by a naval revolt. Theodosius, the son of Tiberius, was bishop of Ephesus by c.\u2009729, and held this position until his death, sometime around 24 July 754, and was a leading figure of the iconoclastic Council of Hieria in 754. Byzantine historians Cyril Mango and Roger Scott do not view this theory as likely, as it would mean that Theodosius lived for thirty more years after his abdication. Cyril Mango proposed that it was actually Theodosius III's son who became bishop, rather than the son of Tiberius.\nTheodosius was allegedly unwilling to be emperor and according to Theophanes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the malefactors arrived at Adramyttium, being leaderless they found there a local man named Theodosius, a receiver of public revenues, non-political and a private citizen. They urged him to become Emperor. He, however, fled to the hills and hid. But they found him and forced him to accept acclamation as Emperor.\nHe was acclaimed as Emperor Theodosius III by the troops of the Opsician Theme at Adramyttium in c. May 715. Anastasius led his army into Bithynia in the Opsician Theme to crush the rebellion. Rather than remaining to fight Anastasius, Theodosius led his fleet to Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. From Chrysopolis, he launched a six-month-long siege of Constantinople, before supporters within the capital managed to open the gates for him, allowing him to seize the city in November 715. Anastasius remained at Nicaea for several months, before finally agreeing to abdicate and retire to a monastery.\nReign.\nOne of Theodosius' first acts as emperor was to reinstate the depiction of the Sixth Ecumenical Synod in the Great Palace of Constantinople, which Emperor Philippicus Bardanes had removed, earning himself the epithet of \"Orthodox\" in the \"Liber Pontificalis\" for this action. Theodosius, whom Byzantine sources convey as being both unwilling and incapable, was viewed by many of his subjects as a puppet emperor of the troops of the Opsician Theme. Thus he was not recognized as legitimate by the Anatolic and the Armeniac Themes, under their respective (generals) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos. Although they had not taken any action to prevent the overthrowal of Anastasius, they took issue with Theodosius' ascension, and Leo proclaimed himself Byzantine emperor in the summer of 716. He also sought the support of the Arabs, who viewed the Byzantine disunity as advantageous, and thought the confusion would weaken the Byzantine Empire and make it easier to take Constantinople. Theodosius negotiated a treaty with the Bulgarian khan Tervel (r.\u2009700\u00a0\u2013\u00a0721), likely to secure his support against an imminent Arab attack. The treaty fixed the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire at Thrace, ceding the Zagoria region to the Bulgarians, as well as stipulating the payment of tribute to the Bulgarians, the return of fugitives, and some trade agreements.\nAround this time, Sulayman had begun advancing into Byzantine territory, laying siege to Amorium, and a separate force entered Cappadocia. Negotiations with Leo led them to withdraw. Leo began to march his troops to Constantinople soon after declaring himself emperor, first capturing Nicomedia, where he found and captured, among other officials, Theodosius' son, and then marched to Chrysopolis. After his son was captured, Theodosius, taking the advice of Patriarch Germanus and the Byzantine Senate, agreed to abdicate and recognize Leo as emperor. Bury states that the elite of Constantinople, who might otherwise have sided with the inoffensive Theodosius, who would be unlikely to politically weaken them, sided with Leo, as Theodosius was not competent enough to deal with the Arab threat. He further states that the meeting of the Patriarch, senate, and chief officials, which chose Leo over Theodosius, was done with the knowledge and consent of Theodosius himself, who accepted the decision. Bury postulates that, without the threat of the Arabs, it is possible that Theodosius may have retained power, and a succession of nominal emperors might have followed him, controlled by court officials and the elites.\nLeo entered Constantinople and definitively seized power on 25 March 717, allowing Theodosius and his son, also named Theodosius, to retire to a monastery as monks. After his retirement to a monastery, Theodosius might have become the bishop of Ephesus, if he was the same person as Theodosius, son of Tiberius, in c.\u2009729, and, if he is the same, died on 24 July 754 according to Sumner. Either he or his son is buried in the Church of St. Philip in Ephesus. Little is known of the reign of Theodosius III.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the major seaside resorts in the country, it is known for the \"Apollonia\" art and film festival (which takes place in early September) that is named after one of the town's ancient names. Part of Burgas Province and administrative centre of the homonymous Sozopol Municipality, as of December 2009, the town has a population of 5,410 inhabitants.\nIn antiquity, the place was the site of a prosperous Greek colony named \"Antheia\" and later known as \"Apollonia.\" In 72 BC it was devastated by a Roman siege, and became a small town of lesser importance. By the first century AD, the name \"Sozopolis\" began to appear in written records.\nThe busiest times of the year are the summer months, ranging from May to September, as tourists from around the world come to enjoy the weather, sandy beaches, history and culture, fusion cuisine (Balkan and Mediterranean), and atmosphere of the colourful resort.\nName.\nThe original name of the city is attested as \"Antheia\" (\u1f0c\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 in Greek) but was soon renamed to \"Apollonia\" (\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1). At various times, Apollonia was known as \"Apollonia Pontica\" (\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u1f21 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, that is, \"Apollonia on the Black Sea\", the ancient \"Pontus Euxinus\") and \"Apollonia Magna\" (\"Great Apollonia\"). By the first century AD, the name \"Sozopolis\" (\u03a3\u03c9\u03b6\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) began to appear in written records. During the Ottoman rule which began in 1453, the town was known as \"Sizebolu\", \"Sizeboli\" or \"Sizebolou\".\nHistory.\nBronze Age.\nSozopol is one of the oldest towns on Bulgarian Thrace's Black Sea coast. The first settlement on the site dates back to the Bronze Age. Undersea explorations in the region of the port reveal relics of dwellings, ceramic pottery, stone and bone tools from that era. Many anchors from the second and first millennium BC have been discovered in the town's bay, a proof of active shipping since ancient times.\nIron Age.\nThe town was founded in the 7th century BC by ancient Greek colonists from Miletus as Antheia (). The town established itself as a trade and naval centre in the following centuries and became one of the largest and richest Greek colonies in the Black Sea region. Its trade influence in the Thracian territories was based on a treaty dating from the fifth century BC with the Odrysian kingdom, the most powerful Thracian state. The town's name was changed to Apollonia, on account of a temple dedicated to Apollo in the town. Apollonia became a legendary trading rival of another Greek colony, Mesembria, today's Nessebar.\nThere were two temples of Apollo Iatros (), meaning healer in Greek. One was from the Late Archaic Greece and the other from the Early Classical Greece.\nIt kept strong political and trade relations with the cities of Ancient Greece \u2013 Miletus, Athens, Corinth, Heraclea Pontica and the islands Rhodes, Chios, Lesbos, etc.\nThe city managed to keep its independence during the wars of Philip II of Macedon (342\u2013339 BC) and Alexander the Great (335 BC).\nIn 72 BC it was conquered and sacked by the Roman legions of Marcus Lucullus, with the latter ordering its devastation. Lucullus transported the statue of Apollo to Rome and placed it in the Capitol. Apollonia did not recover from the disaster, remaining a small town without any significant trade or cultural importance during the Roman period (1st to 3rd centuries AD).\nApollonia Pontica started minting its own coins at the end of the 6th century BC, the anchor appearing on them as the symbol of the polis present on all coins minted since the sixth century BC, proof of the importance of its maritime trade. Coins from the fourth century BC bear the name Apollonia and the image of Apollo. The Roman imperial coins continue to the first half of the third century AD.\nThe \"Tabula Peutinger\" shows Apollonia; but the \"Periplus Ponti Euxini\", 85, and the \"Notiti\u00e6 episcopatuum\" have only the later name Sozopolis.\nLater periods.\nIn 1328 Cantacuzene (ed. Bonn, I, 326) speaks of it as a large and populous town. The islet on which it stood is now connected with the mainland by a narrow tongue of land. Ruled in turn by the Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman Empires, Sozopol was assigned to the newly independent Principality of Bulgaria in the 19th century. A group of Polish Armenians, expelled by the Ottoman occupiers from Kamieniec Podolski in 1674, stayed in the city for a single winter before returning to Poland.\nAt the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) prominent local personalities like Dimitrios Varis were arrested and executed by the Ottoman authorities due to participation in the preparations of the struggle.\nAccording to the Bulgarian jurist and politician Vasil Mitakov (1881\u20131945), the town was almost entirely ethnically Greek in the first decade of the 20th century, with the exception of a few dozen Bulgarians in the whole city who were either current or retired officials. After the anti-Greek pogroms in Bulgaria in 1906, Greek institutions in the city were closed and expropriated, including the churches, the library and the Greek school. Almost all of its remaining Greek population was exchanged with Bulgarians from Eastern Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars. In the 1920s, the former Greek population then settled in Chalkidiki founding a town also named Sozopolis. In 2011 the remainings of an ancient Greek settlement, part of Apollonia, were excavated in the small island of St. Kirik (Saint Cerycus) off Sozopolis.\nSince 1984 Sozopol hosts the \"Apollonia\" art festivities every September, which include theatre shows, exhibitions, movies, musical and dance performances, book presentations and other cultural events.\nColossal statue of Apollo.\nThe city erected, in 5th century BC, a colossal statue of the god Apollo which was tall. It was created by the sculptor Calamis. In 72 BC, the Romans under Marcus Lucullus captured the city and moved the sculpture to Rome on the Capitolium. Pliny the Elder wrote that the statue cost 500 talents. It was lost during the Early Christian period.\nArchaeology.\nRecent excavations have revealed parts of the ancient city including:\nIn addition, archaeologists discovered a Greek bucranium amulet from the 5th century BC.\nA shrine of goddesses Demeter and Persephone from the 6th century BC.\nMany objects from antiquity, included imported luxury ceramics, red-figure pottery, sgraffito pottery, pottery lamps, loom weights, spindle parts, coins, amphora seals, arrow coins, ceramic game pieces, adornments. One of the most impressive finds was an Attica red-figure pottery krater, depicting the myth about Oedipus and the Sphinx. The krater is dated to the second quarter of the 5th century BC.\nExcavation teams also discovered, a ceramic askos dated back to the second half of the 6th century BC, and was \u201cmade in the tradition of grey monochrome Aeolian pottery\", a 6th-century BC home and other antiquity buildings, pottery and coins from both the antiquity period and the Middle Ages. Furthermore, have also identified the ruins of a medieval Christian chapel and have discovered several graves from a medieval necropolis that was used in two time periods \u2013 in the 11th century AD and then again in the 13th \u2013 14th century AD. In a grave from the 11th century, the researchers have found two small crosses \u2013 one made of bronze and another one made of bone. They have also discovered three pits hewn into the rocks from the Classical Period of Ancient Greece containing materials from the 5th \u2013 4th century BC.\nLater, they discovered an ancient metallurgical plant from the 6th century BC located at an antiquity copper mine. While the ancient copper mining near Sozopol has been well researched, for the first time archaeologists have discovered ceramic kilns for melting the copper ore right on the edge of the mine in what resembles an Antiquity metallurgy facility.\nIn 2021, archaeologists discovered a terracotta relief fragment, depicting marching Greek hoplites. The relief is a piece of a larger depiction, other parts of which were discovered in 2018 and 2019.\nEcclesiastical history.\nSozopol was Christianized early. Bishops are recorded as resident there from at least 431. At least eight bishops are known: Athanasius (431), Peter (680), Euthymius (787) and Ignatius (869); Theodosius (1357), Joannicius, who became Patriarch of Constantinople (1524), Philotheus (1564) and Joasaph (1721).\nFrom being suffragan to the archbishopric of Adrianople, it became in the 14th century a metropolitan see without suffragan sees; it perhaps temporarily disappeared with the Turkish conquest, but reappeared later; in 1808 the Greek Orthodox Church united it to the see of Agathopolis. The titular resided at Agathopolis.\nEubel (\"Hierarchia catholica medii \u00e6vi\", I, 194) mentions four Latin bishops of the 14th century.\nThe bishopric is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees as \"Sozopolis in Haemimonto\" and as a suffragan of \"Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto\".\nArt flourished in the Christian era. The ancient icons and magnificent woodcarving in the iconostases are a remarkable accomplishment of the craftsmanship of these times. The architecture of the houses in the old town from the Renaissance period makes it a unique place to visit today.\nThe vampire of Sozopol.\nDuring archaeological excavations in 2012 the remains of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that those are the remains of the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest to make sure that the dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nhttps://\nHonours.\nSozopol Gap in Antarctica is named after the city of Sozopol.\nSport.\nThe local football team is called FC Sozopol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Olivia de Havilland as Catherine Sloper, a naive young woman who falls in love with a handsome young man despite the objections of her emotionally abusive father who suspects the man of being a fortune hunter. Montgomery Clift stars as Morris Townsend, and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper.\n\"The Heiress\" premiered in Los Angeles on October 6, 1949, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures on December 28, 1949. Although a box office failure, grossing $2.3 million on a $2.6 million budget, the film garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers praising Wyler's direction, its screenplay and the performances of the cast. The film received a leading eight nominations at the 22nd Academy Awards, including for the Best Picture, and won four awards (more than any other film nominated that year): Best Actress (for de Havilland), Best Original Score, composed by Aaron Copland, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design.\nIn 1996, \"The Heiress\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nUniversal Pictures, through its EMKA division, currently handles distribution of the film.\nPlot.\nIn 1849 New York City, Catherine Sloper, an inhibited, plain young woman, lives with her wealthy father, Dr. Austin Sloper, in prestigious Washington Square. Catherine's beautiful and accomplished mother died giving birth, and Catherine's awkwardness constantly reminds her father of the poor exchange for his beloved wife. Widowed Aunt Lavinia Penniman, on an extended visit with her brother, helps Catherine improve her social skills.\nAt a ball, Catherine meets handsome, charming Morris Townsend, a polished young man who squandered a small inheritance on a European Grand Tour. Encouraged by Aunt Penniman, Morris artfully pursues Catherine, who he knows through her family connections will inherit $30,000 annually. At first Catherine is overwhelmed by his persistence; starved for affection, however, she quickly falls in love. Suspecting Morris is a fortune hunter, Dr. Sloper consults with Morris's widowed sister, who reluctantly makes admissions that confirm Sloper's opinion.\nBefore approaching Sloper to formally request Catherine's hand in marriage, Morris improperly makes Catherine pledge herself to him. Pointing out the impropriety, Sloper rejects him. When Catherine persists, Sloper insists on taking her on an extended European trip to separate the pair as a test. Catherine informs Morris that she already has a substantial $10,000 inheritance from her mother and does not need her father's approval. Morris claims that he is loath to estrange her from her father, and she should appease him. \nWhile Catherine and her father are away, Morris frequents the Sloper home like a private club, enjoying Aunt Penniman's hospitality and Sloper's cigars and brandy. Disappointed with his daughter's intransigence in her devotion to Morris, Sloper cuts the trip short. Upon returning home, he reveals to Catherine his low opinion of her merits, believing her dim for thinking any suitor would have an interest in her beyond her inheritance. He threatens to cut her out of his will if she marries Morris. Catherine now fully realizes the depth of her father's disdain.\nWounded and angry, Catherine is convinced that Morris's love is compensation for her father's coldness. She begs Morris to arrange their immediate elopement, not wanting to spend another night in her father's home. Morris holds out hope that her father will eventually relent, but Catherine insists that even if her father relents, she will never accept anything from him again. Reluctantly, Morris agrees to elope and leaves to pack his belongings.\nCatherine waits with her bags packed, and Aunt Penniman stays with her, dismayed that Catherine revealed to Morris that there would be no money from her father. As the appointed time comes and passes without his arrival, Catherine realizes that Morris has abandoned her. Pondering why Morris was not satisfied with her substantial $10,000 left by her mother, her aunt explains it is a disappointment because he expected she would also receive an additional $20,000 upon her father's death.\nDays afterward, Sloper reveals he is dying and asks Catherine when she plans to leave with Morris. When Catherine admits that the elopement is off, Sloper expresses pride that Catherine has rejected Morris, but Catherine bitterly informs him that she was jilted. Catherine shrilly expresses that Sloper has denied her even the chance to \"buy\" a husband who at least would hide that he does not love her. She tells her father that if he leaves her his money, he will never know whether she wastes it on Morris or another fortune hunter. Sloper admits that he does not want to disinherit her and accepts that she can do as she pleases when he is gone. Hardened, Catherine refuses to come to his bedside as he is dying.\nYears later, wealthy, independent, and single, Catherine still lives in the Washington Square house with her aunt. Aunt Penniman informs Catherine that Morris has returned from California and wishes to explain himself. Initially reluctant, Catherine eventually agrees to see him. Now destitute, Morris attempts to win Catherine back, saying that he left, selflessly, not to estrange her from her father. Chiding him for not being as impetuous as he used to be, Catherine suggests they carry out the delayed elopement. Morris eagerly leaves to pack. When Morris returns to take her away, Catherine has bolted the door against him, leaving him desperately pounding on the door as she turns off the lights and goes to bed.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nAfter seeing \"The Heiress\" on Broadway, Olivia de Havilland approached William Wyler about directing her in a screen adaptation of the play. He agreed and encouraged executives at Paramount Pictures to purchase the rights from the playwrights (Ruth and Augustus Goetz) for $250,000 and offer them $10,000 per week to write the screenplay. The couple were asked to make Morris less of a villain than he was in their play and the original novel in deference to the studio's desire to capitalize on Montgomery Clift's reputation as a romantic leading man.\nThe film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on October 6, 1949.\nRalph Richardson reprised the role of Austin Sloper in a London production of the play.\nReception.\n\"The Heiress\" received universal critical acclaim. When it premiered at Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"crackles with allusive life and fire in its tender and agonized telling of an extraordinarily characterful tale\" and added Wyler \"has given this somewhat austere drama an absorbing intimacy and a warming illusion of nearness that it did not have on the stage. He has brought the full-bodied people very closely and vividly to view, while maintaining the clarity and sharpness of their personalities, their emotions and their styles...\"The Heiress\" is one of the handsome, intense and adult dramas of the year.\" Currently, the film holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 9.0/10 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews.\nThe \"Brooklyn Eagle\" found the film \"an intensely satisfying drama that holds a high level of interest throughout, building relentlessly to a moving climax.\" Praise for the principals lauded de Havilland especially: \"the transformation of Catherine Sloper from a pathetically shy girl to a cold, handsome woman\" being \"handled with finished skill.\"\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" praised the Goetzes for a skillful transformation of their stage version, finding it \"in almost every way...superior.\" Prospects of an Academy Award for de Havilland were judged \"thoroughly reasonable\" as well.\n\"TV Guide\" rates the film five out of a possible five stars and adds, \"This powerful and compelling drama...owes its triumph to the deft hand of director William Wyler and a remarkable lead performance by Olivia de Havilland\".\n\"Time Out London\" calls the film \"typically plush, painstaking and cold...highly professional and heartless.\"\nChannel 4 stated \"de Havilland's portrayal...is spine-chilling...Clift brings a subtle ambiguity to one of his least interesting roles, and Richardson is also excellent.\"\nInfluence.\nMartin Scorsese has cited \"The Heiress\" as a key influence on his 2023 film \"Killers of the Flower Moon\". Specifically, the portrayal of Mollie Kyle and her relationship with her husband Ernest Burkhart drew inspiration from de Havilland's portrayal of Catherine and her relationship with Morris.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1975, the twenty-first episode of the eighth season of \"The Carol Burnett Show\" featured a take-off of the film titled \"The Lady Heir\", with Carol Burnett as Catherine and Roddy McDowall as Morris.\nThe film's Philippine adaptation, titled \"Ikaw Pa Lang ang Minahal\", was made in 1992. The adaptation was written by Raquel Villavicencio, produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna, and directed by Carlos Siguion-Reyna. The film stars Maricel Soriano and Richard Gomez as Adela and David.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hart and Clara Williams. Directed by Charles Swickard, William S. Hart and Clifford Smith, and produced by Thomas H. Ince, the screenplay was written by C. Gardner Sullivan.\nIn 1994, \"Hell's Hinges\" was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and is considered by some to be one of the finest silent Westerns.\nPlot.\n\"Hell's Hinges\" tells the story of a weak-willed minister, Rev. Bob Henley (played by Standing), who comes to a wild and debauched frontier town with his sister, Faith (played by Williams). The owner of the saloon, Silk Miller (played by Hollingsworth), and his accomplices sense trouble and encourage the local rowdies to disrupt the attempts to evangelize the community. Hard-bitten gunman Blaze Tracy (played by Hart), the most dangerous man around, is, however, won over by the sincerity of Faith. He intervenes to expel the rowdies from the newly built church.\nSilk adopts a new approach. He encourages the dance-hall girl, Dolly (played by Glaum), to seduce Rev. Henley. She gets him drunk, and he spends the night in her room. The following morning the whole town learns of his fall from grace. Blaze rides out to find a doctor for the now near-demented minister.\nThe disgraced minister, having rapidly descended into alcoholism, is goaded into helping the rowdy element to burn down the church. The church-goers try to defend the church, and a gunfight erupts in which the minister is killed and the church set ablaze. Blaze returns too late to stop the destruction. In revenge, Blaze kills Silk and burns down the whole town, beginning with the saloon. He and Faith leave to start a new life.\nProduction.\nThe production companies were Kay-Bee Pictures and New York Motion Picture.\nCritical reception.\nInitial reviews in 1916.\nWhen \"Hell's Hinges\" was released, the reception of the film among New York critics was so positive that the producer bought space in newspapers around the country to reprint the reviews. The following are excerpts from those reviews:\nGrace Kingsley of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the actors high marks. She credited Hart with doing his \"usual excellent work\" and found Glaum to be \"a really fascinating vampire.\" Kingsley paid special note to Standing's performance as the reverend, calling it \"one of the most subtle, but at the same time of the most sincere bits of film acting of his entire career,\" a performance exhibiting \"intelligence and imagination ... in the very highest degree.\" Kingsley found the film to be \"marvelously well done\" but took exception to the would-be folksy western dialect in the title cards:\nC. Gardner Sullivan appears to have written 'Hell's Hinges' for the purpose of allowing us to look our fill on fire and fights. Certain it is the thing is marvelously well done. There is a burning dance hall with men and women entrapped, which fairly makes you gasp, and there is a 'beau-oo-tiful' free-for-all fight between the sheep and the goats of 'Hell's Hinges.' All this is lovely enough in its way to make for forgiveness of the dialect of the subtitles, a dialect which 'never was on land or sea.'\nThe title cards includes lines such as \"When women like her say there is a God, there is one, and he sure must be worth trailin' with\".\nThe publication \"Moving Picture World\" gave the film a mixed review:\n... William S. Hart should try himself out in some other role, or, at least, in some more decided variation of story in which he quite regularly appears. Then, too, he might well be a little more human and less heroic with no loss of sympathy in the average audience. The old fashioned theatrical hero fails to win with a large percentage of the modern audience... Brilliant in subtitle, strong in treatment with occasional notes of true pathos, the marks of creative ability and sure craftmanship are there, but more of the material is outworn--the genius of author and director barely save it--and the fire scenes, elaborate as they are, finally cause interest to flag from too much repetition... The cast is without flaw.The publication further noted that Ince \"is at his best when holding close to revelations of the human mind and heart.\"\nLater historical assessments.\nIn September 1994, \"Hell's Hinges\" experienced a revival following a screening at the Film Center of the School of the Chicago Art Institute. At the time, the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s movie critic, Michael Wilmington, called \"Hell's Hinges\" \"Hart's acknowledged masterpiece,\" \"perhaps the finest movie Western made before John Ford's 1939 \"Stagecoach\",\" and \"as emotionally powerful as any American Western film of the teens, except for the masterpieces of D.W. Griffith and Erich Von Stroheim.\"\nTwo months after the showing in Chicago and Wilmington's review, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nIn 1997, \"Film Comment\" published a review calling \"Hell's Hinges\" a \"classic of its kind\" and arguing that \"to dismiss it casually as a western would be a mistake, for it more resembles \"The Atonement of Gosta Berling\" than it does \"Riders of the Purple Sage\". The reviewer gave particular praise to Hart's directorial skill:\nThe camera placement here, the simple yet effective symbolism, and the flair for spectacle as in the brilliantly handled mob scenes where all of Inceville goes up in smoke, the real 'feel' of the old, dusty, unglamorised West, all should have earned Hart a reputation as one of the great directors. ... For the most part, 'Hell's Hinges' offers highpowered drama rather than traditional western action. ... Fine camerawork utilising long panoramic shots, excellent cutting and a sure control over the masses of extras fuse this into an episode of astonishing vigor. Hart, his assistant Cliff Smith, his writer Gardner Sullivan and cameraman Joe August were one of the sturdiest (and least appreciated) teams of craftsmen the cinema ever produced.\nThe film was given a centenary screening at the Museum of Modern Art in January 2016. In a capsule review for the occasion, \"The New Yorker\"'s Richard Brody praised the film for its uncommon intensity: \"The images are as direct and bare as the characters' emotions, and the harsh drama builds to a mad, apocalyptic climax of crime and revenge.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2009, the band Caledonia Mission wrote a song for \"Esopus\" magazine inspired by the movie. The song is named \"The Ballad of Blaze Tracy.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Morrison's commentary was recorded by engineer Charles Nehlsen, but not broadcast until the next day on May 7, 1937, one of the first times that recordings of a news event were ever broadcast. In 2002, the audio recording was selected for preservation into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. It has since been combined with the separately filmed newsreel footage. Most of the original newsreels have their own narration, and many composite edits have been made for documentaries dubbed with Morrison's commentary.\nFour newsreel teams were in attendance at the time of the disaster. They were positioned close to each other and adjacent to the mooring mast for the airship. As a result, the newsreels do not show the mooring mast for the airship to be moored (other mooring masts appear in the background in many of the reels), unlike many of the press photographs which were taken farther away which show the mast as well as two of the newsreel cameramen with their cameras mounted atop of newsreel trucks. None of the newsreels captured the initial signs of disaster as the cameras had momentarily stopped filming after the ground crew caught the landing ropes (the fire started approximately four minutes after the first starboard rope was dropped at 7:21). At least one amateur film, taken by Harold N. Schenck, is known to exist, showing a side view of the stern on fire and the tail crashing to the ground.\nIn 1997, the original reels were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nList of footage.\nThere are five known newsreels of the fire, released by Path\u00e9 News, Paramount News, Movietone News, Hearst \"News of the Day\"/Universal Newsreel, and the fifth is of unknown origin. In addition, there is one known amateur film, by Harold N. Schenck.\nPath\u00e9.\nCameraman William Deeke filmed the scenes in this newsreel. The footage shows the \"Hindenburg\" making its final sharp turn to starboard while dropping ballast three times before skidding to port and dropping her landing lines. The narrator describes the Hindenburg as a \"puny plaything in the mighty grip of fate\", foreshadowing the stern-heaviness and dumping of water ballast as a \"grim note of impending tragedy.\" Deeke had focused the camera on the ground crew before he stopped filming. Although his camera was focused on the airship the moment it caught fire, the camera malfunctioned and it became necessary for him to set up a hand crank, which he only started to use when ship's tail was on the ground and the side collapsed inward. As a result, the Path\u00e9 News reel is actually the shortest in showing the crash. The footage also suffers from slight camera shake. The newsreel was edited to show the ground crew footage prior to the fire with an explosion sound effect, giving the false impression the ship was exploding while the camera was focused to the ground. Two distinct still frames flash to transition between the ground crew scene and the footage of the fire; these appear to be from footage taken earlier of the ship's landing approach which was edited out of the final reel.\nFox Movietone.\nThe Fox Movietone footage was filmed by Al Gold (who filmed the fire sequence shown in the newsreel), Larry Kennedy and Deon de Titta. Gold stated that he was filming the ground crew when the fire started. However, the Movietone newsreel shows the ground crewmen catching the ropes early on, and it appears Gold's camera only started to film the fire as the airship's stern touched the ground. Kennedy and de Titta were closer to the airship when the fire started and had to run. Soundman Addison Tice was present as well, and recorded some of the audio of the disaster. Although the explosion sound in the newsreel was simulated, some of the audio may have been from the crash, as someone can be heard saying \"you're alright now Al!\".\nUniversal/\"Hearst News of the Day\".\nThe Universal cameraman stationed at the air field left early due to the bad weather and went to see a Broadway play. However, James J. Seeley filmed the disaster for Hearst's \"News of the Day\" and Universal used his footage of the fire for their report. Both newsreel companies had taken their own aerial footage of the airship over New York hours before the fire. One scene in the Universal reel showing passengers looking out of the windows, was taken from Universal's 1936 newsreel of one of the \"Hindenburg's\" previous transatlantic crossings.\nThis newsreel is the longest in showing the fire sequence. The camera pans upward showing the stern ablaze as it crashes down and the fire burns through the nose like a blowtorch. It does not show what is happening below the burning airship when it crashes to the ground as the camera is focused more on the fire itself until the bow nears the ground. At this point, navy ground crewmen can be seen walking close to the camera.\nThe \"Hearst News of the Day\" Newsreel is much less common than the Universal reel. A high quality government archive copy of the Universal version also appeared online (which also includes the Universal Newsreel of the wreckage a few days after, and the Path\u00e9 newsreel). Compared to the Universal edit, the Hearst newsreel has some different shots of the airship over New York and also shows footage of passengers inside the ship from 1936. The same narration is used in the Gaumont British News report which uses footage from both Universal/Hearst and Movietone. Another redub of the newsreel is the \"Victoria Record\".\nParamount.\nThe Paramount was filmed by Tommy Craven using an Eyemo, which had interchangeable lenses. During the landing approach, Craven alternated between wide-angle and telephoto views of the airship. As the ship dropped its ropes another cameraman can be seen. Craven was using the telephoto lens when the fire started (the footage starts a few seconds after the Hearst reel), giving a close-up view of the fire and people running away from the airship. The footage also shows flames burning away the ship's name as it crashes to the ground. Craven, an out-of-work news photographer aspiring to become a newsreel cameraman, was given the chance by Paramount to cover the \"Hindenburg\"'s arrival, which landed him the job at Paramount News. The footage has sometimes been misattributed to Al Mingalone. In 1957, Craven made an appearance in the Canadian game show \"Front Page Challenge\" recounting his experience filming the disaster.\nAmateur footage.\nThere is one known amateur film of the disaster, a 25-second 8mm home movie by Harold N. Schenck, giving a side-rear view of the disaster. While it was known by the Lakehurst Historical Society for many years and shown at an event for the 50th anniversary of the disaster, it was not publicly broadcast until May 2014 by NBC. A restoration and analysis of the film was performed for the 2021 \"Nova\" documentary \"Hindenburg: The New Evidence\". While missing the initial stages of the fire, it shows the fire a few seconds earlier than the Universal/Hearst newsreel, seconds before the airship's tail started to fall.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The series focuses on the relationship between single father Goofy and his son, Max, as well as their neighbor Pete and his family. Created by Robert Taylor and Michael Peraza Jr., the main series of 65 episodes aired in first-run syndication from 1992 to 1993 on \"The Disney Afternoon\" programming block, while an additional thirteen episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC. A Christmas special was also produced and aired in syndication in late 1992.\nWalt Disney Pictures produced two standalone spin-off films from the television series: the theatrical \"A Goofy Movie\", released on April 7, 1995, and direct-to-video sequel \"An Extremely Goofy Movie\", released on February 29, 2000.\nPremise.\nGoofy, a single father, moves back to his hometown of Spoonerville with his son, Max, and they end up moving in next door to his high school friend Pete, a used car salesman and owner of Honest Pete's Used Cars; Pete's wife Peg, a real estate agent; and their two children; their son P.J. (Pete Jr.) and daughter Pistol. Max and P.J. quickly become best friends and do practically everything together. Much of the show's humor comes from Max's normal personality, which contrasts with his father's.\nPromotion and releases.\nMarketing.\nIn June 1992, Buena Vista Television signed a deal with Kellogg's, Burger King, Pacific Theatres, and an unknown retailer to promote \"Goof Troop\" with a \"Get Goofy\" campaign valued at $100 million. From July to September, Kellogg's cereals included figurine giveaways featuring characters from the series. In October, Burger King promoted \"Goof Troop\" premium coupons, Burger King Kids Club displays, and other material. Pacific Theatres offered \"Goof Troop\" collector's cup giveaways. Starting on January 22, 1993, Pizza Hut promoted a Kid's Pizza Pack meal that offered Goof Wear as a premium and a personal pan pizza and beverage with one item, including a T-shirt, a legionnaire cap, a wrist band, and shoelaces.\nBroadcast.\n\"Goof Troop\" was initially previewed on The Disney Channel. \"Goof Troop\" was previewed in syndication in September 1992 with a two-hour television special. The series officially started to air regular episodes on September 7 on The Disney Afternoon programming block. Five days later, it debuted as a Saturday-morning cartoon on ABC. In February 1993, Disney announced that \"Goof Troop\" would not be renewed for a second season due to a failure of network license fees and rising production costs.\nReruns of the series later aired on The Disney Channel starting on September 3, 1996, and later on sister cable channel Toon Disney, with reruns airing on it until January 2005. The program returned from September 2006 until August 2008, with the Christmas special airing in December in the United States.\nHome media and streaming.\nIn February 1993, Disney released three volumes of the series on VHS in the United States: \"Banding Together!\", \"Goin' Fishin'!\", and \"The Race Is On!\". With the exception of the episode \"Counterfeit Goof\", the series is available in HD for purchase on Amazon Prime Video and Google Play. The series has been available to stream on Disney+ since its launch on November 12, 2019.\nReception.\nRatings.\n\"Goof Troop's\" debut on The Disney Afternoon block in syndication received a 3.9 Nielsen rating. On September 10, 1992, \"Goof Troop\" was tied with Fox Kids's \"\" with a 4.3 Nielsen rating, but surpassed the ratings of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" in seven out of thirteen metered markets. On average, \"Goof Troop\" received a 3.9 Nielsen rating on a four-day period as of September 1992. By October 26, it became the highest rated series of the week for children aged two to eleven, receiving a 6.6 Nielsen rating. Receiving a 9.1 Nielsen rating for children aged two to eleven by April 5, 1993, it was Disney's most popular show and the second most popular weekly children's show.\nLegacy.\n\"Goof Troop\" has had a lasting impact on Goofy and Pete\u2019s careers, as their later appearances throughout the 1990s to the mid 2000s were built on the show's status quo. These include \"A Goofy Movie\", \"Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas\", \"An Extremely Goofy Movie\", \"House of Mouse\" and \"Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas\", all of which feature Goofy and/or Pete's respective families as characters. Goofy and Pete also appeared on \"Bonkers\" and \"Raw Toonage\" in their \"Goof Troop\" designs.\nIn the \"DuckTales\" reboot series' premiere episode, Spoonerville is mentioned amongst a number of locations that McDuck Enterprises conducts business in. In the season three episode \"Quack Pack!\", Goofy makes an appearance in his \"Goof Troop\" design. In addition, Max and P.J. appear in photos in the episode.\nIn 2023, new photos were added to the inside of Goofy's house in the refurbished Mickey's Toontown area of Disneyland. The photos now include pictures of Goofy and Max, a picture of Pete with his family, and a picture of Max with P.J. and Pistol. There is also now a height chart for Goofy and Max on a doorway frame in the house.\nFranchise.\nFilms.\nTwo films based on \"Goof Troop\" were released. In the early 1990s, former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned \"A Goofy Movie\", suggesting the storyline inspired by a planned car trip with his daughter to \"Goof Troop\"'s story supervisor Jymn Magon. Suggesting to make a movie about teenagers, Magon thought it would be an interesting idea for the story of Goofy and Max. Premiering on April 5, 1995, at the AMC Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, the film was widely released two days later in the United States. The second film, \"An Extremely Goofy Movie\", was released on DVD and VHS on February 29, 2000.\nVideo game.\nA video game based on the series was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1993.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "73985", "revid": "40808726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73985", "title": "Nikephoros I", "text": "Byzantine emperor from 802 to 811\nNikephoros I (; 750 \u2013 26 July 811), also known as Nicephorus I, was Byzantine emperor from 802 to 811. He was General Logothete (finance minister) under Empress Irene, but later overthrew her to seize the throne for himself. Prior to becoming emperor, he was sometimes referred to as \"the Logothete\" () and \"Genikos\" or \"Genicus\" (), in recognition of his previous role as General Logothete.\nDuring his reign, Nikephoros engaged in military campaigns against both the Arabs and the Bulgarians, although the outcomes were varied. While leading an invasion into Bulgaria, he suffered a defeat and was killed at the Battle of Pliska.\nBackground.\nAccording to contemporary sources like Theophanes the Confessor and Patriarch Nikephoros, he was a Greek from Seleucia in Isauria and that\u2019s what modern scholars also agree on. Other several sources outside the Byzantine context, such as Michael the Syrian, al-Tabari, and Mas'udi, claim that there is a tradition that suggests Nikephoros had Ghassanid Arab origins and that he descended from the final Ghassanid ruler Jabala ibn al-Ayham, which is unlikely as there\u2019s no reliable contemporary source that claims so.\nAccession.\nNikephoros was appointed finance minister (\"logothet\u0113s tou genikou\") by Empress Irene. He played a significant role in a power struggle among courtiers. During Irene's years as sole ruler (797\u2013802), discontent grew due to her financial laxity. In 802, Charlemagne initiated marriage negotiations to \"unite\" the new Western and Eastern empires, thus resolving the problem of two emperors. Irene was happy to do so, but the proposal was frightening to some Byzantine civil and military officials, including Domestic of the Schools Niketas Triphyllios and relative of Irene Leon Sarantapechos, who began a conspiracy led by Nikephoros to overthrow Irene. While the Frankish ambassadors were still in Constantinople to negotiate the marriage, the conspiracy was set in motion. Irene was at her palace near the Harbour of Eleutherios. Nikephoros' co-conspirators falsely informed the guards that the courtier Aetios was forcing Irene to cede the throne to his brother Leo, and that opponents of the coup wished to make Nikephoros emperor instead. The guards sided with Nikephoros, and the palace was surrounded. The next day, Irene was removed and confined to the Great Palace of Constantinople. With the support of his co-conspirators, Nikephoros was then crowned emperor by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople in the Hagia Sophia on 31 October 802. At first Irene was banished to the nearby island of Prinkipo, but she was suspected of plotting with Aetios, and so banished to Lesbos.\nReign.\nNikephoros undertook a comprehensive reorganisation of the Byzantine Empire and made efforts to strengthen its borders. Similarly to the Isaurian emperors, Nikephoros enacted a vigorous policy of resettlement of impoverished soldiers and peasants from the themes of Asia Minor to Thrace, Macedonia, Epirus, Thessaly and southern Greece. He expanded and consolidated the imperial military forces in various themes, managing the empire's finances with strict discipline, which led to the displeasure and hostility of his subjects. To secure political stability and succession, he crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor on Christmas Day 803.\nAccording to later accounts by \"Theophanes Continuatus\" in the 10th century and \"Synopsis Chronike\" in the 13th century, the rebellion of General Bardanes Tourkos in 803 may have been triggered by dissatisfaction with Nikephoros' handling of army salaries. Two influential supporters of Bardanes, Generals Leo (later Emperor Leo V) and Michael (later Emperor Michael II), defected to Nikephoros, receiving major promotions as a reward. Bardanes surrendered on the condition of a pledge of safety for him and his followers but he was soon blinded and sent to a monastery. A conspiracy led by the patrician Arsaber in 808 had a similar outcome.\nIn 805, the Sclaveni of Patras in the Peloponnese rebelled against Nikephoros, who in response appropriated them and their property to the Archbishopric of Patras.\nUpon the death of Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople in February 806, Nikephoros appointed an iconodule layman, Nikephoros, causing the monks at the Monastery of Stoudios including Theodore the Stoudite and Plato of Sakkoudion to grow hostile towards him. Nikephoros also revived the Moechian controversy by convoking a synod in which Constantine VI's second marriage was declared lawful. Theodore persuaded his brother, Joseph, the Archbishop of Thessalonica, to refuse to celebrate the Christmas liturgy with the Patriarch and Emperor, leading to a confrontation. Nikephoros confirmed in a 809 synod that the emperor was not bound by canon law, and demoted Joseph, Theodore and Plato, banishing them to the Princes' Islands. Although the Stoudites were unsuccessful, Theodore's subsequent reputation benefited from his position and behaviour.\nNikephoros' imposition of taxes and his attempts to exert control over the church created a rift between him and the clergy. Although he appointed the iconodule Nikephoros as the patriarch, Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed unfavorably by ecclesiastical historians such as Theophanes the Confessor.\nItaly.\nIn 802, Charlemagne recognised the Republic of Venice as a Frankish fief under his third son, Pepin of Italy. Nikephoros responded by sending a fleet, but a compromise was reached in which the pro-Frankish Doge, Obelerio degli Antenori, would accept the additional title of \"spatharios\" to confirm his imperial loyalty. Nikephoros concluded a treaty known as the \"Pax Nicephori\" with Charlemagne, but refused to acknowledge his imperial status. Relations between the two deteriorated, leading to a war over Venice between 807 and 810 when Obelerio began to show signs of disloyalty, and a second Byzantine fleet arrived. While Nikephoros managed to suppress a rebellion in Venice in 807, he suffered significant losses to the Franks. The conflict was ultimately resolved after Nikephoros' death. Local opinion was overwhelmingly in favour of Byzantium, resulting in the assignment of Venice, Istria, the Dalmatian coast, and Southern Italy to the Eastern realm, while Rome, Ravenna, and the Pentapolis were included in the Western realm.\nCampaigns against the Arabs and Bulgars.\nShortly after Nikephoros' accession, he sent an insulting letter to Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, demanding the return of tribute which Empress Irene had paid. He withheld further tribute, and there may have been raids against Arab settlements. Nikephoros thus committed himself to a war against Harun. Due to Bardanes' disloyalty, Nikephoros was forced to lead the military campaign himself, resulting in a severe defeat at the Battle of Krasos in Phrygia in 805. Although there was an exchange of prisoners, Harun imposed a tribute of 30,000 dinars on Byzantium. In 806, a Muslim army comprising 135,000 soldiers invaded the Empire, once again led by Harun, and captured Heraclea Cybistra and Tyana. Unable to match the Muslim forces, Nikephoros agreed to peace on the condition of an immediate payment of 50,000 \"nomismata\" and an annual tribute of 30,000 \"nomismata\". Harun had taken measures to secure the Arab-Byzantine frontier including the construction of new fortified districts (\"al-Awasim\") in order to more effectively gain control of Asia Minor. However, with the Caliphate embroiled in a succession struggle following Harun al-Rashid's death in 809, Nikephoros was able to focus on dealing with Krum, the Khan of Bulgaria, who was posing a threat to the empire's northern frontiers and had recently conquered Serdica (now Sofia).\nIrene abolished several economic policies enacted by the Isaurians to sustain the Byzantine military, including the taxing of soldiers' widows to compensate for the loss of a fully-equipped soldier, if their household were to continue receiving a pension and tax exemptions. Thus, there was a manpower shortage by 809/810 which forced Nikephoros to decree that rural peasants be enlisted and equipped at the expense of their fellow villagers\u2014a policy which drew harsh criticism from Theophanes the Confessor who numbered it among Nikephoros' \"vexations\". In 809, near the river Struma, the Bulgars captured the wagon of the \"rogai\" (cash renumeration for the Byzantine military), which contained 79,200 \"nomismata\". In 811, the Arabs captured the \"rogai\" of the Armeniac Theme which totalled to 93,600 \"nomismata\". The payment of \"rogai\" was vital for the military and so the wagon was a key target for enemy capture.\nIn 811, Nikephoros launched an invasion of Bulgaria and was initially successful against Khan Krum and his armies, and sacked the Bulgarian capital, Pliska. The \"Chronicle\" of Michael the Syrian, a 12th-century patriarch of the Syrian Jacobites, describes the brutality and atrocities committed by Nikephoros: \"Now Nicephorus went with a large force against the Bulghars. He reached the capital city of their kingdom and caused great destruction, to the point that he threw their little children on the ground and mercilessly drove over them with his threshing wagons.\" As Nikephoros' forces were returning to Byzantium, the imperial army was ambushed and annihilated in the Varbitsa Pass at the Battle of Pliska by Krum. Nikephoros perished in the battle, and Krum is said to have had his head severed and used his skull as a drinking cup. The defeat was disastrous for Byzantine morale and for the political stability of the Empire.\nAssessment and legacy.\nThe reigns of the iconoclast emperors Leo III the Isaurian (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741) and Constantine V (r.\u2009741\u00a0\u2013\u00a0775) were militarily successful and saw the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat. According to the iconodule Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, Isaurian propaganda ascribed both their military successes and longevity to their iconoclasm. The validity of iconoclasm was only confirmed by the military disasters under the iconodule emperors Nikephoros I and Michael I Rhangabe (r.\u2009811\u00a0\u2013\u00a0813) as well as the success of the iconoclast Leo V the Armenian (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0820) against the Bulgars.\nFamily.\nBy an unknown wife Nikephoros I had at least two children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the first direct cinema (or cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9) documentaries . It was shot over five weeks between March and April 1968 at Northeast High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film was not shown in Philadelphia at the time of its release, because of Wiseman's concerns over what he called \"vague talk\" of a lawsuit.\nThe film was released in November 1968. \"High School\" has aired on PBS. Wiseman distributes his work (DVDs and 16mm prints) through Zipporah Films, which rents them to high schools, colleges, and libraries on a five-year long-term lease. \"High School\" was selected in 1991 for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nIn 1994, Wiseman released \"High School II\", a second documentary on high school, based on Central Park East Secondary School in New York City.\nReception and interpretation.\nFilm critic David Denby, writing in the \"New York Review of Books\", described \"High School\" as \"a savagely comic portrait\" of an urban high school in a period of emerging social unrest:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... [t]he movie was shot in 1968, and the school was then clearly attempting to hold off what it perceived as cultural anarchy outside its walls. Many of the teachers and administrators are exercising a bland and frightened dictatorship; their speech is deadened as if any sign of life might inspire the students to break out of control.\nMeanwhile, dull and demoralized by the teachers' inability to bring any subject to life, many of the best students are gathered in a class of malcontents where they sit in resentful torpor - they are also victims of the hypocrisy and authoritarianism promoted in the school ...In his review for \"The A.V. Club\", A.A. Dowd wrote that \"High School\" \u201cis filthy with the kind of revealing behavior that a documentarian can only hope and pray to capture on camera\u201d, concluding: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Beyond all the minute-by-minute highlights, High School accumulates a larger purpose. Wiseman seems to understand high school as a kind of audition for adulthood, and he sees in the faculty a knee-jerk attempt to program the student body\u2014through the reinforcement of social norms, the encouragement to conform, and the strict insistence on obedience. What he discovers, too, in this cloistered academic setting, is a microcosm for the cultural warfare happening all over America in the late \u201960s. High School gradually morphs into a quiet depiction of clashing generational values, with the instructors as torchbearers for a general worldview on the wane and the students as the voices of a new country being born in their image.For \"The New Yorker\", Pauline Kael wrote that the film was a \"revelation\" and that \"Wiseman is probably the most sophisticated intelligence to enter the documentary field in years.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Population loss during World War I was approximately 350,000. At the beginning of World War II the population of the Czech Republic reached its maximum (11.2\u00a0million). Due to the expulsion of the German residents after World War II, the Czech Republic lost about 3 million inhabitants and in 1947 the population was only 8.8\u00a0million.

Other ethnic groups include Germans, Romani people, Poles, and Hungarians. Historical minorities like Germans and Poles are declining due to assimilation. There is also a growing community from Vietnam. Other ethnic communities like Greeks, Turks, Italians, and Yugoslavs are found in Prague. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Slovaks living in the Czech Republic have comprised roughly 3% of the population.\nThere are different groups of national and ethnic minorities in the Czech Republic. The only \"old minority\" is Poles in the Trans-Olza region, while the \"new minorities\" are scattered among the majority population (generally in the larger towns). While some of the minorities have the whole social structure of Czech society (Poles, Slovaks, Greeks and Ukrainians), other represent only some of the social groups (i.e. Russian newcomers of middle class, and Romani people who generally represent the underclass).\nAfter World War I.\n1 In 2011 a large part of the population did not claim any ethnicity, before the census it was widely mediatized that the question is not mandatory. The vast majority of those who did so are presumed to be ethnic Czechs, number of whom dropped by roughly the same amount that the number of undeclared people rose, circa 2.5\u00a0million.\nThe legal position of the minorities is defined foremost in the Act No. 273/2001 Coll. (The Rights of the Minorities Act) which implements the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms, Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and \"Recommendation of the Council of Europe No. 1201\". There is a number of other enactments which to lesser extent deal with the minorities.\nA special situation applies in the case of Moravians and Silesians, who are frequently allocated within the group of Czechs when it comes to the statistical data.\nOfficially recognized minorities.\nMinorities, which \"traditionally and on a long term basis live within the territory of the Czech Republic\" enjoy some privileges. As of 2022 there are 14 such officially recognized minorities, which are (alphabetically): Belarusians, Bulgarians, Croatians, Germans, Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, Romani people, Russians, Rusyns, Serbs, Slovaks, Ukrainians and Vietnamese.\nCitizens belonging to the officially recognized minorities enjoy the right to \"use their language in communication with authorities and in courts of law\". Article 25 of the Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms provides the right of the national and ethnic minorities to education and communication with authorities in their own language. Act No. 500/2004 Coll. (\"The Administrative Rule\") in its paragraph 16 (4) (\"Procedural Language\") provides that a citizen of the Czech Republic who belongs to a national or an ethnic minority, which traditionally and on a long-term basis lives within the territory of the Czech Republic, has the right to address an administrative agency and proceed before it in the language of the minority. In the case that the administrative agency does not have an employee with knowledge of the language, the agency is bound to obtain a translator at the agency's own expense. According to Act No. 273/2001 (\"About The Rights of Members of Minorities\") paragraph 9 (\"The right to use language of a national minority in dealing with authorities and in the courts of law\") the same also applies to members of national minorities in the courts of law.\nBulgarians\nThe economic migration of Bulgarians to the Czech Republic began in the 1990s. 4,363 citizens claimed to have Bulgarian nationality in the 2001 census. They mostly live in the large cities and towns, such as Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Karlovy Vary, Kladno, \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem, D\u011b\u010d\u00edn, and Hav\u00ed\u0159ov. Nowadays the newcomers from Bulgaria aim for these areas in particular, where they can join an already established community. Many of these economic immigrants have dual citizenship of both the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. However most of the recent immigrants still only have Bulgarian citizenship.\nThe Bulgarian Cultural Organisation publishes the magazine \"Roden Glas\", while a folklore organisation \"Kytka\" promotes traditional Bulgarian dances. Among other organisations are \"Pirin\", \"Zaedno\", \"Vazra\u017edane\" and \"Hyshove\".\nAs an officially recognized minority the Bulgarian citizens of the Czech Republic enjoy the right to use their language in communication with authorities and in the courts of law. They also enjoy a number of other rights connected to the status of recognized minority, e.g. the right to education in their own language: the first Bulgarian school in the current Czech Republic was established in 1946 in Prague.\nGermans\nThe German minority of the Czech Republic, historically the largest minority of the country, was almost entirely removed when 3 million were forcibly expelled in 1945\u201346 on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement. The constitution guarantees rights for minority languages, however there are 13 municipalities with German minority constituting 10% of population, which qualifies for such provisions. There is no bilingual education system in Western and Northern Bohemia, where the German minority is mostly concentrated. However, this is in large part due to the absence of German-speaking youth, a heritage of the post-war policy of the Communist government.\nAccording to the 2001 census there remain 13 municipalities and settlements in the Czech Republic with more than 10% Germans.\nMany representatives of expellees' organizations support the erection of bilingual signs in all formerly German-speaking territory as a visible sign of the bilingual linguistic and cultural heritage of the region, but their efforts are not supported by some of the current inhabitants, as the vast majority of the current population is not of German descent.\nThe German-Czech Declaration of 21 January 1997 covered the two most critical issues\u2014the role of some Sudeten Germans in the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and their expulsion after World War II.\nGreeks\nAnother influential minority are Greeks. Large numbers of Greeks arrived in Czechoslovakia during the end of the Greek Civil War. The first transports of Greek children arrived in 1948 and 1949. Later, more transports, also including adults, arrived. They were partly leftists, communists and guerillas with their relatives, hence the willingness of Czechoslovak government to allow the immigration. This was viewed rather as a temporary solution. After the defeat of DSE and other left-wing guerillas, the Greeks stayed in Czechoslovakia. In total more than 12,000 Greeks immigrated to Czechoslovakia between 1948 and 1950. Today, there are about 7000 Greeks in the country (3219 according to 2001 census data), mostly in the 3 biggest towns \u2013 Prague, Brno, Ostrava \u2013 and also in Bohum\u00edn, Hav\u00ed\u0159ov, Jesen\u00edk, Karvin\u00e1, Krnov, \u0160umperk, T\u0159inec, Vrbno pod Prad\u011bdem and \u017damberk (apart from the last one these towns are in Silesia).\nPoles\nThe most concentrated linguistic minority in the Czech Republic are ethnic Poles, historically the plurality, today constituting about 10% of the population of Karvin\u00e1 and Fr\u00fddek-M\u00edstek districts. Poles have the right to use their language in official dealings; the public media (Czech TV and Czech Radio) regularly broadcast in Polish; and there are many Polish primary and secondary schools in the area. The Polish minority has been decreasing substantially since World War II as education in Polish was difficult to obtain, while Czech authorities did not permit bilingual signs to maintain Polish awareness among the population.\nThe erection of bilingual signs has technically been permitted since 2001, if a minority constitutes 10% of the population of a municipality. The requirement that a petition be signed by the members of minority was cancelled, thus simplifying the whole process. Still, only a couple of villages with large Polish minorities have bilingual signs (Vendryn\u011b/W\u0119drynia for instance).\nRomanis\nAnother minority is the Roma, who nonetheless have very little influence on Czech policy. Around 90% of the Roma that lived in the Czech Republic prior to World War II were exterminated by the Nazi Porajmos. The Roma there now are 80% post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary, or the descendants thereof. In total, the Roma in the CR now number around 200,000. There is Romani press in the CR, written in both Czech and Romani, but Romani radio is broadcast in Czech and there is no Romani television. Romani is also absent from legislative, judiciary, and other political texts but it has recently entered some university and elementary school courses. Life expectancy, literacy, median wage, school enrolment, and other socio-economic markers remain low while Roma compose the majority of prison and habitual offender populations despite accounting for only a fraction of a percent of Czech population.\nImmigration.\nAccording to the Czech Statistical Office as of 31 December 2020 there were 632,570 legal foreign residents in the Czech Republic (5.1% of the total population). Residents from Ukraine are the largest group (165,356), followed by residents of Slovakia (124,544). There are also Asian immigrant communities in the Czech Republic. The largest is the Vietnamese one (62,842) followed by the Mongolians (10,135) and the Chinese (7,940). During the communist era the governments of Czechoslovakia and Vietnam had a deal concerning the education of Vietnamese people in Czechoslovakia. Vietnamese people came to Czechoslovakia for the first time in 1956 and then the number of new migrants grew until the fall of communism. First generation Vietnamese work mostly as small-scale businessmen in markets. Still, many Vietnamese are without Czech citizenship. One of the towns with the largest Vietnamese communities is Cheb. \nOther large immigrant groups come from Russia (41,692), Poland (20,733), Germany (20,861), Bulgaria (17,917) and Romania (18,396).\nLanguages.\nThe Czech language (divided into three dialects in Bohemia, four dialects in Moravia, and two dialects in Czech Silesia) is the official language of the state. There is also the transitional Cieszyn Silesian dialect as well as the Polish language in Cieszyn Silesia, both spoken in Czech Silesia. Various Sudeten German dialects are currently practically extinct: present Czech Germans speak mainly Czech and/or Standard German. Czech Sign Language is the language of most of the deaf community.\nThe Czech Republic officially recognizes a series of minorities who have legal status and may use their own language to conduct official business, which results in a series of minority languages that may be used officially by members of the recognized minority groups.\nReligion.\nThe 2021 census did not contain list of religious organisations and they had to be written by the respondent (unlike in the previous ones). Therefore another 231 thousand people responded with \"catholicism\" or similar response, 71 thousand people identified simply with \"Christianity\" and 27 thousand people claimed to be \"protestants\" or \"evangelicals\". Moreover, after doubling their followers the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia was the 2nd strongest church in 2021 census with 40,681 faithful.\nAlmost half (45.2%) of the Czech population prefer not to respond to religious questions in the Census. Others claim to have no religion or that they are without religious affiliation (34.2%). In comparison, one in every five claims to have some personal belief (20.6%).\nThe largest denominations are Roman Catholicism, estimated at 10.3% of the population, Protestant (0.5%), Hussites (0.4%). Other organized religions, including non-organized believers, totalled about (9.4%) (as of Census 2011).\nAccording to the Eurobarometer Poll 2005, 19% of Czech citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 50% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 30% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\"; the percentage of believers is thus the lowest of EU countries after Estonia with 16%.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His career, not uniformly successful in matters of statecraft or of war, nonetheless greatly contributed to the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire during the 10th century. In the east, Nikephoros completed the conquest of Cilicia and retook the islands of Crete and Cyprus, opening the path for subsequent Byzantine incursions reaching as far as Upper Mesopotamia and the Levant; these campaigns earned him the sobriquet \"pale death of the Saracens.\"\nEarly life and career.\nNikephoros Phokas was born around 912. From his paternal side, he belonged to the Phokas family which had produced several distinguished generals, including Nikephoros' father Bardas Phokas, brother Leo Phokas, and grandfather Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, who had all served as commanders of the field army (\"domestikos t\u014dn schol\u014dn\"). From his maternal side he belonged to the Maleinoi, a powerful Anatolian Greek family which had settled in Cappadocia.[ii] Early in his life Nikephoros had married Stephano. She had died before he rose to fame, and after her death he took an oath of chastity.\nEarly Eastern campaigns.\nNikephoros joined the army at an early age. He was appointed the military governor of the Anatolic Theme in 945 under Emperor Constantine VII. In 954 or 955 Nikephoros was promoted to Domestic of the Schools, replacing his father, Bardas Phokas, who had suffered a series of defeats by the Hamdanids and by the Abbasids. The new position essentially placed Nikephoros in charge of the eastern Byzantine army. From 955, the Hamdanids in Aleppo entered a period of unbroken decline until their destruction in 1002. In June 957 Nikephoros managed to capture and destroy Adata. The Byzantines continued to push their advantage against the Arabs until the collapse of the Hamdanids, except for the period from 960 to 961, when the army turned its focus to the reconquest of Crete.\nConquest of Crete.\nFrom the ascension of Emperor Romanos II in 959, Nikephoros and his younger brother Leo Phokas were placed in charge of the eastern and western field armies respectively. In 960, 27,000 oarsmen and marines were assembled to man a fleet of 308 ships carrying 50,000 troops. At the recommendation of the influential minister Joseph Bringas, Nikephoros was entrusted to lead this expedition against the Muslim Emirate of Crete. The Byzantines disembarked near Almyros, where they defeated a minor Arab force. Nikephoros soon began a nine-month siege of the fortress town of Chandax, where his forces suffered through the winter due to supply issues. Following a failed assault and many raids into the countryside, Nikephoros entered Chandax on 6 March 961 and soon wrested control of the entire island from the Muslims. Upon returning to Constantinople, he was denied the usual honor of a triumph, but was permitted an ovation in the Hippodrome.\nLater Eastern campaigns.\nFollowing the conquest of Crete, Nikephoros returned to the east and marched a large and well-equipped army into Cilicia. In February 962, he captured Anazarbos and threatened the major city of Tarsus, which had recently ceased to recognize the Hamdanid Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla. Nikephoros continued to ravage the Cilician countryside and won an open battle against Ibn al-Zayyat, governor of Tarsus, who killed himself after the defeat. Thereafter, Nikephoros returned to the regional capital of Caesarea. Upon the beginning of the new campaigning season al-Dawla entered the Byzantine Empire to conduct raids, a strategy which left Aleppo dangerously undefended. Nikephoros soon took Syrian Hierapolis. In December, an army split between Nikephoros and John I Tzimiskes marched towards Aleppo, quickly routing an opposing force led by Naja al-Kasaki. Al-Dawla's force caught up with the Byzantines, but he too was routed, and Nikephoros and Tzimiskes entered Aleppo on 24 December. The loss of the city would prove to be both a strategic and moral disaster for the Hamdanids. It was probably on these campaigns that Nikephoros earned the sobriquet \"Pale Death of the Saracens\".\nAscension to the throne.\nOn 15 March 963, Emperor Romanos II died unexpectedly at the age of twenty-five of uncertain cause. Both contemporary and later historians attribute the death to overindulgence in sex and drinking, or suspect that Romanos was poisoned by his wife, the Empress Theophano (c. 941\u2013after 976). Theophano had already gained a reputation for intelligence and ambition, and hostile later historians characterize her as ruthless in achieving her goals. She now became regent for her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, who had already been crowned co-emperors by Romanos but were respectively five and three years old at the time of his death.\nTheophano's authority was challenged by Joseph Bringas, a eunuch palace official seeking to keep the primacy he had attained in the reign of Romanos. He also tried to reduce the power of Nikephoros Phokas, who had been accepted as the actual commander of the army and maintained a strong connection to the aristocracy. On July 2 Bringas' fears were realized, when the armies, including their highest-ranking officers, proclaimed Nikephoros emperor in Caesarea. Before news of the proclamation could spread, Nikephoros sent a fleet to secure the Bosphorus Strait against his enemies. Around the same time, he appointed Tzimiskes as Domestic of the East, now taking on the formal roles of emperor. He then sent a letter to Constantinople requesting to be accepted as co-emperor. In response, Bringas locked down the city, forcing Nikephoros' father Bardas Phokas to seek sanctuary in the Hagia Sophia, while his brother Leo Phokas escaped the city in disguise. Bringas was able to garner some support within the city from a few high-ranking officers, namely Marianos Argyros, but he himself was not a skilled orator and was unable to obtain the support of other popular officials such as the Patriarch Polyeuctus and the general Basil Lekapenos. The people of Constantinople soon turned against his cause, killing Argyros in a riot and forcing Bringas to flee. On August 16, Nikephoros was proclaimed emperor and married the empress Theophano.\nReign.\nWestern Wars.\nNikephoros II was not very successful in his western wars. Under his reign, relations with the Bulgarians worsened. It is likely that he bribed the Kievan Rus' to raid the Bulgarians in retaliation for them not blocking Magyar raids. This breach in relations triggered a decades-long decline in Byzantine-Bulgarian diplomacy and was a prelude to the wars fought between the Bulgarians and later Byzantine emperors, particularly Basil II.\nNikephoros' first military failures came in Sicily. In 962 the son of the governor of Fatimid Sicily, Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi, captured and reduced the Byzantine city of Taormina. The last major Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, Rometta, appealed to the newly crowned emperor Nikephoros for aid against the approaching Muslim armies. Nikephoros renounced his payments of tribute to the Fatimid caliphs, and sent a huge fleet, purportedly boasting a crew of around 40,000 men, under Patrikios Niketas and Manuel Phokas, to the island. The Byzantine forces, however, were swiftly routed in Rometta and at the Battle of the Straits, and Rometta soon fell to the Muslims, completing the Islamic conquest of Sicily.\nIn 967, the Byzantines and the Fatimids hastily concluded a peace treaty to cease hostilities in Sicily. Both empires had grander issues to attend to: the Fatimids were preparing to invade Egypt, and tensions were flaring up on mainland Italy between the Byzantines and the German emperor Otto I. The constant tension between the Germans and the Byzantines was largely due to mutual cultural biases, exacerbated by each group styling itself the true successor of the Roman Empire. Conflicts in southern Italy were preceded by religious contests between the two empires and by the malicious writings of Liutprand of Cremona. Otto first invaded Byzantine Apulia in 968 and failed to take Bari. Early the next year, he once again moved against Byzantine Apulia and Calabria, but, unable to capture Cassano or Bovino, failed to make any progress. In May he returned north, leaving Pandulf Ironhead to take charge of the siege. Pandulf was defeated and taken prisoner by the Byzantine general Eugenios, who went on to besiege Capua and enter Salerno. The two empires would continue to skirmish with each other until after the reign of Nikephoros, but neither side was able to make permanent or significant gains.\nEastern Wars.\nFrom 964 to 965, Nikephoros led an army of 40,000 men which conquered Cilicia and conducted raids in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria, while the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes recovered Cyprus. In the spring of 964, Nikephorus headed east. During the summer he captured Anazarbos and Adana before withdrawing. Later that year, Nikephoros attempted to quickly take Mopsuestia, but failed, returning to Caesarea. It was around this time that Niketas Chalkoutzes instigated a coup in Cyprus, which at the time was a shared condominium between the Byzantines and the Arabs. In the summer of 965, the conquest of Cilicia began in earnest. Nikephorus and Tzimiskes seized Mopsuestia July 13, while Leo Phokas invested Tarsus and Nikephoros and Tzimiskes arrived soon after. Nikephoros won a pitched battle against the Tarsiots, routing their forces with his cataphracts. Within a fortnight, on August 16, Tarsus surrendered. Nikephoros allowed the inhabitants to depart unharmed before the city was plundered by his army. With the fall of these two strongholds, Cilicia was in the hands of the Byzantines.\nIn June 966, Sayf al-Dawla and the Byzantines held an exchange of prisoners at Samosata. In October 966, Nikephoros led an expedition to raid Amida, Dara and Nisibis, then marched towards Hierapolis, where he took a relic with the image of Jesus to be later placed in the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos in Constantinople. A detachment sent to Barbalissos returned with 300 prisoners, after which Nikephoros raided Wadi Butnan, Chalcis, Tizin and Artah, and finally laid siege to Antioch, abandoning the project after eight days due to a lack of supplies.\nIn 967 or 968, Nikephoros annexed the Armenian state of Taron by diplomacy, in addition to Arzen and Martyropolis. He commenced another expedition in October 968 by besieging Antioch for thirteen days. Afterwards the Byzantine army moved south, raiding and sacking most of the fortresses and cities along its path, including Maarrat Misrin, Arra, Capharda, Larissa, Epiphania and Emesa in the Orontes valley, until it reached the city of Tripoli; from Tripoli, Nikephoros moved to take Arca, Antarados, Maraclea, and Gabala, and received the submission of Laodicea. His aim was to cut off Antioch from its allies. Not wishing to damage its buildings, the emperor decided to take it by hunger. A detachment (taxiarchy) of 1500 men was left in the fort of Pagrae, controlling the road from Antioch to Alexandretta, while the occupation of Maarat Misrin, Tizin, and Artach closed potential relief routes from Aleppo and Damascus. The siege ended in 969, when Michael Bourtzes, the \"patrikios\" commanding the fort, disobeyed the emperor's orders and took Antioch with a surprise attack, supported by the troops of the \"stratopedarch\" Petros, eunuch of the Phokas family. Bourtzes was disgraced for his insubordination, and later joined the plot that killed Phokas.\nCivil administration.\nNikephoros' popularity was largely based on his conquests. Due to the resources he allocated to his army, Nikephoros was compelled to exercise a rigid economic policy in other departments. He retrenched court largess and curtailed the immunities of the clergy, and while he had an ascetic disposition, he forbade the foundation of new monasteries. By his heavy imposts and the debasement of the Byzantine currency, along with the enforcement and implementation of taxes across the centralized regions of the empire, he forfeited his popularity with the people and gave rise to riots.\nNikephoros also disagreed with the church on theological grounds. He wished the church to elevate those soldiers who died in battle against the Saracens to the positions of martyrs in the church \u2013 similar to the status of \"Shahid\" which the Emperor's Muslim foes bestowed on their own fallen soldiers. In the Christian context, this was a highly controversial and unpopular demand.\nIn 967, he sparked a controversy in the capital by making a display of his military maneuvers in the Hippodrome similar in style to those displayed by the emperor Justinian centuries earlier preceding the Nika riots and its violent suppression within the stadium itself. The crowd within the Hippodrome panicked and began a stampede to retreat from the stadium, resulting in numerous deaths. In order to repopulate the regained lands in the East, he invited the Syriac Orthodox patriarch John VII Sarigta and his community to live in these lands. The Syriac community subsequently experienced a golden age with many monasteries founded, especially in the region around Melitene, such as the Monastery of B\u0101rid, where John VII Sarigta and his successors came to reside.\nNikephoros was the author of extant treatises on military tactics, most famously the \"Praecepta Militaria\", which contains valuable information on the art of war in his time, and the less-known \"On Skirmishing\" (), which concerned guerrilla-like tactics for defense against a superior enemy invasion force along the eastern frontier; though it purports that the tactics were no longer needed since the danger of the Muslim states to the east had subsided. It is likely that this latter work, at least, was not composed by the Emperor but rather for him; translator and editor George T. Dennis suggests that it was perhaps written by his brother Leo Phokas, then Domestic of the West. Nikephoros was a very devout man, and he helped his friend, the monk Athanasios, found the monastery of Great Lavra on Mount Athos.\nAssassination.\nThe plot to assassinate Nikephoros began when he dismissed Michael Bourtzes from his position following his disobedience in the siege of Antioch. Bourtzes was disgraced, and he would soon find an ally with whom to plot against Nikephoros. Towards the end of 965, Nikephoros had John Tzimiskes exiled to eastern Asia Minor for suspected disloyalty, then recalled him upon the intercession of Theophano. According to Joannes Zonaras and John Skylitzes, the imperial couple had a loveless relationship: Nikephoros continued his ascetic lifestyle, while Theophano and Tzimiskes pursued a secret affair and plotted to overthrow the emperor. On 11 December 969, Tzimiskes and his entourage entered Nikephoros' bedchamber, through a door Theophano had left unlocked, and assassinated him. Nikephoros prayed to the mother of God as he died. Following his death, the Phokas family broke into insurrection under Nikephoros' nephew Bardas Phokas, but their revolt was promptly subdued as Tzimiskes ascended the throne.\nLegacy.\nContemporary descriptions.\nThe tension between East and West caused by Nikephoros' policies may be glimpsed in the unflattering description of him and his court in Bishop Liutprand of Cremona's \"Relatio de legatione Constantinopolitana\", a work clouded by the ill-treatment its author received while on a diplomatic mission to Constantinople. Nikephoros, a man of war, was not apt at diplomacy. At the time of the embassy his mood had been worsened by a letter from Pope John XIII, who referred to Otto I as Emperor of Rome and to Nikephoros merely as Emperor of the Greeks. Liutprand failed in his goal of procuring an Imperial princess as a wife for Otto's young son, the future emperor Otto II.\nLiutprand calls Nikephoros:\n...a monstrosity of a man, a pygmy, fat-headed and like a mole as to the smallness of his eyes; disgusting with his short, broad, thick, and half hoary beard; disgraced by a neck an inch long; very bristly through the length and thickness of his hair; in color an Ethiopian; one whom it would not be pleasant to meet in the middle of the night; with extensive belly, lean of loin, very long of hip considering his short stature, small of shank, proportionate as to his heels and feet; clad in a garment costly but too old, and foul-smelling and faded through age; shod with Sicyonian shoes; bold of tongue, a fox by nature, in perjury, and lying a Ulysses.\nWhereas Bishop Liutprand describes the emperor's hair as being bristly, Leo the Deacon says it was black with \"tight curls\" and \"unusually long\".\nJohn Julius Norwich says, about his murder and burial, \"It was a honourable place; but Nikephoros Phocas, the White Death of the Saracens, hero of Syria and Crete, saintly and hideous, magnificent and insufferable, had deserved a better end\".\nDescendants.\nDuring the last decades of the tenth century, the Phokades repeatedly tried to get their hands again on the throne, and almost succeeded when Nikephoros' nephew, Bardas Phokas the Younger, rebelled against the rule of Basil II. His death, possibly by cardiac arrest, put an end to the rebellion, and ultimately to the political prominence of the Phokades, although Bardas the Younger's own son, Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, launched another abortive revolt in 1022 along with Nikephoros Xiphias.\n\"Praecepta Militaria\".\nPhokas was the author of a military manual, the \"Praecepta Militaria\".\nMemory in Crete.\nDue to his role in ending Saracen rule in Crete, Nikephoros II is often featured as a point of reference in legends that circulated in Crete during the later Middle Ages, when the island was under Venetian rule and the local Greek inhabitants sought inspiration in the Byzantine imperial past. Nikephoros II was also brought into the legend of the twelve noble families of Crete by sending one of his sons to be the governor of Crete. The Kallergis family, the most prominent of the Venetian-era Cretan nobility, claimed descent from Nikephoros II Phokas.\nModern honours.\nOn 19 November 2004, the Hellenic Navy named its tenth in his honour as \"Nikiforos Fokas\" F-466 (formerly HNLMS \"Bloys Van Treslong\" F-824). Also, in the Rethymno regional unit in Crete, a municipality (Nikiforos Fokas) is named after him, as are many streets throughout Greece.\nIn popular culture.\nNikephoros II appears as a character in:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74007", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74007", "title": "Technology assessment", "text": "Research area dealing with trends in science and technology and related social developments\nTechnology assessment (TA, , ) is a practical process of determining the value of a new or emerging technology in and of itself or against existing technologies. This is a means of assessing and rating the new technology from the time when it was first developed to the time when it is potentially accepted by the public and authorities for further use. In essence, TA could be defined as \"a form of policy research that examines short- and long term consequences (for example, societal, economic, ethical, legal) of the application of technology.\"\nGeneral description.\nTA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is a way of trying to forecast and prepare for the upcoming technological advancements and their repercussions to the society, and then make decisions based on the judgments. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Technology assessment was initially practiced in the 1960s in the United States where it would focus on analyzing the significance of \"supersonic transportation, pollution of the environment and ethics of genetic screening.\"\nAlso, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained ethicists themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress. TA is a very broad phenomenon which also includes aspects such as \"diffusion of technology (and technology transfer), factors leading to rapid acceptance of new technology, and the role of technology and society.\"\nTechnology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.\nTherefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.\nAn important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called Collingridge dilemma: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used. It emphasizes on the fact that technologies, in their early stage, are unpredictable with regards to their implications and rather tough to regulate or control once it has been widely accepted by the society. Shaping or directing this technology is the desired direction becomes difficult for the authorities at this period of time. There have been several approaches put in place in order to tackle this dilemma, one of the common ones being \"anticipation.\" In this approach, authorities and assessors \"anticipate ethical impacts of a technology (\"technomoral scenarios\"), being too speculative to be reliable, or on ethically regulating technological developments (\"sociotechnical experiments\"), discarding anticipation of the future implications.\"\nTechnology assessments, which are a form of cost\u2013benefit analysis, are a medium for decision makers to evaluate and analyze solutions with regards to the particular technology assessment, and choose a best possible option which is cost effective and obeys the authoritative and budgetary requirements. However, they are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives. Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in '\u2019Technology, Environment, and Human Values'\u2019, technology assessment is \"a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation.\"\nOverall, technology assessment is a very broad field which reaches beyond just technology and industrial phenomenons. It handles the assessment of effects, consequences, and risks of a technology, but also is a forecasting function looking into the projection of opportunities and skill development as an input into strategic planning.\" Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, hydrogen technologies, nuclear technology, molecular nanotechnology, pharmacology, organ transplants, gene technology, artificial intelligence, the Internet and many more. \nForms and concepts of technology assessment.\nThe following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.\nTechnology assessment institutions around the world.\nMany TA institutions are members of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network, some are working for the STOA panel of the European Parliament and formed the European Technology Assessment Group (ETAG).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He became a general during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, serving with distinction during the Pecheneg revolt of 1048\u20131053. In 1057 he aided Isaac I Komnenos in overthrowing Emperor Michael VI Bringas, leading forces at the decisive Battle of Petroe. Under the Emperor Constantine X Doukas Nikephoros was made \"doux\", first of Thessalonica and subsequently of Antioch. In the latter position he repelled numerous incursions from the Emirate of Aleppo. Constantine X died in 1067 and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa married Romanos IV Diogenes; Nikephoros, who had also been a candidate for Eudokia's hand and the position of emperor, was exiled and remained in retirement until Emperor Michael VII summoned him to serve as \"kouropalates\" and governor of the Anatolic Theme.\nHaving insulted Emperor Michael with overly frank appeals for help against the Seljuk Turks in Byzantine Anatolia, Nikephoros decided to protect himself from reprisals by seizing the throne. His military acumen and family renown won him strong support, and he took power in 1078 with the approval of the Byzantine Senate and the citizens of Constantinople. As emperor he faced numerous revolts, including those of Nikephoros Bryennios, Nikephoros Basilakes, and Constantine Doukas, as well as an attempted assassination by the Varangian Guard. Nikephoros performed many acts to increase his legitimacy and support, spending large amounts on donatives for the army and his supporters, forgiving all debt in arrears, and instituting minor legal reforms. Diplomatically, he secured the submission of Theodore Gabras and Philaretos Brachamios, governors of Trebizond and Antioch, respectively, who had become de facto independent of the Byzantine Empire.\nIn 1081, Alexios I Komnenos, sent to counter a Norman invasion, instead conspired to make himself emperor. He captured Constantinople on 1 April and arrested Nikephoros, who abdicated and became a monk in the Monastery of Peribleptus.\nHistoriography and sources.\nThe most comprehensive account of Nikephoros III's life and reign is \"The History\", written in the 1070s by the Byzantine historian Michael Attaleiates and dedicated to Nikephoros himself. Attaleiates is the primary contemporary source for Nikephoros's reign and counters the narrative of Byzantine historian Michael Psellos's \"Chronographia\", the only other contemporary source. Attaleiates highlights Nikephoros's achievements, often recording actions which no other source mentions, such as his eleven-day rearguard command after the Battle of Zygos Pass, to which Attaleiates dedicates several pages. Attaleiates's high opinion of Nikephoros was likely shaped by Nikephoros raising him to the rank of \"vestes\", and by his benefiting from Nikephoros's patronage. Much of Attaleiates's work is shaped by his personal opinion of contemporary events, such as his bias against Nikephoros's predecessor, Emperor Michael VII Doukas.\nThe Battle of Manzikert in 1071 is mentioned only in a single paragraph by Psellos, who chiefly comments that Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes should have studied strategy better; however, Attaleiates devotes an entire chapter to the details of the decisive battle, including the events before and after the battle, while also giving his own commentary and anecdotes of the actions and mistakes which were made. Attaleiates is invaluable in providing an understanding of what the populace of the Byzantine Empire, outside of the nobles of Constantinople, thought of the Turkish invasion of Anatolia. These opinions explain why Attaleiates condemns Michael VII and praises Nikephoros to such a degree: in the view of the average Byzantine, Michael was primarily at fault for the loss of Byzantine Anatolia, Attaleiates's homeland, whereas Nikephoros, a fellow Anatolian, actively worked to prevent the further collapse of the Byzantine Empire.\nPsellos's \"Chronographia\" is largely useless in understanding the life of Nikephoros; while he provides a contemporary source from the view of the Byzantine nobles, he is far from objective in his review of events, although his retelling of Michael's letter to Nikephoros is useful as it shares both Michael's and Psellos's opinion of the events. While Attaleiates generally provides a favorable account of Nikephoros, he does mention some of his failings, such as his defeat by the Oghuz Turks in 1063, whereas Psellos intentionally fails to mention several failings of Michael VII in his panegyrical chapter on him, including his loss of Anatolia to the Seljuk Turks and the debasement of currency which took place under him. The other main source for Nikephoros's reign is Anna Komnene's \"Alexiad\", although she was born after the events, and the first sections of her account are generally derived from the writings of her husband Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger. She is also biased as a result of being the daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who seized the throne from Nikephoros, causing the account to be from the view of Alexios's rise. While her narrative primarily focuses on the actions of Alexios, it does provide information on Nikephoros's last years in power and his subsequent exile to a monastery.\nNikephoros is briefly mentioned by John Skylitzes in his \"Synopsis of Histories\", which covers the events of 811\u20131057, but is referenced far more in Skylitzes's \"Continuatus\". Although Skylitzes is a contemporary source, his \"Continuatus\" was written under Alexios, whom he is known to have favored; however, he generally follows the more objective account of Attaleiates, who was one of his main sources. Nikephoros Bryennius the Younger's \"Material for a History\" chiefly relies on the testimonies of his contemporaries, including his father, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder, and Alexios himself; however, it also relies on the works of Attaleiates, Psellos, and Skylitzes. Nikephoros Bryennios's bias in favor of Alexios and against Nikephoros III is an inevitable result of being married to Alexios's daughter, and of the fact that his father was blinded by Nikephoros. These authors mostly cover the career of Nikephoros from his role in the Battle of the Zygos Pass in 1053 to his death.\nWilliam of Apulia, a Norman historian who wrote in the 1090s, mentions Nikephoros during his account of Robert Guiscard's invasion of the Byzantine Empire in 1081; as a foreigner, he was removed from the court politics of the Byzantine Empire, and thus provides a fair and objective view of Nikephoros. Nikephoros is also mentioned in the accounts of both Matthew of Edessa and Michael the Syrian, who wrote their chronicles several centuries after the events and are therefore quite objective in their treatment of Nikephoros, lacking political intrigue related to him. Michael is quite brief in his account of Nikephoros, but gives a balanced view \u2013 while he portrays Michael VII as incompetent and corrupt, he does praise Nikephoros as Attaleiates does. Michael's usefulness is limited by his brevity on the subject, although it is likely, based on the contents of his chronicle, that Attaleiates himself served as a source. Matthew's chronicle is longer, but clearly derived from the work of Psellos, as Matthew openly praises Michael VII while ridiculing Nikephoros, who he portrays as a hedonistic womanizer; ironically the exact accusation which Michael the Syrian makes against Michael VII.\nBiography.\nEarly life and family.\nNikephoros was born in 1002 to Michael Botaneiates and his wife, members of the Botaneiates family, a prominent military family from the Anatolic Theme. According to Attaleiates, Nikephoros's grandfather Nikephoros and father Michael both served as commanders under Basil II (r.\u2009976\u00a0\u2013\u00a01025) during his campaigns against the Georgians and his conquest of Bulgaria; Attaleiates is the only source which gives this information. Attaleiates also states that the Botaneiatai family was related to Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas and the Phocas family. This was almost certainly used by Nikephoros to add legitimacy to his later rule, and this is corroborated by Psellos, who calls Nikephoros III \"Phocas\" in his reproduction of Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas' letter to him. Christian Settipani speculates that Nikephoros III's great-grandfather Michael married an unnamed daughter of Nikephoros II. At an unknown date, Nikephoros married a woman named Vevdene, but he later married Maria of Alania, the former wife of Michael VII. He seems to have had at least one child with Vevdene, as Anna Komnene mentions his grandson in the \"Alexiad\". Little else is known of Nikephoros's life before 1053, other than that he served as a commander under Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos during the Pecheneg revolt of 1048\u20131053.\nEarly career.\nNikephoros first attracts the attention of his Byzantine contemporaries and historians for his actions after the Battle of Zygos Pass in 1053. Attaleiates records that Nikephoros was able to wield effective command over his retreating mounted troops, preventing them from being overrun by Pecheneg forces during the Pecheneg revolt. Nikephoros ordered his cavalry to hold a tight formation, limiting the damage the horse-archers of the Pechenegs could inflict and deployed scouts to prevent his troops from being ambushed. During his maneuvering, the Pechenegs attempted to assault his troops and break their formation several times, but each time they were rebuffed. Nikephoros led his troops for eleven days in spite of constant harassment. According to Attaleiates, the Pechenegs attempted to convince the Byzantines to surrender and killed their horses with their bows when this failed. Nikephoros had them continue on foot and refused to flee when offered a horse, proclaiming he would prefer death to the dishonor of cowardice, which reinforced the morale of his troops. After eleven days of constant attacks, they reached the Byzantine city of Adrianople, where the Pechenegs finally gave up their pursuit. For his actions, Emperor Constantine IX awarded Nikephoros the high court rank of \"magistros\". While it is possible that his actions were exaggerated by Attaleiates, it fits comfortably with his reputation as a strong commander.\nNikephoros is next mentioned for his role in the revolt of Isaac I Komnenos against the Byzantine Emperor Michael VI Bringas (r.\u20091056\u00a0\u2013\u00a01057) in 1057. This revolt was a result of Michael's favoritism toward the civil officials of Constantinople, and his scorn toward the military elites. After the \"Dynatoi\" were humiliated by Michael by his refusal to grant them any gifts, Isaac attempted to reconcile with Michael, only to be personally insulted by him, sparking a civil war, which is mentioned by Skylitzes, Psellos, and Attaleiates; Psellos himself led the embassy from Michael to Isaac. Isaac then gathered the support of other military elites before marching for Constantinople. At Constantinople, the Battle of Petroe took place on 20 August 1057, a decisive victory for Isaac, and reportedly one of the bloodiest battles the Byzantines engaged in during a civil war. Isaac's victory placed the military aristocracy firmly back in control and marked the first time a general had held the throne since the death of Emperor Basil II in 1025. Nikephoros led a wing of Isaac's forces during the battle, suggesting he had been a part of Isaac's inner circle; Skylitzes mentions that during this battle Nikephoros fought a duel against one of Michael's mercenaries, Randolf the Frank. In 1059, Isaac placed Nikephoros in command of the Danube frontier, where he remained until 1064. During his time at this command, he saved the life of the future Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes during Isaac's campaign against the Hungarians.\nBy October 1061 at the latest, Nikephoros was serving as \"doux\" of Thessalonica. The evidence for his time in Thessalonica comes from several surviving signed and dated documents from the Iveron Monastery on Mount Athos. The first of these is an \"engraphon\" dated to December 1061. It mentions that Iveron's abbot and two of its monks had delivered an order from Constantine X Doukas (r.\u20091059\u00a0\u2013\u00a01067) to Nikephoros, \"doux\" of Thessalonica, in October (so Nikephoros's tenure must have begun by then). The next two documents are a \"praktikon\" and a \"hypomnema\" both dated to August 1062. The \"praktikon\" still has a seal of Nikephoros's attached to it, and all three documents also have Nikephoros's signature. He misspelled his own name on all three. A fourth Athonite document, dated to February 1063, is signed by a \"doux\" of Thessalonica named Theodoros Dalassenos, so Nikephoros's time as \"doux\" of Thessalonica must have ended by then.\nThe Iveron documents record some of Nikephoros's activity settling complaints in the theme of Thessalonica. The first complaint we know of was a dispute centered on the Byzantine government's confiscation of some of the property and \"Paroikoi\" (serfs) of the Iveron Monastery of Mount Athos, which the monastery viewed as unlawful. Nikephoros sent Michael the \"spatharokandidatos\" to inquire into the case, before ruling that, based upon a chrysobull issued by Basil II which had declared that the monastery's property and \"Paroikoi\" were exempt from taxes, they could not be confiscated by the government. Nikephoros settled another dispute in February 1062, this time between the Monastery of Lavra and Theodoros of Aichmalotou, a local landowner, over monastic property; Nikephoros ruled in favor of the monastery. Nikephoros settled a boundary dispute between the Iveron Monastery and the Bishop of Ezoba, basing his ruling on the knowledge of the local populace. The last Thessalonian dispute we know of that Nikephoros ruled on was between the Iveron Monastery and the \"metochion\" of Melissourgeion; the \"metochion\" appears to have ignored a ruling previously made by Empress Theodora Porphyrogenita, which Nikephoros reasserted.\nIn the fall of 1064, the Oghuz Turks invaded the Byzantine Balkans and defeated both Nikephoros and Basil Apokapes, \"archon\" of Paristrion, in battle, and took them captive, which Attaleiates suggests was greatly humiliating for Nikephoros; however, the two men were able to escape captivity after the Oghuz Turk forces were devastated by both Bulgarian raids and disease. The surviving Oghuz Turks were quickly recruited into the Byzantine army.\nNikephoros may have also served as \"doux\" of Cyprus sometime in the mid-1060s. The only source for this is Bar Hebraeus, who wrote that Nikephoros \"ruled first over the island of Cyprus, and then over Antioch\". Olga Karagiorgou suggests a date of c. 1065-67 for this stage in Nikephoros's career.\nLater military career.\nNikephoros was reassigned as \"doux\" of Antioch in c.1065 by Constantine X due to the mismanagement of the province by its previous \"doux\", Nikephoritzes, who would later serve as \"logothetes\" under Michael VII. Although his troops were inexperienced and under-equipped, Nikephoros was able to repel numerous raids against Antioch from the Emirate of Aleppo, largely due to his own military prowess, his well-trained retinue, and his use of local levies. Nikephoros was relieved of his command in c. 1067, likely due to the political efforts of the civil officials, who wished to eliminate the military aristocracy, of which Nikephoros was a member. The political machinations of the civil officials, and their willingness to undermine the military elites, had built up under previous emperors such as Romanos III (r.\u20091028\u00a0\u2013\u00a01034) and Michael VI; during this period the civil officials had become increasingly powerful, until Isaac I's reforms definitively curbed their power. Constantine X had become emperor when Isaac abdicated in 1059 and was considerably weaker than Isaac had been, allowing the civil officials to manipulate him, thereby preventing him from gaining the level of control that Isaac had. This was largely accomplished by undermining the military aristocracy, even while the Turks had begun to invade Byzantine Armenia.\nUpon the death of Constantine X in 1067, his wife, Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa, considered taking Nikephoros as husband and emperor, but instead chose Romanos IV Diogenes (r.\u20091068\u00a0\u2013\u00a01071). The need for an emperor was made pressing by the constant raids of the Turks into the Byzantine territories of Antioch, Cilicia, and Armenia; Eudokia, Patriarch John VIII of Constantinople, and the Byzantine Senate agreed that their top priority was the defense of the empire and that they needed an emperor to lead troops to repel the Turks. Nikephoros was the favorite candidate of the senate, but was in the field leading troops in Antioch, and was still married to Vevdene. Romanos was already in Constantinople and had no wife, making him a much more suitable candidate; Matthew of Edessa also suggests that Eudokia already desired Romanos over Nikephoros. Upon taking power, Romanos exiled Nikephoros to his holdings in the Anatolic Theme and excluded him from the Manzikert campaign due to questionable loyalty, likely because he had been Eudokia's other candidate for the throne, and thus posed a threat to Romanos's rule. After Romanos was captured by the Seljuks at the disastrous Battle of Manzikert, Nikephoros did not involve himself in the coup d'\u00e9tat of Michael VII against the still-captive Romanos, and would not again lead troops until the uprising of the mercenary leader Roussel de Bailleul.\nEmperor Michael VII (r.\u20091071\u00a0\u2013\u00a01078) brought Nikephoros, who was now in his early seventies, out of retirement and declared him \"kouropalates\" and governor of the Anatolic Theme. The title of \"kouropalates\" was reserved for esteemed members of the imperial court who were not related to the ruling dynasty, and officially designated him as a high-ranking general; the title of \"kouropalates\" was below the rank of \"nobilissimus\" and two ranks below the title of \"Caesar\". None of the sources specifically mention why Nikephoros was recalled to lead forces, but it is likely due to a few reasons: Nikephoros was a renowned commander who had served under the Doukas emperors, he did not have any loyalty to Romanos IV, and the main theater of war was in the eastern portion of the Byzantine Empire, the terrain of which Nikephoros knew well; he likely gained the military governorship of the Anatolic Theme because it was his homeland. Michael VII then sent Nikephoros and the Caesar John Doukas to defeat the rebellion of Roussel de Bailleul. Nikephoros warned John not to cross the Zompos Bridge and engage the forces of Roussel, but John disregarded him and led his troops to defeat at the Battle of the Zompos Bridge in 1074. Nikephoros, who commanded the rearguard, held his troops back from fighting in the battle; modern historians have debated exactly why he chose to withhold his troops, and whether they could have turned the tide of the battle. After the defeat of the forces under John, Nikephoros gathered the survivors and led them with his troops back to his estates in the Anatolic Theme.\nRevolt.\nNikephoros, seeing how dire the situation of the Byzantine Empire was, sent a letter to Emperor Michael in 1077 pleading with him to address the rapidly worsening situation in Byzantine Anatolia. Michael was insulted by the directness of one of his subordinates, and turned against Nikephoros, forcing him to rebel against Michael to protect himself from imprisonment. Nikephoros declared himself emperor shortly after, on 2 July/October 1077, mobilizing an army of native troops and Turkish mercenaries. Michael sent Nikephoros a letter in which he reminded Nikephoros that he owed much to the emperor who had brought him out of exile. A month later, in November 1077, the general Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder raised his own revolt against Michael. The military acumen and family renown of Nikephoros (III) helped him to solidify his support base, and the tyranny of Michael ensured that even some of the elites of Constantinople sided with Nikephoros\u2014something Attaleiates notes as being very rare, since generally people defect from the usurper's side to the emperor's side. The defection of some of the capital elites was even more astonishing because the march from the Anatolic Theme to Constantinople was not safe due to Turkish raids, which had reached deep into Anatolia by 1078, meaning that Nikephoros's rebellion might be destroyed before it even reached Constantinople. On 7 January 1078, the Byzantine Senate proclaimed Nikephoros III as emperor, although he was still far from the city. Michael's wife, Maria of Alania, seeing that Michael would soon be overthrown, defected to the side of Nikephoros. Michael VII abdicated after a popular uprising and was forced to become a monk on 31 March. Three days later, on 3 April, Nikephoros entered Constantinople and seized the throne. Upon taking power, Nikephoros married Maria of Alania, exiled Michael to a monastery, a common Byzantine practice for removing threats to the throne since the 7th century, and castrated Michael's sons. The castration of the sons was viewed poorly by the Byzantine nobility, possibly due to the brutality of the act, although Michael the Syrian does not provide an in-depth explanation of exactly why the Byzantine elite opposed it.\nReign.\nDuring the reign of Nikephoros, he had to contend with four revolts and plots before the revolt of Alexios I Komnenos which ultimately ended his reign. The first revolt was that of Nikephoros Bryennios, who had contended for the throne of Michael VII at the same time as Nikephoros III; Nikephoros, now too old to command armies, sent Alexios Komnenos to defeat him. Once Bryennios was defeated, Nikephoros III had him blinded, but granted him and his partisans amnesty. The second revolt came from a supporter of Bryennios, Nikephoros Basilakes the \"protoproedros\", rebelled in Dyrrhachium (modern-day Durr\u00ebs) in 1078, but he was quickly defeated by Alexios, and similarly blinded. In 1079 the Varangian Guard attempted to murder Nikephoros during an evening inspection, but they were unsuccessful as Nikephoros was able to command his retinue and defend himself until his imperial guards could arrive to defeat the Varangians. Nikephoros had the ringleaders of the plot sent to remote forts and granted amnesty to the rest. Around this time, Michael of Nicomedia, the \"hypertimos\" (head of the imperial administration), who may be the same person as Michael Psellos, died in Nicomedia; it is not known if his death was related to the assassination plot of the Varangians.\nAround the same time, Constantine Doukas plotted against Nikephoros, despite the emperor's favor towards him. Meanwhile, Nikephoros was planning to deal with Byzantine Anatolia, now practically overrun by the Seljuk Turks. Nikephoros hired mercenaries to strengthen his forces, as he viewed his native forces as being too little in number; however, the mercenaries were rowdy and disloyal. At one point Nikephoros had to personally address the mercenaries to attempt to make them cooperate. Constantine Doukas's rebellion put an end to Nikephoros's eastern campaign, but Nikephoros was popular enough that none outside of the immediate army under Constantine joined him, allowing Nikephoros to quickly assemble an army of levies and his imperial guard to challenge Constantine. Nikephoros quickly sent emissaries to Constantine to inquire why he had rebelled and was able to persuade the soldiers under Constantine to surrender their general through an offer of amnesty; after Constantine was handed over to Nikephoros by his own troops, he was sent into exile at a monastery.\nIn 1078 the Paulician sect attempted to use the chaos of the rebellions of Bryennios and Basilakes and their growing popularity in the Balkans to rise up against Nikephoros; Leca the Paulician agitated against Nikephoros and attempted to convince the Pechenegs, with whom Basilakes had earlier attempted to ally, to invade Byzantine land. At the same time, Dobromir the Paulician stirred up a revolt in Mesembria, in co-operation with Leca, and began to pillage the surrounding areas. Leca and Dobromir soon abandoned their rebellion after they were informed that Nikephoros was quickly assembling an army to defeat them. Knowing their few loyalists would not be able to confront the Byzantine army, they begged Nikephoros for forgiveness, fearing that they would share the same punishment as Bryennios and Basilakes; Nikephoros showed mercy and granted them amnesty, along with both gifts and titles.\nNikephoros had originally considered Constantine Doukas as a candidate for his heir, as he had no children of his own, but he abandoned this after Constantine revolted against him. He then set his sights upon a distant relative, Nikephoros Synadenos, of whom almost nothing is known other than that he later married a niece of Alexios.\nNorman Duke Robert Guiscard of Apulia prepared to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081 under the pretext of defending the succession of Constantine Doukas, who had been engaged to Robert's daughter Helena; at the same time, the Seljuks captured the town of Cyzicus. Alexios was entrusted with a substantial army to defeat the Norman threat but conspired with his relative John Doukas to instead take the throne for himself. Alexios raised a rebellion against Nikephoros and was able to quickly surround Constantinople and put it to siege due to the lack of a defensive army. Nikeophoros was unable to secure the support of either the Seljuk Turks or Nikephoros Melissenos, his traditional rivals, and thus was forced to prepare to abdicate. Nikephoros decided that his only choice was to abdicate in favor of Melissenos, who was nearby in Damalis in Anatolia, and sent messengers to him across the Bosphorus; however, these messengers were intercepted by George Palaiologos, a general of Alexios, who persuaded them to support Alexios. Alexios and his forces broke through the walls of Constantinople on 1 April 1081 and sacked the city; Patriarch Cosmas convinced Nikephoros to abdicate to Alexios rather than prolong the civil war. Nikephoros then fled to the Hagia Sophia and sought sanctuary inside of it. Michael, the future \"logothete\" of Alexios, then escorted Nikephoros to the Monastery of Peribleptus, where he abdicated and became a monk. He died later that year. Daniel Maynard comments that both Anthony Kaldellis and Jo\u00e3o Vicente de Medeiros Publio Dias tend to characterize Nikephoros' reign as part of the Doukas dynasty, with Kaldellis stating that \"Botaniates' reign was basically an extension of the Ducas dynasty\", and de Medeiros Publio Dias stating that \"His government is normally only seen as a prelude to the important, but at the same time controversial rule of Alexios I Komnenos\".\nReforms and domestic policy.\nNikephoros performed many acts to secure the support of the Byzantine populace, as he lacked the legitimacy of imperial succession as a usurper. He spent large amounts of money on donatives for his army and supporters, which severely sapped the imperial treasury, and distributed many titles to them; he also donated generously to charities. He returned the gold and silver ornaments that Michael VII had confiscated from the churches to fund his civil war against him. Whether or not these acts managed to gain the support of the people cannot be ascertained, as Nikephoros's reign was filled with revolts and political uncertainty; however, it can be assumed that he was determined to prevent the betrayal which many previous emperors had suffered, and as such freely handed out gifts and titles. Many of the reforms which Nikephoros enacted were more likely intended to solidify his tenuous hold on the throne, rather than for the security of the empire.\nNikephoros issued a chrysobull that forgave all debt which was in arrears in order to gain support and to attempt to remedy the debt crisis which had occurred under the Doukas dynasty; he also forbade creditors from demanding debt repayment before the terms of the contract stated, likely to improve the financial stability of the empire by preventing sudden impoverishment, and forbade creditors from seizing the property of their debtors in payment of debt after their debts were canceled. Attaleiates says that these laws \"put an end to the fear of debt\", which he said had been a source of much suffering for the Byzantine citizens under the Doukas dynasty.\nNikephoros may have revoked the edicts of Michael VII to secure more legitimacy and to reward the citizens of Constantinople who had supported him; one such measure involved the restoration of rights to owners of small jetties around Constantinople, allowing them to again use these ports, called \"skalai\". Attaleiates states that Nikephoros \"diligently attended the festivals of the capital and frequently bestowed gifts to his subjects\", suggesting that Nikephoros did not hesitate to embrace the trappings of an emperor to ensure that he was viewed as the legitimate emperor rather than a mere usurper. Nikephoros worked to not only gain the favor of the masses, but also the previous dynasty, which Romanos IV had failed to do, leading to his downfall. He brought Eudokia Makrembolitissa out of her monastic exile and allowed her to live among her family, and attempted to make Constantine Doukas his heir, likely in an attempt to appease the civil officials who he had just deposed. Additionally, succession was a strong concern, as Nikephoros was a widower, old, and childless in 1078. His marriage to Maria, the wife of Michael VII, and attempt to take Constantine as his heir, show Nikephoros's determination to both secure his succession and restore stability to the empire.\nAttaleiates praised Nikephoros for his reforms to the legal code and his diligence in the performance of his imperial duties. Nikephoros presided over court cases and in his free time read books to improve his ability to judge cases. Nikephoros settled several pressing legal issues in 1079, first enacting a law regarding spousal insanity, the second increasing the time between sentencing and execution to thirty days to allow new evidence to be presented or the judge to review whether the crime merited capital punishment. Nikephoros also issued a law that extended the same legal rights and protections enjoyed by private servants to imperial servants. While the reforms of Nikephoros are quite minor, they provide insight into Nikephoros's desire to relieve some of the issues plaguing the Byzantine Empire and correct the rampant corruption of the Byzantine courts; that his reforms were quite minor is unsurprising in light of the fact that Nikephoros was nearly eighty and had to suppress several revolts and defend against the Turks in Anatolia.\nDiplomacy.\nThe situation of Byzantine Anatolia worsened after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, as the Seljuk Turks began to take the Byzantine lands for themselves, rather than simply raid them. Theodore Gabras and Philaretos Brachamios, the governors of Trebizond and Antioch, respectively, had become separated from the rest of the Byzantine Empire as the Turks invaded other regions of Anatolia which were almost undefended, and thus became \"de facto\" independent of the Byzantine Empire. Nikephoros negotiated with Philaretos for the submission of his fief in 1078 and granted him the title of \"doux\", leaving him the legitimate ruler of the newly returned Byzantine province. This reincorporation benefited the Byzantine Empire as Philaretos had been attacking some nearby Byzantine towns in order to incorporate them into his domain, dividing the Byzantines' focus upon the Seljuk Turks in the area. This successful negotiation may also have reflected the prestige of the Botaneiates family, as Michael Doukas had failed to negotiate a similar agreement with Philaretos because of Philaretos's dislike of the corrupt Nikephoritzes the Logothete. While a diplomatic victory, it did not effectively change the situation of either party, as Philaretos remained effectively independent, and Nikephoros had little to gain from reasserting control over the land. The only real success to come from it is that he may have gained legitimacy due to achieving something which his predecessor was never able to; that Attaleiates deigns to mention it as one of Nikephoros's successes lends credence to it largely benefiting only Nikephoros's legitimacy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Demographic features of the population of Bulgaria include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and others.\nIn 2023, Bulgaria had a Human Development Index of 0.845, which corresponds to \"very high human development\", ranking 55th in the world together with neighbouring Romania, was designated as a \"High-income economy\" by the World Bank, with a GNI per capita of $15,320, as of 2024, and was awarded the 38th position in \"Newsweek\"'s rankings of the world's best countries to live in, measuring health, education, political environment and economic dynamism in 2010.\nDemographic history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVarious estimates have put Bulgaria's medieval population at 1.1 million in 700 AD and 2.6 million in 1365. At the 2011 census, the population inhabiting Bulgaria was 7,364,570 in total, but the 2021 Census calculated that the population had declined to 6.5 million. The peak was in 1989, the year when the borders opened after a half of a century of communist regime, when the population numbered 9,009,018.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNote: Crude migration change (per 1000) is an extrapolation \nVital statistics.\nVital Statistics 1875 to 1899.\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World in Data and Gapminder Foundation.\nVital statistics 1900 to present.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nBirth rates and fertility.\nHistorical birth and fertility rates.\nThe first reliable data about fertility and natural increase rates in the Bulgarian lands date back to the mid-1800s.\nAccording to Turkish statistician Kemal Karpat, Non-Muslims, Bulgarians included, in the Ottoman Empire received a remarkable boost in fertility in the early 1830s. Their average growth rate climbed up to 2% per year, compared to zero among Muslims, who suffered from demographic stagnation.\nThe same trend continued well after Bulgaria's Liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878. Until the early 1890s, Muslim birth rates in Bulgaria hesitated in the low 20s, dwarfed by rates of + 40\u2030 among Orthodox Christians, while natural increase rates hovered around zero. The ongoing Muslim demographic crisis and the heavy migration to Turkey were the two primary reasons for the rapid decrease in Bulgaria's Muslim and Turkish population between 1880 and 1910, from 28.7% in 1880 to 13.8% in 1910 for Muslims and from 26.2% to 10.7% for Turks.\nMuslim birth and natural increase rates started climbing slowly from the late 1890s but only surpassed Orthodox ones in 1924. Nevertheless, it was not the Eastern Orthodox but rather Bulgaria's Roman Catholics that had the highest birth rate during the period, though usually offset by very high mortality rates.\nAverage Number of Births &amp; Deaths, Average Birth Rate, Death Rate and Rate of Natural Increase in the Principality of Bulgaria by Period and Confession\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, ethnic Bulgarians completed stage 2 of their demographic transition, and crude birth rate among them fell to a mere 23.3\u2030 by 1946, or twice as low as the birth rate of Bulgaria's two largest minorities, Turks (40.9\u2030) and Roma (47.2\u2030). At the same time, due to higher mortality, the rate of natural increase among Bulgarian Turks was almost identical to that among ethnic Bulgarians (12.1\u2030 vs. 11.1\u2030), while the rate among the Romani was twice as high (23.1\u2030).\nPresent-day.\nA total of 64,984 live births were recorded in Bulgaria in 2016, giving the country a crude birth rate of 9.1\u2030.\nBulgaria has a low total fertility rate of 1.58 children per woman (according to the 2021 Census). This is up significantly from the late 1990s, but still below replacement and not enough to prevent further population decline, especially with emigration. Provinces with large Roma populations (for example Sliven, Montana and Yambol) tend to have higher fertility rates (and higher death rates) compared to other areas, whereas Turkish fertility is similar to the Bulgarian majority. The average number of (live births) children in 2021 was 1.47 for all women (aged 12 or more), ranging from 0.04 children for women between the ages of 12-19 to 1.92 children per women between the ages of 70-79. The distribution by ethnicity shows that only among women who identify themselves as belonging to the Roma ethnic group, the average number of children is sufficient for simple reproduction - 2.25 children, mainly because of the significantly younger age structure and low educational level of this group, followed by the Turkish ethnic group with 1.79 children and 1.41 children for women who self-identified as belonging to the Bulgarian ethnic. The distribution of the average number of live births by religion changes from 1.83 children for Muslim women and 1.82 children for Protestant women, followed by 'other Christian' (1.63), Eastern Orthodox (1.43), Catholic (1.36), Jewish (1.27) and Armenian Apostolic (1.26). Women without religion had an average number of 1.40 children.\nRegional differences.\nAs of 2022, the municipality of Tvarditsa has the highest crude birth rate in the country, at 18.4\u2030, followed by the municipalities of Yablanitsa (17.9\u2030) and Nikolaevo Municipality (17.2\u2030). All these municipalities have relatively large Romani populations.\nOn the other hand, the municipalities of Georgi Damyanovo, Banite and Nevestino have incredibly low birth rates. These municipalities are almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians.\nTeenage pregnancy.\nBulgaria has one of the highest share of teenage pregnancy in Europe. Nevertheless, this number declined rapidly between 1995 and 2010, until it stabilized at around 10%.\nThe ten municipalities with the largest absolute number of teenage mothers for 2022 are: Sliven (371), Sofia (345), Plovdiv (196), Pazardzhik (130), Yambol (123), Nova Zagora (121), Burgas (108), Pleven (110), Tvarditsa (98), Stara Zagora, Varna (83) and Haskovo (81).\nTotal population: 74.83 years\nMale: 71.37 years\nFemale: 78.39 years (2016-2018 est.)\nLife expectancy at birth.\nAverage life expectancy at age 0 of the total population.\nKardzhali Province and Sofia City have the highest life expectancy with 76.6 years for both sexes. The lowest life expectancy is recorded in the Northwestern provinces like Montana (72.7 years), Vratsa (72.8 years) and Vidin (72.9 years).\nTotal: 4.5 deaths/1,000 live births (2024)\nMale: 5.1 deaths/1,000 live births (2024)\nFemale: 3.8 deaths/1,000 live births (2024)\nProjections.\nThe following forecast for the future population is an official estimate of the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria.\nDemographic statistics.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n6,519,789 (Sept 2021 cens)\n6,919,180 (July 2021 est.)\n7,057,504 (July 2018 est.)\nBulgarian 76.9%, Turkish/Balkan Gagauz 8%, Romani 4.4%, other 0.7% (including Russian, Armenian, and Vlach), other (unknown) 10% (2011 est.)\nnote: Romani populations are usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 9\u201311% of Bulgaria's population\nBulgarian (official) 76.8%, Balkan Gagauz 8.2%, Romani 3.8%, other 0.7%, unspecified 10.5% (2011 est.)\nEastern Orthodox 59.4%, Muslim 7.8%, other (including Catholic, Protestant, Armenian Apostolic Orthodox, and Jewish) 1.7%, none 3.7%, unspecified 27.4% (2011 est.)\n\"0-14 years:\" 14.52% (male 520,190 /female 491,506)\n\"15-24 years:\" 9,4% (male 340,306 /female 312,241)\n\"25-54 years:\"42.87% (male 1,538,593 /female 1,448,080)\n\"55-64:\" 13.15% (male 433,943 /female 482,784)\n\"65 years and over:\" 20.06% (male 562,513 /female 835,065) (2020 est.)\n\"0-14 years:\" 14.6% (male 530,219 /female 500,398)\n\"15-24 years:\" 9.43% (male 346,588 /female 318,645)\n\"25-54 years:\" 43.12% (male 1,565,770 /female 1,477,719)\n\"55-64 years:\" 13.3% (male 442,083 /female 496,888)\n\"65 years and over:\" 19.54% (male 557,237 /female 821,957) (2018 est.)\ntotal: 43.7 years.

The Government implemented a program for the period 2017 - 2021, the first one aimed at reversing this trend. The program identifies the priority means for achieving this goal: measures to increase the birth rate, reduce youth emigration, and build up regulatory and institutional capacity to implement a modern immigration policy tailored to the needs of Bulgarian business.\nEthnic groups.\nThe following table shows the ethnic composition of all Provinces of Bulgaria according to the 2021 census:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nLanguages.\nThe 2001 census defines an ethnic group as a \"community of people, related to each other by origin and language, and close to each other by mode of life and culture\"; and one's mother tongue as \"the language a person speaks best and usually uses for communication in the family (household)\".\nAccording to the 2011 census, among the Bulgarians 99.4% indicate Bulgarian as a mother tongue, 0.3% - Turkish/Balkan gagauz, 0.1% - Roma and 0.1% others; among Turks 96.6% have pointed the Turkish/Balkan Gagauz as a mother tongue and 3.2% - Bulgarian; among the Roma 85% indicate Roma language as a mother tongue, 7.5% - Bulgarian, 6.7% - Turkish/Balkan gagauz and 0.6% - Romanian.\nReligion.\nBulgaria's traditional religion according to the constitution is the Orthodox Christianity, while Bulgaria is a secular state too. Since the last two censuses (2001 and 2011) provide widely divergent results, they are both shown in the table below. It is noteworthy that over a fifth of the population chose not to respond to this question in the 2011 census.\nThe results of the Bulgarian 2011 Census, in which the indication of answer regarding the question for confession was optional, are as follows:\nThe results of the Bulgarian 2001 Census by ethnic groups, the latest census in which the indication of identification (whether by confession or as irreligious) in the question for confession was obligatory, are as follows:\nMigration.\nHistorical migration.\nThe first censuses of the Principality of Bulgaria and the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia in 1880 recorded 31,786 and 17,970 Bulgarian refugees from Macedonia and Ottoman Thrace, respectively, who accounted for 1.38% of the population of the Principality an 2.20% of the population of the autonomous province, respectively. The census of the Principality also counted a total of 37,635 people, or 1.88% of the population, born in a country other than the Ottoman Empire, mostly Bulgarians from Romania, Northern Dobruja and Bessarabia. By 1887, when the first joint census of the Principality and the autonomous province was conducted following their peaceful unification in 1885, the number of the refugees from the Ottoman Empire had grown to 54,462 people, or 1.73% of the population, while the rest of the foreign-born population had fallen to 31,637 people, 9,831 of whom born in the Russian Empire, 11,843 in Romania, 2,690 in Serbia and 7,273 elsewhere.\nAccording to the 1910 census, 300,000 or almost 10% of the ethnic Bulgarians were born in another Bulgarian municipality than the one they were enumerated in. The same data shows that the foreign-born ethnic Bulgarians numbered 78,000, or 2% of them, most numerous of whom were the 61,000 Ottoman-born, 9,000 Romanian-born and by less than 2,000 Austro-Hungarian, Serbian and Russian-born. By the 1926 census, there had been 253,000 refugees with granted households and land or citizenship but with many more in towns of uncertain number. 35% came from Eastern Thrace, 30% came from Greek Macedonia, another 18% from Western Thrace, 8% from Dobruja, 4% from the Western Outlands, 3% from Asia Minor, and 2% from North Macedonia. They constituted 6% of the country's population. In 1940, 70,000 Bulgarians were exchanged from Northern Dobruja. The total number of refugees in 1878-1940 is estimated at between 700,000 and 1,200,000. In 1950-1951, around 150,000 Turks left Bulgaria for Turkey, and again in 1989.\nCurrent migration.\nAccording to the 2011 census Russian citizens are the most numerous foreigners - 11 991, followed by 8 444 EU citizens (UK- 2 605, Greece - 1 253, Germany- 848, Poland - 819 and Italy - 456), citizens of Ukraine - 3 064, North Macedonia - 1 091, Moldova - 893 and Serbia - 569. 22.8% of them are from Asia, mostly from Turkey. Those with dual Bulgarian and other citizenship were 22 152, or 0.3% of the population. Of them persons with Bulgarian and Russian citizenship were 5 257 (23.7%), followed by persons with Bulgarian and Turkish citizenship - 4 282 (19.3%), Bulgarian and citizenship of the USA- 1 725 (7.8%). There are at least 17,527 Refugees of the Syrian Civil War with applications in Bulgaria. In 2001-2015 185,447 people applied for Bulgarian citizenship and 116,222 were provided with. 113,647 were granted on grounds of proven Bulgarian ancestry, including 59,968 North Macedonia citizens. 29,218 were Moldovan citizens, 5930 Ukrainians, 5374 Serbians, 5194 Russians, 3840 Israeli, 2192 Albanians, 692 Turks and others. In 2016, 12,880 foreigners were naturalized, including 6196 Macedonians.\nPopulation by country of birth:\nForeigners by nationality:\n0\u201314 years: 13.2%\n15\u201365 years: 68.3%\n65 years and over: 18.5% (Census 2011)\nAge structure.\nAt the 2011 census, the largest cohort of those self-identified as Romani was the 0\u20139 years cohort, which accounted for 20.8% of all Romani. The same age cohort accounted for 10.2% of the Turks and 7.2% of the Bulgarians. At the 2021 census, the 0\u20139 years cohort amongst the Romani was second largest after the 10\u201319 years one and represented 17.0% of all Romani. The corresponding percentages for ethnic Bulgarians and ethnic Turks stood at 7.7% and 8.8%, respectively.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBulgarian children constitute the majority of all children in 23 out of 28 provinces. They constitute more than ninety percent of all children in two provinces: Sofia (city) (92%) and Pernik Province (90%).\nTurkish children constitute the majority in Kardzhali Province (68% of self-declared) and Razgrad Province (50% of self-declared); they also constitute the largest group of all children in Silistra Province (43%).\nRoma children constitute 12% of all children in Bulgaria and more than a quarter in three provinces: Montana (29%), Sliven (28%) and Yambol (27%).\nBulgaria is ageing rapidly, especially in some remote rural areas.\nThe ageing of the population leads to an increase of the median age. The median age is 43.6 as of 2017, up from 40.4 years in 2001.\nEducation.\nOver 98% of the population is literate, the males being more literate than the females.\nAccording to the 2011 census, about 112,778 people aged nine or more are illiterate. There are considerable differences in the share of illiterate persons amongst the three main ethnic groups. Amongst the Bulgarian ethnic group the share of illiterate is 0.5%, amongst the Turkish - 4.7% and amongst the Roma ethnic group - 11.8%. About 81 thousand people aged seven or more never visited school.\nUnemployment.\nThe number of unemployed people declined from 207,000 people (or around 6.2% of the population) in 2017 to 156,657 in November 2023. The unemployment rate stood at 4.3 per cent in November 2023 according to Eurostat.\nMost unemployed people are aged 15 to 24 years old.\nThe unemployment rate in rural areas (around 10.0%) is nearly two times higher than the unemployment rate in urban areas (approximately 5.1%).\nVidin Province has the highest unemployment rate with almost one fifth of its labour force being unemployed. The provinces of Shumen (15.9%), Silistra (12.5%) and Targovishte (12.4%) also have very high unemployment rates.\nOther statistics.\nHome ownership.\nAccording to Eurostat, 82.3% per cent of the population live in privately owned and owner-occupied homes, ranking it as 12th highest in ownership globally. It is down from a recent peak of 87.6% in 2008, and has been steadily falling since.\nInternet penetration.\nThe number of Internet users has increased rapidly since 2000\u2014from 430,000 their number grew to 1.55\u00a0million in 2004, and 3.4\u00a0million (48 per cent penetration rate) in 2010.

The plot, which occurs in real time, centers on a town marshal whose sense of duty is tested when he must decide to either face a gang of killers alone, or leave town with his new wife.\nThough mired in controversy at the time of its release due to its political themes, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four (Actor, Editing, Score and Song) as well as four Golden Globe Awards (Actor, Supporting Actress, Score, and Black and White Cinematography). The award-winning score was written by Ukrainian/Russian-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin.\n\"High Noon\" was selected in 1989 by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". An iconic film whose story has been partly or completely repeated in later film productions, its ending in particular has inspired numerous later films, including but not just limited to westerns.\nPlot.\nIn Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane, newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire. The happy couple will soon depart to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive by the noon train, one day ahead of the new marshal. Miller's gang\u2014his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce\u2014wait at the station.\nFor Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simple\u2014leave town before Miller arrives\u2014but Kane's sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.\nKane visits old friends and allies, but none can or will help. Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane's young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane \"puts the word in\" for him with the city fathers. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at Ram\u00edrez's Saloon and the church are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation. Some are Miller's friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others believe that Kane's fight is not the town's responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, forcing his wife Mildred to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. The pastor of the local church, his service interrupted by Kane seeking help from the parishioners, is of no aid. Neither are some apparently willing volunteers, after the mayor encourages Kane to leave town. Martin Howe, Kane's predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. One last offer of help comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires his courage, but refuses his aid.\nWhile waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy confronts Helen Ram\u00edrez, who was once Miller's lover, then Kane's, then Pell's. Amy believes the reason Kane refuses to leave town is because he wants to protect Helen, but Helen reveals there is no lingering attachment on Kane's part and she, too, is leaving. When Helen questions why Amy will not stay with Kane, Amy explains that both her brother and father were gunned down by criminals, a tragedy that converted her to Quakerism. Helen nonetheless chides Amy for not standing by her husband in his hour of need, saying that if she were in Amy's place, she would take up a gun and fight alongside Kane.\nPell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking Pell senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. As the clock ticks toward noon, Kane goes into the street to face Miller and his gang. Amy and Helen ride by on a wagon, bound for the train. The train arrives, and Miller steps off as the two ladies board.\nKane walks down the deserted main street alone. He manages to kill Frank Miller's brother, Ben, in the opening salvo. Just before the train departs, Amy hears the gunfire and runs back to town. Kane takes refuge in a stable, and Colby is killed when he comes in after him. Miller sets fire to the stable to flush him out. Kane frees the horses and tries to escape on one, only to be shot off and cornered. Despite her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell's pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller's face, he pushes her to the ground and Kane shoots him dead.\nThe couple embrace. As the townspeople emerge, Kane smiles at Johnny, but looks angrily at the rest of the crowd. He drops his marshal's star to the street and departs with Amy.\nCast.\nMain cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane\nUncredited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* James Millican as Herb Baker\nProduction.\nAccording to \"Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents\"\u2014 a 2002 documentary based in part on a lengthy 1952 letter from screenwriter Carl Foreman to film critic Bosley Crowther\u2014 Foreman's role in the creation and production of \"High Noon\" has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of producer Stanley Kramer's. Foreman told Crowther that the film originated from a four-page plot outline he wrote that turned out to be very similar to \"The Tin Star\", a 1947 short story by John W. Cunningham about an aging sheriff taking on a dangerous murderer.\nForeman purchased the film rights to Cunningham's story and wrote the screenplay. By the time the documentary aired, most of the principals were dead, including Kramer, Foreman, Zinnemann, and Cooper. Victor Navasky, author of \"Naming Names\", an authoritative account of the Hollywood blacklist, told a reporter that, based on his interviews with Kramer's widow and others, the documentary seemed \"one-sided, and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer, when it was more complicated than that\".\nYears later, director Richard Fleischer claimed that he helped Foreman develop the story of \"High Noon\" over the course of eight weeks while driving to and from the set of the 1949 film \"The Clay Pigeon\", which they were making together. Fleischer said that his RKO contract prevented him from directing \"High Noon\".\nThere is a description of an incident very similar to the central plotline of \"High Noon\" in Chapter XXXV of \"The Virginian\", by Owen Wister, in which Trampas (a villain) calls out The Virginian, who has a new bride waiting whom he might lose if he engages in a gunfight. \"High Noon\" has even been described as a \"straight remake\" of the 1929 film version of \"The Virginian\", which also featured Gary Cooper in a starring role.\nHouse Un-American Activities Committee controversy.\nThe production and release of \"High Noon\" intersected with the Second Red Scare in the United States and the Korean War. In 1951, during production of the film, screenwriter Carl Foreman was summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during its investigation of \"Communist propaganda and influence\" in the motion picture industry. Foreman had once been a member of the Communist Party, but he declined to identify fellow members or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an \"uncooperative witness\" by the committee, making him vulnerable to blacklisting by the movie industry.\nAfter his refusal to name names was made public, Foreman's production partner Stanley Kramer demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the \"High Noon\" project, but before the film's release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to Britain, knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.\nKramer later asserted that he had ended their partnership because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman said that Kramer feared damage to his own career due to \"guilt by association\". Foreman was indeed blacklisted by the Hollywood studios due to the \"uncooperative witness\" label along with pressure from Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn, MPA president John Wayne, and \"Los Angeles Times\" gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.\nCasting.\nJohn Wayne was originally offered the lead role in the film, but refused it because he believed that Foreman's story was an obvious allegory against blacklisting, which he actively supported. Later, he told an interviewer that he would \"never regret having helped run Foreman out of the country\". Gary Cooper was Wayne's longtime friend and shared his conservative political views; Cooper had been a \"friendly witness\" before HUAC but did not implicate anyone as a suspected Communist, and he later became a vigorous opponent of blacklisting. Cooper won an Academy Award for his performance, and since he was working in Europe at the time, he asked Wayne to accept the Oscar on his behalf. Although Wayne's contempt for the film and refusal of its lead role were well known, he said, \"I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of ... Now that I'm through being such a good sport ... I'm going back to find my business manager and agent ... and find out why I didn't get \"High Noon\" instead of Cooper ...\"\nAfter Wayne refused the Will Kane role, Kramer offered it to Gregory Peck, who declined because he felt it was too similar to his role in \"The Gunfighter\", the year before. Peck later said he considered it the biggest mistake of his career. Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and Charlton Heston also declined the role.\nKramer saw Grace Kelly in an off-Broadway play and cast her as Kane's bride, despite Cooper and Kelly's substantial age disparity (50 and 21, respectively). Rumors of an affair between Cooper and Kelly during filming remain unsubstantiated. Kelly biographer Donald Spoto wrote that there was no evidence of a romance, aside from tabloid gossip. Biographer Gina McKinnon speculated that \"there might well have been a roll or two in the hay bales\", but cited no evidence, other than a remark by Kelly's sister Lizanne that Kelly was \"infatuated\" with Cooper.\nLee Van Cleef made his film debut in \"High Noon\". Kramer first offered Van Cleef the Harvey Pell role, after seeing him in a touring production of \"Mister Roberts\", on the condition that Van Cleef have his nose surgically altered to appear less menacing. Van Cleef refused and was cast instead as Colby, the only role of his career without a single line of dialogue.\nFilming.\n\"High Noon\" was filmed in the late summer/early fall of 1951 in several locations in California. The opening scenes, under the credits, were shot at Iverson Movie Ranch near Los Angeles. A few town scenes were shot in Columbia State Historic Park, a preserved Gold Rush mining town near Sonora, but most of the street scenes were filmed on the Columbia Movie Ranch in Burbank. St. Joseph's Church in Tuolumne City was used for exterior shots of the Hadleyville church. The railroad was the old Sierra Railroad in Jamestown, a few miles south of Columbia, now known as Railtown 1897 State Historic Park, and often nicknamed \"the movie railroad\" due to its frequent use in films and television shows. The railroad station was built for the film alongside a water tower at Warnerville, about 15 miles to the southwest.\nCooper was reluctant to film the fight scene with Bridges due to ongoing problems with his back, but eventually did so without the use of a stunt double. He wore no makeup to emphasize his character's anguish and fear, which was probably intensified by pain from recent surgery to remove a bleeding ulcer.\nThe running time of the story almost precisely parallels the running time of the film\u2014an effect heightened by frequent shots of clocks to remind the characters (and the audience) that the villain will be arriving on the noon train.\nMusic.\nThe movie's theme song, \"High Noon\" (as it is credited in the film), also known by its opening lyric, \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling\", became a major hit on the country-and-western charts for Tex Ritter, and later, a pop hit for Frankie Laine as well. Its popularity set a precedent for theme songs that were featured in many subsequent Western films. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's score and song, with lyrics by Ned Washington, became popular for years afterwards and Tiomkin became in demand for future westerns in the 1950s like \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" and \"Last Train from Gun Hill.\" The song, along with its various instrumental arrangements, is heard 36 times throughout the film, functioning as a recurring musical motif.\nReception.\nThe film earned $3.75 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office in 1952.\nUpon its release, critics and audiences expecting chases, fights, spectacular scenery, and other common Western film elements were dismayed to find them largely replaced by emotional and moralistic dialogue until the climactic final scenes. Some critics scoffed at the unorthodox rescue of the hero by the heroine. David Bishop argued that had Quaker Amy \"not\" helped her husband by shooting a man in the back, such inaction would have pulled pacifism \"toward apollonian decadence\". Alfred Hitchcock thought Kelly's performance was \"rather mousy\" and lacking in animation; only in later films, he said, did she show her true star quality.\n\"High Noon\" has been cited as a favorite by several U.S. presidents. Dwight Eisenhower screened the film at the White House, and Bill Clinton hosted a record 17 White House screenings of it. \"It's no accident that politicians see themselves as Gary Cooper in \"High Noon\",\" Clinton said. \"Not just politicians, but anyone who's forced to go against the popular will. Any time you're alone and you feel you're not getting the support you need, Cooper's Will Kane becomes the perfect metaphor.\" Ronald Reagan cited \"High Noon\" as his favorite film, due to the protagonist's strong commitment to duty and the law.\nBy contrast, John Wayne told an interviewer that he considered \"High Noon\" \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life,\" and later teamed with director Howard Hawks to make \"Rio Bravo\" in response. \"I made \"Rio Bravo\" because I didn't like \"High Noon\",\" Hawks explained. \"Neither did Duke [Wayne]. I didn't think a good town marshal was going to run around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking everyone to help. And who saves him? His Quaker wife. That isn't my idea of a good Western.\"\nZinnemann responded, \"I admire Hawks very much. I only wish he'd leave my films alone!\" In a 1973 interview, Zinnemann added, \"I'm rather surprised at Hawks' and Wayne's thinking. Sheriffs are people and no two people are alike. The story of \"High Noon\" takes place in the Old West but it is really a story about a man's conflict of conscience. In this sense it is a cousin to \"A Man for All Seasons\". In any event, respect for the Western hero has not been diminished by \"High Noon\".\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 91 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A classic of the Western genre that broke with many of the traditions at the time, \"High Noon\" endures -- in no small part thanks to Gary Cooper's defiant, Oscar-winning performance.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 89 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating .\nThe film was criticized in the Soviet Union as \"glorification of the individual\".\nAccolades.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Will Kane on their list of \"The 20 All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture\".\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"High Noon\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nLegacy and cultural influence.\n\"High Noon\" is considered an early example of the revisionist Western. Kim Newman calls it the \"most influential Western of the 1950s (because) its attitudes subtly changed the societal vision of the whole (Western) genre\". The traditional format of the Western is of a strong male character leading the civilized against the uncivilized but in this film, the civilized people fail (in a way described by John Wayne as \"un-American\") to support their town marshal. Newman draws the contrast between the \"eerily neat and civilised\" town of Hadleyville and the \"gutlessness, self-interest and lack of backbone exhibited by its inhabitants\" who will allow the town to \"slip back into the savage past\" from which Kane and his deputies once saved it.\nIn his article, \"The Women of \"High Noon\": A Revisionist View\", Don Graham argues that in addition to the man-alone theme, \"High Noon\" \"represents a notable advance in the portrayal of women in Westerns\". Compared with the \"hackneyed presentation\" of stereotypical women characters in earlier Westerns, \"High Noon\" grants the characters of Amy and Helen an expanded presence, the two being counterpoints. While Helen is socially inferior, she holds considerable economic power in the community. Helen's encounter with Amy is key because she tells Amy that she would never leave Kane if he were her man \u2013 she would get a gun and fight, thus predicting Amy's actions. For most of the film, Amy is the \"Eastern-virgin archetype\" but her reaction to the first gunshot \"transcends the limitations of her genre role\" as she returns to town and kills Pierce.\nThe gang's actions indicate the implicit but very real threat they pose to women, as is suggested by the Mexican woman crossing herself when the first three ride into town. Graham summarizes the many references to women as a community demoralized by the failure of its male members, other than Kane. The women, he asserts, equal Kane in strength of character to the extent that they are \"protofeminists\".\nIn 1989, 22-year-old Polish graphic designer Tomasz Sarnecki transformed Marian Stachurski's 1959 Polish variant of the \"High Noon\" poster into a Solidarity election poster for the first partially free elections in communist Poland. The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying \"Wybory\" (i.e., elections) in his right hand while the Solidarity logo is pinned to his vest above the sheriff's badge. The message at the bottom of the poster reads: \"W samo po\u0142udnie: 4 czerwca 1989\", which translates to \"High Noon: 4 June 1989.\"\nAs former Solidarity leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa wrote, in 2004,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe 1981 science fiction film \"Outland\", starring Sean Connery as a federal agent on an interplanetary mining outpost, has been compared to \"High Noon\" due to similarities in themes and plot.\n\"High Noon\" is referenced several times on the HBO drama series \"The Sopranos\". Tony Soprano cites Gary Cooper's character as the archetype of what a man should be, mentally tough and stoic. He frequently laments, \"Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?\" and refers to Will Kane as the \"strong, silent type\". The iconic ending to the film is shown on a television during an extended dream sequence in the fifth-season episode \"The Test Dream\".\n\"High Noon\" inspired the 2008 hip-hop song of the same name by rap artist Kinetics, in which \"High Noon\" is mentioned along with several other classic Western films, drawing comparisons between rap battles and Western-film street showdowns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is found mostly as Lakapenos in the sources, although English-language scholarship in particular prefers the form Lekapenos, in large part due to Sir Steven Runciman's 1928 study on the emperor. He was the son of a peasant with the remarkable name of Theophylact \"the Unbearable\" (\"Theophylaktos Abaktistos\" or \"Abastaktos\"), who had rescued the Emperor Basil I from the enemy in battle at Tephrike in 872, saving his life, and had been rewarded by a place in the Imperial Guard and received estates as a reward. Theophylaktos is usually identified as Armenian. Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis contests this, saying that Armenian ancestry is not mentioned in the many Byzantine sources which discuss Romanos, and that Theophylaktos' alleged ethnicity is an assumption based on his being born in humble circumstances in the Armeniac Theme. The assumption has been repeated so often in literature that it has acquired the status of a known fact, even though it is based on the most tenuous of indirect connections.\nAlthough he did not receive any refined education (for which he was later abused by his son-in-law Constantine VII), Romanos advanced through the ranks of the army during the reign of Emperor Leo VI the Wise. In 911 he was general of the naval theme of Samos and later served as admiral of the fleet (\"droungarios tou ploimou\"). In this capacity he was supposed to participate in the Byzantine operations against Bulgaria on the Danube in 917, but he was unable to carry out his mission. In the aftermath of the disastrous Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Acheloos in 917 by the Bulgarians, Romanos sailed to Constantinople, where he gradually overcame the discredited regency of Empress Zoe Karvounopsina and her supporter Leo Phokas.\nRise to power.\nOn 25 March 919, at the head of his fleet, Lekapenos seized the Boukoleon Palace and the reins of government. Initially, he was named \"magistros\" and \"megas hetaireiarches\", but he moved swiftly to consolidate his position: in April 919 his daughter Helena was married to Constantine VII, and Lekapenos assumed the new title \"basileopator\". On 24 September 920, he was named \"caesar\"; and on 17 December, Romanos was crowned senior emperor.\nIn subsequent years Romanos crowned his own sons co-emperors, Christopher in 921, Stephen and Constantine in 924, although, for the time being, Constantine VII was regarded as first in rank after Romanos himself. It is notable that, as he left Constantine VII untouched, he was called 'the gentle usurper'. Romanos strengthened his position by marrying his daughters to members of the powerful aristocratic families of Argyros and Mouseles, by recalling the deposed patriarch Nicholas Mystikos, and by putting an end to the conflict with the Papacy over the four marriages of Emperor Leo VI.\nHis early reign saw several conspiracies to topple him, which led to the successive dismissal of his first \"paradynasteuontes\", John the Rhaiktor and John Mystikos. From 925 and until the end of his reign, the post was occupied by the chamberlain Theophanes.\nWar and peace with Bulgaria.\nThe first major challenge faced by the new emperor was the war with Bulgaria, which had been re-ignited by the regency of Zoe. The rise to power of Romanos had curtailed the plans of Simeon I of Bulgaria for a marital alliance with Constantine VII, and Romanos was determined to deny the unpopular concession of imperial recognition to Simeon, which had already toppled two imperial governments. Consequently, the first four years of Romanos' reign were spent in warfare against Bulgaria. Although Simeon generally had the upper hand, he was unable to gain a decisive advantage because of the impregnability of Constantinople's walls. In 924, when Simeon had once again blockaded the capital by land, Romanos succeeded in opening negotiations.\nMeeting Simeon in person at Kosmidion, Romanos criticized Simeon's disregard for tradition and Orthodox Christian brotherhood and supposedly shamed him into coming to terms and lifting the siege. In reality, this was accomplished by Romanos' tacit recognition of Simeon as emperor of Bulgaria. Relations were subsequently marred by continued wrangling over titles (Simeon called himself emperor of the \"Romans\" as well), but peace had been effectively established.\nOn the death of Simeon in May 927, Bulgaria's new emperor, Peter I, made a show of force by invading Byzantine Thrace, but he showed himself ready to negotiate for a more permanent peace. Romanos seized the occasion and proposed a marriage alliance between the imperial houses of Byzantium and Bulgaria, at the same time renewing the Serbian-Byzantine alliance with \u010caslav of Serbia, returning independence the same year. In September 927 Peter arrived before Constantinople and married Maria (renamed Eirene, \"Peace\"), the daughter of Romanos' eldest son and co-emperor Christopher, and thus his granddaughter. On this occasion Christopher received precedence in rank over his brother-in-law Constantine VII, something which compounded the latter's resentment towards the Lekapenoi, the Bulgarians, and imperial marriages to outsiders (as documented in his composition \"De Administrando Imperio\"). From this point on, Romanos' government was free from direct military confrontation with Bulgaria. Although Byzantium would tacitly support a Serbian revolt against Bulgaria in 931, and the Bulgarians would allow Magyar raids across their territory into Byzantine possessions, Byzantium and Bulgaria remained at peace for 40 years, until Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria.\nCampaigns in the East.\nRomanos appointed the brilliant general John Kourkouas commander of the field armies (\"domestikos ton scholon\") in the East. John Kourkouas subdued a rebellion in the theme of Chaldia and intervened in Armenia in 924. From 926 Kourkouas campaigned across the eastern frontier against the Abbasids and their vassals, and won an important victory at Melitene in 934. The capture of this city is often considered the first major Byzantine territorial recovery from the Muslims.\nIn 941, while most of the army under Kourkouas was absent in the East, a fleet of 15 old ships under the \"protovestiarios\" Theophanes had to defend Constantinople from a Kievan raid. The invaders were defeated at sea, through the use of Greek fire, and again at land, when they landed in Bithynia, by the returning army under Kourkouas. In 944 Romanos concluded a treaty with Prince Igor of Kiev. This crisis having passed, Kourkouas was free to return to the eastern frontier.\nIn 943 Kourkouas invaded northern Mesopotamia and besieged the important city of Edessa in 944. As the price for his withdrawal, Kourkouas obtained one of Byzantium's most prized relics, the \"mandylion\", the holy towel allegedly sent by Jesus Christ to King Abgar V of Edessa. \nJohn Kourkouas, although considered by some of his contemporaries \"a second Trajan or Belisarius,\" was dismissed after the fall of the Lekapenoi in 945. Nevertheless, his campaigns in the East paved the way for the even more dramatic reconquests in the middle and the second half of the 10th century.\nInternal policies.\nRomanos I Lekapenos attempted to strengthen the Byzantine Empire by seeking peace everywhere that it was possible\u2014his dealings with Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' have been described above. To protect Byzantine Thrace from Magyar incursions (such as the ones in 934 and 943), Romanos paid them protection money and pursued diplomatic avenues. The Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of Romanos, when he started persecuting the Jews of the empire. According to the Schechter Letter, the Khazar ruler Joseph responded to the persecution of Jews by \"doing away with many Christians\", and Romanos retaliated by inciting Oleg of Novgorod (called \"Helgu\" in the letter) against Khazaria.\nSimilarly, Romanos re-established peace within the church and overcame the new conflict between Rome and Constantinople by promulgating the \"Tomos of Union\" in 920. In 933 Romanos took advantage of a vacancy on the patriarchal throne to name his young son Theophylaktos patriarch of Constantinople. The new patriarch did not achieve renown for his piety and spirituality, but he added theatrical elements to the Byzantine liturgy and was an avid horse-breeder, allegedly leaving mass to tend to one of his favorite mares when she was giving birth.\nRomanos was active as a legislator, promulgating a series of laws to protect small landowners from being swallowed up by the estates of the land-owning nobility (\"dynatoi\"). The legislative reform may have been partly inspired by hardship caused by the famine of 927 and the subsequent semi-popular revolt of Basil the Copper Hand. The emperor also managed to increase the taxes levied on the aristocracy and established the state on a more secure financial footing. Romanos was also able to effectively subdue revolts in several provinces of the empire, most notably in Chaldia, the Peloponnese, and Southern Italy.\nHe incorporated the Armenian fortress of Citharizum into the empire in 942 and renamed it Romanopolis (\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2). In Constantinople, he built his palace in the place called Myrelaion, near the Sea of Marmara. Beside it Romanos built a shrine which became the first example of a private burial church of a Byzantine emperor. Moreover, he erected a chapel devoted to Christ Chalkites near the Chalke Gate, the monumental entrance to the Great Palace.\nEnd of the reign.\nRomanos' later reign was marked by the old emperor's heightened interest in divine judgment and his increasing sense of guilt for his role in the usurpation of the throne from Constantine VII. On the death of Christopher, by far his most competent son, in 931, Romanos did not advance his younger sons in precedence over Constantine VII. Fearing that Romanos would allow Constantine VII to succeed him instead of them, his younger sons Stephen and Constantine arrested their father on 20 (or 16) December 944, carried him off to the Princes' Islands and compelled him to become a monk. When they threatened the position of Constantine VII, however, the people of Constantinople revolted, and Stephen and Constantine were likewise stripped of their imperial rank and sent into exile to their father. Romanos died on 15 June 948, and was buried as the other members of his family in the church of Myrelaion.\nHaving lived long under constant threat of deposition\u2014or worse\u2014by the Lekapenoi family, Constantine VII was extremely resentful of them. In his \"De Administrando Imperio\" manual written for his son and successor, Romanos II, he minces no words about his late father-in-law: \"the lord Romanus the Emperor was an idiot and an illiterate man, neither bred in the high imperial manner, nor following Roman custom from the beginning, nor of imperial or noble descent, and therefore the more rude and authoritarian in doing most things ... for his beliefs were uncouth, obstinate, ignorant of what is good, and unwilling to adhere to what is right and proper.\"\nFamily.\nRomanos I's only named wife is Theodora, who died in 922. However, genealogical and chronological considerations have led to the hypothesis that his three eldest children may have been born from an otherwise unattested first marriage. Romanos had at least eight legitimate and at least one illegitimate children, leading to numerous aristocratic descendants and connections in the Middle Byzantine period, including every emperor for the next century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released by Columbia Pictures. The plot centers on a newspaper editor named Walter Burns who is about to lose his ace reporter and ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, newly engaged to another man. Burns suggests they cover one more story together, getting themselves entangled in the case of murderer Earl Williams as Burns desperately tries to win back his wife. The screenplay was adapted from the 1928 play \"The Front Page\" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. This was the second time the play had been adapted for the screen, the first occasion being the 1931 film which kept the original title \"The Front Page\".\nThe script for \"His Girl Friday\" was written by Charles Lederer, with the biggest alteration to the source material being the change of Hildy Johnson's gender, an idea introduced by Hawks. Filming began in September 1939 and finished in November, seven days behind schedule. Production was delayed because the frequent improvisation and numerous ensemble scenes required many retakes. Hawks encouraged his actors to be aggressive and spontaneous. \"His Girl Friday\" has been noted for its surprises, comedy, and rapid, overlapping dialogue. Hawks was determined to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, at the time held by \"The Front Page\". He used a sound mixer on the set to increase the speed of dialogue and held a showing of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his film was.\n\"His Girl Friday\" was #19 on American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs and was selected in 1993 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film is in the public domain because the copyright was not renewed; the play it was based on remained under copyright for several decades until it expired in 2024, fully releasing the film from remaining copyright.\nPlot.\nWalter Burns, a hard-boiled newspaper editor, learns that his ex-wife and former star reporter, Hildy Johnson, is about to marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin and settle down as a housewife in Albany. Walter, determined to sabotage these plans, asks a reluctant Hildy to cover one last story: the execution of Earl Williams, who has been convicted of murdering a black policeman. Walter maintains that Williams is innocent and that the city fathers are only going through with the execution so as to curry favor with black voters. Hildy accepts the assignment on the condition that Walter buy a life insurance policy from Bruce.\nWhile Hildy works on the story, Walter does everything he can to keep Bruce from taking her to Albany, including framing him for theft (forcing Hildy to bail him out of jail). Exasperated, Hildy quits, but when Williams escapes, her journalistic instincts get the better of her. Walter frames Bruce again, and he is immediately sent back to jail.\nWilliams suddenly appears at the window of the press room where Hildy is working. She hides him in a rolltop desk. Meanwhile, a messenger from the governor arrives at the mayor's office with a reprieve for Williams. The mayor, who is determined to see Williams hanged, bribes the messenger to keep the reprieve under his hat until it is too late.\nMrs. Baldwin, Hildy's future mother-in-law, enters the press room, having eluded a kidnapper sent by Walter. She reveals to the assembled crowd (which includes the mayor) that Hildy is keeping Williams in the desk. Williams is taken back to his cell and Walter and Hildy are arrested for abetting his escape. At this point, the messenger returns with the reprieve, telling the mayor that he has decided not to take the bribe after all. Walter uses this information to blackmail the mayor into letting them go.\nWalter tells Hildy that she is free to go to Albany with Bruce. Hildy is put out by this, realizing that she still loves Walter and is not ready to give up her career as a journalist. Bruce then calls to say he has been arrested again, this time for carrying counterfeit money (that Walter gave him). Hildy is relieved to learn that Walter never had any intention of letting her go quietly. Walter proposes to Hildy for the second time and promises to take her on the honeymoon they never had in Niagara Falls. He then learns that there is a strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls. Hildy agrees to honeymoon in Albany, accepting that Walter will never change.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Cary Grant as Walter Burns\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDevelopment and writing.\nWhile producing \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (1939), Howard Hawks tried to pitch a remake of \"The Front Page\" to Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures. Cary Grant was almost immediately cast in the film, but Cohn initially intended Grant to play the reporter, with radio commentator Walter Winchell as the editor. Hawks's production that became \"His Girl Friday\" was originally intended to be a straightforward adaptation of \"The Front Page\", with both the editor and reporter being male. During auditions, Howard Hawks's secretary, a woman, read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns played by Cary Grant. Cohn purchased the rights for \"The Front Page\" in January 1939.\nAlthough Hawks considered the dialogue of \"The Front Page\" to be \"the finest modern dialogue that had been written\", more than half of it was replaced with what Hawks believed to be better lines. Some of the original dialogue was left the same, as were all of the characters' names with two exceptions: Hildy's fianc\u00e9 (now no longer a fianc\u00e9e) was given the name Bruce Baldwin, and the name of the comic messenger bringing the pardon from the governor was changed from Pincus to Pettibone. Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures approved Hawks's idea for the film project. Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, the writers of the original play, were unavailable for screenwriting. Consequently, Hawks considered Gene Fowler as the screenwriter, but he declined the job because he disliked the changes to the screenplay Hawks intended to make. Hawks instead recruited Charles Lederer, who had worked on the adaptation for \"The Front Page\", to work on the screenplay. Though he was not credited, Hecht assisted Lederer in the adaptation. Additions were made at the beginning of the screenplay by Lederer to give the characters a convincing backstory; it was decided that Hildy and Walter would be divorced with Hildy's intentions of remarriage serving as Walter's motivation to win her back.\nDuring writing, Hawks was in Palm Springs directing \"Only Angels Have Wings\", but stayed in close contact with Lederer and Hecht. Hecht helped Lederer with some organizational revisions, and Lederer finished the script on May 22. After two more drafts completed by July, Hawks called Morrie Ryskind to revise the dialogue and make it more interesting. Ryskind revised the script throughout the summer and finished by the end of September before filming began. More than half of the original dialogue was rewritten. The film lacks one of the well-known final lines of the play, \"the son-of-a-bitch stole my watch!\", because films of the time were more censored than Pre-Code Hollywood films, and Hawks felt that the line was too overused. Ryskind developed a new ending in which Walter and Hildy start fighting immediately after saying \"I do\" in the wedding they hold in the newsroom, with one of the characters stating, \"I think it's gonna turn out all right this time.\" However, after revealing the ending to a few writers at Columbia one evening, Ryskind was surprised to hear that his ending was filmed on another set a few days later. Forced to create another ending, Ryskind ended up thanking the anonymous Columbia writer, because he felt that his ending and one of his final lines, \"I wonder if Bruce can put us up\", were better than what he had written originally. After reviewing the screenplay, the Hays Office saw no issues with the film, besides a few derogatory comments towards newsmen and some illegal behavior of the characters. During some rewrites for censors, Hawks focused on finding a lead actress for his film.\nCasting.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHawks had difficulty casting \"His Girl Friday\". While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a more extended process. At first, Hawks wanted Carole Lombard, whom he had directed in the screwball comedy \"Twentieth Century\" (1934), but the cost of hiring Lombard in her new status as a freelancer proved to be far too expensive, and Columbia could not afford her. Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Margaret Sullavan, Ginger Rogers, and Irene Dunne were offered the role, but turned it down. Dunne rejected the role because she felt the part was too small and needed to be expanded. Jean Arthur was suspended by the studio when she refused to take it. Joan Crawford reportedly was considered. Hawks then turned to Rosalind Russell, who had just finished MGM's \"The Women\" (1939). Russell was upset when she discovered from a \"New York Times\" article that Cohn was \"stuck\" with her after attempting to cast many other actresses. Before Russell's first meeting with Hawks, to show her apathy, she took a swim and entered his office with wet hair, causing him to do a \"triple take\". Russell confronted him about this casting issue; he dismissed her quickly and asked her to go to wardrobe.\nFilming.\nAfter makeup, wardrobe, and photography tests, filming began on 27 September 1939. The film had the working title of \"The Bigger They Are\".\nThe film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialogue is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur, Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I had noticed that when people talk, they talk over one another, especially people who talk fast or who are arguing or describing something. So we wrote the dialogue in a way that made the beginnings and ends of sentences unnecessary; they were there for overlapping.\"\nTo get the effect he wanted, as multi-track sound recording was not yet available at the time, Hawks had the sound mixer on the set turn the various overhead microphones on and off as required for the scene, as many as 35 times. Reportedly, the film was sped up because of a challenge Hawks took upon himself to break the record for the fastest dialogue on screen, at the time held by \"The Front Page\". Hawks arranged a showing for newsmen of the two films next to each other to prove how fast his dialogue was.\nHawks gave the actors the freedom to improvise some of their lines and actions, as he did with his comedies more than his dramas. In her autobiography \"Life Is a Banquet\", Russell wrote that she thought she did not have as many good lines as Grant, so she hired her own writer to \"punch up\" her dialogue. With Hawks encouraging ad-libbing, she was able to slip her writer's work into the movie. Only Grant was wise to this tactic and greeted her each morning with \"What have you got today?\" Her ghostwriter gave her some of the lines for the restaurant scene, which is unique to \"His Girl Friday\". It was one of the most complicated scenes to film; because of the rapidity of the dialogue the actors actually ate very little during the scene. Hawks shot this scene with one camera a week and a half into production, and it took four days to film instead of the intended two. The improvisations made it difficult for the cinematographers to know what the characters were going to do. Russell was also difficult to film because her lack of a sharp jawline required makeup artists to paint and blend a dark line under her jawline while shining a light on her face to simulate a more youthful appearance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, breaking the fourth wall a few times in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera, saying \"Is she going to do that?\" Hawks decided to leave this scene in, although it does not appear in the final cut.\nOwing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), Hawks added some straight supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters.\nArthur Rosson worked for three days on second unit footage at Columbia Ranch.\nFilming was completed on 21 November 1939, seven days past schedule.\nUnusually for the time period, the film contains no music except for the music that leads to the final fade out of the film.\nAd-libs by Grant.\nGrant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know ... Ralph Bellamy!\" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad-libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other \"inside\" remarks in the film. When his character is arrested for kidnapping, he describes the horrendous fate suffered by the last person who crossed him: Archie Leach (Grant's birth name). When Earl Williams attempts to climb out of the rolltop desk in which he has been hiding, Grant's character tells him, \"Get back in there, you mock turtle!\" Grant played the Mock Turtle in the 1933 film version of \"Alice in Wonderland\".\nRelease.\nRelease of the film was rushed by Cohn and a sneak preview of the film was held in December, with a press screening on January 3, 1940. \"His Girl Friday\" premiered in New York City at Radio City Music Hall on January 11, 1940, and went into general American release a week later.\nReception.\nContemporary reviews from critics were very positive. Critics were particularly impressed by the gender change of the reporter. Frank S. Nugent of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"Except to add that we've seen \"The Front Page\" under its own name and others so often before we've grown a little tired of it, we don't mind conceding \"His Girl Friday\" is a bold-faced reprint of what was once\u2014and still remains\u2014the maddest newspaper comedy of our times.\" The \"Variety\" reviewer wrote \"The trappings are different\u2014even to the extent of making reporter Hildy Johnson a femme\u2014but it is still \"Front Page\" and Columbia need not regret it. Charles Leder (sic) has done an excellent screenwriting job on it and producer-director Howard Hawks has made a film that can stand alone almost anywhere and grab healthy grosses.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote \"Even though the story and its development will be familiar to those who saw the first version of \"The Front Page\", they will be entertained just the same, for the action is so exciting that it holds one in tense suspense throughout.\" \"Film Daily\" wrote \"Given a snappy pace, a top flight cast, good production and able direction, the film has all the necessary qualities for first-rate entertainment for any type of audience.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that after years of \"feeble, wispy, sad imitations\" of \"The Front Page\", he found this authentic adaptation of the original to be \"as fresh and undated and bright a film as you could want\". Louis Marcorelles called \"His Girl Friday\" \"le film am\u00e9ricain par excellence\".\nPauline Kael was enthusiastic: \"Overlapping dialogue carries the movie along at breakneck speed... as this race of brittle, cynical, childish people rush around on corrupt errands. Russell is at her comedy peak here... And, as Walter Burns, Grant raises mugging to a joyful art... His Burns is a strong-arm performance, defiantly self-centered and funny.\" Leonard Maltin gave it four of four stars: \"Splendid comedy... Terrific character actors add sparkle to must-see film... \" Leslie Halliwell gave it one of his rare four of four stars: \"Frantic, hilarious black farce with all participants at their best, possibly the fastest comedy ever filmed, and one of the funniest.\"\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Anchored by stellar performances from Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, \"His Girl Friday\" is possibly the definitive screwball romantic comedy.\"\nIn the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll of the greatest films of all time, \"His Girl Friday\" appeared on several lists, including those of critic David Thomson and director Quentin Tarantino.\nInterpretation and themes.\nStory.\nThe title \"His Girl Friday\" is an ironic title, because a girl \"Friday\" represents a servant of a master, but Hildy is not a servant in the film, but rather the equal to Walter. The world in this film is not determined by gender, but rather by intelligence and capability. At the beginning of the film, Hildy says that she wants to be \"treated like a woman\", but her return to her profession reveals her true desire to live a different life. In \"His Girl Friday\", even though the characters remarry, Hawks displays an aversion to marriage, home, and family through his approach to the film. Specific, exclusionary camera work and character control of the frame and the dialogue portray a subtle criticism of domesticity. The subject of domesticity is fairly absent throughout the film. Even among the relationships between Grant and Russell and Bellamy and Russell, the relationships are positioned within a larger frame of the male-dominated newsroom. The film, like many comedies, celebrates difficult, tumultuous love rather than secure, suburban love through its preference for movement and argument rather than silent poise. Film critic Molly Haskell wrote that the scene near the end of the film when Hildy sheds tears was not included to expose her femininity, but to express the confusion she felt due to the collision of her professional and feminine natures. The feminine side of Hildy desires to be subservient and sexually desirable to men, while the other side of Hildy desires assertion and to forfeit the stereotypical duties of a woman. Her tears represent her emotional helplessness and inability to express anger to a male authority figure.\nA commonality in many Howard Hawks films is the revelation of the amorality of the main character and a failure of that character to change or develop. In \"His Girl Friday\", Walter Burns manipulates, acts selfishly, frames his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9, and orchestrates the kidnapping of an elderly woman. Even at the end of the film, Burns convinces Hildy Johnson to remarry him despite how much she loathes him and his questionable actions. Upon the resumption of their relationship, there is no romance visible between them. They do not kiss, embrace, or even gaze at each other. It is evident that Burns is still the same person he was in their previous relationship as he quickly waves off the plans for the honeymoon that they never had in pursuit of a new story. Additionally, he walks in front of her when exiting the room, forcing her to carry her own suitcase despite Johnson already having criticized this at the beginning of the film. This hints that the marriage is fated to face the same problems that ended it previously.\nHawks is known for his use of repeated or intentional gestures in his films. In \"His Girl Friday\", the cigarette in the scene between Hildy and Earl Williams serves several symbolic roles in the film. First, the cigarette establishes a link between the characters when Williams accepts the cigarette even though he does not smoke. However, the fact that he doesn't smoke, and they don't share the cigarette shows the difference between and separation of the worlds in which the two characters live.\nThe film contains two main plots: the personal and the professional. Walter induces Hildy to get back in the beat in the paper\u2019s attempt to scoop the story of murderer Earl Williams; the concurrent plot is Walter attempting to scuttle Hildy\u2019s upcoming marriage. The speed of the film results in snappy and overlapping dialogue among interruptions and rapid speech. Gesture, character and camera movement, as well as editing, serve to complement the dialogue in increasing the pace of the film. There is a clear contrast between the fast-talking Hildy and Walter and slow-talking Bruce and Earl. The average word per minute count of the film is 240 while the average American speech is around 140 words per minute. There are nine scenes with at least four words per second and at least two with more than five words per second. Hawks attached verbal tags before and after specific script lines so the actors would be able to interrupt and talk over each other without making the necessary dialogue incomprehensible.\nFilm theorist and historian David Bordwell explained the ending of \"His Girl Friday\" as a \"closure effect\" rather than a closure. The ending of the film is rather circular, and there is no development of characters, specifically Walter Burns, and the film ends similarly to the way in which it starts. Additionally, the film ends with a brief epilogue in which Walter announces their remarriage and reveals their intention to go cover a strike in Albany on the way to their honeymoon. The fates of the main characters and even some of the minor characters such as Earl Williams are revealed, although there are minor flaws in the resolution. For example, they do not discuss what happened to Mollie Malloy after the conflict is resolved. However, the main characters\u2019 endings were wrapped up so neatly that it overshadows the need for the minor characters' endings to be wrapped up. This creates a \"closure effect\" or an appearance of closure.\nEditing style.\n\"His Girl Friday\" is a movie intentioned for speed: it set the record on fastest words spoken per minute in a movie. A second to appreciate the moment is a foregone luxury in the whirlwind nature of the publishing business. Dissecting one of the scenes from the movie to best display the editing style, consider the specific scene where Earl Williams escapes. Howard Hawks emphasizes the pace difference between Hildy\u2019s two possible lives, by having plot elements and staging mirror the editing, where slow and languid moments are interspersed with sub-second shots of newsworthy freneticism. To emphasize the contrast of rhythm between Hildy\u2019s domestic life with Bruce versus her dynamic life with Walter, the director mirrors with editing techniques like lengthier contemplative shots versus rapid fire shots, matches on action versus elliptical shots with continuous diegetic sound, and scenes with one element of focus versus several different objects and sounds splitting our attention.\nThe scene opens with two lengthy (10 second) shots of Hildy describing her life outside the newsroom\u2014the shots reinforce the idea that the life with Bruce will be predictable and slowly paced. As Hildy looks off away from the camera for the first time, literally turning her back on the newspaper life for just an instant, her attention is snapped back to the newsroom as shots are fired. Immediately, the editing reflects the newfound fast pace: from slow pans to static shots with the only movement being Hildy\u2019s slow walking, the movie immediately shifts to dynamic shots with several people\u2019s movements on the street, as well as gunshots, ducking, spotlight-exaggerated lighting shifts, and shouting with the men in the window. The medium shots of the frantic news reporters are in contrast with a now obscured long shot of Hildy\u2014while previously she was the main character and source of sound, the director makes it clear that she will be suddenly relegated to the background when the action is happening: her background presence is obscured by a frosted window, and her sounds obscured by the frenzy of the gunshots and shouting.\nUpon revealing that Earl Williams has escaped, the movie then shifts from multi-second shots to sub-second shots as the news editors enter maximum monkey mode. As gunshots provide a diegetic backdrop of time, ellipses shots become more obvious; the first reporter immediately cuts from reaching the table to talking on the phone. The next 5 shots are also sub-second close-ups of newsmen yelling into phones. As she is slowly drawn into this world again, Hildy begins to occupy more of the frame\u2014going from a long shot to a medium shot as the newsmen stream past her. Once the men are gone, the longest shot of the sequence ensues: 16 seconds as she closes the distance she created from her old life, shedding her coat, symbolizing her chilly life in Albany, to reveal the reporter-ready dress underneath, the person she truly is. She fully reunites with it as she picks up the phone to talk to Walter, then rushes out of the room with the same fervor as the news folk. The camera cements this final switch as the dolly moves out, and a crossfade ensues on her running out, unlike all the prior cuts.\nFinally it concludes using shots of gates opening, cars streaming out, and people running. Here, Hawks\u2019s shots are not just fast\u2014they are explicit about being faster than time. A diegetic siren delineates unit seconds as cars screech, but the film shows the abbreviated ellipses shot of the gate closing, skipping the time with a shot of guards running. This sequence is faster than real time, and the contrast with the siren shows how time in the news reporters world is faster paced than the world around them. Hildy joins the chaos shouting \"HEY!\", providing a final contrast to the start of the scene where she described the idyllic and calm city life she was originally headed for.\nThroughout this sequence, Hawks is explicit about the passage of time and focus of characters through his edits and mocks the slow Albany life Hildy begins with by showcasing the romantic frenzy of news life through shot timing, continuity of action, and shifting attention-grabbing elements.\nWomen reporters.\nAccording to Pauline Kael, all female reporters in newspaper films are based on Adela Rogers St. Johns.\nLegacy.\n\"His Girl Friday\" (often along with \"Bringing Up Baby\" and \"Twentieth Century\") is cited as an archetype of the screwball comedy genre. In 1993, the Library of Congress selected \"His Girl Friday\" for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The film ranked 19th on the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs, a 2000 list of the funniest American comedies. Prior to \"His Girl Friday\", the play \"The Front Page\" had been adapted for the screen once before, in the 1931 film, also called \"The Front Page\", produced by Howard Hughes, with Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien in the starring roles. In this first film adaptation of the Broadway play of the same title (written by former Chicago newsmen Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), Hildy Johnson was male.\n\"His Girl Friday\" was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on the September 30, 1940, broadcast of \"Lux Radio Theatre\", with Claudette Colbert, Fred MacMurray and Jack Carson. It was dramatized again with a half-hour version on \"The Screen Guild Theater\" on March 30, 1941, with Grant and Russell reprising their film roles. \"The Front Page\" was remade in a 1974 Billy Wilder movie starring Walter Matthau as Walter Burns, Jack Lemmon as Hildy Johnson, and Susan Sarandon as his fianc\u00e9e.\n\"His Girl Friday\" and the original Hecht and MacArthur play were adapted into another stage play \"His Girl Friday\" by playwright John Guare. This was presented at the National Theatre in London from May to November 2003, with Alex Jennings as Burns and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as Hildy. The 1988 film \"Switching Channels\" was loosely based on \"His Girl Friday\", with Burt Reynolds in the Walter Burns role, Kathleen Turner in the Hildy Johnson role, and Christopher Reeve in the role of Bruce. In December 2017 Peter Giser, the artistic director of the Snowglobe Theatre, an independent theatre based in Montreal, Canada, adapted the script for the stage, expanded some characters, and made the play more accessible to modern audiences. It was performed that December after Snowglobe obtained copyright status of this adapted version.\nDirector Quentin Tarantino has named \"His Girl Friday\" as one of his favorite movies. In the 2004 French film \"Notre musique\", the film is used by Godard as he explains the basic of filmmaking, specifically the shot reverse shot. As he explains this concept, two stills from \"His Girl Friday\" are shown with Cary Grant in one photo and Rosalind Russell in the other. He explains that upon looking closely, the two shots are actually the same shot, \"because the director is incapable of seeing the difference between a man and a woman.\"\nRosalind Russell's performance as Hildy Johnson was cited as the model for the character of Lois Lane in the Superman franchise.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2025 film \"Heart Eyes\", \"His Girl Friday\" is playing at a drive-in movie theatre with Ally McCabe (Olivia Holt) admitting \"I actually kind of like this movie.\" Ally is later shown watching the film at home.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading"}

He succeeded his father Constantine\u00a0VII at the age of twenty-one and died suddenly and mysteriously four years later. His wife Theophano helped their sons Basil II and Constantine VIII ultimately succeed him in 976.\nLife.\nRomanos II was a son of the Emperor Constantine VII and Helena Lekapene, the daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos and his wife Theodora. The \"Theophanes Continuatus\" states that he was 21 years old at the time of his accession in 959, meaning that he was born in 938. Named after his maternal grandfather, Romanos was married, as a child, to Bertha, the illegitimate daughter of King Hugh of Italy, to bond an alliance. She had changed her name to Eudokia after their marriage, but died an early death in 949, which caused the dissolution of the alliance.\nOn 27 January 945, Constantine VII succeeded in removing his brothers-in-law, the sons of Romanos I, assuming the throne alone. On 6 April 945 (Easter), Constantine crowned his son co-emperor. With Hugh out of power in Italy and dead by 947, Romanos secured the promise from his father that he would be allowed to select his own bride. Romanos chose a woman named Anastaso, whom he married in 956 and renamed Theophano.\nIn November 959, Romanos\u00a0II succeeded his father on the throne amidst rumors that he or his wife had poisoned him.[i] Romanos purged his father's courtiers of his enemies and replaced them with friends. To appease his bespelling wife, he excused his mother, Empress Helena, from court and forced his five sisters into convents. Nevertheless, many of Romanos' appointees were able men, including his chief adviser, the eunuch Joseph Bringas.\nThe pleasure-loving sovereign could also leave military matters in the adept hands of his generals, in particular the brothers Leo and Nikephoros Phokas. In 960 Nikephoros Phokas was sent to Crete with a fleet that was considered by contemporary historians as notably large, but probably not comprising more than 25,000-30,000 soldiers and sailors in total. After a difficult campaign and nine-month Siege of Chandax, Nikephoros successfully re-established Byzantine control over the entire island in 961. Following a triumph celebrated at Constantinople, Nikephoros was sent to the eastern frontier, where the Emir of Aleppo Sayf al-Dawla was engaged in annual raids into Byzantine Anatolia. Nikephoros took Cilicia and even Aleppo in 962, sacking the palace of the Emir and taking possession of his treasures. In the meantime Leo Phokas and Marianos Argyros had countered Magyar incursions into the Byzantine Balkans.\nAfter a lengthy hunting expedition Romanos\u00a0II took ill and died on 15 March 963.[iv] Rumor attributed his death to poison administered by his wife Theophano, but there is no evidence of this, and Theophano would have been risking much by exchanging the secure status of a crowned Augusta with the precarious one of a widowed regent of her very young children.\nRomanos\u00a0II's reliance on his wife and on bureaucrats like Joseph Bringas had resulted in a relatively capable administration, but this built up resentment among the nobility, which was associated with the military. In the wake of Romanos' death, his Empress Dowager, now regent to the two co-emperors, her underage sons, was quick to marry the general Nikephoros Phokas and to acquire another general, John Tzimiskes, as her lover, having them both elevated to the imperial throne in succession. The rights of her sons were safeguarded, however, and eventually, when Tzimiskes died at war, her eldest son Basil\u00a0II became senior emperor.\nFamily.\nRomanos' first marriage, in September 944,[iii] was to Bertha, illegitimate daughter of King Hugh of Italy. She changed her name from Bertha to Eudokia after her marriage. She died in 949, her marriage unconsummated.[ii]\nBy his second wife Theophano he had at least four children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "74028", "revid": "49648260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74028", "title": "The Hitch-Hiker", "text": "1953 film by Ida Lupino\nThe Hitch-Hiker is a 1953 American independent film noir thriller directed by Ida Lupino, who co-wrote it with her former husband Collier Young, and starring Edmond O'Brien, William Talman and Frank Lovejoy. Based on the 1950 killing spree of Billy Cook, the film follows two friends who are taken hostage by a serial-murdering hitchhiker during an automobile trip to Mexico.\n\"The Hitch-Hiker\" was the first mainstream-released American film of its type directed by a woman. It was selected in 1998 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nIn the early 1950s, a serial-murdering hitchhiker is on a spree. A prison break-out, Emmett Myers (Talman), is blared in newspaper headlines.\nIn California, two friends, Roy Collins (O'Brien) and Gilbert Bowen (Lovejoy), leave one evening on a planned fishing trip to San Felipe, Baja California, Mexico. They cross the Mexico\u2013United States border at Calexico-Mexicali and continue on through the night. They pick up Myers, who pulls a gun and holds them hostage. He forces them to drive him through the Baja California desert towards Santa Rosal\u00eda, Baja California Sur, where he plans to escape a police dragnet by taking a ferry across the Gulf of California to Guaymas. To avoid law enforcement, he orders the pair to drive at night.\nCollins and Bowen comply. In Mexico, Myers sadistically terrorizes the pair\u2014at one point forcing Bowen to shoot a tin can out of Collins' hand with a game rifle\u2014and revels in the ineffective attempts by Mexican law enforcement to catch him using checkpoints. After a tense moment while buying food, they stop for the night. Collins and Bowen discuss their plans to escape, and agree that they must only act at the right time or they will be killed.\nThe next morning, the car radio fails, and Myers slugs Collins in the head for breaking it, so Bowen must drive. Meanwhile, police investigators learn the three are together and deduce where Myers is heading. At a gas station, Myers kills a dog, while Bowen leaves his wedding ring for the police to find. Overnight, Collins and Bowen attempt to escape, but Collins injures his ankle, and the pair are recaptured. As the police investigation proceeds, supervisors release false information to trick Myers, which seems to work. Later, when the car is damaged, Myers forces the group to continue on foot at gunpoint, and taunts them for missing opportunities to escape even if it would mean the other would be killed.\nCollins, Bowen, and Myers reach Santa Rosal\u00eda and head to a bar, where Myers tries to conceal his identity and find an English speaking local. Learning the regular ferry to Guaymas has burned, Myers pays a fisherman to take him there instead. However, as the threesome prepare to leave, a local resident recognizes Myers and alerts the authorities, who deploy to catch him at the pier. After a shootout and scuffle, Myers is subdued and Collins and Bowen are freed unharmed.\nProduction.\nBackground.\n\"The Hitch-Hiker\" was based on the 1950 killing spree of Billy Cook who, posing as a hitchhiker, murdered a family of five, kidnapped a Riverside County Sheriff's Department deputy and abandoned him in a desert (the deputy survived), and killed a traveling salesman, before attempting to flee to Mexico by taking two men on a hunting trip hostage and forcing them to drive him to Santa Rosal\u00eda. There, Cook was identified and apprehended by local police without incident. As Mexico then lacked a formal extradition treaty with the United States, Mexican authorities \"extradited\" him back to the U.S. by physically pushing him over the border, where he was taken into custody by waiting American law enforcement. Cook was tried, convicted, and received the death penalty. On December 12, 1952, Cook was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison in California.\nWriting.\nThe film was written by Lupino and her former husband Collier Young, based on a story by Daniel Mainwaring, which was adapted by Robert L. Joseph. Mainwaring did not receive a screen credit because of his Hollywood blacklisting.\nLupino interviewed the two prospectors whom Billy Cook had held hostage, and got releases from them and from Cook as well, so that she could integrate parts of Cook's life into the script. To appease the censors at the Hays Office, however, she reduced the number of deaths to three. \nFilming.\n\"The Hitch-Hiker\" went into independent productionn on June 24, 1952, and wrapped in late July. The director of photography was RKO Pictures regular Nicholas Musuraca. Location shooting took place in the Alabama Hills near Lone Pine and Big Pine, California. Working titles for the film were \"\"The Difference\" and \"The Persuader\"\".\nLupino was a noted actress who began directing when Elmer Clifton got sick and couldn't finish the film he was directing for Filmakers Inc., the production company founded by Lupino and Young to make low-budget, issue-oriented movies. Lupino stepped in to finish the film and went on to direct her own projects. \"The Hitch-Hiker\" was her first hard-paced, fast-moving picture after four \"women's\" films about social issues.\nThe film is in the public domain.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"The Hitch-Hiker\" premiered in Boston on March 20, 1953, to little fanfare and immediately went into general release. The film was marketed with the tagline: \"When was the last time you invited death into your car?\"\nReception.\nThe picture received mixed contemporary reviews, whereas later reviews are consistently positive.\n\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" said that \"with nothing more than three able actors, a lot of rugged scenery and their own impressive talents as producers, authors and director, Collier Young and Ida Lupino have brewed a grim little chiller\". The \"Inquirer\" critic praised the performances and said the film was \"directed with masculine strength by the amazing Miss Lupino\".\nThe \"New York Daily News\" gave the film three and a half of four stars, saying Lupino made \"good and exciting use\" of the real-life incident.\n\"The New York Times\" called the film an \"unrelenting but superficial study of abnormal psychology coupled with standard chase melodrama\". Critic A. H. Weiler complimented the performances and Lupino's \"brisk direction\", but criticized the plot as excessively predictable.\n\"The Detroit Free Press\" said that the film performed a public service by warning motorists about the dangers of picking up hitchhikers.\nIn 1992, critics Bob Porfiero and Alain Silver praised Lupino's use of shooting locations. They wrote, \"\"The Hitch-Hiker\"'s desert locale, although not so graphically dark as a cityscape at night, isolates the protagonists in a milieu as uninviting and potentially deadly as any in \"film noir\".\"\nIn 2002 critic John Krewson lauded the work of Ida Lupino, and wrote, As a screenwriter and director, Lupino had an eye for the emotional truth hidden within the taboo or mundane, making a series of B-styled pictures which featured sympathetic, honest portrayals of such controversial subjects as unmarried mothers, bigamy, and rape ... in \"The Hitch-Hiker\", arguably Lupino's best film and the only true noir directed by a woman, two utterly average middle-class American men are held at gunpoint and slowly psychologically broken by a serial killer. In addition to her critical but compassionate sensibility, Lupino had a great filmmaker's eye, using the starkly beautiful street scenes in \"Not Wanted\" and the gorgeous, ever-present loneliness of empty highways in \"The Hitch-Hiker\" to set her characters apart.\nIn 2008 \"Time Out Film Guide\" wrote of the film, Absolutely assured in her creation of the bleak, noir atmosphere \u2013 whether in the claustrophobic confines of the car, or lost in the arid expanses of the desert \u2013 Lupino never relaxes the tension for one moment. Yet her emotional sensitivity is also upfront: charting the changes in the menaced men's relationship as they bicker about how to deal with their captor, stressing that only through friendship can they survive. Taut, tough, and entirely without macho-glorification, it's a gem, with first-class performances from its three protagonists, deftly characterised without resort to clich\u00e9.\nIn January 2014, a restored 35mm print was premiered by the Film Noir Foundation at Noir City 12 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. On April 6, 2014 \"The Hitch-Hiker\" was shown again at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. Mary Ann Anderson author of \"The Making of The Hitch-Hiker\" appeared at this event.\nAs of 2021 held a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 43 reviews.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also called data processing terminal equipment or tail circuit. A DTE device communicates with the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE), such as a modem. The DTE/DCE classification was introduced by IBM.\nA DTE is the functional unit of a data station (\"station\", \"terminal\") that serves as a data source or a data sink and provides for the data communication control function to be performed in accordance with the link protocol.\nUsually, the DTE device is the terminal (or a computer emulating a terminal), and the DCE is a modem or another carrier-owned device. The data terminal equipment may be a single piece of equipment or an interconnected subsystem of multiple pieces of equipment that perform all the required functions necessary to permit users to communicate. A user interacts with the DTE (e.g. through a human-machine interface), or the DTE may be the user.\nConnections.\nTwo different types of devices are assumed on each end of the interconnecting cable for a case of simply adding DTE to the topology (e.g. to a hub, DCE), which also brings a less trivial case of interconnection of devices of the same type: DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE. Such cases need crossover cables, such as for the Ethernet or null modem for RS-232.\nD-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment.\nNetworking.\nA general rule is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the provided clock (external clocking).\nThis term is also generally used in the Telco and Cisco equipment context to designate a network device, such as terminals, personal computers but also routers and bridges, that's unable or configured not to generate clock signals. Hence a direct PC to PC Ethernet connection can also be called a DTE to DTE communication. This communication is done via an Ethernet crossover cable as opposed to a PC to DCE (hub, switch, or bridge) communication which is done via an Ethernet straight cable.\nV.35 is a high-speed serial interface designed to support both higher data rates and connectivity between DTEs (data-terminal equipment) or DCEs (data-communication equipment) over digital lines.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74043", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74043", "title": "Captain Hook", "text": "Captain James Hook is the main antagonist of J. M. Barrie's 1904 play \"Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\" and its various adaptations, in which he is Peter Pan's archenemy. The character is a pirate captain of the brig Jolly Roger. His two principal fears are the sight of his own blood (supposedly an unnatural colour) and the crocodile who pursues him after having previously eaten Captain Hook's hand cut off by Pan. An iron hook that replaced his severed hand has given the pirate his name.\nCreation of the character.\nHook did not appear in early drafts of the play, wherein the capricious and coercive Peter Pan was closest to a \"villain\", but was created for a front-cloth scene (a cloth flown well downstage in front of which short scenes are played while big scene changes are \"silently\" carried out upstage) depicting the children's journey home. Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on the premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by Dorothea Baird, the actress playing Mary Darling, but Gerald du Maurier, already playing George Darling (and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead, a casting tradition since replicated in many stage and film productions of the Peter Pan story.\nAccording to A. N. Wilson, Barrie \"openly acknowledged Hook and his obsession with the crocodile was an English version of Ahab\", and there are other borrowings from Melville.\nBiography of the character.\nBarrie states in the novel: \"Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze.\" He is said to be \"Blackbeard's bo'sun\" and \"the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid\". (In Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\", one of the names Long John Silver goes by is Barbecue.)\nIn the play, it is implied that Hook attended Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, and his final words are \"Floreat Etona\", Eton's motto. In the novel, Hook's last words are a similarly upper-class \"bad form\", in disapproval of the way Peter Pan beats him by throwing him overboard. He also has a yellow blood disorder.\nThe book relates that Peter Pan began the ongoing rivalry between them by feeding the pirate's hand to a crocodile. After getting a taste of Hook, the crocodile pursues him relentlessly, but the ticking clock it has also swallowed warns Hook of its presence.\nAppearances.\n\"Peter Pan\" (play) and \"Peter and Wendy\" (novel).\nHook is described as \"cadaverous\" and \"blackavised\", with \"eyes which were of the blue of the forget-me-not\" (\"save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly\") and long dark curls resembling \"black candles\". He is a very skilled swordsman. In many pantomime performances of \"Peter Pan\", Hook's hair is a wig and is accompanied by thick bushy eyebrows and moustache. The hook is fixed to his right hand (often changed to the left hand in film adaptations) and is used as a weapon. He is also described as having a \"handsome countenance\" and an \"elegance of ... diction\"\u00a0\u2013 \"even when he [is] swearing\". Barrie describes \"an attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts\". Hook's cigar holder enables him to smoke two cigars at once. Barrie also stated in \"Captain Hook at Eton\" that he was, \"in a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting\". Although Hook is callous and bloodthirsty, it makes it clear that these qualities make him a magnificent pirate and \"not wholly unheroic\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Disney version.\nIn the animated film \"Peter Pan\" (1953), Captain Hook is a far more comical villain than the original character: he is seen as a vain and dastardly coward with a childish temper who is prone to crying out in terror. During the film's early development, the story department analysed Hook's character as \"a fop... Yet very mean, to the point of being murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts\".\nFrank Thomas was the directing animator of Hook. According to Disney's Platinum release bonus features, Hook was modeled after Charles II of England. One director insisted that Hook should be a darker villain with no comedic traits; but this was refused for fear of frightening a juvenile audience, and Hook became a comical villain, equally matched with Peter Pan.\nActor Hans Conried set the tone for Disney's interpretation of Hook, as he was the original voice for the Captain, as well as, in the tradition of the stage play, Mr. Darling, and performed live-action reference for the two characters. In subsequent Disney animation, Hook is voiced by Corey Burton.\nHook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his left hand and refuses to leave Neverland prior to this revenge. Throughout the film, Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan, he plants a bomb in Peter's hideout (instead of Barrie's vial of poison). At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance, with the rest of the crew trying to save Hook. Walt Disney insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: \"The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.\"\nOther film appearances.\nIn the sequel \"Return to Never Land\" (2002), Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death. After this fails, he promises to take Jane home if she will help him find the island's treasure, and \"not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan's head\". This last promise is kept when he pulls a single hair from Peter's head, declaring \"the rest of him is mine\". At the end of the film, he and the crew are pursued into the distance by a giant octopus. \nCaptain Hook is one of the Disney Villains who have a main focus in the direct-to-video anthology film \"Once Upon a Halloween\".\nCaptain Hook's origins are explored in the Disney Fairies film \"The Pirate Fairy\", in which he is voiced by Tom Hiddleston. In the story, a young James years before he lost his hand, pretended to be a pirate ship's cabin boy and befriended the rebellious fairy Zarina, who had left Pixie Hollow after being dismissed as a dust-keeper when her unauthorised experiments with pixie dust led to a disaster. James foresaw the great potential of the pixie dust and let Zarina think she had the authority over pirates.\nIn \"The Simpsons\" short film \"Welcome to the Club\", Captain Hook (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) appears along with other Disney Villains trying to convince Lisa Simpson how fun it is to be a villain. He also appears in the short film \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\".\nJude Law portrays Captain Hook in the live-action film \"Peter Pan &amp; Wendy\", which adapts material from the 1953 animated film. Unlike the animated version, his hook is his right arm. Unlike Barrie's original play and later \"Peter Pan\" adaptations, in which the same actor play Hook and Mr. Darling, the latter's role is performed by a different actor, Alan Tudyk. In this version, Hook is revealed to be an old friend of Peter's and the first Lost Boy, but he left Neverland because he missed his mother. Years later, he returned to Neverland as a pirate, being rejected by Peter because he had grown up.\nJoshua Colley plays a teen Hook in the live-action film \"\", from the \"Descendants\" franchise. His teenage son Harry (portrayed by Thomas Doherty) appears in the previous films of the franchise \"Descendants 2\" and \"Descendants 3\", Captain Hook being only mentioned.\nTelevision series.\nCaptain Hook made a special guest cameo on \"Raw Toonage\" in the episode hosted by Don Karnage (air pirate of \"TaleSpin\"), wherein he challenged Karnage to a sword fight for a treasure chest and won.\nHook also appeared frequently on \"House of Mouse\", and its two direct-to-video films \"\" and \"Mickey's House of Villains\", acting as a major antagonist in the latter.\nIn the Disney Junior series \"Jake and the Never Land Pirates\", Hook serves as the main antagonist, with his mother, Mama Hook, herself exclusive to the Disney Junior series, keeping him \"honest\" if he gets tempted.\nVideo games.\n\"Kingdom Hearts\" series.\n appears in the video game series \"Kingdom Hearts\". He is voiced in Japanese by Chikao Ohtsuka until \"Birth by Sleep\", after which he is voiced by Naoya Uchida. His English voice actor is Corey Burton.\n\"Epic Mickey\".\nAn animatronic version of Captain Hook appears in \"Epic Mickey\", wherein he has been converting his crew into animatronic, cyborg version of themselves (referred to in the game as Beetleworx) and is waging an attack against the non-converted pirates. Smee requests that Mickey Mouse find a way to save Hook and stop this machine that is turning pirates into Beetleworx. Players can either fight Hook by themselves and earn a thinner upgrade (and a \"bad ending\") or free the Sprite and have Pete Pan (a version of Pete dressed as Peter Pan) defeat him and earn a paint upgrade (and a \"good ending\" showing Pete Pan and Captain Hook in a duel). In \", Hook has disappeared entirely, leaving his crew leaderless and having been run out of Tortooga by Blackbeard and Pete Pan having joined up with the Mad Doctor after losing his purpose. Some of Hook's clothes and items have been left behind in Ventureland, which the crew members seek to assert their authority to take over leadership of the other pirates and lead them to take back their home.\nThe Cartoon World's version of Hook appears in \" as the first boss, having fallen under the control of Mizrabel to fight Mickey. Upon his defeat, he comes to his senses and offers his help to Mickey's quest to bring the toons back to the Cartoon World.\nAttractions and live events.\nCaptain Hook appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a meetable character along with Mr. Smee alternating between Fantasyland and Adventureland. He also appears as a figure during the dark ride \"Peter Pan's Flight\".\nIn \"Fantasmic!\" at Disneyland, there is a scene in which we see Captain Hook and Peter Pan duelling aboard the Jolly Roger (portrayed by the Sailing Ship \"Columbia\"). This is replaced by a short re-enactment of Disney's \"Pocahontas\" at Disney's Hollywood Studios.\nAt Disney World's \"Dream-Along with Mickey\" show, Hook, along with Smee, is one of the villains that crashes Mickey's party. This happens when Peter and Wendy appear to make Goofy's dream for some adventure come true and play a game of \"Pretend to Be Pirates\" with Donald Duck, who pretends to be the captain until the real Hook appears and challenges Peter to a duel. At first, Hook's appearance seems to take place for no reason other than to add some action to the show but is revealed to actually be working for Maleficent, who is insulted after not being invited to the party. He is defeated by Mickey Mouse, who leads the audience in a chant of \"Dreams come true!\", and scares off the villains.\nAt the Disney Villains Mix and Mingle Halloween Dance Party at \"Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party\", Hook is summoned up by Maleficent along with the other villains, and co-hosts along with her, revealed by him being the only one of the villains besides her to sing and also being the villain that dances with her.\nCaptain Hook was also featured in the \"Disney on Ice\" 2013 show 'Let's Party' as part of the Halloween celebration section, which takes the format of a party hosted by Jack Skellington where all the 'main' Disney villains attend (the Evil Queen and Jafar being two other notable villains in the scene) and they plan to capture Mickey Mouse to plunge everyone into unhappiness.\nPrinted media.\nOccasionally, Hook appears in the Scrooge McDuck universe of comic books as the nemesis of Moby Duck, a whaler cousin of Donald Duck.\nIn the \"Kingdom Keepers\" series book \"Disney at Dawn\" (2008), Captain Hook was snooping around Ariel's Grotto, having been sent by the Overtakers in investigate the meaning in Jess playing songs over the park speakers.\nIn the \"Descendants\" franchise novels \"Isle of the Lost\" (2015) and its sequel \"Rise of the Isle of the Lost\" (2017), Captain Hook appears as one of the villains who live imprisoned on the titular island. He is also the father of Harriet (eldest daughter), Harry (middle son), and CJ (youngest daughter).\nIn the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" novel \"\" by A. C. Crispin, Captain Hook is mentioned as \"James\" in conversation, confirmed by Crispin to be a Disney \"in\" joke.\nIn film.\n\"Peter Pan\" (1924 film).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan\" (1924), portrayed by Ernest Torrence.\n\"Hook\" (1991 film).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Hook\", portrayed by Dustin Hoffman. Looking for purpose in his own life Hook kidnaps the children of the adult Peter to lure his arch-enemy back to Neverland and gives the middle-aged man three days to rekindle his spirit. Hook has been left feeling depressed and suicidal since Peter Pan forfeited his eternal youth and left Neverland to start a family with Wendy's granddaughter Moira and took on the new identity of Peter Banning (Robin Williams). After his initial arrival in Neverland, Banning make an unsuccessful first attempt to get Hook to release his children by offering money but Hook refuses, shooting Peter's checkbook. Hook worries he has nothing left to accomplish; he has long since killed the crocodile and made a quiet clock tower out of its corpse. Despite killing the crocodile, he remains terrified of the sound of ticking clocks and has become increasingly paranoid of the crocodile coming back, often destroying clocks to cope. At Smee's suggestion, Hook attempts to persuade Peter's children that their father never loved them, in order to coerce them to stay in Neverland. He is successful with Jack, Peter's son, who soon sees Hook as the attentive father figure that Peter has never been, and Hook eventually sees Jack as a potential heir. Peter's daughter, Maggie, mistrusts Hook immediately and refuses to be swayed, reminding Hook of her father's past defiances. Hook decides to hold Maggie hostage until Peter's failure to rescue her ruins her faith in him. This backfires when Peter and the Lost Boys rescue her immediately. Jack sees Hook stab Rufio to death in a duel and realises how much his father cares for the Lost Boys, rejecting the murderous Hook and embracing Peter once again. As Peter leaves the ship with his children and the Lost Boys, Hook orders him to come back. Maggie tells him off, stating Hook needs a mother to straighten his bad attitude. After Hook vows to kidnap future generations of children in Peter's family, Peter and Hook engage in a final duel amidst a circle of Lost Boys, Peter taunting Hook about the idea that the ticking clocks he fears are not reminders of the crocodile, but a reminder of time ticking away. After a close call where Tinker Bell deflects an attack with the hook, the crocodile clock tower seemingly comes to \"life\" and eats Hook when it falls on top of him.\nHook's missing hand is his left and his stump takes other attachments, including a baseball mitt and a pointer. He dresses very elegantly in a gold-trimmed red coat, matching hat, and a wig that hides his balding head. He wears a ceremonial captain's sword at his side, but uses a proper duelling sword when fighting Rufio and Peter. Hook's physical appearance in the film is heavily influenced by Disney's portrayal, though with more elaborate clothing trim and his moustache is curled, shaped like a hook. He is closer to Barrie's characterisation as a gentleman pirate than in Disney's version; for instance, he frequently describes certain behaviours as \"good form\" or \"bad form\" (although he is willing to violate these rules when it suits him, such as trying to stab Peter in the back during their climatic duel). Hoffman claimed to have based the character's voice and mannerisms on conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr.\nIn addition to playing the titular character, Hoffman also provided the airline pilot's announcement in the scene where the Bannings fly from San Francisco to London for Christmas, as a reference to the traditional element of casting one actor in a dual-role of Captain Hook and George Darling in the original play\n\"Peter Pan\" (2003 film).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan\" (2003), portrayed by Jason Isaacs. In the climactic duel, he learns to fly, almost defeating Peter Pan, but the Lost Boys' taunts weaken the enthusiasm needed to fly, and he falls into the crocodile's mouth, accepting his fate.\n\"Shrek\" film series.\nCaptain Hook appears in the \"Shrek\" franchise. In \"Shrek 2\", he plays piano in the Poison Apple Tavern, singing \"Little Drop of Poison\" by Tom Waits and \"People Ain't No Good\" by Nick Cave. In \"Shrek the Third\"., he appears as a secondary antagonist voiced by Ian McShane.\n\"Pan\" (2015 film).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Pan\", portrayed by Garrett Hedlund. He works with Peter Pan to escape from Blackbeard's mines in Neverland and joins forces with the native tribe. Although initially only interested in leaving Neverland, Hook is attracted to Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) and assists her and Peter in personally dueling Boatswain Bishop as Tiger Lily fights Blackbeard during the final confrontation in the fairy kingdom. At the film's conclusion, he joins Peter and Tiger Lily in rescuing other children including Peter's confidant Nibs from Peter's old orphanage back in London. Hook in this film is different from the original character, and is portrayed as a pioneer-era American without any connection with Eton, Blackbeard, or piracy in general.\n\"Come Away\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Come Away\", portrayed by David Gyasi. This version is a ruthless pawnbroker and lower crime lord who is the son of the Mad Hatter, the paternal grandfather of Alice and Peter Pan, making CJ their paternal uncle and the paternal great-uncle of the Darling children, Wendy, Michael and John. CJ takes care of his father who is showing senility and thus only recognizes Jack; Alice and Peter's father as his son who CJ has always resented having grown up in his older brother's shadow. He also seems to blame Jack for the death of David who CJ seemed to view as his favorite nephew, so when Jack comes to his brother to help call off various debt collectors, CJ showing loyalty to his crime lord superiors crushes Jack's right hand leaving it to be amputated. Peter in response seeks out a group of street urchins to then rob his uncle of the gold coins he's safe guarding for the various criminal underworld factions before cutting off CJ's left hand in a sword duel (when CJ catches them in the act) before fleeing to parts unknown pursued by CJ and his cohorts.\n\"Wendy\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Wendy\", portrayed by Kevin Pugh, with Gavin Naquin portraying his younger self. Wendy here is the youngest to two twin older brothers James and Douglas, who are taken to Neverland by Peter, who here is made ageless after a deity saved him from a disaster that killed his family by sharing her powers with him making him untouched by time. This deity who is known as \"mother\" stops the kids who dwell there from growing up provided they retain faith in her otherwise she lets them rapidly ages into middle age adults. When Douglas seems to drown James starts losing faith, finding his right hand start to age prematurely prompting Peter to amputate it, but despite this James continues to grow old and rallies the other adults to kill and consume \"mother\" in an effort to retain their lost youth with a restored fishing boat. When Wendy discovers Douglas survived from seemingly drowning both help Peter revive \"mother\" after she is harpooned and temporary dies. James now with a makeshift hook in place of his right hand can no longer return home with his siblings and their friends, so stays to play with Peter as his new \"enemy\" Captain Hook, thereby allowing him to live out the rest of his days with the spirit of a child.\n\"Lost Girls\".\nIain Glen plays Hook in the 2022 film \"The Lost Girls\".\n\"Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare\", portrayed by Charity Kase. In the film, he was abducted by Peter 15 years ago, and is depicted as a heavily mutilated individual, chained and his hand replaced with a hook.\nIn television.\n\"Peter Pan (1976 musical)\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan\" (1976), portrayed by Danny Kaye.\n\"Peter Pan \u2013 The Animated Series (no boken)\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"\", voiced by Chikao Ohtsuka. This version's personality is far closer to the original character from Barrie's novel. Apart from wanting to destroy Pan, he is also eager to become Neverland's first king. Hook has a second hook-hand which resembles a crab claw.\n\"Peter Pan and the Pirates\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan and the Pirates\", voiced by Tim Curry. This version harkens closer to the original depiction of the character, being ruthless and cunning.\n\"Funky Fables\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Funky Fables\", voiced by Garry Chalk.\n\"The Children's Party at the Palace\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Children's Party at the Palace\", portrayed by Anthony Head.\n\"Once Upon a Time\".\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Once Upon a Time\", portrayed by Colin O'Donoghue.\nHook is born Killian Jones, who becomes captain of the Jolly Roger after his brother's death. His hand is cut off by the dark trickster Rumpelstiltskin as revenge for Hook running away with his wife. In order to find a way to kill Rumplestiltskin, Hook travels to Neverland, where he spends over 100 years before escaping back to the Enchanted Forest. Hook teams up with Cora, the Queen of Hearts, and they travel to the Land Without Magic after the curse is broken.\n\"Neverland\" (TV miniseries).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Neverland\", portrayed by Rhys Ifans. He is introduced as \"Jimmy\", a fencing teacher and leader of a small group of juvenile pickpockets including Peter Pan with whom he has developed a father-son relationship (that over time shatters completely due to events in Neverland culminating in the demise of Peter's confidant). Jimmy is seeking a mysterious orb, which Peter and his gang have discovered unbeknownst to him. In the course of the miniseries, \"Jimmy\" in avertedly causes Peter's right hand boy to die, where it is then revealed that \"Jimmy\" actually killed Peter's father because he was in love with Peter's mother, with the watch that Hook owns having once belonged to Peter's father; the watch is lost with Hook's hand in their final confrontation when the crocodile swallows both.\n\"Peter Pan Live!\" (2014 TV special).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter Pan Live!\", portrayed by Christopher Walken. Compared to the 1954 musical on which it was based, this show sought to \"strengthen and deepen\" the portrayal of Captain Hook. Hook and his pirate crew perform songs from the original musical, such as \"Hook's Tango\", in addition to new songs such as \"Vengeance\" and \"Only Pretend\".\n\"Peter and Wendy\" (2015 TV film).\nCaptain Hook appears in \"Peter and Wendy\", portrayed by Stanley Tucci. Hook is shown to be just as being somewhat equally na\u00efve as Peter Pan; since this disliking of children is due to his own somewhat turbulent childhood; where he was sent away to Eton by an unloving family so therefore in some ways he needs Wendy as much as Peter. He even reads out aloud to crewmembers his recounts of his hated school days but still refuses to believe his family didn't love him. He is shown to punish his crew for the slightest infractions killing one for accidentally spitting on his boots. Culminating in an ending similar to the book, only this time the crocodile drags him through an opening after bursting through the bottom hull to seize him, with said hook breaking off while James uses it to cling to the side of the hull.\nIn literature.\n\"Peter Pan in Scarlet\".\nGeraldine McCaughrean's authorized sequel to \"Peter Pan\" gives Peter a new nemesis, while bringing back the old favourite.\nRavello, a circus man in a constantly ragged woollen coat, volunteers to become Peter's valet in the search for the treasure. Ravello provides a red coat (that formerly belonged to Hook) and a bad influence, influencing Peter increasingly to become more and more like Captain Hook. He sees himself not as a living person; he never sleeps and eats only eggs. He is revealed in the middle of the book to be the old James Hook, who escaped the crocodile when the animal's stomach contractions broke the vial of poison Hook kept with him at all times. The poison killed the crocodile, and Hook used his hook to claw his way out, but he was mutated by the stomach acid into an uglier man with a scarred visage\u2014vastly different in appearance from the noble pirate. He then assumed a new identity of Ravello, owner of a travelling circus, complete with lions, tigers, and bears.\nA clue to Ravello's true identity is given when one of the Lost Boys asks Ravello his name: he thinks for a while as if trying to remember, and finally says the name his mother gave him was Crichton, but that names given by mothers don't mean anything.\n\"Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth\".\nAccording to the 2007 novel \"Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth\", Captain Hook was the illegitimate son of a nobleman, \"Lord B\", and an unnamed woman Hook has never met (implied to be the Queen). Disowned by Lord B., James Matthew is reared by a Shakespearean actress he calls Aunt Emily, and unwillingly attends Eton College as an Oppidan scholar, where he is an avid reader of Shakespeare and Shelley, and his motto is \"Knowledge is Power\". He describes many things as first-rate \u2013 \"Topping Swank\", and punctuates his sentences with \"The End\". He is very interested in the French Revolution.\nIn the novel, James has only a few friends including Roger Peter Davies, whom he nicknames \"Jolly Roger\" (the name of his ship in later life), and the spider \"Electra\". A seventeen-year-old Colleger, Arthur Darling (named after Arthur Llewelyn Davies) is his rival in studies, fencing, sports, and the attentions of the visiting Ottoman Sultana Ananova Ariadne. When James successfully woos Ananova, their affection sets off political outrage that affects the noble position of Lord B., who arranges for James to leave Eton on his trading ship, the \"Sea Witch\". Upon leaving, James defeats Arthur in a final duel and burns his own school records to leave no traces of his behaviour. On the \"Sea Witch\", he befriends boatswain Bartholomew Quigley Smeethington, generally called Smee, frees the slaves aboard ship, overthrows the ship's captain (killed by Electra), and murders the quartermaster with a metal hook.\nThroughout \"Capt. Hook\", author J.V. Hart relates events in James Matthew Barrie's life and the lives of the Llewellyn Davies children. The narrative expands upon details of Barrie's original play and novel but ascribes James's unusual colouring and yellow blood to a blood disorder, makes James's long dark hair natural, rather than the usual wig, and has James titled \"Hook\" after murdering the quartermaster of the \"Sea Witch\", rather than in reference to his prosthetic hand.\n\"Peter and the Starcatchers\".\nIn the novel \"Peter and the Starcatchers\" by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, Captain Hook is distinguished by halitosis, beady black eyes, a pock-marked face, and perpetual filth of his person and surroundings contrasting strongly with J. M. Barrie's Etonian gentleman. The novel, which takes place before the Captain meets Peter Pan, calls Hook \"Black Stache\" for his prominent moustache, and his ship is called the \"Sea Devil\"; he captures the \"Jolly Roger\", originally a British ship called the \"Wasp\", later. Black Stache is renamed \"Captain Hook\" in the second instalment, \"Peter and the Shadow Thieves\". In Barry and Pearson's book, his left hand is accidentally cut off by Peter.\nIn Rick Ellis' theatrical adaptation of the Barry-Pearson novel, Black Stache (portrayed in the original production by Christian Borle, who won a Tony Award for the role) is a witty, poetical, but psychotic pirate prone to malapropisms and the occasional pratfall. Similar to the Disney film character, Black Stache resembles both a dangerous villain and a comic buffoon. The last of a line of villains, he seeks to become a great villain by fighting a great hero, and finds one in Peter. His hand is cut off not by Peter, but accidentally severed when he slams the lid of a trunk in a fit of rage.\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean\".\nOne of conceptual consultant James Ward Byrkit's concept art for the 2007 film \"\" showed a pirate similar to Captain Hook as one of the Pirate Lords of the Brethren Court.\nIn A. C. Crispin's 2011 novel ', during a conversation between Captain Teague and Pirate Lord Don Rafael: \"You'll never guess who I encountered at Oporto a few months ago. [...] James. [...] He's lost a hand. [...] he said it wasn't so bad, the hook was as good as a dagger in a fight. [...] He didn't look a day older, not a day. [...] James was a lot more...subdued. [...] The taberna keeper's little lad came round to collect our plates, and when he turned and saw he, for just a second he looked\u2014scared. No, worse than that. Terrified. [...] Can you imagine that? Afraid! Of a young boy!\" It was confirmed by the author Crispin that \"James\" is indeed Captain Hook from J.M. Barrie's \"Peter Pan\". Crispin figured that since the \"Pirates\" franchise had a couple Disney \"in\" jokes (such as Gillette's comment about \"a little mermaid\" in '), that she'd include the mention of \"James\" as a joke.\nIn theatre.\n\"Peter Pan\" (1950 musical).\nIn Leonard Bernstein's musical version, Boris Karloff starred as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook and Jean Arthur played Peter.\n\"Peter Pan\" (1954 musical).\nMost notably, Cyril Ritchard played Captain Hook in the 1954 musical adaptation which starred Mary Martin as Peter Pan. George Rose played the role in the 1977 revival which featured Sandy Duncan as Pan.\n\"Finding Neverland\" (2012 musical).\nThe role of Captain Hook in the musical adaptation of \"Finding Neverland\" is played by the same actor playing Charles Frohman. The role was originated in Leicester by Oliver Boot. In the American Repertory Theater try out the role was played by Michael McGrath. Kelsey Grammer originated the role in the Broadway cast and replacements for the role in the production include Anthony Warlow, Terrence Mann, and Marc Kudisch. Tom Hewitt played the role in the first US national tour.\nOther.\n2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.\nAlongside other inflatable villains such as Lord Voldemort, the Queen of Hearts, Cruella de Vil, and The Child Catcher, Captain Hook made an appearance during the opening ceremony of the XXX Olympiad in London, representing one of the villains of British children's literature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Roy Disney (chairman of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in that moment), working closely with Disney Television's Los Angeles-based senior vice president, Barry Blumberg, and executive producers Roberts Gannaway and Tony Craig, created an opening sequence in which music would be played by the characters, similar to the early \"Mickey Mouse\" cartoons. Production began in January 1998, and \"Mickey Mouse Works\", a weekly half-hour series scheduled to premiere in January 1999, was produced by an animation team assigned exclusively to create new adventures for Disney's most famous characters. \nThe first Disney television animated series to be produced in widescreen high definition, it is formatted as a variety show, with skits starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Ludwig Von Drake while other characters from the Mickey Mouse universe appear as supporting or minor characters. Musical themes for each character were composed by Stephen James Taylor with a live 12-piece band and extensive use of the fretless guitar to which the music of the series was nominated for an Annie Award in both 1999 and 2001. Most of the shorts from the series were later used in \"House of Mouse\".\nOverview.\nAs Mickey Mouse's first revival series, \"Mickey Mouse Works\" was produced to recreate the golden age of Disney's animated shorts featuring Disney's most popular characters. By using basic colors and the original sound effects, effort was put forth to capture the look and feel of \"classic\" Disney.\nEach half-hour episode consisted of various short cartoons that fell into three general types: 90-second gag cartoons, 7-and-a-half-minute character cartoons, and 12-minute \"Mouse Tales\" based on famous stories. The character-based segments also included \"Silly Symphonies\", carrying on the tradition of that series of theatrical shorts.\nThe gag shorts, which lasted 90 seconds each, were shown with the following umbrella titles:\nWith no established schedule or routine, \"Mickey Mouse Works\" was designed to look like one spontaneous flow. Adding to that feeling were the show's opening credits which ended differently each week, the only constant being an elaborate interruption from a spotlight-stealing Donald Duck.\nWhile most skits involved individual characters, some have Mickey, Donald and Goofy running a special service group. Most Goofy skits have him doing a \"how-to\" segment always accompanied by a narrator. Most Donald segments were about him trying to accomplish a certain task which never works out right, frustrating him. Some stories were set to a specific theme for a specific character, but with differing scenarios \u2013 for example, one set focused on Mickey seeking to rescue Minnie from Pete, against a different obstacle in each short, while another set focused on Pluto's efforts to get Mickey his paper while facing a different problem.\nLegacy.\nWhen the show was replaced by \"House of Mouse\" in January 2001, most of the \"Mouse Works\" segments were repeated there but the original \"Mickey Mouse Works\" format has never been seen again.\nFour of the gag cartoons were released theatrically with various Disney films during 1998 and 1999 and released to theaters as commercials for the show. The cartoons included:\nHome media.\nWhile the series has not seen an official VHS or DVD release, several shorts have been featured on other releases.\nIn April 2005, Disney released a DVD in European, Latin American and Asian territories entitled \"Mickey's Laugh Factory\", which contained nine selected shorts taken from this series as well as those from \"House of Mouse\" with jokes told by various children used as framing material. While some shorts have the \"Mickey Mouse Works\" title card background, others have the \"House of Mouse\" version (the \"Mouse Works\" version has various mechanics in the background including a Mickey-shaped one and one with the \"Mouse Works\" text inside it, but the \"House of Mouse\" version has various moving swirls). Cartoons include \"Hickory Dickory Mickey\", \"Mickey Tries to Cook\", \"Organ Donors\", \"Mickey's Airplane Kit\", \"Street Cleaner\", \"Mickey's New Car\", \"Bubble Gum\", \"Mickey's Big Break\" and \"Mickey's Mix-Up\".\nThe DVD \"Disney's Learning Adventures: Mickey's Seeing the World\" includes the cartoons \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" and \"Mickey's Mechanical House\" slightly abridged to fit in with the documentary nature of the DVD.\nOn November 11, 2008, the eighth wave of Walt Disney Treasures was released. One of the sets released in this wave, \"\", features a handful of Donald-centric shorts from both \"Mickey Mouse Works\" and \"House of Mouse\" as bonuses, including \"Bird Brained Donald\", \"Donald and the Big Nut\", \"Donald's Charmed Date\", \"Donald's Dinner Date\", \"Donald's Failed Fourth\", \"Donald's Rocket Ruckus\", \"Donald's Shell Shots\", \"Donald's Valentine Dollar\", \"Music Store Donald\" and \"Survival of the Woodchucks\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(sometimes called just Yum!) is an American multinational fast food corporation. It was formed in 1977 as a subsidiary of PepsiCo, after the company acquired KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. PepsiCo divested the brands in 1997, and these consolidated as Yum!. The company operates KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Habit Burger &amp; Grill, and several technology companies.\nYum! was founded as Tricon Global Restaurants after PepsiCo finalized the split. In 2002, it took its current name after they merged with Yorkshire Global Restaurants, which at the time was the parent company of A&amp;W, who also spun off an international branch. In China, the restaurant brands are operated by another company known as Yum China.\nBased in Louisville, Kentucky, Yum! is one of the world's largest fast food restaurant companies in terms of system units. In 2016, Yum! had 43,617 restaurants, including 2,859 that were company-owned and 40,758 that were franchised, in 135 nations and territories worldwide. Due to it being a spin-off of PepsiCo, all restaurants owned by this company do not serve Coca-Cola as a soft drink (except in certain markets such as Israel and New Zealand), and instead serve Pepsi.\nHistory.\nPepsiCo fast food division.\nThe company's history began in 1977, when PepsiCo entered the restaurant business by acquiring Pizza Hut from co-founders Dan and Frank Carney. A year later, PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell from founder Glen Bell. In July 1986, R. J. Reynolds sold KFC to PepsiCo to pay off debt from its recent purchase of Nabisco.\nIn 1990, Hot 'n Now was acquired via Taco Bell from William Van Domelen, but the company was sold in 1996. In 1992, PepsiCo acquired California Pizza Kitchen. In 1993, it acquired Chevys Fresh Mex, D'Angelo Grilled Sandwiches, and the American division of Canadian chain East Side Mario's. These chains were later sold when PepsiCo exited the restaurant business and spun off KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (see next paragraph). In 1997, PepsiCo sold PepsiCo Food Systems restaurant-supply unit to Ameriserve Food Distribution Inc.\nTricon Global Restaurants.\nYum! was created in 1997 as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies. The decision was announced in January and the spin off was effected on October 6. Before the Tricon name was introduced in June 1997, the company was referred to by the placeholder name \"Great American Restaurant Company\". Tricon selected Louisville, also the site of KFC's headquarters, as its corporate headquarters. Taco Bell and Pizza Hut continued to be headquartered in Irvine, California and Dallas, Texas, respectively.\nIn 2000, Tricon Global tested multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants, parent company of A&amp;W and Long John Silver's. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&amp;Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.\nIn 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called \"Wing Works\", a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. KFC also hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.\nTricon bought both A&amp;W and LJS from Grotech in March 2002, shortly before the merger announcement.\nYum! Brands.\nIn March 2002, Yorkshire announced it would merge with Tricon Global Restaurants to form Yum! Brands. The merger was finalized on May 8, 2002, and the name change became effective on May 22, 2002. Tricon had previously used \"YUM\", an exclamation representing enjoyment of food, as its stock ticker symbol since it was spun off in 1997. On June 6, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&amp;W Restaurants (which previously served Coca-Cola products) began switching to Pepsi products, with A&amp;W Restaurants retaining A&amp;W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Keurig Dr Pepper).\nIn 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers, and A&amp;W. The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.\nIn 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise. In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicized WingStreet's national launch.\nAn East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success. As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.\nInternational focus.\nIn January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to dispose of its Long John Silver's and A&amp;W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans. The foreign expansion\u2014particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut\u2014was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to dispose of the A&amp;W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&amp;W and Long John Silver's chains. A Great American Brand bought A&amp;W, and Long John Silver's was sold to LJS Partners LLC.\nIn May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion. The deal spent more than 4 months in antitrust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.\nIn 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut was also planned.\nIn India, Thailand, Nepal, and Nigeria, Yum! Brands operates primarily through its largest franchise partner, Devyani International Limited, which manages numerous KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell outlets.\nYum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.\nIn the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.\nIn 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop. Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas, a restaurant similar in format to Chick-fil-A, on April 9, 2014. In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company. A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.\nIn 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.\nIn January 2020, Yum! announced they were acquiring Irvine, California-based The Habit Burger Grill, for $375 million; the transaction was completed on March 18, 2020. The company was renamed Habit Burger &amp; Grill in 2024.\nIn 2020 and 2021, Yum! acquired several technology companies. In March 2020, it acquired Heartstyles, an omnichannel training company. In March 2021, it acquired Tictuk Technologies, an Israeli omnichannel ordering and marketing solutions provider, and announced it was acquiring Kvantum Inc., an artificial intelligence-based consumer insights and marketing technology company. In September 2021, Yum! completed the acquisition of Australian kitchen order management and delivery technology company Dragontail Systems for US$69.1 million in cash.\nIn December 2023, the company announced it will acquire 218 restaurants from its largest franchisee EG Group in the UK and Ireland. After completion in 2024, all of the privately owned EG Group's KFC UK and Ireland businesses will come under Yum's KFC UK and Ireland management.\nAnimal welfare.\nIn 2021, Yum! Brands committed to transitioning to 100% cage-free eggs in the majority of its locations by 2026, and globally by 2030.\nCorporate.\nThe current CEO of Yum! Brands is David Gibbs. Former CEOs include Greg Creed and David C. Novak. Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001. Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015. At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman. At the end of 2019 Greg Creed retired as CEO and the COO at that time (David Gibbs) was Creed's replacement and was promoted to CEO.\nSince 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.\nOn October 20, 2015, Yum! announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016. Yum China's operations excluded stores in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are franchised from Yum Brands through Jardine Matheson unit Jardine Pacific's Jardine Restaurant Group.\nBrands.\nCurrent.\nThe joint KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut outlets are colloquially called \"Ken-Taco-Huts\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had three brothers, Francis, Archibald, and James, and two sisters, Gertrude and Florence. He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father's succession in 1856, and on the latter's death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry. The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships \"Illustrious\" and \"Britannia\" at Portsmouth, and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864. He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871.\nIn 1864, Lord Queensberry entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, which he left two years later without taking a degree. He was more distinguished in sport, playing college cricket as well as running, hunting, and steeplechasing.\nHe married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866. They had four sons and a daughter; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery. She survived him to the age of 90, dying in 1935. Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893, but this marriage was annulled the following year.\nQueensberry sold the family seat of Kinmount in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, an action which further alienated him from his family.\nHis eldest son and heir apparent was Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig, who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister, the 5th Earl of Rosebery. Lord Drumlanrig died from a gunshot wound, unmarried and without children.\nDouglas's second son, Lord Percy Douglas (1868\u20131920), succeeded to the peerage instead. Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas, his third son, was a close friend of famous author and poet Oscar Wilde. Eventually it became known that Lord Alfred and Wilde had engaged in sexual intercourse on multiple occasions, severely damaging the reputation of both men and enraging Queensberry. Queensberry's efforts to end that relationship ultimately led to his famous dispute with Wilde, which would culminate in Wilde's eventual imprisonment, decline, and fall.\nQueensberry died, two months after a stroke, and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis, in his club room in Welbeck Street, west London, aged 55, nearly a year before Oscar Wilde's death. He wrote a poem starting with the words \"When I am dead cremate me.\" After cremation at Woking Crematorium, his ashes were buried at Kinmount in the Douglas Mausoleum outside Cummertrees Parish Church, a Church of Scotland.\nContributions to sports.\nQueensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast. In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club, now the Amateur Athletic Association of England, one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes to compete. The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches. The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry's sponsorship and are universally known as the \"Queensberry Rules\". These rules were eventually to govern the sport worldwide.\nHe was one of the first people to bring association football to Scotland, forming his own team\u2014called Kinmount\u2014of which he was captain to take on the Annan N.B. team in matches in 1868. As the Annan side wore red caps, the Kinmount side wore blue caps.\nA keen rider, Queensberry was also active in fox hunting and owned several successful race horses. As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865, and his last was at Sandown Park in 1883. He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870. He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a Grand National as a rider, a last-minute substitution on the victorious \"Old Joe\" keeping him out of the 1886 National. During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1872, Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. He served as such until 1880, when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the sovereign. Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist, he declared that he would not participate in any \"Christian tomfoolery\" and that his word should suffice. As a consequence neither he nor Charles Bradlaugh, who had also refused to take the oath after being elected to the House of Commons, were allowed to take their seats in parliament. This prompted an apology from the new prime minister, William Gladstone. Bradlaugh was re-elected four times by the constituents of Northampton until he was finally allowed to take his seat in 1886. Queensberry, however, was never again sent to parliament by the Scottish nobles.\nIn 1881, Queensberry accepted the presidency of the British Secular Union, a group that had broken away in 1877 from Bradlaugh's National Secular Society. That year he published a long philosophical poem, \"The Spirit of the Matterhorn\", which he had written in Zermatt in 1873 in an attempt to articulate his secularist views. In 1882, he was ejected from the theatre after loudly interrupting a performance of the play \"The Promise of May\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the Poet Laureate, because it included a villainous atheist in its cast of characters. Under the auspices of the British Secular Union, Queensberry wrote a pamphlet entitled \"The Religion of Secularism and the Perfectibility of Man\". The Union, always small, ceased to function in 1884.\nHis divorces, brutality, atheism, and association with the boxing world made Queensberry an unpopular figure in London high society. In 1893 his eldest son Francis was made a baron in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, thus giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Queensberry resented his son sitting in a chamber that had refused to admit him, leading to a bitter dispute between himself and both his son and the Earl of Rosebery, who had promoted Francis's ennoblement and who shortly thereafter became prime minister. Francis was killed in a shooting accident in 1894; the inquest returned an \"accidental death\" verdict, but his death may have been a suicide. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that \"snob queers like Rosebery\" had corrupted his sons, and held Rosebery responsible for Francis's death.\nDispute with Oscar Wilde.\nIn February 1895, angered by the apparent ongoing homosexual relationship between his son Alfred and Oscar Wilde,\nQueensberry left a calling card reading \"For Oscar Wilde, posing Somdomite [\"sic\"]\" at Wilde's club. Wilde sued for criminal libel, leading to Queensberry's arrest.\nThe trial opened at the Old Bailey on 3 April 1895 before Justice Richard Henn Collins amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. Queensberry's lawyers, headed by barrister Edward Carson, presented Wilde as a vicious older man who seduced innocent young boys into a life of degenerate homosexuality. Wilde dropped the libel case when Queensberry's lawyers informed the court that they intended to call several male prostitutes as witnesses to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. According to the Libel Act 1843, proving the truth of the accusation and a public interest in its exposure was a defence against a libel charge, and Wilde's lawyers concluded that the prostitutes' testimony was likely to do that. Queensberry won a counterclaim against Wilde for the expenses he had incurred from lawyers and private detectives in organizing his defence. Wilde was left bankrupt; his assets were later seized and sold at auction to pay the claim.\nQueensberry then sent the evidence collected by his detectives to Scotland Yard, which resulted in Wilde being charged and convicted of gross indecency under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 and sentenced to two years' hard labour, which he served (1895-1897). Upon release, Wilde immediately went into exile in France, his health and reputation destroyed.\nQueensberry died on 31 January 1900. Ten months later, Oscar Wilde died at the Hotel d'Alsace in Paris.\nScreen portrayals.\nQueensberry has been portrayed by a number of actors in later dramatisations of the Wilde-Alfred Douglas affair, notably:\nAn effeminately flamboyant caricature of him, voiced by Jim Rash, is featured as a main character in the Adult Swim cartoon \"Mike Tyson Mysteries\" in which he serves as a lifestyle coach to Mike Tyson.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the University of Oxford, he edited an undergraduate journal, \"The Spirit Lamp\", that carried a homoerotic subtext, and met Wilde, starting a close but stormy relationship. Douglas's father, John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, abhorred it and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal libel, but Queensberry produced witnesses who attested to the truth of his claim, and Wilde was later imprisoned. On his release, he briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they had separated by the time Wilde died in 1900. Douglas married a poet, Olive Custance, in 1902 and had a son, Raymond.\nOn converting to Catholicism in 1911, he repudiated homosexuality, and in a Catholic magazine, \"Plain English\", expressed openly antisemitic views, but rejected the policies of Nazi Germany. He was jailed for libelling Winston Churchill over claims of World War I misconduct. Douglas wrote several books of verse, some in a homoerotic Uranian genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" appears in one (), though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.\nEarly life and background.\nDouglas was born at Ham Hill House in Powick, Worcestershire, the third son of John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery. He was born on 22 October 1870.\nHis nickname derived from his mother's habit of calling him \"Boysie\", a West Country diminutive meaning \"little boy\", which was eventually shortened to \"Bosie.\" This was a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life. His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery. The Marquess later married Ethel Weeden in 1893, but the marriage was annulled the following year.\nDouglas was educated at Wixenford School, Winchester College (1884\u201388) and Magdalen College, Oxford (1889\u201393), which he left without obtaining a degree. At Oxford, he edited an undergraduate journal, \"The Spirit Lamp\" (1892\u201393), an activity that intensified the constant conflict between him and his father. Their relationship had always been strained, and during the Queensberry\u2013Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with George Cecil Ives.\nIn 1858, his grandfather, Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry, had died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but was widely believed to have been suicide. In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to Catholicism and took her children to live in Paris. One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister \"Florrie\" (Lady Florence Douglas) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie. In 1885, Lord James tried to abduct a young girl, and after that, he became ever more manic; in 1888, he made a disastrous marriage. Separated from Florrie, James drank himself into a deep depression, and in 1891 committed suicide by cutting his throat. Another of his uncles, Lord Francis Douglas (1847\u20131865), had died in a climbing accident on the Matterhorn. His uncle, Lord Archibald Edward Douglas (1850\u20131938), became a clergyman. Alfred Douglas's aunt, Lord James's twin Lady Florence Dixie (1855\u20131905), was an author, war correspondent for the \"Morning Post\" during the First Boer War, and a feminist. In 1890, she published a novel, \"Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900\", in which women's suffrage is achieved after a woman posing as a man named Hector D'Estrange is elected to the House of Commons. The character D'Estrange is clearly based on Oscar Wilde.\nRelationship with Wilde.\nIn 1891, Lionel Johnson brought Douglas to the home of Oscar Wilde in Tite Street, Chelsea, for afternoon tea. Wilde took an interest in Douglas but it was six months before they became intimate and their affair began. In 1894, the Robert Hichens novel \"The Green Carnation\" was published, a \"roman \u00e0 clef\" depicting satirically Douglas's dependent relationship on Wilde.\nDouglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on boys and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would always be reconciled.\nDouglas had praised Wilde's play \"Salome\" in the Oxford magazine \"The Spirit Lamp\", of which he was editor. Wilde had originally written \"Salom\u00e9\" in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher John Lane and the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley when they themselves objected to the poor standard of Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to Robbie Ross: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but in a gesture of reconciliation suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than be credited, along with him, on the title page. Accepting this, Douglas, likened the difference between sharing the title page and having a dedication to \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".\nIn 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.\nOn another occasion, while staying with Wilde in Brighton, Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill having caught influenza in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the luxurious Grand Hotel and on Wilde's 40th birthday sent him a letter informing him that he had charged Wilde with the hotel bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for blackmail.\nAlfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies.\" Alfred responded with a telegram reading: \"What a funny little man you are.\"\nQueensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.\nQueensberry was well known for his short temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".\nIn answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother so as not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime... You must be demented.\"\nDouglas's eldest brother Francis Viscount Drumlanrig died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, as rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the future Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial. The Marquess and a bodyguard confronted Wilde in Wilde's home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde on the first night of \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", but forewarned of this, Wilde was able to deny him access to the theatre.\nQueensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving at the latter's club a visiting card on which he had written, \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite [\"sic\"]\". The wording is in dispute \u2013 the handwriting is unclear \u2013 although Hyde reports it as this. According to Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.\n1895 trials.\nWith Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as Robbie Ross, Frank Harris and George Bernard Shaw, Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal libel in a private prosecution, as sodomy was then a criminal offence. According to the libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was true but also that there was a public interest in having made the charge public. Edward Carson, Queensberry's lawyer, portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who preyed upon naive young boys and with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced as evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was questioned closely on the homoerotic themes in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and \"The Chameleon\", a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed \"Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young\".\nQueensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time meant that Wilde was responsible for Queensberry's considerable legal costs which, along with other debts, left him bankrupt. Based on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal sodomy and \"gross indecency\", a crime capable of being committed only by two men, which might include sexual acts other than sodomy.\nDouglas's September 1892 poem \"\" (published in the Oxford magazine \"The Chameleon\" in December 1894) was used against Wilde at the latter's trial. It ends with the famous line that refers to male homosexuality as \"the love that dare not speak its name\", which is often attributed wrongly to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counter-productive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a hung jury.\nIn 1895, when Wilde was released on bail during his trials, Douglas's cousin Sholto Johnstone Douglas stood surety for \u00a3500 of the bail money. The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' hard labour, first at Pentonville, then Wandsworth, then famously in Reading Gaol. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled \"De Profundis\", describing how he felt about him. Wilde was not permitted to send it but it might have been sent to him after Wilde's release. It was given to Robbie Ross with instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotations and did not know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde on which Ross had consulted. After Wilde's release on 19 May 1897, the two reunited in August at Rouen but stayed together only a few months due to personal differences and various pressures on them.\nNaples and Paris.\nThe meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but they separated due to financial pressures and for other personal reasons. Wilde spent the rest of his life mainly in Paris; Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898. The cohabitation period in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually gained funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he gave him occasional sums. Wilde was still bankrupt when he died in 1900. Douglas served as chief mourner, but there was reportedly a graveside altercation between him and Robbie Ross that developed into a feud and foreshadowed the later litigation between the two former lovers of Wilde.\nMarriage.\nAfter Wilde's death, Douglas made a close friendship with Olive Custance, a bisexual heiress and poet. They married on 4 March 1902. Olive Custance was in a relationship with the writer Natalie Barney when she and Douglas first met. Barney and Douglas eventually became close friends and Barney was named godmother to their son, Raymond Wilfred Sholto Douglas, born on 17 November 1902.\nThe marriage grew stormy after Douglas became a Catholic in 1911. They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up her Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.\nRepudiation of Wilde.\nIn 1911, Douglas embraced Catholicism as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's \"De Profundis\" letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by Maud Allan against Noel Pemberton Billing in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play \"Salome\", of being part of a deliberate homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.\nDouglas also contributed to Billing's journal \"Vigilante\" as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem calling Margot Asquith one \"bound with Lesbian fillets\", while her husband Prime Minister Herbert gave Ross money. During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\", adding that he intensely regretted having met Wilde and helped him with the French translation of \"Salome\", which he called \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".\n\"Plain English\".\nIn 1920 Douglas founded a right-wing, Catholic, and deeply antisemitic weekly magazine called \"Plain English\", in which he collaborated with Harold Sherwood Spencer and initially Thomas William Hodgson Crosland. It claimed to succeed \"The Academy\", to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. \"Plain English\" ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".\nFrom August 1920 (issue No 8) \"Plain English\" began publishing a long series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch, whose title was taken from the fore-title of George Shanks's version of a fraudulent work, \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". \"Plain English\" advertised from issue 20 The Britons' second edition of Shank's version of the \"Protocols\". Douglas challenged the \"Jewish Guardian\", published by the League of British Jews, to take him to court, suggesting they refrained from doing so because they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made.\" The magazine suggested in 1921, \"We need a Ku Klux Klan in this country,\" but a promotion for \"Ostara\" magazine was generally not well received by readers.\nOther regular targets of the magazine included David Lloyd George, Alfred Viscount Northcliffe, H. G. Wells, Frank Harris, and Sinn F\u00e9in. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.\nFrom 25 December 1920 it began publishing notorious articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the Battle of Jutland that the British had broken their code, and that Winston Churchill had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from Ernest Cassel, who thereby profited. In May 1921 Douglas insinuated that Lord Kitchener had been murdered by Jews.\nDouglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921, after a row with Spencer. He then produced a short-lived, almost identical rival called \"Plain Speech\" in 1921 with Herbert Moore Pim. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"Herr Hittler\" (so spelt) and \"The German White Labour Party\".\nIn 1920 he adhered to the idea of \"the Jewish Peril\", but noted, \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race.\" In 1921 he declared it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews. In his 1929 \"Autobiography\" he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish,\" and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.\nThe historian Colin Holmes argued that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis. Politically Douglas described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".\nLibel actions.\nDouglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by gaining an apology and 50 guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines \"Isis\" and \"Cambridge\" for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.\nDouglas was plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or criminal libel. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. That same year he accused Arthur Ransome of libelling him in his book \"Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study\". He saw the trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit. Ransome removed the offending passages from the second edition.\nThe prime case was brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923. Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister of falsifying an official report on the Battle of Jutland in 1916, when although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British Navy had in fact been defeated, the supposed motive being that when the news was flashed, British security prices would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply; Churchill's alleged reward was a houseful of furniture valued at \u00a340,000. The allegations were made by Douglas in \"Plain English\" and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests, but by this time (after the failure of his Dardanelles Campaign) Churchill was unconnected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general noted in court on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqu\u00e9, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".\nIn 1924, while in prison, Douglas echoed Wilde's composition of \"De Profundis\" (From the Depths) during his incarceration and wrote his last major poetic work, \"In Excelsis\" (In the Highest) in 17 cantos. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him on his release, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.\nLater life.\nDouglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften after Douglas's own incarceration in 1924. He wrote in \"Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up\", \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery.\" In 1933 he gave a talk about poetry to the Catholic Poetry Society on 'The Catholic attitude to certain poets.' Of Wilde, Douglas said: 'Many years [after Wilde's death] and after I had become a Catholic, I reacted violently against him...Converts are very apt to be censorious and to be more Catholic than Catholics...I hope I am now more charitable and broad-minded than I was...After swinging to two extremes in my estimate of Wilde I have now got into what I believe to be the happy mean.' Similarly, in 1935 he wrote to the theatre manager Norman Marshall regarding Marshall's proposed production of a play about the Wilde scandal, closing his letter, 'Devoted as I still am and always will be to the memory of this brilliant and wonderful man and conscious as I am and always shall be about my own failings...Wilde was the author of what I consider to be, apart from Shakespeare, the finest comedy in the English language.'\nThroughout the 1930s and up to his death, Douglas kept up correspondence with many people, including Marie Stopes and George Bernard Shaw. Anthony Wynn based his play \"Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship\" on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was a well-received lecture to the Royal Society of Literature on 2 September 1943 on \"The Principles of Poetry\", published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of T. S. Eliot; the talk was praised by Arthur Quiller-Couch and Augustus John.\nHarold Nicolson described his impression of Douglas after meeting him at a lunch party in 1936: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is a little trace of his good looks left. His nose has assumed a curious beaklike shape, his mouth has twisted into shapes of nervous irritability, and his eyes, although still blue, are yellow and bloodshot. He makes nervous and twitching movements with freckled and claw-like hands. He stoops slightly and drags a leg. Yet behind this appearance of a little, cross, old gentleman flits the shape of a young man of the 'nineties, with little pathetic sunshine-flashes of the 1893 boyishness and gaiety. I had fully expected the self-pity, suspicion and implied irritability, but I had not foreseen that there would be any remnant of merriment and boyishness. Obviously the great tragedy of his life has scarred him deeply. He talked very frankly about his marriage and about his son, who is in a home at Northampton.\nProfessor, tattoo artist and pornographer Samuel Steward wrote in his diary that he met Lord Alfred Douglas when Douglas was 67; Steward was 27. Douglas professed that he was beyond \"sins of the flesh,\" yet he ended up in bed with Steward. Douglas claimed that Wilde and he did little more than kiss and find other men for each other.\nDouglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed in 1927, at the age of 24, with schizoaffective disorder and entered St Andrew's Hospital, a mental institution. Though decertified and discharged after five years, he suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a cerebral haemorrhage at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral, and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated, and he again returned to St Andrew's in November, where he stayed until his death on 10 October 1964.\nDeath.\nDouglas died of congestive heart failure in Lancing, West Sussex, on 20 March 1945 at the age of 74. He was buried on 23 March at the Franciscan Friary, Crawley, alongside his mother, who had died on 31 October 1935 at the age of 90. They share a gravestone.\nThe elderly Douglas, living a reduced life in Hove in the 1940s, appears in the diaries of Henry Channon and in the first autobiography of Donald Sinden, whose son Marc Sinden claimed his father was one of only two people at the funeral. In fact the funeral report in \"The Times\" named some 20 mourners, including Sinden, with \"other friends\". He died at the home of Edward and Sheila Colman, who were the main beneficiaries in his will, inheriting the copyright to his work.\nWritings.\nDouglas published several volumes of poetry and two books about his relationship with Wilde, \"Oscar Wilde and Myself\" (1914, largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, assistant editor of the literary journal \"The Academy\" and later repudiated by Douglas) and \"Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up\" (1940). He also wrote two memoirs: \"The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas\" (1929) and \"Without Apology\" (1938).\nDouglas edited \"The Academy\" from 1907 to 1910, during which time he had an affair with the artist Romaine Brooks, who was also bisexual. The main love of her life, Natalie Clifford Barney, also had an affair with Wilde's niece Dorothy and even, in 1901, with Douglas's future wife Olive Custance, the year before the couple married.\nOf the six biographies of Douglas, the earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were forbidden to quote from his copyright work, while \"De Profundis\" was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, H. Montgomery Hyde (who also wrote about Wilde), Douglas Murray (who called Braybrooke's biography \"a rehash and exaggeration of Douglas's book\" [his autobiography]). The most recent is \"Alfred Douglas: A Poet's Life and His Finest Work\" by Caspar Wintermans in 2007.\nIn 1999, The University of Oxford established the Lord Alfred Douglas Memorial Prize for \"...the best sonnet or other poem written in English and in strict rhyming metre.\" The award was established by Douglas's friend Sheila Colman, who, on her death, left a legacy of $36,000 to fund the award.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the films \"Oscar Wilde\" and \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\", both released in 1960, Douglas was portrayed by John Neville and John Fraser respectively. In the 1997 British film \"Wilde\", Douglas was portrayed by Jude Law.

He eschewed sentimentality and moral allusion in painting and was a leading proponent of the credo \"art for art's sake\".\nHis signature for his paintings took the shape of a stylized butterfly with an added long stinger for a tail. The symbol combined both aspects of his personality: his art is marked by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music, and entitled many of his paintings \"arrangements\", \"harmonies\", and \"nocturnes\", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous painting, \"Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1\" (1871), commonly known as \"Whistler's Mother\", is a revered and often parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his aesthetic theories and his friendships with other leading artists and writers.\nEarly life.\nHeritage.\nJames Abbott Whistler was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on July 10, 1834, the first child of Anna McNeill Whistler and George Washington Whistler, and the elder brother of Confederate surgeon William McNeill Whistler.\nIn later years, Whistler played up his mother's connection to the American South and its roots, and he presented himself as an impoverished Southern aristocrat, although it remains unclear to what extent he truly sympathized with the Southern cause during the American Civil War. He adopted his mother's maiden name after she died, using it as an additional middle name.\nNew England.\nHis father was a railroad engineer, and Anna was his second wife. James lived the first three years of his life in a modest house at 243 Worthen Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. The house is now the Whistler House Museum of Art, a museum dedicated to him. He claimed St. Petersburg, Russia as his birthplace during the Ruskin trial: \"I shall be born when and where I want, and I do not choose to be born in Lowell.\"\nWhistler was a moody child, prone to fits of temper and insolence, and he often drifted into periods of laziness after bouts of illness. His parents discovered that drawing often settled him down and helped focus his attention.\nThe family moved from Lowell to Stonington, Connecticut in 1837, where his father worked for the Stonington Railroad. Three of the couple's children died in infancy during this period. Their fortunes improved considerably in 1839 when his father became chief engineer for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, and the family built a mansion in Springfield, Massachusetts, where the Wood Museum of History now stands. They lived in Springfield until they left the United States for Russia in late 1842.\nRussia and England.\nIn 1842, his father was recruited by Nicholas I of Russia to design a railroad in Russia. The Emperor learned of George Whistler's ingenuity in engineering the Canton Viaduct for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, and he offered him a position engineering the Saint Petersburg-Moscow Railway. The rest of the family moved to St. Petersburg to join him in the winter of 1842/43.\nAfter moving to St. Petersburg, the young Whistler took private art lessons, then enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Arts at age eleven. The young artist followed the traditional curriculum of drawing from plaster casts and occasional live models, revelled in the atmosphere of art talk with older peers, and pleased his parents with a first-class mark in anatomy. In 1844, he met the noted artist Sir William Allan, who came to Russia with a commission to paint a history of the life of Peter the Great. Whistler's mother noted in her diary, \"the great artist remarked to me 'Your little boy has uncommon genius, but do not urge him beyond his inclination.'\"\nIn 1847\u20131848, his family spent some time in London with relatives, while his father stayed in Russia. Whistler's brother-in-law Francis Haden, a physician who was also an artist, spurred his interest in art and photography. Haden took Whistler to visit collectors and to lectures and gave him a watercolour set with instructions.\nWhistler already was imagining an art career. He began to collect books on art and he studied other artists' techniques. When his portrait was painted by Sir William Boxall in 1848, the young Whistler exclaimed that the portrait was \"very much like me and a very fine picture. Mr. Boxall is a beautiful colourist... It is a beautiful creamy surface, and looks so rich.\" In his blossoming enthusiasm for art, at fifteen, he informed his father by letter of his future direction, \"I hope, dear father, you will not object to my choice.\" His father, however, died from cholera at the age of 49, and the Whistler family moved back to his mother's home town of Pomfret, Connecticut.\nThe family lived frugally and managed to get by on a limited income. His art plans remained vague and his future uncertain. His cousin reported that Whistler at that time was \"slight, with a pensive, delicate face, shaded by soft brown curls ... he had a somewhat foreign appearance and manner, which, aided by natural abilities, made him very charming, even at that age.\"\nWest Point.\nWhistler was sent to Christ Church Hall School with his mother's hopes that he would become a minister. Whistler was seldom without his sketchbook and was popular with his classmates for his caricatures. However, it became clear that a career in religion did not suit him, so he applied to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where his father had taught drawing and other relatives had attended. He was admitted to the highly selective institution in July 1851 on the strength of his family name, despite his extreme nearsightedness and poor health history. However, during his three years there, his grades were barely satisfactory, and he was a sorry sight at drill and dress, known as \"Curly\" for his hair length which exceeded regulations. Whistler bucked authority, spouted sarcastic comments, and racked up demerits. Colonel Robert E Lee was the West Point Superintendent and, after considerable indulgence toward Whistler, he had no choice but to dismiss the young cadet. Whistler's major accomplishment at West Point was learning drawing and map making from American artist Robert W. Weir.\nHis departure from West Point seems to have been precipitated by a failure in a chemistry exam where he was asked to describe silicon and began by saying, \"Silicon is a gas.\" As he himself put it later: \"If silicon were a gas, I would have been a general one day\". However, a separate anecdote suggests misconduct in drawing class as the reason for Whistler's departure.\nFirst job.\nAfter West Point, Whistler worked as draftsman mapping the entire U.S. coast for military and maritime purposes. He found the work boring and he was frequently late or absent. He spent much of his free time playing billiards and idling about, was always broke, and although a charmer, had little acquaintance with women. After it was discovered that he was drawing sea serpents, mermaids, and whales on the margins of the maps, he was transferred to the etching division of the United States Coast Survey. He lasted there only two months, but he learned the etching technique that later proved valuable to his career.\nAt this point, Whistler firmly decided that art would be his future. For a few months he lived in Baltimore with a wealthy friend, Tom Winans, who furnished Whistler with a studio and some spending cash. The young artist made some valuable contacts in the art community and also sold some paintings to Winans. Whistler turned down his mother's suggestions for other more practical careers and informed her that with money from Winans, he was setting out to further his art training in Paris. Whistler never returned to the United States.\nArt study in France.\nWhistler arrived in Paris in 1855, rented a studio in the Latin Quarter, and quickly adopted the life of a bohemian artist. Soon he had a French girlfriend, a dressmaker named H\u00e9loise. He studied traditional art methods for a short time at the Ecole Imp\u00e9riale and at the atelier of Charles Gleyre. The latter was a great advocate of the work of Ingres, and impressed Whistler with two principles that he used for the rest of his career: that line is more important than color and that black is the fundamental color of tonal harmony. Twenty years later, the Impressionists would largely overthrow this philosophy, banning black and brown as \"forbidden colors\" and emphasizing color over form. Whistler preferred self-study and enjoying the caf\u00e9 life.\nWhile letters from home reported his mother's efforts at economy, Whistler spent freely, sold little or nothing in his first year in Paris, and was in steady debt. To relieve the situation, he took to painting and selling copies from works at the Louvre and finally moved to cheaper quarters. As luck would have it, the arrival in Paris of George Lucas, another rich friend, helped stabilize Whistler's finances for a while. In spite of a financial respite, the winter of 1857 was a difficult one for Whistler. His poor health, made worse by excessive smoking and drinking, laid him low.\nConditions improved during the summer of 1858. Whistler recovered and traveled with fellow artist Ernest Delannoy through France and the Rhineland. He later produced a group of etchings known as \"The French Set\", with the help of French master printer Auguste Del\u00e2tre. During that year, he painted his first self-portrait, \"Portrait of Whistler with Hat\", a dark and thickly rendered work reminiscent of Rembrandt. But the event of greatest consequence that year was his friendship with Henri Fantin-Latour, whom he met at the Louvre. Through him, Whistler was introduced to the circle of Gustave Courbet, which included Carolus-Duran (later the teacher of John Singer Sargent), Alphonse Legros, and \u00c9douard Manet.\nAlso in this group was Charles Baudelaire, whose ideas and theories of \"modern\" art influenced Whistler. Baudelaire challenged artists to scrutinize the brutality of life and nature and to portray it faithfully, avoiding the old themes of mythology and allegory. Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, one of the first to explore translation qualities among art and music, may have inspired Whistler to view art in musical terms.\nLondon.\nReflecting his adopted circle's banner of the Realism art movement, Whistler painted his first exhibited work, \"La M\u00e8re G\u00e9rard\" in 1858. He followed it by painting \"At the Piano\" in 1859 in London, which he adopted as his home, while also regularly visiting friends in France. \"At the Piano\" is a portrait composed of his niece and her mother in their London music room, an effort which clearly displayed his talent and promise. A critic wrote, \"[despite] a recklessly bold manner and sketchiness of the wildest and roughest kind, [it has] a genuine feeling for colour and a splendid power of composition and design, which evince a just appreciation of nature very rare amongst artists.\" The work is unsentimental and effectively contrasts the mother in black and the daughter in white, with other colors kept restrained in the manner advised by his teacher Gleyre. It was displayed at the Royal Academy the following year, and in many exhibits to come. Diana Seave Greenwald writes that \"At the Piano\" \"could have been inspired directly by \"The Concert\",\" a painting by Johannes Vermeer.\nIn a second painting executed in the same room, Whistler demonstrated his natural inclination toward innovation and novelty by fashioning a genre scene with unusual composition and foreshortening. It later was re-titled \"Harmony in Green and Rose: The Music Room\". This painting also demonstrated Whistler's ongoing work pattern, especially with portraits: a quick start, major adjustments, a period of neglect, then a final flurry to the finish.\nAfter a year in London, he produced a set of etchings in 1860 called \"Thames Set,\" as counterpoint to his 1858 \"French set,\" as well as some early impressionistic work including \"The Thames in Ice\". At this stage, he was beginning to establish his technique of tonal harmony based on a limited, predetermined palette.\nEarly career.\nIn 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, Whistler painted his first famous work, \"\". The portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins's \"The Woman in White\", a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner. In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a wolf skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the wolf's head staring menacingly at the viewer. The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but was shown in a private gallery under the title \"The Woman in White\". In 1863, it was shown at the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor Napoleon III for the exhibition of works rejected from the Salon.\nWhistler's painting was widely noticed, although upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting \"Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe\". Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was \"an apparition with a spiritual content\" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.\nTwo years later, Whistler painted another portrait of Hiffernan in white, this time displaying his newfound interest in Asian motifs, which he entitled \"\". His \"Lady of the Land Lijsen\" and \"The Golden Screen\", both completed in 1864, again portray his mistress, in even more emphatic Asian dress and surroundings.\nDuring this period Whistler became close to Gustave Courbet, the early leader of the French realist school, but when Hiffernan modeled in the nude for Courbet, Whistler became enraged and his relationship with Hiffernan began to fall apart.\nIn January 1864, Whistler's very religious and very proper mother arrived in London, upsetting her son's bohemian existence and temporarily exacerbating family tensions. As he wrote to Henri Fantin-Latour, \"General upheaval!! I had to empty my house and purify it from cellar to eaves.\" He also immediately moved Hiffernan to another location.\nFrom 1866, Whistler made his home in Chelsea, London, an area popular with artists, firstly in Cheyne Walk, then an ill-fated move to Tite Street, and finally Upper Church Street.\nMature career.\nNocturnes.\nIn 1866, Whistler decided to visit Valpara\u00edso, Chile, a journey that has puzzled scholars, although Whistler stated that he did it for political reasons. Chile was at war with Spain and perhaps Whistler thought it a heroic struggle of a small nation against a larger one, but no evidence supports that theory. What the journey did produce was Whistler's first three nocturnal paintings (which he originally termed \"moonlights\"): night scenes of the harbor painted with a blue or light green palette.\nAfter he returned to London, he painted several more nocturnes over the next ten years, many of the River Thames and of Cremorne Gardens, a pleasure park famous for its frequent fireworks displays, which presented a novel challenge to paint. In his maritime nocturnes, Whistler used highly thinned paint as a ground with lightly flicked color to suggest ships, lights, and shore line. Some of the Thames paintings also show compositional and thematic similarities with the Japanese prints of Hiroshige.\nIn 1872, Whistler credited his patron Frederick Leyland, an amateur musician devoted to Chopin, for his musically inspired titles.\nI say I can't thank you too much for the name 'Nocturne' as a title for my moonlights! You have no idea what an irritation it proves to the critics and consequent pleasure to me\u2014besides it is really so charming and does so poetically say all that I want to say and \"no more\" than I wish!\nAt that point, Whistler painted another self-portrait and entitled it \"Arrangement in Gray: Portrait of the Painter\" (c. 1872), and he also began to re-title many of his earlier works using terms associated with music, such as a \"nocturne\", \"symphony\", \"harmony\", \"study\" or \"arrangement\", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content. Whistler's nocturnes were among his most innovative works. Furthermore, his submission of several nocturnes to art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel after the Franco-Prussian War gave Whistler the opportunity to explain his evolving \"theory in art\" to artists, buyers, and critics in France.\nHis good friend Fantin-Latour, growing more reactionary in his opinions, especially in his negativity concerning the emerging Impressionist school, found Whistler's new works surprising and confounding. Fantin-Latour admitted, \"I don't understand anything there; it's bizarre how one changes. I don't recognize him anymore.\" Their relationship was nearly at an end by then, but they continued to share opinions in occasional correspondence.\nWhen Edgar Degas invited Whistler to exhibit with the first show by the Impressionists in 1874, Whistler turned down the invitation, as did Manet, and some scholars attributed this in part to Fantin-Latour's influence on both men.\nPortraits.\nThe Franco-Prussian War of 1870 fragmented the French art community. Many artists took refuge in England, joining Whistler, including Camille Pissarro and Claude Monet, while Manet and Degas stayed in France. Like Whistler, Monet and Pissarro both focused their efforts on views of the city, and it is likely that Whistler was exposed to the evolution of Impressionism founded by these artists and that they had seen his nocturnes. Whistler was drifting away from Courbet's \"damned realism\" and their friendship had wilted, as had his liaison with Joanna Hiffernan.\n\"Whistler's Mother\".\nBy 1871, Whistler returned to portraits and soon produced his most famous painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled \"Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1\", but usually referred to as \"Whistler's Mother\". A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned to his mother and suggested that he do her portrait. He had her stand at first, in his typically slow and experimental way, but that proved too tiring so the seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.\nThe austere portrait in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design is in fact a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture on the wall, and floor which stabilize the curve of her face, dress, and chair. Whistler commented that the painting's narrative was of little importance, yet the painting was also paying homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.\nThe public reacted negatively to the painting, mostly because of its anti-Victorian simplicity during a time in England when sentimentality and flamboyant decoration were in vogue. Critics thought the painting a failed \"experiment\" rather than a work of art. The Royal Academy rejected it, but then grudgingly accepted it after lobbying by Sir William Boxall\u2014but they hung it in an unfavorable location at their exhibition.\nFrom the start, \"Whistler's Mother\" sparked varying reactions, including parody, ridicule, and reverence, which have continued to today. Some saw it as \"the dignified feeling of old ladyhood\", \"a grave sentiment of mourning\", or a \"perfect symbol of motherhood\"; others employed it as a fitting vehicle for mockery. It has been satirized in endless variations in greeting cards and magazines, and by cartoon characters such as Donald Duck and Bullwinkle the Moose. Whistler did his part in promoting the picture and popularizing the image. He frequently exhibited it and authorized the early reproductions that made their way into thousands of homes. The painting narrowly escaped being burned in a fire aboard a train during shipping. It was ultimately purchased by the French government, the first Whistler work in a public collection, and is now housed in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris.\nDuring the Great Depression in the United States, the picture was billed as a \"million dollar\" painting and was a big hit at the 1933\u201334 Chicago World's Fair. It was accepted as a universal icon of motherhood by the worldwide public, which was not particularly aware of or concerned with Whistler's aesthetic theories. In recognition of its status and popularity, the United States issued a postage stamp in 1934 featuring an adaptation of the painting.\nIn 2015, \"New Yorker\" critic Peter Schjeldahl wrote that it \"remains the most important American work residing outside the United States.\" Martha Tedeschi writes:\n\"Whistler's Mother\", Wood's \"American Gothic\", Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" and Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" have all achieved something that most paintings\u2014regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value\u2014have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.\nOther portraits.\nOther important portraits by Whistler include those of Thomas Carlyle (historian, 1873), Maud Franklin (his mistress, 1876), Cicely Alexander (daughter of a London banker, 1873), Lady Meux (socialite, 1882), and Th\u00e9odore Duret (critic, 1884). In the 1870s, Whistler painted full-length portraits of his benefactor Frederick Leyland and his wife Frances. Leyland subsequently commissioned the artist to decorate his dining room (see Peacock Room below).\nWhistler had been disappointed over the irregular acceptance of his works for the Royal Academy exhibitions and the poor hanging and placement of his paintings. In response, Whistler staged his first solo show in 1874. The show was notable and noticed, however, for Whistler's design and decoration of the hall, which harmonized well with the paintings, in keeping with his art theories. A reviewer wrote, \"The visitor is struck, on entering the gallery, with a curious sense of harmony and fitness pervading it, and is more interested, perhaps, in the general effect than in any one work.\"\nWhistler was not so successful a portrait painter as the other famous expatriate American John Singer Sargent. Whistler's spare technique and his disinclination to flatter his sitters, as well as his notoriety, may account for this. He also worked very slowly and demanded extraordinarily long sittings. William Merritt Chase complained of his sitting for a portrait by Whistler, \"He proved to be a veritable tyrant, painting every day into the twilight, while my limbs ached with weariness and my head swam dizzily. 'Don't move! Don't move!' he would scream whenever I started to rest.\" By the time he gained widespread acceptance in the 1890s, Whistler was past his prime as a portrait painter.\nTechnique.\nWhistler's approach to portraiture in his late maturity was described by one of his sitters, Arthur J. Eddy, who posed for the artist in 1894:\nHe worked with great rapidity and long hours, but he used his colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours increased in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on from day to day and week to week, and often from month to month. ... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually\u2014light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.\nPrintmaking.\nWhistler produced numerous etchings, lithographs, and dry-points. His lithographs, some drawn on stone, others drawn directly on \"lithographie\" paper, are perhaps half as numerous as his etchings. Some of the lithographs are of figures slightly draped; two or three of the very finest are of Thames subjects\u2014including a \"nocturne\" at Limehouse; while others depict the Faubourg Saint-Germain in Paris, and Georgian churches in Soho and Bloomsbury in London.\nThe etchings include portraits of family, mistresses, and intimate street scenes in London and Venice. Whistler gained an enormous reputation as an etcher. Martin Hardie wrote \"there are some who set him beside Rembrandt, perhaps above Rembrandt, as the greatest master of all time. Personally, I prefer to regard them as the Jupiter and Venus, largest and brightest among the planets in the etcher's heaven.\" He took great care over the printing of his etchings and the choice of paper. At the beginning and end of his career, he placed great emphasis on cleanness of line, though in a middle period he experimented more with inking and the use of surface tone.\nButterfly signature and painting settings.\nWhistler's famous butterfly signature first developed in the 1860s out of his interest in Asian art. He studied the potter's marks on the china he had begun to collect and decided to design a monogram of his initials. Over time this evolved into the shape of an abstract butterfly. By around 1880, he added a stinger to the butterfly image to create a mark representing both his gentle, sensitive nature and his provocative, feisty spirit. He took great care in the appropriate placement of the image on both his paintings and his custom-made frames. His focus on the importance of balance and harmony extended beyond the frame to the placement of his paintings to their settings, and further to the design of an entire architectural element, as in the Peacock Room.\n\"The Peacock Room\".\n\"Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room\" is Whistler's masterpiece of interior decorative mural art. Painted in 1876\u20131877, it is now considered a high example of the Anglo-Japanese style.\nFrederick Leyland left the room in Whistler's care to make minor changes, \"to harmonize\" the room whose primary purpose was to display Leyland's china collection. He painted over the original paneled room designed by Thomas Jeckyll (1827\u20131881), in a unified palette of brilliant blue-greens with over-glazing and metallic gold leaf.\nWhistler let his imagination run wild, however: \"Well, you know, I just painted on. I went on\u2014without design or sketch\u2014putting in every touch with such freedom ... And the harmony in blue and gold developing, you know, I forgot everything in my joy of it.\" He completely painted over 16th-century Cordoba leather wall coverings first brought to Britain by Catherine of Aragon that Leyland had paid \u00a31,000 for.\nHaving acquired the centerpiece of the room, Whistler's painting of \"The Princess from the Land of Porcelain\", American industrialist and aesthete Charles Lang Freer purchased the entire room in 1904 from Leyland's heirs, including Leyland's daughter and her husband, the British artist Val Prinsep. Freer then had the contents of the \"Peacock Room\" installed in his Detroit mansion. After Freer's death in 1919, \"The Peacock Room\" was permanently installed in the Freer Gallery of Art at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The gallery opened to the public in 1923. A large painted caricature by Whistler of Leyland portraying him as an anthropomorphic peacock playing a piano, and entitled \"The Gold Scab: Eruption in Frilthy Lucre\" \u2013 a pun on Leyland's miserliness and fondness for frilly shirt fronts \u2013 is in the permanent collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.\nRuskin trial.\nIn 1877 Whistler sued the critic John Ruskin after the critic condemned his painting \"Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket\". Whistler exhibited the work in the Grosvenor Gallery, an alternative to the Royal Academy exhibition, alongside works by Edward Burne-Jones and other artists. Ruskin, who had been a champion of the Pre-Raphaelites and J. M. W. Turner, reviewed Whistler's work in his publication \"Fors Clavigera\" on July 2, 1877. Ruskin praised Burne-Jones, while he attacked Whistler:\nFor Mr. Whistler's own sake, no less than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsay [founder of the Grosvenor Gallery] ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of willful imposture. I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.\nWhistler, seeing the attack in the newspaper, replied to his friend George Boughton, \"It is the most debased style of criticism I have had thrown at me yet.\" He then went to his solicitor and drew up a writ for libel, which was served to Ruskin. Whistler hoped to recover \u00a31,000 plus the costs of the action. The case came to trial the following year after delays caused by Ruskin's bouts of mental illness, while Whistler's financial condition continued to deteriorate. It was heard in the Exchequer Division of the High Court on November 25 and 26, 1878, before Baron Huddleston and a special jury. Counsel for John Ruskin, Attorney General Sir John Holker, cross-examined Whistler:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHolker: \"What is the subject of \"Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket\"?\"\nWhistler: \"It is a night piece and represents the fireworks at Cremorne Gardens.\"\nHolker: \"Not a view of Cremorne?\"\nWhistler: \"If it were \"A View of Cremorne\" it would certainly bring about nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders. It is an artistic arrangement. That is why I call it \"a nocturne.\" ...\"\nHolker: \"Did it take you much time to paint the \"Nocturne in Black and Gold?\" How soon did you knock it off?\"\nWhistler: \"Oh, I 'knock one off' possibly in a couple of days \u2013 one day to do the work and another to finish it ...\" [the painting measures 24 3/4 x 18 3/8 inches]\nHolker: \"The labour of two days is that for which you ask two hundred guineas?\"\nWhistler: \"No, I ask it for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime.\"\nWhistler had counted on many artists to take his side as witnesses, but they refused, fearing damage to their reputations. The other witnesses for him were unconvincing and the jury's own reaction to the work was derisive. With Ruskin's witnesses more impressive, including Edward Burne-Jones, and with Ruskin absent for medical reasons, Whistler's counterattack was ineffective. Nonetheless, the jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler, but awarded a mere farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split. The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence (\"The White House\" in Tite Street, Chelsea, designed with E. W. Godwin, 1877\u20138), bankrupted him by May 1879, resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky notes the irony that the Fine Art Society of London, which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin's legal costs, supported him in etching \"The Stones of Venice\" (and in exhibiting the series in 1883), which helped recoup Whistler's costs.\nWhistler published his account of the trial in the pamphlet \"Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics\", included in his later \"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\" (1890), in December 1878, soon after the trial. Whistler's grand hope that the publicity of the trial would rescue his career was dashed as he lost rather than gained popularity among patrons because of it. Among his creditors was Leyland, who oversaw the sale of Whistler's possessions. Whistler made various caricatures of his former patron, including a biting satirical painting called \"The Gold Scab\", just after Whistler declared bankruptcy. Whistler always blamed Leyland for his financial downfall.\nLater years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \n\"It is always a delight to remember that actually once Mr. Whistler was really shy! Those who had the pleasure of hearing his first Ten O'Clock must remember that when he came before his rather puzzled and distinguished audience, there were a few minutes of very palpable stage fright.\" \u2013 Anna Lea Merritt\n\"The Life of James McNeill Whistler\", by E. R. and J. Pennell, Volume 2 (1908)\nAfter the trial, Whistler received a commission to do twelve etchings in Venice. He eagerly accepted the assignment, and arrived in the city with girlfriend Maud Franklin, taking rooms in a dilapidated palazzo they shared with other artists, including John Singer Sargent. Although homesick for London, he adapted to Venice and set about discovering its character. He did his best to distract himself from the gloom of his financial affairs and the pending sale of all his goods at Sotheby's. He was a regular guest at parties at the American consulate, and with his usual wit, enchanted the guests with verbal flourishes such as \"the artist's only positive virtue is idleness\u2014and there are so few who are gifted at it.\"\nHis new friends reported, on the contrary, that Whistler rose early and put in a full day of effort. He wrote to a friend, \"I have learned to know a Venice in Venice that the others never seem to have perceived, and which, if I bring back with me as I propose, will far more than compensate for all annoyances delays &amp; vexations of spirit.\" The three-month assignment stretched to fourteen months. During this exceptionally productive period, Whistler finished over fifty etchings, several nocturnes, some watercolors, and over 100 pastels\u2014illustrating both the moods of Venice and its fine architectural details.\nFurthermore, Whistler influenced the American art community in Venice, especially Frank Duveneck (and Duveneck's \"boys\") and Robert Blum who emulated Whistler's vision of the city and later spread his methods and influence back to America.\nBack in London, the pastels sold particularly well, and he quipped, \"They are not as good as I supposed. They are selling!\" He was actively engaged in exhibiting his other work but with limited success. Though still struggling financially, he was heartened by the attention and admiration he received from the younger generation of English and American painters who made him their idol and eagerly adopted the title \"pupil of Whistler\". Many of them returned to America and spread tales of Whistler's provocative egotism, sharp wit, and aesthetic pronouncements\u2014establishing the legend of Whistler, much to his satisfaction.\nIn January 1881, his mother Anna Whistler died. In her honour, he publicly adopted her maiden name McNeill as a middle name.\nIn February 1885, Whistler delivered a his https://, a major expression of his belief in \"art for art's sake\". At the time, the opposing Victorian notion reigned, namely, that art, and indeed much human activity, had a moral or social function. To Whistler, however, art was its own end and the artist's responsibility was not to society, but to himself, to interpret through art, and to neither reproduce nor moralize what he saw. Furthermore, he stated, \"Nature is very rarely right\", and must be improved upon by the artist, with his own vision.\nThough differing with Whistler on several points, including his insistence that poetry was a higher form of art than painting, Oscar Wilde was generous in his praise and hailed the lecture as a masterpiece:\nnot merely for its clever satire and amusing jests ... but for the pure and perfect beauty of many of its passages ... for that he is indeed one of the very greatest masters of painting, in my opinion. And I may add that in this opinion Mr. Whistler himself entirely concurs.\nWhistler, however, thought himself mocked by Oscar Wilde, and from then on, public sparring ensued leading to a total breakdown of their friendship, precipitated by a report written by Herbert Vivian. Later, Wilde \"symbolically murdered Whistler\", basing Basil Hallward, the murdered artist in his novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" on Whistler.\nWhistler joined the Society of British Artists in 1884, and on June 1, 1886, he was elected president. The following year, during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, Whistler presented to the Queen, on the Society's behalf, an elaborate album including a lengthy written address and illustrations that he made. Queen Victoria so admired \"the beautiful and artistic illumination\" that she decreed henceforth, \"that the Society should be called Royal.\" This achievement was widely appreciated by the members, but soon it was overshadowed by the dispute that inevitably arose with the Royal Academy of Arts. Whistler proposed that members of the Royal Society should withdraw from the Royal Academy. This ignited a feud within the membership ranks that overshadowed all other society business. In May 1888, nine members wrote to Whistler to demand his resignation. At the annual meeting on June 4, he was defeated for re-election by a vote of 18\u201319, with nine abstentions. Whistler and 25 supporters resigned, while the anti-Whistler majority (in his view) was successful in purging him for his \"eccentricities\" and \"non-English\" background.\nWith his relationship with Maud Franklin unraveling, Whistler suddenly proposed to Beatrice Godwin (also called Beatrix or Trixie), a former pupil and the widow of his late friend, architect Edward William Godwin. Through his friendship with Godwin, Whistler had become close to Beatrice, whom Whistler painted in the full-length portrait titled \"Harmony in Red: Lamplight\" (GLAHA 46315). By the summer of 1888 Whistler and Beatrice appeared in public as a couple. At a dinner Louise Jopling and Henry Labouch\u00e8re insisted that they should be married before the end of the week.\nThe marriage ceremony was quickly arranged; as a member of Parliament, Labouch\u00e8re arranged for the Chaplain to the House of Commons to marry the couple. No publicity was given to the ceremony to avoid the possibility of a furious Maud Franklin interrupting the marriage ceremony. The marriage took place on August 11, 1888, with the ceremony attended by a reporter from the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", so that the event received publicity. The couple left soon after for Paris, to avoid any risk of a scene with Maud.\nWhistler's reputation in London and Paris was rising and he gained positive reviews from critics and new commissions. His book \"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\" was published in 1890 with mixed success, but it afforded helpful publicity.\nIn 1890, he met Charles Lang Freer, who became a valuable patron in America, and ultimately his most important collector. Around this time, in addition to portraiture, Whistler experimented with early colour photography and with lithography, creating a series featuring London architecture and the human figure, mostly female nudes. He contributed the first three of his \"Songs of Stone\" lithographs to \"The Whirlwind,\" a Neo-Jacobite magazine published by his friend Herbert Vivian. Whistler had met Vivian in the late 1880s when both were members of the Order of the White Rose, the first of the Neo-Jacobite societies.\nIn 1891, with help from his close friend St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, \"Whistler's Mother\" was purchased by the French government for 4,000 francs. This was much less than what an American collector might have paid, but that would not have been so prestigious by Whistler's reckoning.\nAfter an indifferent reception to his solo show in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided he had had enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n\u00b0 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse.\nHe felt welcomed by his old Paris friends Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, and he set himself up a large studio. He was at the top of his career when it was discovered that his wife Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.\nIn 1899, Charles Freer introduced Whistler to his friend and fellow businessman Richard Albert Canfield, who became a personal friend and patron of Whistler's. Canfield owned a number of fashionable gambling houses in New York and Rhode Island, including Saratoga Springs and Newport, and was also a man of culture with refined tastes in art. He owned early American and Chippendale furniture, tapestries, Chinese porcelain and Barye bronzes, and possessed the second-largest and most important Whistler collection in the world prior to his death in 1914.\nIn May 1901, Canfield commissioned a portrait from Whistler; he started to pose for \"Portrait of Richard A. Canfield\" (YMSM 547) in March 1902. According to Alexander Gardiner, Canfield returned to Europe to sit for Whistler at the New Year in 1903, and sat every day until May 16, 1903. Whistler was ill and frail at this time and the work was his last completed portrait. The deceptive air of respectability that the portrait gave Canfield caused Whistler to call it 'His Reverence'. The two men were in correspondence from 1901 until Whistler's death. A few months before his own death, Canfield sold his collection of etchings, lithographs, drawings and paintings by Whistler to the American art dealer Roland F. Knoedler for $300,000. Three of Canfield's Whistler paintings hang in the Frick Museum in New York City.\nIn the final seven years of his life, Whistler did some minimalist seascapes in watercolor and a final self-portrait in oil. He corresponded with his many friends and colleagues. Whistler founded an art school in 1898, but his poor health and infrequent appearances led to its closure in 1901. He died in London on July 17, 1903, six days after his 69th birthday. He is buried in Chiswick Old Cemetery in west London, adjoining St Nicholas Church, Chiswick.\nWhistler was the subject of a 1908 biography by his friends, the husband-and-wife team of Joseph Pennell and Elizabeth Robins Pennell, printmaker and art critic respectively. The Pennells' vast collection of Whistler material was bequeathed to the Library of Congress. The artist's entire estate was left to his sister-in-law Rosalind Birnie Philip. She spent the rest of her life defending his reputation and managing his art and effects, much of which eventually was donated to Glasgow University.\nPersonal relationships.\nWhistler had a distinctive appearance, short and slight, with piercing eyes and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.\nWhistler had a high-pitched, drawling voice and a unique manner of speech, full of calculated pauses. A friend said, \"In a second you discover that he is not conversing\u2014he is sketching in words, giving impressions in sound and sense to be interpreted by the hearer.\"\nWhistler was well known for his biting wit, especially in exchanges with his friend and rival Oscar Wilde. Both were figures in the Caf\u00e9 society of Paris, and they were often the \"talk of the town\". They frequently appeared as caricatures in \"Punch\", to their mutual amusement. On one occasion, young Oscar Wilde attended one of Whistler's dinners, and hearing his host make some brilliant remark, apparently said, \"I wish I'd said that\", to which Whistler riposted, \"You will, Oscar, you will!\" In fact, Wilde did repeat in public many witticisms created by Whistler. Their relationship soured by the mid-1880s, as Whistler turned against Wilde and the Aesthetic Movement. When Wilde was publicly acknowledged to be a homosexual in 1895, Whistler openly mocked him.\nWhistler reveled in preparing and managing his social gatherings. As a guest observed:\nOne met all the best in Society there\u2014the people with brains, and those who had enough to appreciate them. Whistler was an inimitable host. He loved to be the Sun round whom we lesser lights revolved ... All came under his influence, and in consequence no one was bored, no one dull.\nIn Paris, Whistler was friends with members of the Symbolist circle of artists, writers and poets that included St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Marcel Schwob. Schwob had met Whistler in the mid-1890s through St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9; they had other mutual friends, including Oscar Wilde (until they argued) and Whistler's brother-in-law, Charles Whibley.\nWhistler was friendly with many French artists, including Henri Fantin-Latour, Alphonse Legros, and Gustave Courbet. He illustrated the book \"Les Chauves-Souris\" with Antonio de La Gandara. He also knew \u00c9douard Manet and the Impressionists, notably Claude Monet, and Edgar Degas. As a young artist, he was a close friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His close friendships with Monet and poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, who translated the \"Ten O'Clock\" lecture into French, helped strengthen respect for Whistler by the French public. Whistler was friendly with his fellow students at Gleyre's studio, including Ignace Schott, whose son Leon Dabo Whistler later would mentor.\nWhistler's lover and model for \"The White Girl\", Joanna Hiffernan, also posed for Gustave Courbet. Historians speculate that Courbet used her as the model for his erotic paintings \"Le Sommeil\" and \"L'Origine du monde\", possibly leading to the breakup of the friendship between Whistler and Courbet.\nDuring the 1870s and much of the 1880s, he lived with his model and mistress Maud Franklin. Her ability to endure long, repetitive sittings helped Whistler develop his portrait skills. He not only made several excellent portraits of her, but she was also a helpful stand-in for other sitters. Whistler had two daughters by Maud Franklin: Ione (born circa 1877) and Maud McNeill Whistler Franklin (born 1879). Maud sometimes referred to herself as 'Mrs. Whistler', and in the census of 1881 gave her name as 'Mary M. Whistler'.\nWhistler had several extramarital children, of whom Charles James Whistler Hanson (1870\u20131935) is the best documented. After Whistler parted from his mistress Joanna Hiffernan, she helped to raise Hanson, even though his mother was the parlour maid, Louisa Fanny Hanson.\nIn 1888, Whistler married Beatrice Godwin, whom he called Beatrix or Trixie. She was the widow of his friend E. W. Godwin, the architect who had designed Whistler's \"White House\", and the daughter of the sculptor John Birnie Philip and his wife Frances Black. Beatrix and her sisters Rosalind Birnie Philip and Ethel Whibley posed for many of Whistler's paintings and drawings; with Ethel Whibley modeling for \"\" (1888\u20131900). The first five years of their marriage were very happy, but her later life was a time of misery for the couple, due to her illness and eventual death from cancer. Near the end, she lay comatose much of the time, completely subdued by morphine, given for pain relief. Her death was a heavy blow Whistler never quite overcame.\nLegacy.\nWhistler was inspired by and incorporated many sources in his art, including the work of Rembrandt, Vel\u00e1zquez, and ancient Greek sculpture to develop his own highly influential and individual style. He was adept in many media, with over 500 paintings, as well as etchings, pastels, watercolors, drawings, and lithographs. Whistler was a leader in the Aesthetic Movement, promoting, writing, and lecturing on the \"art for art's sake\" philosophy. With his pupils, he advocated simple design, economy of means, the avoidance of over-labored technique, and the tonal harmony of the final result.\nWhistler has been the subject of many major museum exhibitions, studies, and publications. Like the Impressionists, he employed nature as an artistic resource. Whistler insisted that it was the artist's obligation to interpret what he saw, not be a slave to reality, and to \"bring forth from chaos glorious harmony\".\n\"Whistler was the single most depicted artist prior to the twentieth century; approximately one hundred artists portrayed him in over four hundred works.\" During his life, he influenced many artists throughout the English-speaking world. Whistler had significant contact and exchanged ideas and ideals with Realist, Impressionist, and Symbolist painters. The artist Walter Sickert was his pupil, and the writer Oscar Wilde was his friend. His Tonalism had a profound effect on many American artists, including John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, Henry Salem Hubbell, Willis Seaver Adams (whom he befriended in Venice) and Arthur Frank Mathews, whom Whistler met in Paris in the late 1890s and who took Whistler's Tonalism to San Francisco, spawning a broad use of that technique among turn-of-the-century California artists. Whistler was also a major influence on the 1880s Heidelberg School movement in Australia, otherwise known as Australian impressionism. As American critic Charles Caffin wrote in 1907:\nHe did better than attract a few followers and imitators; he influenced the whole world of art. Consciously or unconsciously, his presence is felt in countless studios; his genius permeates modern artistic thought.\nDuring a fourteen-month stay in Venice in 1879 and 1880, Whistler created a series of etchings and pastels that not only reinvigorated his finances (this was after he had declared bankruptcy following the Ruskin trial), but also re-energized the way in which artists and photographers interpreted the city\u2014focusing on the back alleys, side canals, entrance ways, and architectural patterns\u2014and capturing the city's unique atmospherics.\nIn 1940 Whistler was commemorated on a United States postage stamp when the U.S. Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps commemorating America's famous authors, poets, educators, scientists, composers, artists, and inventors: the Famous Americans Series.\nThe Gilbert and Sullivan operetta \"Patience\" pokes fun at the Aesthetic movement, and the lead character of Reginald Bunthorne is often identified as a send-up of Oscar Wilde, though Bunthorne is more likely an amalgam of several prominent artists, writers, and Aesthetic figures. Bunthorne wears a monocle and has prominent white streaks in his dark hair, as did Whistler.\nNovelist Henry James \"had become well enough acquainted with Whistler to base several fictional characters on the 'queer little Londonized Southerner,' most notably in \"Roderick Hudson\" and \"The Tragic Muse\"\". Whistler \"also appeared as one of Henry James's most attractive minor characters, the sculptor Gloriani in \"The Ambassadors\", whose personality, way of life, and even home are closely based on Whistler.\"\nGeorge du Maurier's 1894 novel \"Trilby\" has a character, Joe Sibley, \"the idle apprentice,\" who was meant to depict Whistler. \"Whistler threatened to sue, and in subsequent editions the character was replaced by another.\" Whistler was also the model for a character in Marcel Proust's novel, \"In Search of Lost Time\" \u2014 the painter Elstir.\nWhistler was the favorite artist of singer and actress Doris Day. She owned and displayed an original etching of Whistler's \"Rotherhithe\" and two of his original lithographs, \"The Steps, Luxembourg Gardens, Paris\" and \"The Pantheon, from the Terrace of the Luxembourg Gardens\".\nThe Lowell, Massachusetts, house in which Whistler was born is now preserved as the Whistler House Museum of Art. He is buried at St Nicholas Church, Chiswick.\nHonors.\nWhistler achieved worldwide recognition during his lifetime:\nA statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected in 2005 at the north end of Battersea Bridge on the River Thames in the United Kingdom.\nAuction records.\nOn October 27, 2010, Swann Galleries set a record price for a Whistler print at auction, when \"Nocturne\", an etching and drypoint printed in black on warm, cream Japan paper, 1879\u201380 sold for $282,000.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dedicated to the history of ice hockey, it holds exhibits about players, teams, National Hockey League (NHL) records, memorabilia and NHL trophies, including the Stanley Cup. Founded in Kingston, Ontario, the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 under the leadership of James T. Sutherland. The first class of honoured members was inducted in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL withdrew its support for the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario, due to funding issues. Its first permanent building opened at Exhibition Place in 1961. The hall was relocated in 1993, and is now in downtown Toronto, inside Brookfield Place, and a historic Bank of Montreal building. The Hockey Hall of Fame has hosted International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) exhibits and the IIHF Hall of Fame since 1998.\nAn 18-person committee of players, coaches and others meets annually in June to select new honourees, who are inducted as players, builders or on-ice officials. In 2010, a subcategory was established for female players. The builders' category includes coaches, general managers, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. Honoured members are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony held at the Hall of Fame building in November, which is followed by a special \"Hockey Hall of Fame Game\" between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team. As of May 2024[ [update]], 299 players (including ten women), 115 builders and 16 on-ice officials have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been criticized for focusing mainly on players from the National Hockey League and largely ignoring players from other North American and international leagues.\nHistory.\nThe Hockey Hall of Fame was established through the efforts of James T. Sutherland, a former president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA). Sutherland sought to establish it in Kingston, Ontario, as he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey. In 1943, the NHL and CAHA reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston. Originally called the \"International Hockey Hall of Fame\", its mandate was to honour great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first nine \"honoured members\" (players Hobey Baker, Charlie Gardiner, Eddie Gerard, Frank McGee, Howie Morenz, Tommy Phillips, Harvey Pulford, Hod Stuart and Georges Vezina) were inducted on April 30, 1945, although the Hall of Fame still did not have a permanent home. The first board of governors included hockey executives Red Dutton, Art Ross, Frank Sargent, and Lester Patrick; and journalists Abbie Coo, Wes McKnight, Basil O'Meara, J. P. Fitzgerald, and W. A. Hewitt.\nKingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the hall in Kingston. In January 1958, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, and Frank J. Selke was named managing director of the project.\nThe temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within Canada's Sports Hall of Fame at Exhibition Place in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due to the success of the exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960.\nThe first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.\nBy 1986, the Hall of Fame was running out of room in its existing facilities and the board of directors decided that a new home was needed. The Hall vacated the Exhibition Place building in 1992, and its half was taken over by the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. The building was eventually demolished; portion of its fa\u00e7ade was preserved as an entrance to BMO Field stadium. Development of the new location in the BCE Place complex (now Brookfield Place, featuring the former Bank of Montreal at the corner of Yonge and Front Streets in Toronto, began soon after. The design was by Frank Darling and S. George Curry. The new Hockey Hall of Fame officially opened on June 18, 1993. The new location has of exhibition space, seven times larger than that of the old facility. The Hockey Hall of Fame averaged an annual attendance of 292,000 between 1994 and 2019.\nOperations and organization.\nThe first curator of the new Hall of Fame was Bobby Hewitson. Following Hewitson's retirement in 1967, Lefty Reid was appointed to the position. Reid was curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame for the next 25\u00a0years, retiring in 1992. Following Reid's retirement, former NHL referee-in-chief Scotty Morrison, who was the president of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, was appointed curator. Morrison supervised the relocation of the Hall of Fame and its exhibits. The current curator is Phil Pritchard.\nThe Hockey Hall of Fame is led by Lanny McDonald, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Denomme. McDonald will be succeeded by Mike Gartner when his term expires in June 2025. The Hall of Fame is operated as a non-profit business called the \"Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\" (HHFM), independent of the National Hockey League. It was originally sponsored by the NHL and Hockey Canada and revenue is generated mainly through admissions.\nExhibits.\nThe Hockey Hall of Fame has 15 exhibit areas covering . Visitors can view trophies, memorabilia and equipment worn by players during special games. The Esso Great Hall, described as \"a Cathedral to the icons of Hockey\", contains portraits and biographical information about every Hall of Fame honoured member. The centrepiece of the Great Hall is the Stanley Cup; for part of the year a replica is put on display when the presentation cup travels outside of the Hall of Fame. The original version of the Cup and the older rings, as well as all of the current National Hockey League trophies, are displayed in the bank vault, an alcove off the Great Hall. The Hall of Fame induction ceremony was held in the Great Hall until it outgrew the space and moved to the Allan Lambert Galleria in Brookfield Place.\nThe NHL Zone is a large area featuring displays relating to the NHL. Current teams and players are highlighted in the NHL Today area, while the NHL Retro displays include memorabilia and information about every NHL team past and present. The NHL Legends area features rotating exhibits focusing on honoured members; and NHL Milestones displays exhibits of noteworthy records including Darryl Sittler's ten-point game and Wayne Gretzky's all-time points record. The Stanley Cup dynasties exhibit features displays that include memorabilia from the rosters of nine teams considered to be dynasties because they dominated the NHL for several years at a time. This area also has a replica of the Montreal Canadiens' dressing room as it existed at the old Montreal Forum. The St. Louis Bar and Grill Arena Zone is dedicated to hockey across all levels of play in North America; it includes exhibits about various leagues and sections on women's and disabled hockey leagues. Newly renovated, the exhibit now contains several big ticket items including trophies from multiple North American leagues, artifacts from all Original Six arena's, and a full size Zamboni machine once used at the Boston Garden.\nInteractive displays are featured in the NHLPA Be A Player Zone. At the \"NHLPA Gametime\", visitors take shots using real pucks at a computer simulation of goaltender Ed Belfour. Visitors can also take turns playing goaltender, blocking shots from computer simulations of players like Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier. The TSN/RDS Broadcast Zone provides a look at how hockey broadcasting works and allows users to record messages that may be displayed on both the Hockey Hall of Fame's website, and the TSN/RDS networks.\nWorld of Hockey Zone.\nWhile many of the Hall of Fame exhibits are dedicated to the NHL, there is a large section devoted to hockey leagues and players outside North America. On June 29, 1998, the \"World of Hockey Zone\" opened. It is a area dedicated to international hockey, including World and Olympic competition and contains profiles on all International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) member countries.\nThe IIHF agreed to transfer its exhibits from the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston, Ontario, to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998. The \"World of Hockey Zone\" is sponsored by Tissot. The zone includes the IIHF Hockey Hall of Fame honour roll, listing each inductee by country and year of enshrinement. Each national association member of the IIHF is represented in the collection of artifacts in the display, which includes many national team hockey jerseys. The World of Hockey also recognizes members of the Triple Gold Club, and displays memorabilia from the \"Miracle on Ice\" at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games. Other notable events included are the 1972 Summit Series, the men's and women's Ice Hockey World Championships, national-level hockey leagues in Europe, the Spengler Cup, the World Cup of Hockey, and the Canada Cup.\nA new addition to the World of Hockey is Women's Hockey: Celebrating Excellence. This exhibit takes a deep dive into the history of the women's game and features stories and artifacts beginning with the earliest days of women's hockey and continuing through to the PWHL.\nHall of Fame.\nSelection process.\nAs of 2009, new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes coaches, general managers, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. The category for on-ice officials was added in 1961 and a \"veteran player\" category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to \"provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players\". Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.\nCandidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an 18-person selection committee. The committee includes Hockey Hall of Fame members, hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game; the membership is representative of \"areas throughout the world where hockey is popular\", and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey. Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three-year term. The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members. As of November 2018, the selection committee includes: chairman John Davidson, James M. Gregory (Chairman Emeritus), and committee members David Branch, Brian Burke, Colin Campbell, Cassie Campbell-Pascall, Mark Chipman, Bob Clarke, Marc de Foy, Michael Farber, Ron Francis, Mike Gartner, Anders Hedberg, Jari Kurri, Igor Larionov, Pierre McGuire, Bob McKenzie, David Poile, and Luc Robitaille.\nEach committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each category per year. Nominations must be submitted to the chairman of the board of directors by April 15 of the nomination year. The committee then meets in June where a series of secret ballot votes is held; any player with the support of 75% of the members of the committee present is inducted. If the maximum number of players does not receive 75% after the first round of voting, then run-off votes are held. Players with less than 50% are dropped from consideration for that year and voting continues until either the maximum number of inductees is reached or all remaining nominees receive between 50% and 75%. In any given year, a maximum of four players, two builders, and one on-ice official are inducted as members. Player and on-ice officials must have not participated in a professional or international game for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination. Builders may be \"active or inactive\".\nThe waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable; Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979), Mario Lemieux (1997), and Wayne Gretzky (1999). Following Gretzky's induction, the Board of Directors determined that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under \"certain humanitarian circumstances\". Three Hall of Fame members came out of retirement after their induction and resumed a career in the National League: Gordie Howe, Guy Lafleur and Mario Lemieux. Chris Pronger and Shea Weber were inducted in 2015 and 2024 while still technically active players; Pronger and Weber were under contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Utah Hockey Club at the time of their induction. Pronger's contract expired after the 2016\u201317 season and Weber's contract will expire after the 2025\u201326 season. The Hall of Fame amended its by-laws by introducing the \"three-year waiting period\", which made Pronger and Weber eligible for induction since they last played in 2011 and 2021, respectively.\nOn March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame announced new by-law additions which were implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder does not need to have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The board of directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.\nThere is also a category for \"Media honourees\". The Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award is awarded by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association to \"distinguished members of the newspaper profession whose words have brought honour to journalism and to hockey\". The Foster Hewitt Memorial Award is awarded by the NHL Broadcasters' Association to \"members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting\". The voting for both awards is conducted by their respective associations. While media honourees are not considered full inductees, they are still honoured with a display at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The ceremonies associated with these awards are held separately from the induction of the members of the Hall of Fame. Some of the award winners have also been inducted into the Hall of Fame as builders, including Foster Hewitt.\nInduction ceremony.\nThe induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from 1959 until 1974. In 1975, it was held at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto and would be held there until 1979. From 1980 to 1992, the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto, except for 1986, 1987 and 1991 when the ceremonies were held in Vancouver, Detroit and Ottawa respectively. Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building. The ceremony was first broadcast by The Sports Network in 1994. \nIn 1999 the \"Hockey Hall of Fame game\" was established, a contest between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year's inductees held before the game. Robert Tychkowski of the \"Edmonton Sun\" reports that many, including Edmonton Oilers president Kevin Lowe, believe the induction ceremony should be held on a night when there are no NHL games scheduled. This would allow a more representative portion of the hockey world to attend.\nCriticism.\nThe Hall of Fame has been criticized for inducting several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to \"a shortage of true greatness\". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players; critics re-emphasized, from 2005 to 2007, that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League, that it is more of an \"NHL Hall of Fame\" than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame has hosted International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) exhibits and the IIHF Hall of Fame since 1998, and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction. While Vladislav Tretiak had been a notable inductee in 1989, Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, and is one of the few other modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and overrepresenting the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nOne of the most discussed potential nominees is Paul Henderson, who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. This is one of the best-known moments in hockey and Canadian sports history. While there is little question of the historical significance of that goal, Henderson's NHL statistics are not at a level comparable to those players usually selected for induction. His candidacy led to many debates among hockey fans and columnists.\nControversy.\nConn Smythe resignation.\nConn Smythe served as the Hall's chairman for several years, but resigned in June 1971 when Harvey \"Busher\" Jackson was posthumously elected into the Hall. Smythe said that it made him sick to think of Jackson alongside such Toronto Maple Leafs players as \"Apps, Primeau, Conacher, Clancy and Kennedy. If the standards are going to be lowered I'll get out as chairman of the board.\" Jackson was notorious for his off-ice lifestyle of drinking and broken marriages. Smythe would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model. Frank J. Selke, head of the selection committee, defended the selection on the belief that a man should not be shut out \"because of the amount of beer he drank\".\nGil Stein dispute.\nOn March 30, 1993, it was announced that Gil Stein, who at the time had been president of the National Hockey League for nine months but had been overlooked for the new job of commissioner in favour of Gary Bettman, would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the Hall's board of directors. Due to these allegations, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman hired two independent lawyers, Arnold Burns and Yves Fortier, to lead an investigation. They concluded that Stein had \"improperly manipulated the process\" and \"created the false appearance and illusion\" that his nomination was the idea of Bruce McNall. They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman. There was a dispute over McNall's role and Stein was \"categorical in stating that the idea was Mr. McNall's\". They recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, but it was revealed Stein had decided to turn down the induction before their announcement.\nAlan Eagleson resignation.\nIn 1989, Alan Eagleson, a longtime executive director of the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA), was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NHLPA pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay and Brad Park, campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74107", "revid": "50043193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74107", "title": "Citation signal", "text": "Phrases to clarify authority in legal documents\nIn law, a citation or introductory signal is a set of phrases or words used to clarify the authority (or significance) of a legal citation as it relates to a proposition. It is used in citations to present authorities and indicate how those authorities relate to propositions in statements. Legal writers use citation signals to tell readers how the citations support (or do not support) their propositions, organizing citations in a hierarchy of importance so the reader can quickly determine the relative weight of a citation. Citation signals help a reader to discern meaning or usefulness of a reference when the reference itself provides inadequate information.\nCitation signals have different meanings in different U.S. citation-style systems. The two most prominent citation manuals are \"The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation\" and the \"ALWD Citation Manual\". Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation. The \"Bluebook\" citation system is the most comprehensive and the most widely used system by courts, law firms and law reviews.\nUse.\nIn legal writing, citation signals appear before the citation that is being introduced. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Formatting rules for legal citations are well-defined. \"See generally The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation\" (Columbia L. Rev. Ass'n et al. eds., 21st ed. 2020) (describing formatting rules for legal citation and providing examples).\nIn the above sentence, the signal \"See generally\" is used to indicate that the source presents helpful background material related to the proposition.\nSignals indicating support.\nNo signal.\nIt is acceptable to cite an authority without using an introductory signal when the cited authority (1) directly states the proposition, (2) identifies the source of a quotation, or (3) identifies an authority referred to in the text. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The United States unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September 2024. U.S. Dep't of Lab., USDL-24-2052, The Employment Situation -- September 2024 (2024). This drop has alleviated concerns of a recession among some economists, particularly because this data comes at a time when \"[r]eal-time estimates of overall economic growth remain strong.\" Talmon Joseph Smith, \"Labor Market Shows Unexpected Strength\", N.Y. Times (Oct. 4, 2024).\nIn the above example, the author is restating numerical data from an authority and then directly quoting another authority, so no introductory signal is necessary.\n\"e.g.\".\nThis signal, an abbreviation of the Latin \"exempli gratia\", means \"for example\". It tells the reader that the citation supports the proposition; although other authorities also support the proposition, their citation(s) may not be useful or necessary. This signal may be used in combination with other signals, preceded by an italicized comma. The comma after \"e.g.\", is not italicized when attached to another signal at the end (whether supportive or not), but is italicized when \"e.g.\" appears alone. Examples: Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. \"See, e.g.\", \"Abele v. Markle\", 342 F. Supp. 800 (D. Conn.1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-56. Unfortunately, hiring undocumented laborers is a widespread industry practice. \"E.g.\", \"Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Bellefonte Ins. Co.\", 548 F. Supp. 1329, 1331 (E.D. Pa. 1982).\nAccord.\n\"Accord\" is used when two or more sources state or support the proposition, but the text quotes (or refers to) only one; the other sources are then introduced by \"accord\". Legal writers often use \"accord\" to indicate that the law of one jurisdiction is in accord with that of another jurisdiction. Examples: \"[N]ervousness alone does not justify extended detention and questioning about matters not related to the stop.\" \"United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela\", 268 F.3d 719,725 (9th Cir. 2001); \"accord United States v. Beck\", 140 F.3d 1129, 1139 (8th Cir. 1998); \"United States v. Wood\", 106 F.3d 942, 248 (10th Cir. 1997); \"United States v. Tapia\", 912 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1990). \"... The term 'Fifth Amendment' in the context of our time is commonly regarded as being synonymous with the privilege against self-incrimination\". \"Quinn v. United States\", 349 U.S. 155, 163, 75 S. Ct. 668, 99 L. Ed. 964 (1955); \"accord In re Johnny V.\", 85 Cal. App. 3d 120, 149 Cal.Rptr. 180, 184, 188 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that the statement \"I'll take the fifth\" was an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege).\nSee.\n\"See\" indicates that the cited authority supports, but does not directly state, the proposition given. Used similarly to no signal, to indicate that the proposition follows from the cited authority. It may also be used to refer to a cited authority which supports the proposition. For example, before 1997 the IDEA was silent on the subject of private school reimbursement, but courts had granted such reimbursement as \"appropriate\" relief under principles of equity pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C ). \"See Burlington\", 471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996 (\"[W]e are confident that by empowering the court to grant 'appropriate' relief Congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case.\"); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C ) (\"In any action brought under this paragraph, the court ... shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.\").\nSee also.\nThis indicates that the cited authority constitutes additional material which supports the proposition less directly than that indicated by \"see\" or \"accord\". \"See also\" may be used to introduce a case supporting the stated proposition which is distinguishable from previously-cited cases. It is sometimes used to refer readers to authorities supporting a proposition when other supporting authorities have already been cited or discussed. A parenthetical explanation of the source's relevance, after a citation introduced by \"see also\", is encouraged. For example, \" ... Omitting the same mental element in a similar weapons possession statute, such as RCW 9.41.040, strongly indicates that the omission was purposeful and that strict liability was intended. \"See generally\" \"State v. Alvarez\", 74 Wash. App. 250, 260, 872 P.2d 1123 (1994) (omission of \"course of conduct\" language in criminal counterpart to civil antiharassment act indicated \"Legislature consciously chose to criminalize a single act rather than a course of conduct.\") aff'd, 128 Wash.2d 1, 904 P.2d 754 (1995); \"see also\" \"State v. Roberts\", 117 Wash.2d 576, 586, 817 P.2d 855 (1991) (use of certain statutory language in one instance, and different language in another, evinces different legislative intent) (citing cases).\" Source: \"State v. Anderson\", 141 Wash.2d 357, 5 P.3d 1247, 1253 (2000).\n\"Cf.\".\nFrom the Latin \"confer\" (\"compare\"), this signals that a cited proposition differs from the main proposition but is sufficiently analogous to lend support. An explanatory parenthetical note is recommended to clarify the citation's relevance. For example, it is precisely this kind of conjecture and hair-splitting that the Supreme Court wanted to avoid when it fashioned the bright-line rule in Miranda. \"Cf\". \"Davis\", 512 U.S. at 461 (noting that where the suspect asks for counsel, the benefit of the bright-line rule is the \"clarity and ease of application\" that \"can be applied by officers in the real world without unduly hampering the gathering of information\" by forcing them \"to make difficult judgment calls\" with a \"threat of suppression if they guess wrong\").\nSignal indicating background material.\nSee generally.\nThis signal indicates that the cited authority presents background material relevant to the proposition. Legal scholars generally encourage the use of parenthetical explanations of the source material's relevance following each authority using \"see generally\", and this signal can be used with primary and secondary sources. For example, it is a form of \"discrimination\" because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. \"See generally Olmstead v. L. C\"., 527 U.S. 581, 614, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540, 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (finding that the \"normal definition of discrimination\" is \"differential treatment\").\nSignals indicating contradiction.\n\"Contra\".\nThis signals that the cited authority directly contradicts a given point. \"Contra\" is used where no signal would be used for support. For example: \"Before \"Blakely\", courts around the country had found that 'statutory minimum' was the maximum sentence allowed by law for the crime, rather than the maximum \"standard\" range sentence. \"See, e.g.,\" \"State v. Gore\", 143 Wash. 2d 288, 313-14, 21 P.3d 262 (2001), \"overruled by State v. Hughes\", 154 Wash. 2d 118, 110 P.3d 192 (2005). \"Contra Blakely\", 124 S. Ct. at 2536-37.\"\nBut see.\nThe cited authority contradicts the stated proposition, directly or implicitly. \"But see\" is used in opposition where \"see\" is used for support. For example: \"Specifically, under \"Roberts\", there may have been cases in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. \"But see Bockting v. Bayer\", 418 F.3d at 1058 (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\"\n\"But cf.\".\nThe cited authority contradicts the stated proposition by analogy; a parenthetical explanation of the source's relevance is recommended. For example: \"But cf.\" 995 F.2d, at 1137 (observing that \"[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee\").\n\"But\" should be omitted from \"but see\" and \"but cf.\" when the signal follows another negative signal: \"Contra\" \"Blake v. Kiline\", 612 F.2d 718, 723-24 (3d Cir. 1979); \"see\" CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 48 (4th ed. 1983).\nSignals indicating comparison.\nCompare.\nThis signal compares two or more authorities who reach different outcomes for a stated proposition. Because the relevance of the comparison may not be readily apparent to the reader, \"The Bluebook\" recommends adding a parenthetical explanation after each authority. Either \"compare\" or \"with\" may be followed by more than one source, using \"and\" between each. Legal writers italicize \"compare\", \"with\" and \"and\". \"Compare\" is used with \"with\", with the \"with\" preceded by a comma. If \"and\" is used, it is also preceded by a comma. For example: To characterize the first element as a \"distortion\", however, requires the concurrence to second-guess the way in which the state court resolved a plain conflict in the language of different statutes. \"Compare\" Fla. Stat. 102.166 (2001) (foreseeing manual recounts during the protest period), \"with\" 102.111 (setting what is arguably too short a deadline for manual recounts to be conducted); compare 102.112(1) (stating that the Secretary \"may\" ignore late returns), \"with\" 102.111(1) (stating that the Secretary \"shall\" ignore late returns).\nSignals as verbs.\nIn footnotes, signals may function as verbs in sentences; this allows material which would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation to be integrated. When used in this manner, signals should not be italicized. \"See\" Christina L. Anderson, Comment, \"Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice\", 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004) (discussing four main types of restorative justice programs) becomes: See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, \"Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice\", 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004), for a discussion of restorative justice as a reasonable replacement for retributive sanctions. \"Cf.\" becomes \"compare\" and \"e.g.\" becomes \"for example\" when the signals are used as verbs.\nFormatting.\nCapitalization.\nThe first letter of a signal should be capitalized when it begins a citation sentence. If it is in a citation clause or sentence, it should not be capitalized.\nPlacement and typeface.\nOne space should separate an introductory signal from the rest of the citation, with no punctuation between. For example, \"See\" \"American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA\", 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\nDo not italicize a signal used as a verb; for example, for a discussion of the Environmental Protection Agency's failure to interpret a statute to provide intelligible principles, see \"American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA,\" 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\nOrder.\nWhen one or more signals are used, the signals should appear in the following order:\nWhen multiple signals are used, they must be consistent with this order. Signals of the same basic type - supportive, comparative, contradictory or background - are strung together in a single citation sentence, separated by semicolons. Signals of different types should be grouped in different citation sentences. For example:\n\"\"See\" \"Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia\", 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (\"per curiam\"); \"cf.\" Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F.Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers). \"But see\" Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose). \"See generally\" Comment, \"O'Neill v. Baine\": \"Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications\", 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications).\"\nWhen \"e.g.\" is combined with another signal, the placement of the combined signal is determined by the non-\"e.g.\" signal; the combined signal \"\"see, e.g.\" should be placed where the \"see\"\" signal would normally be. In a citation clause, citation strings may contain different types of signals; these signals are separated by semicolons.\nOrder of authorities.\nAuthorities in a signal are separated by semicolons. If an authority is more helpful or authoritative than others cited in a signal, it should precede them. Otherwise, authorities are cited in the following order:\nParenthetical information.\nParentheticals, as needed, explain the relevance of an authority to the proposition in the text. Parenthetical information is recommended when the relevance of a cited authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader. Explanatory information takes the form of a present-participle phrase, a quoted sentence or a short statement appropriate in context. Unlike the other signals, it immediately follows the full citation. Usually brief (about one sentence), it quickly explains how the citation supports or disagrees with the proposition. For example: \"Brown v. Board of Education\", 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (overruling \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", 163 U.S. 537 (1896)).\nPhrases not quoting an authority.\nExplanatory parenthetical phrases not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and should not begin with a capital letter: \"See generally\" John Copeland Nagle &amp; J.B. Ruhl, \"The Law of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management\" 227-45 (2002) (detailing the ESA's prohibition on the possession of protected species). When a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in context, a shorter parenthetical may be substituted:\nSuch standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems. \"See, e.g.\", H.B. Jacobini, \"The New International Sanitary Regulations\", 46 Am. J. INT'L L. 727, 727-28(1952) (health-related water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Preparatoires \"for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention\", 2 EARTH L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976)(conservation of protected areas).\nPhrases quoting an authority.\nIf the parenthetical quotes one or more full sentences, it begins with a capital letter and ends with punctuation: \"See\" Committee Note to Interim Rule 8001(f) (\"Given the short time limit to file the petition with the circuit clerk, subdivision (f)(1) provides that entry of a certification on the docket does not occur until an effective appeal is taken under Rule 8003(a) or (b).\"). Insert a space before the opening parenthesis of the explanatory parenthetical. If the parenthetical does not contain a complete sentence, the writer should not place final punctuation (such as a period) inside it.\nPlace a parenthetical included as part of a citation before an explanatory parenthetical:\nFed. R. Civ. P. 30(1) (emphasis added) (also indicating that \"[a] party may instruct a deponent not to answer . . . when necessary to preserve a privilege\"). Shorter parenthetical phrases may be used if a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in the context of the citation: The Florida Supreme court recently declared that \"where the seller of a home knows facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.\" \"Johnson v. Davis\", 480 So. 2d 625, 629 (Fla. 1985) (defective roof in three-year-old home). If a source directly quotes or supports an argument (no signal or \"see\" before a citation), no parenthetical is necessary.\nOrder in a citation.\nIf a cited case has subsequent history or other relevant authority, it follows the parenthetical: \"Anderson v. Terhune\", 467 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir.2006) (claiming that a police officer's continued questioning violated due process rights), \"rehearing en banc granted\", 486 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2007).\nInternal cross-references.\nPortions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece are cited with \"supra\" or \"infra\". \"Supra\" refers to material already in the piece, and \"infra\" to material appearing later in the piece. \"Note\" and \"Part\" refer to footnotes and parts (when parts are specifically designed) in the same piece; \"p.\" and \"pp.\" are used to refer to other pages in the same piece. These abbreviations should be used sparingly to avoid repeating a lengthy footnote or to cross-reference a nearby footnote.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"dauphin\" is French for dolphin and was the hereditary title of the ruler of the Dauphin\u00e9 of Viennois. While early heirs were granted these lands to rule, eventually only the title was granted.\nThe wife of the Dauphin was known as \"la Dauphine\".\nHistory.\nCount Guigues IV of Albon (d. 1142) in Viennois, within the Kingdom of Burgundy (Arles), under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire, had a dolphin on his coat of arms, and was nicknamed \"le Dauphin\". In time, that nickname came to be used as a title. Since c. 1285, the title of Dauphin de Viennois was already in official use by the counts of Albon, and their domains came to be known as the Dauphin\u00e9. \nIn 1343, a series of negotiations was initiated between dauphin Humbert II of Viennois and the French king Philippe VI, regarding the future inheritance of the Dauphin\u00e9. Since Humbert had no heirs, it was initially agreed that in exchange for a substantial financial compensation, his domains will pass to king's younger son Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, but already in 1344 the provisions were changed by the new agreement, designating king's oldest son and heir John, Duke of Normandy as Humbert's heir in the Dauphin\u00e9.\nBy 1349, Humbert decided to relinquish his rule over Dauphin\u00e9, and the final agreement was made, designating king's grandson and John's son Charles as Humbert's successor, on the condition that Dauphin\u00e9 will remain a distinctive polity, not integrated into the French realm. Thus in the summer of 1349, the young French prince Charles became the first Dauphin de Viennois from the House of Valois. In 1350, when his father ascended to the French throne as king John II, Charles became the heir presumptive and thus for the first time both honors (heir to the French throne, and Dauphin de Viennois) were held by the same person.\nThe title was roughly equivalent to the Spanish \"Prince of Asturias\", the Portuguese \"Prince of Brazil\", the English (later British) \"Prince of Wales\", the Dutch \"Prince of Orange\", and the Scottish \"Duke of Rothesay\". The official style of a Dauphin of France, prior to 1461, was \"par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu, dauphin de Viennois, comte de Valentinois et de Diois\" (\"By the Grace of God, Dauphin of Viennois, Count of Valentinois and of Diois\"). A Dauphin of France united the coat of arms of the Dauphin\u00e9, which featured dolphins, with the French fleurs-de-lis, and might, where appropriate, further unite that with other arms (e.g. Francis, son of Francis I, was ruling Duke of Brittany, so united the arms of that province with the typical arms of a Dauphin; Francis II, while Dauphin, was also King of Scots by marriage to Mary I, and added the arms of the Kingdom of Scotland to those of the Dauphin).\nOriginally the Dauphin was personally responsible for the rule of the Dauphin\u00e9, which was legally part of the Holy Roman Empire, and which the emperors, in giving the rule of the province to the French heirs, had stipulated must never be united with France. Because of this, the Dauphin\u00e9 suffered from anarchy in the 14th and 15th centuries, since the Dauphins were frequently minors or concerned with other matters.\nDuring his period as Dauphin, Louis, son of Charles VII, defied his father by remaining in the province longer than the king permitted and by engaging in personal politics more beneficial to the Dauphin\u00e9 than to France. For example, he married Charlotte of Savoy against his father's wishes. Savoy was a traditional ally of the Dauphin\u00e9, and Louis wished to reaffirm that alliance to stamp out rebels and robbers in the province. Louis was driven out of the Dauphin\u00e9 by Charles VII's soldiers in 1456, leaving the region to fall back into disorder. After his succession as Louis XI in 1461, Louis united the Dauphin\u00e9 with France, bringing it under royal control.\nThe title was automatically conferred upon the next heir apparent to the throne in the direct line upon birth, accession of the parent to the throne or death of the previous Dauphin, unlike the British title \"Prince of Wales\", which has always been in the gift of the monarch (traditionally conferred upon the heir's 21st birthday).\nThe sons of the King of France held the style and rank of \"fils de France\" (son of France), while male-line grandsons were given the style and rank of \"petits-enfants de France\" (Grandson of France). The sons and grandsons of the Dauphin ranked higher than their cousins, being treated as the king's children and grandchildren respectively. The sons of the Dauphin, though grandsons of the king, were ranked as Sons of France, and the grandsons of the Dauphin ranked as Grandsons of France; other great-grandsons of the king ranked merely as princes of the blood.\nThe title was abolished by the Constitution of 1791, which made France a constitutional monarchy. Under the constitution the heir-apparent to the throne (Dauphin Louis-Charles at that time) was restyled \"Prince Royal\" (a \"Prince of the Blood\" retitled \"prince fran\u00e7ais\"), taking effect from the inception of the Legislative Assembly on 1 October 1791. The title was restored \"in potentia\" under the Bourbon Restoration of Louis XVIII, but there would not be another Dauphin until after his death. With the accession of his brother Charles X, Charles' son and heir Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame automatically became Dauphin.\nWith the removal of the Bourbons the title fell into disuse, the heirs of Louis Philippe I being titled \"Prince Royal\". After the death of Henri, comte de Chambord, Carlos, Duke of Madrid, the heir of the legitimist claimant, Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n, made use of the title in pretense, as have the Spanish legitimist claimants since.\nIn literature.\nIn Mark Twain's \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", Huck encounters two odd characters who turn out to be professional con men. One of them claims that he should be treated with deference, since he is \"really\" an impoverished English duke, and the other, not to be outdone, reveals that he is \"really\" the Dauphin \"Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonet\".\nLouis, Duke of Guyenne, the Dauphin of Viennois, is a character in William Shakespeare's \"Henry V\". Another Shakespeare play, \"King John\", features the future Louis VIII as \"Lewis the Dauphin\" - this is an anachronisms, as he died over a century before the term was applied to French heirs-apparent.\nIn Baroness Emma Orczy's \"Eldorado\", the Scarlet Pimpernel rescues the Dauphin from prison and helps spirit him from France.\nAlphonse Daudet wrote a short story called \"The Death of the Dauphin\", about a young Dauphin who wants to stop Death from approaching him.\nThe Dauphin is also mentioned in Cormac McCarthy's \"Blood Meridian\".\n is a 1988 episode of \"\". As the titular character (a planetary princess) is female, the episode title gets the gender incorrect (the French female equivalent is \"Dauphine\").\nRobert Pattinson portrays the Dauphin of Viennois in \"The King\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He stood tall and weighed . He was among the most dominant pitchers in baseball history, and ranks in the all-time top 10 in several key pitching categories, including wins, shutouts, and earned run average. In 1936, Mathewson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its first five members.\nMathewson grew up in Factoryville, Pennsylvania, and began playing semiprofessional baseball when he was 14 years old. He played in the minor leagues in 1899, recording a record of 21 wins and two losses. He pitched for the Giants the next season, but was sent back to the minors. He eventually returned to the Giants and went on to win a National League record 373 career games, tying Grover Cleveland Alexander for the third-most career wins of all time. He led the Giants to the franchise's first World Series championship in 1905 by pitching a single World Series record three shutouts. He also holds the record for career shutouts in the World Series, with four. Mathewson never pitched on Sundays, owing to his devout Christian beliefs. Mathewson served in the United States Army's Chemical Warfare Service in World War I, and was accidentally exposed to chemical weapons during training. His respiratory system was weakened from the exposure, causing him to contract tuberculosis, from which he died in Saranac Lake, New York in 1925.\nEarly life.\nChristopher Mathewson was born on August 12, 1880, in Factoryville, Pennsylvania, and he attended high school at Keystone Academy.\nCollege career.\nHe attended college at Bucknell University, where he served as class president and played on the school's football, basketball, and baseball teams. Mathewson was also a member of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. His first experience of semi-professional baseball came in 1895, when he was 14 years old. The manager of the Factoryville ball club asked Mathewson to pitch in a game with a rival team in Mill City, Pennsylvania. Mathewson helped his hometown team to a 19\u201317 victory, but with his batting rather than his pitching. He continued to play baseball during his years at Bucknell, pitching for minor league teams in Honesdale and Meridian, Pennsylvania. Mathewson was selected to the Walter Camp All-American football team in 1900. He was a drop-kicker.\nProfessional football career.\nMathewson played football at Keystone Academy from 1895 to 1897. He turned pro in 1898, appearing as a fullback with the Greensburg Athletic Association. While a member of the New York Giants, Mathewson played fullback for the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. However, Mathewson disappeared from the team in the middle of the team's 1902 season. Some historians speculate that the Giants got word that their star pitcher was risking his baseball career for the Stars and ordered him to stop, while others feel that the Stars' coach, Willis Richardson, got rid of Mathewson because he felt that, since the fullback's punting skills were hardly used, he could replace him with a local player, Shirley Ellis.\nProfessional baseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 1899, Mathewson signed to play professional baseball with Taunton Herrings of the New England League, where he finished with a record of 2\u201313. The next season, he moved on to play on the Norfolk Phenoms of the Virginia League. He finished that season with a 20\u20132 record. He continued to attend Bucknell during that time.\nNew York Giants (1900\u20131916).\nIn July 1900, the New York Giants purchased his contract from Norfolk for $1,500 (). Between July and September 1900, Mathewson appeared in six games for the Giants. He started one of those games and compiled a 0\u20133 record. Displeased with his performance, the Giants returned him to Norfolk and demanded their money back. Later that month, the Cincinnati Reds picked up Mathewson off the Norfolk roster. On December 15, 1900, the Reds quickly traded Mathewson back to the Giants for Amos Rusie.\nDuring his 17-year career, Mathewson won 373 games and lost 188 for a .665 winning percentage. His career earned run average of 2.13 and 79 career shutouts are among the best all time for pitchers, and his 373 wins are still number one in the National League, tied with Grover Cleveland Alexander. He employed a good fastball, outstanding control, and, especially a new pitch he termed the \"fadeaway\" (later known in baseball as the \"screwball\"), which he learned from teammate Dave Williams in 1898.\nThis reference is challenged by Ken Burns documentary \"Baseball\" in which it is stated that Mathewson learned his \"fadeaway\" from Rube Foster when New York Giants manager John McGraw quietly hired Rube to show the Giants bullpen what he knew. Many baseball historians consider this story apocryphal.\nMathewson recorded 2,507 career strikeouts against only 848 walks. He is famous for his 25 pitching duels with Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown, who won 13 of the duels against Mathewson's 11, with one no-decision.\nMathewson was a very good-hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .215 batting average with 151 runs, seven home runs, and 167 runs batted in. In 10 of his 17 years in the majors, he had at least 10 runs batted in, with a season-high of 20 in 1903. He batted .281 (9-for-32) in 11 World Series games.\nBy 1903, Mathewson's stature was such that when he briefly signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the American League, he was thought to be the spark the Browns needed to win the pennant. The Browns had finished a strong second in 1902, five games behind the Philadelphia Athletics. They offered him four times what he was making with the Giants. However, as part of the settlement that ended the two-year war between the American and National Leagues, Mathewson and Browns owner Robert Lee Hedges tore up the contract. Hedges later said that ensuring the return of peace to the game was more important, even if it meant effectively giving up a pennant.\nFrom 1900 to 1904, Mathewson established himself as a premier pitcher. Posting low earned run averages and winning nearly 100 games, Mathewson helped lead the Giants to their first National League title in 1903, and a berth in first World Series. Though no World Series was held in 1904, the Giants captured the pennant, prompting McGraw to proclaim them as the best team in the world.\nMathewson strove even harder in 1905. After switching to catcher, Roger Bresnahan had begun collaborating with Mathewson, whose advanced memory of hitter weaknesses paved the way for a historic season. Pinpoint control guided Mathewson's pitches to Bresnahan's glove. In 338 innings, Mathewson walked only 64 batters. He shut out opposing teams eight times, pitching entire games in brief 90-minute sessions. Besides winning 31 games, Mathewson recorded an earned run average of 1.28 and 206 strikeouts. He led the National League in all three categories, earning him the Triple Crown.\nMathewson's Giants won the 1905 World Series over the Philadelphia Athletics. Mathewson was the starting pitcher in game one, and pitched a four-hit shutout for the victory. Three days later, with the series tied 1\u20131, he pitched another four-hit shutout. Then, two days later in game five, he threw a six-hit shutout to clinch the series for the Giants. In a span of only six days, Mathewson had pitched three complete games without allowing a run, while giving up only 14 hits.\nThe next year, Mathewson lost much of his edge, owing to an early-season diagnosis of diphtheria. McGraw pulled over 260 innings from him, but these were plagued with struggle. Though he maintained a 22\u201312 record, his 2.97 earned run average was well above the league average of 2.62. His 1.271 walks plus hits per innings pitched, quite uncharacteristic of him, was due to an increased number of hits and walks.\nBy 1908, Mathewson was back on top as the league's elite pitcher. Winning the most games of his career, 37, coupled with a 1.43 earned run average and 259 strikeouts, he claimed a second triple crown. He also led the league in starts, innings pitched, complete games, and shutouts, and held hitters to an exceptionally low 0.827 walks plus hits per innings pitched. He even led the league in saves, racking up 5 of them in 12 relief appearances. Unfortunately, the Giants were unable to take home the pennant due to what was ultimately known as Merkle's Boner, an incident that cost the Giants a crucial game against the Chicago Cubs, who eventually defeated the Giants in the standings by one game.\nMathewson returned for an outstanding 1909 season; though not as dominant as the previous year, he posted a better earned run average (1.14), and a record of 25\u20136. He repeated a strong performance in 1910 and then again in 1911, when the Giants captured their first pennant since 1905. The Giants ultimately lost the 1911 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics, the same team they had defeated for the 1905 championship. Mathewson and Rube Marquard allowed two game-winning home runs to Hall of Famer Frank Baker, earning him the nickname, \"Home Run\". Mathewson, the team's \"star pitcher\", signed a three-year contract with the Giants in late 1910, for the upcoming 1911, 1912 and 1913 seasons, the first time he had signed a contract over a year in length.\nIn 1912, Mathewson gave another stellar performance. Capturing the pennant, the Giants were fueled by the stolen-base game and a superior pitching staff capped by Rube Marquard, the \"11,000-dollar lemon\" who turned around to win 26 games, 19 of them consecutively. In the 1912 World Series, the Giants faced the Boston Red Sox, the 1904 American League pennant winners who would have faced the Giants in the World Series that year had one been played. Though Mathewson threw three complete games and maintained an earned run average below 1.00, numerous errors by the Giants, including a lazy popup dropped by Fred Snodgrass in the eighth game (Game 2 was a tie), cost them the championship. The Giants also lost the 1913 World Series, a 101-win season cemented by Mathewson's final brilliant season on the mound: a league-leading 2.06 earned run average in over 300 innings pitched complemented by 0.6 bases on balls per nine innings pitched.\nFor the remainder of his career with the Giants, Mathewson began to struggle. Soon, the former champions fell into decline. In 1915, Mathewson's penultimate season in New York, the Giants were the worst team in the National League standings. Mathewson, who had expressed interest in serving as a manager, wound up with a three-year deal to manage the Cincinnati Reds effective July 21, 1916.\nManagerial career.\nCincinnati Reds (1916\u20131918).\nOn July 20, 1916, Mathewson's career came full circle when he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with Edd Roush. He was immediately named as the Reds' player-manager. However, for all intents and purposes, his playing career was over. He appeared in only one game as a pitcher for the Reds, on September 4, 1916. He faced Brown in the second half of a doubleheader, which was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors. The high-scoring game was a win for Mathewson's Reds over Brown's Cubs, 10\u20138.\nMathewson retired as a player after the season and managed the Reds for the entire 1917 season and the first 118 games of 1918, compiling a total record of 164\u2013176 as a manager.\nPersonal life and literary career.\nMathewson married Jane Stoughton (1880\u20131967) in 1903. Their only son, Christopher Jr., was born shortly after. Christy Mathewson Jr. served in World War II, and died in an explosion at his home in Texas on August 16, 1950. During Mathewson's playing years, the family lived in a duplex on the Upper West Side, at Columbus and 85th, alongside Mathewson's manager John McGraw and his wife Blanche. Mathewson and McGraw remained friends for the rest of their lives. In the 1909 offseason, Christy Mathewson's younger brother Nicholas Mathewson died by suicide in a neighbor's barn. Another brother, Henry Mathewson, pitched briefly for the Giants before dying of tuberculosis in 1917.\nMathewson was highly regarded in the baseball world during his lifetime. As he was a clean-cut, intellectual collegiate, his rise to fame brought a better name to the typical ballplayer, who usually spent his time gambling, boozing, or womanizing. As noted in \"The National League Story\" (1961) by Lee Allen, Mathewson was a devout Christian and never pitched on Sunday, a promise he made to his mother that brought him popularity among the more religious New York fans and earned him the nickname \"The Christian Gentleman\". However, the impact of this practice on the Giants was minimized, since, in the eight-team National League, only the Chicago Cubs (Illinois), Cincinnati Reds (Ohio), and St. Louis Cardinals (Missouri) played home games in states that allowed professional sports on Sunday.\nIn his free time, Mathewson enjoyed nature walks, reading, golf, and checkers, of which he was a renowned champion player. The combination of athletic skill and intellectual hobbies made him a favorite for many fans, even those opposed to the Giants. Sportswriters praised him, and in his prime every game he started began with deafening cheers. Sometimes, the distraction prompted him to walk out 10 minutes after his fielders took the field. Mathewson soon became the unspoken captain of the Giants.\nHe was the only player to whom John McGraw ever gave full discretion. McGraw told many younger players to watch and listen to his wisdom.\nMathewson garnered respect throughout the baseball world as a pitcher of great sportsmanship. He was often asked to write columns concerning upcoming games. In 1912, with the editing and ghostwriting aid of sportswriter John Wheeler, Mathewson published his classic memoir \"Pitching in a Pinch, or Pitching from the Inside\", which was admired by poet Marianne Moore and is still in print. Years later, Mathewson co-wrote a mildly successful play called \"The Girl and The Pennant\", which was inspired by Helene Hathaway Britton's ownership of the St. Louis Cardinals. Mathewson went on to pursue more literary endeavors ending in 1917 with a children's book called \"Second Base Sloan\".\nOne of the journalists to unmask the 1919 Black Sox, Hugh Fullerton, consulted Mathewson for information about baseball gambling. Fullerton trusted Mathewson for his writing intellect, as well as his unbiased standpoint. As a player and manager, Mathewson also had several seasons of experience playing alongside Hal Chase, a veteran major league player widely rumored to have been involved in several gambling incidents and attempts to fix games.\nRepresenting the only former ballplayer among the group of investigating journalists, Mathewson played a small role in Fullerton's exposure of the 1919 World Series scandal.\nWorld War I and afterward.\nLate in the 1918 season, Mathewson enlisted in the United States Army during World War I. His wife Jane was very much opposed to the decision, but Mathewson insisted on going. He served overseas as a captain in the newly formed Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) along with Ty Cobb. Mathewson served with the American Expeditionary Forces until February 1919 and was discharged later that month.\nMathewson developed tuberculosis shortly after his military service. It was widely assumed his disease was caused by his work with chemical weapons, largely due to the conventional wisdom that tuberculosis more easily infects lungs that have been damaged by these gases. This narrative was given further credence from a passage in Al Stump's 1961 biography of Ty Cobb, which says that Cobb and Mathewson were both accidentally gassed during a chemical training exercise in Choignes, France where eight men died; Mathewson purportedly told Cobb afterwards that he had 'got a good dose of that stuff. I feel terrible.' This account has widely been accepted as true, although it is not without its detractors: Branch Rickey, who also served in the CWS alongside Mathewson, flatly denied the incident; other historians have noted that Stump's book, published after Cobb's death, is sensationalized and generally unreliable. Further, some historians question whether the incident ever occurred. Mathewson himself never mentioned a training accident during his lifetime, but acknowledged that he had been exposed to potentially lethal gases on various occasions while demonstrating gas shells to students: \"We were careful, but there is no doubt the accumulated gases affected my lungs,\" he later said.\nAlthough he returned to serve as a coach for the Giants from 1919 to 1921, he spent a good portion of that time in Saranac Lake fighting the tuberculosis, initially at the Trudeau Sanitorium, and later in a house that he had built. In 1923, Mathewson returned to professional baseball when Giants attorney Emil Fuchs and he put together a syndicate that bought the Boston Braves. Although initial plans called for Mathewson to be principal owner and team president, his health had deteriorated so much that he could perform only nominal duties. He turned over the presidency to Fuchs after the season.\nDeath and legacy.\nAfter contracting tuberculosis, Mathewson moved to the frigid climate of Saranac Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains, where he sought treatment from Edward Livingston Trudeau at his renowned Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium. He died in Saranac Lake of tuberculosis on October 7, 1925. Mathewson is buried at Lewisburg Cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Bucknell University. Members of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators wore black armbands during the 1925 World Series. Mathewson had died on the day the series began, October 7. According to \"Baseball\", some of Mathewson's last words were to his wife: \"Now Jane, I want you to go outside and have yourself a good cry. Don't make it a long one; this can't be helped.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Line-Up for Yesterday\"\n\"M is for Matty,\"\"Who carried a charm\"\"In the form of an extra\"\"brain in his arm.\"\n \u2014 Ogden Nash, \"Sport\" magazine (January 1949)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74133", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74133", "title": "Adding machine", "text": "Type of mechanical calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic\nAn adding machine is a class of mechanical calculator, usually specialized for bookkeeping calculations. Consequently, the earliest adding machines were often designed to read in particular currencies. Adding machines were ubiquitous office equipment in developed countries for most of the twentieth century. \nThey were phased out in favor of electronic calculators in the 1970s and by personal computers beginning in about 1985. \nBlaise Pascal and Wilhelm Schickard were the two original inventors of the mechanical calculator in 1642. For Pascal, this was an adding machine that could perform additions and subtractions directly and multiplication and divisions by repetitions, while Schickard's machine, invented several decades earlier, was less functionally efficient but was supported by a mechanised form of multiplication tables. These two were followed by a series of inventors and inventions leading to those of Thomas de Colmar, who launched the mechanical calculator industry in 1851 when he released his simplified arithmometer (it took him thirty years to refine his machine, patented in 1820, into a simpler and more reliable form). However, they did not gain widespread use until Dorr E. Felt started manufacturing his comptometer (1887) and Burroughs started the commercialization of differently conceived adding machines (1892).\nOperation.\nTo add a new list of numbers and arrive at a total, the user was first required to \"ZERO\" the machine. Then, to add sets of numbers, the user was required to press numbered keys on a keyboard, which would remain depressed (rather than immediately rebound like the keys of a computer keyboard or typewriter or the buttons of a typical modern machine). The user would then pull the crank, which caused the numbers to be shown on the rotary wheels, and the keys to be released (i.e., to pop back up) in preparation for the next input. To add, for example, the amounts of 30.72 and 4.49 (which, in adding machine terms, on a decimal adding machine is 3,072 plus 449 \"decimal units\"), the following process took place: Press the 3 key in the column fourth from the right (multiples of one thousand), the 7 key in the column second from right (multiples of ten) and the 2 key in the rightmost column (multiples of 1). Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now showed 3072. Press the 4 key in the third column from the right, the 4 key in the second column from right, and the 9 key in the rightmost column. Pull the crank. The rotary wheels now show a running 'total' of 3521, which, when interpreted using the decimal currency colour-coding of the key columns, equates to 35.21. Keyboards typically did not have or need 0 (zero) keys; one simply did not press any key in the column containing a zero. Trailing zeros (those to the right of a number) were there by default because when a machine was zeroed, all numbers visible on the rotary wheels were reset to zero. \nSubtraction was impossible, except by adding the complement of a number (for instance, subtract 2.50 by adding 9,997.50).\nMultiplication was a simple process of keying in the numbers zero or more columns to the left and repeating the \"addition\" process. For example, to multiply 34.72 by 102, key in 3472, pull the crank, and repeat once more. Wheels show 6944. Now key in 347200 = 3472x100 (3472 in columns 3 to 6 from the right, and nothing in columns 1 and 2 from the right), pull crank. Wheels now show 354144, or 3,541.44. To multiply by 102, 3 additions are required. To multiply by any number, the number of additions required is the sum of its digits.\nA later adding machine, called the comptometer, did not require that a crank be pulled to add. Numbers were input simply by pressing keys. The machine was thus driven by finger power. Multiplication was similar to that on the adding machine, but users would \"form\" up their fingers over the keys to be pressed and press them down the multiple of times required. Using the above example, four fingers would be used to press down twice on the 3 (fourth column), 4 (third column), 7 (second column) and 2 (first column) keys. That finger shape would then move left two columns and press once. Usually, a small crank near the wheels would be used to zero them. Subtraction was possible by adding complementary numbers; keys would also carry a smaller, complementary digit to help the user form complementary numbers. Division was also possible by putting the dividend to the left end and performing repeated subtractions by using the complementary method.\nSome adding machines were electromechanical \u2013 an old-style mechanism, but driven by electric power.\nSome \"ten-key\" machines had input of numbers as on a modern calculator \u2013 30.72 was input as 3, 0, 7, 2. These machines could subtract as well as add. Some could multiply and divide, although including these operations made the machine more complex. Those that could multiply used a form of the old adding machine multiplication method. Using the previous example of multiplying 34.72 by 102, the amount was keyed in, then the 2 key in the \"multiplication\" key column was pressed. The machine cycled twice, then tabulated the adding mechanism below the keyboard, one column to the right. The number keys remained locked down on the keyboard. The user now pressed the multiplication 0 key, which caused tabulation of the adding mechanism one more column to the right, but did not cycle the machine.

{"id": "74134", "revid": "18745235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74134", "title": "Northern and Southern dynasties", "text": "Period in Chinese history from 420 to 589\nThe Northern and Southern dynasties () was a period of political division in the history of China that lasted from 420 to 589, following the tumultuous era of the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is sometimes considered to be the latter part of a longer period known as the Six Dynasties (220\u2013589). The period featured civil war and political chaos. However, it was also a time of flourishing arts and culture, advancement in technology, and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. The period saw large-scale migration of Han Chinese people to lands south of the Yangtze. It came to an end with the unification of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty in 589.\nDuring this period, the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Han ethnicities in the north and the indigenous peoples in the south. This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism in both northern and southern China. Daoism gained influence as well, with two essential Daoist canons written during this period. Additionally, many notable technological advances occurred during this period. The invention of the stirrup during the earlier Jin dynasty (266\u2013420) helped spur the development of heavy cavalry as a combat standard. Historians also note advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and cartography. Intellectuals of the period include the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429\u2013500), and astronomer Tao Hongjing (456\u2013536).\nBackground.\nAfter the collapse of a unified China proper under the Eastern Han dynasty in 220, China moved into the Three Kingdoms period. Of these, the kingdom of Cao Wei was the strongest, followed by Eastern Wu and Shu Han. Initially, they were in a relatively stable formation. After a 249 coup by Sima Yi, the Sima family essentially controlled Cao Wei and the conquest of Shu Han by Cao Wei followed in late 263.\nFollowing a failed coup by the ruling Cao family against the Sima family in June 260, the final Cao ruler abdicated in February 266. Sima Yan (Emperor Wu of Jin) then founded the Western Jin dynasty. The conquest of Eastern Wu by Western Jin occurred in 280, ending the Three Kingdoms period and reuniting China proper.\nThe Western Jin dynasty was severely weakened due to the War of the Eight Princes from 291 to 306. During the reigns of Emperor Huai of Jin and Emperor Min of Jin, the empire was put into grave danger by the uprising of northern non-Han peoples known as the Five Barbarians. Numerous nomadic tribal groups had been forcibly resettled in northern and northwestern China during previous centuries. When the warring princes heavily drafted these tribes into the military, they mutinied and exploited the civil wars to seize power. Their armies almost destroyed the dynasty in the Disaster of Yongjia of 311, when the Five Barbarians sacked Luoyang. Chang'an met a similar fate in 316.\nHowever, a scion of the imperial house, Sima Rui (Emperor Yuan of Jin) fled south of the Huai River and reestablished the dynasty, known in historiography as the Eastern Jin dynasty. Cementing their power in the south, the Eastern Jin established Jiankang on the existing site of Jianye (present-day Nanjing) as their new capital.\nIn the north, the Five Barbarians established numerous short-lived dynasties, leading to the period known as the Sixteen Kingdoms. Eventually, the Northern Wei dynasty conquered the rest of the northern states in 439 and unified northern China. Although the Eastern Jin and successive southern dynasties were well-defended from the northern dynasties by their placement of naval fleets along the Yangtze, they suffered various problems related to the creation and maintenance of military strength. The court's designation of specific households for military service through the tuntian system eventually led to a fall in their social status, causing widespread desertion of troops. Faced with shortage of troops, Eastern Jin generals were often sent on campaigns to capture non-Han indigenous peoples in the south to draft them into the military. The Eastern Jin dynasty fell not because of external invasion, however, but because Liu Yu (Emperor Wu of Liu Song) seized the throne from the Emperor Gong of Jin and founded the Liu Song dynasty, which officially began the Northern and Southern dynasties period.\nNorthern dynasties.\nThe Northern dynasties began in 439 when the Northern Wei conquered the Northern Liang and united Northern China. It ended in 589 when the Sui dynasty conquered the Chen dynasty. It can be divided into three time periods \u2014 the Northern Wei, the Eastern and Western Weis, and the Northern Qi and Northern Zhou. The Northern, Eastern, and Western Weis as well as the Northern Zhou were established by the Xianbei people, while the Northern Qi was established by a Xianbei-influenced ethnic Han.\nIn the north, local ethnic Han gentry clans responded to the chaos by constructing fortified villages. These clans would then carve de facto fiefs out of these highly cohesive family-based self-defense communities. Lesser peasant families would work for the dominant clan as tenants or serfs. The chaos also allowed these Han gentry families to avoid government service before the Northern Wei court launched the sinicization movement. Northern gentry were therefore highly militarized as compared to their refined southern counterparts, and this distinction persisted well into the Sui and Tang dynasties centuries later.\nNorthern Wei (386\u2013535).\nRise to power.\nDuring the Sixteen Kingdoms period, the Tuoba family of the Xianbei were the rulers of the state of Dai. Although it was conquered by the Former Qin, their defeat at the Battle of Fei River resulted in their collapse. Tuoba Gu, the grandson of the last prince of Dai, restored the fortunes of the Tuoba clan, renaming his state Wei (now known as Northern Wei) with its capital at Shengle (near modern-day Hohhot). Under the rule of Emperors Daowu (Tuoba Gui), Mingyuan, and Taiwu, the Northern Wei progressively expanded. The establishment of the early Northern Wei state and the economy were also greatly indebted to the father-son pair of Cui Hong and Cui Hao. Tuoba Gui engaged in numerous conflicts with the Later Yan that ended favorably for the Northern Wei after they received help from Zhang Gun that allowed them to destroy the Later Yan army at the Battle of Canhe Slope. Following this victory, Tuoba Gui conquered the Later Yan capital of Pingcheng (modern-day Datong). That same year, he declared himself Emperor Daowu.\nDue to Emperor Daowu's cruelty, he was killed by his son Tuoba Shao, but crown prince Tuoba Si managed to defeat Tuoba Shao and eventually took the throne as Emperor Mingyuan. Though he managed to conquer Liu Song's province of Henan, he died soon afterward. Emperor Mingyuan's son Tuoba Tao took the throne as Emperor Taiwu. Due to Emperor Taiwu's energetic efforts, Northern Wei's strength greatly increased, allowing them to repeatedly attack Liu Song. After dealing with the Rouran threat to his northern flank, he engaged in a war to unite northern China. With the fall of the Northern Liang in 439, Emperor Taiwu united northern China, ending the Sixteen Kingdoms period and beginning the Northern and Southern dynasties period with their southern rivals, the Liu Song.\nEven though it was a time of great military strength for the Northern Wei, Rouran harassment from the north forced them to divert their focus from their southern expeditions. After uniting the north, Emperor Taiwu also conquered the powerful Shanshan kingdom and subjugated the other kingdoms in the Western Regions. In 450, Emperor Taiwu once again attacked the Liu Song and reached Guabu (modern-day Nanjing), threatening to cross the river to attack Jiankang, the Liu Song capital. Up until this point, the Northern Wei military forces had dominated the Liu Song forces. However, they took heavy casualties. The Northern Wei forces plundered numerous households before returning north.\nAt this point, followers of the Buddhist Gai Wu rebelled. After pacifying this rebellion, Emperor Taiwu, under the advice of his Daoist prime minister Cui Hao, proscribed Buddhism \u2014 the first of the persecutions of Chinese Buddhism known as the Three Disasters of Wu. At this late stage in his life, Emperor Taiwu meted out cruel punishments, which led to his death in 452 at the hands of the eunuch Zong Ai. His death sparked off turmoil that only ended with the ascension of Emperor Wencheng later that same year. Wang Yu, an ethnic Qiang court eunuch and the favourite of Empress Dowager Wenming, patronized Buddhism lavishly. He constructed Cave 9\u201310, the most highly decorated of the Yungang Grottoes, and had a temple constructed in 488 at Lirun, Fengyi (modern day Chengcheng), which was his birthplace according to the Booke of Wei. Wang Yu may have been castrated during the suppression of a 446 Qiang rebellion since the Northern Wei would castrate rebel tribes' young elite.\nIn the first half of the Northern Wei dynasty, the Xianbei steppe tribesmen who dominated northern China kept a policy of strict social distinction between them and their Han subjects. Ethnic Han were drafted into the bureaucracy, employed as officials for jobs such as collecting taxes. However, the Han were kept out of many higher positions of power. They also represented the minority of the populace where centers of power were located.\nSinicization.\nWidespread social and cultural transformation in northern China came with Emperor Xiaowen, who reigned from 471\u2013499. While his father was a Xianbei, his mother was a Han. Although he was of the Tuoba Clan from the Xianbei tribe, Emperor Xiaowen asserted his dual Xianbei-Han identity, renaming his own clan \"Yuan\". In the year 493, he instituted a new sinification program that had the Xianbei elites conform to many Han standards. These social reforms included donning Han clothing (banning Xianbei clothing at court), learning the Han language (if under the age of thirty), converting Xianbei family names to one-character Han surnames, and encouraging high-ranking Xianbei and Han families to intermarry. Emperor Xiaowen also moved the capital city from Pingcheng to one of China's old imperial sites, Luoyang, which had been the capital during the earlier Eastern Han and Western Jin dynasties. The new capital at Luoyang was revived and transformed, with roughly 150,000 Xianbei and other northern warriors moved from the north to the south by the year 495 to serve in the capital. Within a couple of decades, the population had risen to about half a million residents and was famed for being home to over a thousand Buddhist temples. Defectors from the south, such as Wang Su of the prestigious Langye Wang family, were largely accommodated and felt at home with the establishment of their own Wu quarter in Luoyang (this quarter of the city was home to over three thousand families). They were even served tea (by this time gaining popularity in southern China) at court instead of the yogurt drinks commonly found in the north.\nBeginning in the 480s, the Northern Wei arranged for Han elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba imperial family. More than fifty per cent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han men from the imperial families and aristocrats of the southern dynasties who had defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen married Han elites: the Liu Song royal Liu Hui (), married Princess Lanling () of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang () to Sima Fei (), a descendant of Jin royalty, Princess Jinan () to Lu Daoqian (), and Princess Nanyang () to Xiao Baoyin, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei's sister, the Shouyang Princess, was wedded to Emperor Wu of Liang's son Xiao Zong. According to the Book of Zhou, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei's sister was married to the ethnic Han Zhang Huan, son of Zhang Qiong. When the Eastern Jin dynasty ended, the Northern Wei received the Jin prince Sima Chuzhi as a refugee, and he married a Northern Wei princess. Their son Sima Jinlong in turn married Northern Liang Xiongnu King Juqu Mujian's daughter.\nIn the year 523, Prince Dongyang of the Northern Wei was sent to Dunhuang to serve as its governor for a term of fifteen years. With Buddhism gaining mainstream acceptance in Chinese society, Prince Dongyang and local wealthy families set out to establish a monumental project in honor of Buddhism, carving and decorating Cave 285 of the Mogao Caves with beautiful statues and murals. Such promotion of the arts would continue for centuries at Dunhuang and it is now one of China's greatest tourist attractions.\nSplit into Eastern Wei (534\u2013550) and Western Wei (535\u2013557).\nIn the year 523, a revolt of several military garrisons broke out and became known as the Rebellion of the Six Garrisons (\"Liu Zhen\"). The revolt was caused by a food shortage far north of Luoyang. After the rebel force was suppressed, the government had 200,000 surrendered garrison rebels deployed to Hebei, which proved later to be a mistake when a former garrison officer organized another rebellion in the years 526\u2013527. The underlying cause of these wars was the growing rift between the governing aristocracy which was increasingly adopting Han-style sedentary policies and lifestyles and their nomadic tribal armies who continued to preserve the old steppe way of life.\nThe Northern Wei court was betrayed by one of their own generals, who had the empress dowager and the young emperor thrown into the Yellow River while establishing his own puppet ruler to maintain authority. As conflict swelled in the north between successive leaders, Gao Huan took control of the east and Luoyang (holding Emperor Xiaojing as a puppet ruler) by 534, while his rival Yuwen Tai took control of the west and the traditional Chinese capital of Chang'an by 535. The Western regime was dominated by the sinicized nobles and their Han bureaucrats while the Eastern regime was controlled by the traditional steppe tribes.\nNorthern Qi (550\u2013577) and Northern Zhou (557\u2013581).\nEventually, Gao Huan's son Gao Yang forced the Eastern Wei emperor to abdicate in favor of his claim to the throne, establishing the Northern Qi dynasty (551\u2013577). Afterward, Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue seized the throne of power from Emperor Gong of Western Wei, establishing the Northern Zhou dynasty (557\u2013580).\nThe Northern Qi inherited the primary recruiting grounds of the Northern Wei army; previously, five out of six Northern Wei military officers came from the eastern territories, particularly the local armed forts of Han military families and steppe tribes who had settled in these areas. The members of these military families \u2014 both men and women \u2014 were often expert riders and archers.\nLike its predecessor the Western Wei, the Northern Zhou reacted against sinicization by trying to revive Xianbei warrior culture: reviving Xianbei tunics, trousers and boots, reverting sinicized surnames into Xianbei names and even giving Han officers Xianbei surnames. This \"tribalization\" policy was intended to convert large numbers of Han Chinese army recruits into \"Xianbei\" who would pay for their own equipment in exchange for tax exemptions. The policy was highly successful in boosting the state's military strength.\nThe Northern Zhou dynasty was able to defeat and conquer Northern Qi in 577, reunifying the north. However, this success was short-lived, as the Northern Zhou was overthrown in 581 by Yang Jian, who became Emperor Wen of Sui.\nWith greater military power and morale, along with convincing propaganda that the Chen dynasty ruler Chen Shubao was a decadent ruler who had lost the Mandate of Heaven, the Sui Dynasty was able to effectively conquer the south. After this conquest, the whole of China entered a new golden age of reunification under the centralization of the short-lived Sui dynasty and the succeeding Tang dynasty (618\u2013907).\nThe core elite of the Northern dynasties \u2014 mixed-culture, and mixed-ethnicity military clans \u2014 would later also form the founding elites of the Sui and Tang dynasties. Hence, they tended to have a flexible approach to steppe nomads, viewing them as possible partners rather than intrinsic enemies.\nSouthern dynasties.\nThe Jin were succeeded by a series of short-lived dynasties: Liu Song (420\u2013479), Southern Qi (479\u2013502), Liang (502\u2013557) and Chen (557\u2013589). As all of these dynasties had their capital at Jiankang (except for a brief interlude from 552 to 555), they are sometimes grouped together with Eastern Wu and Eastern Jin under the historiographic term \"the Six Dynasties\". The rulers of these short-lived dynasties were generals who seized and then held power for several decades but were unable to successfully transfer power to their heirs to continue their dynasty. Emperor Wu of Liang (502\u2013549) was the most notable ruler of this age, being a patron of the arts and of Buddhism.\nThe Southern dynasties with the exception of the last Chen dynasty were strongly dominated by the \"shijia\", (great families) who monopolized political power until the mid-6th century. This class was created by Cao Cao during the late Han dynasty when he attempted to consolidate his power by building an endogenous military caste of professional soldiers. His policy led to the rise and usurpation of the Sima family who established the Jin dynasty; subsequent leaders were similarly unable to bring the other great families in line. The Jin dynasty's flight south greatly exacerbated the weakness of the central government, and the great families who accompanied the Emperor in his flight, along with the most wealthy clans of earlier settlers along the Zhejiang coast, were the primary power brokers in the Eastern Jin. With the greatly increased importance of proving one's pedigree to receive privileges, there was a rise in compiling of genealogy records, and the great families moved to legally outlaw intermarriage with common families. The lower class Northern migrants were forced to become \"guests\" (dependents) of the great families who established private guard forces with their new retainers. When the Eastern Jin attempted to draft the dependents of the great families, the court was quickly overthrown.\nHowever, with the fall of the Eastern Jin in 420, the balance of power shifted in favour the central government. The subsequent Liu Song, Qi, Liang and Chen dynasties were ruled by military leaders from lowly social backgrounds. They gradually stripped the powerful clans of military power, authority and wealth. The emperors stationed regional armies around the country under the command of their imperial relatives. They recruited officers from humble backgrounds and appointed low-ranking officials to monitor the powerful elites occupying the top government posts. The southern aristocracy declined with the rise of the Indian Ocean trade in the mid 5th century, which led to the court revenues shifting to trade and the disappearance of the caste by the Chen dynasty. As landowning aristocrats were unable to convert cash from the produce of their estates, the resurgence of trade and the money-based economy forced them to break up and sell their lands to the burgeoning merchant class. Influential merchants increasingly occupied political offices, displacing the old aristocrats. On the other hand, the economic developments also drove peasants, unable to cope with inflation or to pay taxes in cash, to become mercenary soldiers, wandering through the country selling their services to the warring princes and plundering the populace. These upheavals devastated the south which eased the fall of the south to the Sui dynasty.\nUnder the waning leadership of the Chen dynasty, the southern Chinese were unable to resist the military power amassed in the north by Yang Jian, who declared himself Emperor Wen of Sui and invaded the south.\nAboriginal chiefs played an important active role in adapting to the dominant Chinese structure, rather than being forcibly subjugated. For instance, the aboriginal chief Lady Xian, who married the Liang court's governor Feng Bao, helped to extend the dynasties' authority while preserving autonomy and local culture. Lady Xian and Feng Bao played a critical role in assisting Chen Baxian's rise, and in stabilising the region between the Liang, Chen, and Sui dynasties. The court acknowledged her authority by awarding her with official titles and emblems of power. There were many other local chieftains of mixed origins between Guangzhou and modern Vietnam that displayed mixed traits of both aboriginal and sinicized culture, such as the Ning of Qinzhou, the Li of Guizhou-Tengzhou and the Chen of Shuangzhou. These families functioned both as cheftains to the natives and bureaucrats to the court.\nLiu Song (420\u2013479).\nLiu Song founder Liu Yu was originally a leader of the Army of the Northern Garrison () that notably won the Battle of Fei River in 383, resulting in the collapse of the Former Qin. In 404, he helped suppress Huan Xuan's rebellion, leading to his dominance over the Eastern Jin court. In order to gain popularity and take the throne, he led expeditions against the Sixteen Kingdoms, capturing Shandong, Henan and, briefly, Guanzhong by 416. He gave up Guanzhong to try to take the throne because he believed in a prophecy saying there would be one more emperor after Emperor An. Liu Yu deposed him and his replacement, Emperor Gong in 420, ending the Eastern Jin dynasty.\nEven after crowning himself Emperor Wu, Liu Yu remained frugal. However, he did not care for education and trusted unsavory people. He felt that the nobility had too much power, so he tended to appoint the lower classes to government positions and gave military power to imperial kinsmen. Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was afraid they would have thoughts of usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.\nAfter the death of Emperor Wu in 422, his son Emperor Shao ruled briefly before being judged incompetent and killed by government officials led by Xu Xianzhi, replacing him with Emperor Wen, a different son, who soon killed the officials who supported him. Emperor Wen's reign was a period of relative political stability because of his frugality and good government; this period was called the Reign of Yuanjia ().\nIn 430, Emperor Wen started a number of northern expeditions against Northern Wei. These were ineffective because of insufficient preparations and excessive micromanagement of his generals, increasingly weakening the dynasty. Because of his jealousy of Tan Daoji, a noted leader of the Army of the Northern Garrison, he deprived himself of a formidable general to the great delight of the Northern Wei. Thus, they were unable to capitalize when the Northern Wei suffered the Wuqi Incident. Starting in 445, Northern Wei, taking advantage of Liu Song's weakness, made major incursions in the lands between the Yangtze and the Huai (modern-day Shandong, Hebei, and Henan) and devastating six provinces. Emperor Wen lamented that if Tan were still alive, he would have prevented Northern Wei advances. From then on, Liu Song remained in a weakened state.\nEmperor Wen was assassinated by Crown Prince Shao and Second Prince Jun in 453 after planning to punish them for witchcraft. However, they were both defeated by Third Prince Jun, who become Emperor Xiaowu. He proved to be licentious and cruel, supposedly committing incest with the daughters of an uncle who had helped him gain the throne; his rivals also claimed he had incest with his mother. This led to two rebellions by the imperial clan, one of which saw him slaughter the inhabitants of Guangling. The following ballad gives an idea of those times:\n \"Looking toward Jiankang city\"\n \"the little river flows against the current\"\n \"in front, one sees sons killing fathers\"\n \"and behind, one sees younger brothers killing older brothers\" \nEmperor Xiaowu died of natural causes in 464 and was succeeded by his son, who became Emperor Qianfei. Emperor Qianfei proved to be similar to his father, engaging in both kin-slaughter and incest. In a scandalous move, because his sister complained about how it was unfair that men were allowed 10,000 concubines, he gave her 30 handsome young men as lovers. His uncle Liu Yu, the Prince of Xiangdong, whom he called the \"Prince of Pigs\" for his obesity, eventually assassinated him and became Emperor Ming.\nEmperor Ming began his reign by killing all of the descendants of Emperor Xiaowu, and his suspicious nature resulted in the loss of the provinces north of the Huai River, which were only briefly regained in the other Southern dynasties. Emperor Ming's young son became Emperor Houfei. The political situation was volatile. General Xiao Daocheng slowly gained power and eventually deposed Emperor Houfei in favor of his brother, who became Emperor Shun. After defeating the rival general Shen Youzhi, Xiao forced Emperor Shun to yield the throne and crowned himself Emperor Gao of Southern Qi, thus ending the Liu Song dynasty.\nSouthern Qi (479\u2013502).\nThough distantly related, the Southern Qi and the Liang dynasty that followed were members of the Xiao () family from Lanling (, in modern-day Cangshan County, Shandong). Because Emperor Gao had a low social standing, he earned the disdain of nobility. His style of governance was similar to the early style of the Liu Song dynasty and was very economical. He died in the fourth year of his reign and his heir, who was only 13 years younger than him, succeeded him as Emperor Wu of Southern Qi. Emperor Wu made peace with the Northern Wei, content to protect his borders. This period of peace was known as the Yongming Administration. He also used government secretaries appointed with provincial governors and members of the imperial clan to monitor them. \nThe short reigns of Emperor Wu's grandsons, Xiao Zhaoye and Xiao Zhaowen (his first son predeceased him), were dominated by Xiao Luan, Emperor's Wu's first cousin. He killed them in turn and crowned himself as Emperor Ming. Using the government secretaries, he slaughtered all the sons of Emperors Gao and Wu. Emperor Ming soon became very ill and started following Daoism, changing his whole wardrobe to red. He also passed an edict making officials try to find whitebait (\u9280\u9b5a). He died in 498 and was succeeded by his son Xiao Baojuan, who killed high-ranking officials and governors at whim, sparking many revolts. The final revolt in 501 started after Xiao Baojuan killed his prime minister Xiao Yi, leading his brother Xiao Yan to revolt under the banner of Xiao Baojuan's brother, Xiao Baorong, who was declared Emperor He. Xiao Baojuan was killed by one of his generals during the siege of his capital at Jiankang. After a short puppet reign by Emperor He, Xiao Yan overthrew the Southern Qi and established the Liang dynasty.\nLiang (502\u2013557).\nEmperor Wu was economical, worked hard at governing, and cared for the common people. His early reign was known as the Reign of Tianjian. The Liang dynasty's military strength gradually surpassed the strength of the Northern Wei, who suffered internal strife due to their policy of sinicization. In 503, the Northern Wei invaded but were defeated at Zhongli (modern-day Bengbu). Emperor Wu supported the Northern Expeditions but did not aggressively take advantage of his victory in 516 at Shouyang due to heavy casualties. Given the excessive kin-slaughter in the Liu Song and Southern Qi dynasties, Emperor Wu was very lenient to imperial clansmen, not investigating them even when they committed crimes. The Liang reached a cultural peak because he was very learned, supported scholars, and encouraged the flourishing education system. An avid poet, Emperor Wu was fond of gathering many literary talents at court, and even held poetry competitions with prizes of gold or silk for those considered the best.\nIn his later years, however, sycophants surrounded him. Three times he dedicated his life to Buddhism and tried to become a monk, but each time he was persuaded to return by extravagant court donations to Buddhism. Furthermore, since Buddhists and Daoists were exempt from taxation, nearly half of the population fraudulently named themselves as such, badly damaging state finances. Imperial clansmen and officials were also greedy and wasteful.\nEmperor Wu was willing to accept generals who defected from Northern Wei. When the Northern Wei suffered major revolts in their northern garrison towns, he sent his general Chen Qingzhi to support the pretender Yuan Hao. Despite the fact that Chen was only given 7,000 troops, he still managed to defeat army after army and even captured Luoyang, the capital of Northern Wei. Ultimately, Chen was insufficiently supplied and was defeated by troops ten times his size. After the Northern Wei split into Eastern and Western Wei, Emperor Wu granted asylum to rebel Eastern Wei commander Hou Jing, sending him on Northern Expeditions against Eastern Wei. After some initial successes, Liang forces were decisively defeated. Rumors abounded that Emperor Wu intended to give Hou as a peace offering. Despite Emperor Wu's assurances, Hou decided to rebel in the name of Xiao Dong, the grandson of the former crown prince Xiao Tong, who died in 531 and was removed from being crown prince because of conflicts with his father. Hou surprised Emperor Liang by besieging the Liang capital at Jiankang. Attempts by Liang forces to break the siege failed, and Emperor Wu was forced to negotiate a ceasefire and peace. However, Hou thought that peace was unsustainable, so he broke the ceasefire and captured the palace, leading to the slaughter of the nearby populace. Emperor Wu was starved to death and after the short puppet reigns of crown prince Xiao Gang and Xiao Dong, Hou seized power and established the Han dynasty.\nIn spite of conquering Jiankang, Hou essentially only controlled the nearby areas. The rest of the Liang dynasty lands were under the control of members of the imperial clan. Their squabbling amongst themselves weakened their efforts to defeat Hou. In the end, Xiao Yi, with the aid of his generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, defeated Hou, crowning himself Emperor Yuan. His brother Xiao Ji, based in Sichuan, however, was still a major threat. Emperor Yuan asked for assistance from Western Wei to defeat Xiao Ji, but after subduing him, they kept Sichuan. Due to a diplomatic faux pas, he incited the anger of Yuwen Tai, the leading general of Western Wei, which resulted in him being deposed and dying. Western Wei set up the puppet state of Western Liang with capital at Jiangling. Northern Qi also had designs on the Liang throne and sent an expedition under the banner of a cousin of Emperor Yuan. Chen Baxian and Wang Sengbian set up the last surviving son of Emperor Yuan, Xiao Fangzhi, as Liang ruler, but he was not given the imperial title. After some defeats to the forces of Northern Qi, Wang Sengbian allowed their pretender, Xiao Yuanming to establish himself as Emperor Min of Liang. However, Chen Baxian was displeased with the arrangements, and in a surprise move killed Wang and deposed Emperor Min in favor of Xiao Fangzhi who became Emperor Jing of Liang. After a short reign, Chen deposed Emperor Jing and took power himself as Emperor Wu of Chen in 557.\nChen (557\u2013589).\nEmperor Wu of Chen came from the region of Wu (a region near modern-day Shanghai). At that time, due to the Hou Jing rebellion, the Qiao and Wu clans were greatly weakened, and many independent regimes emerged. Emperor Wu could not pacify all the independent regimes, so he adopted conciliatory measures. After the sudden death of Emperor Wu, his nephew Chen Qian took power as Emperor Wen of Chen. After the fall of Liang, the general Wang Lin had established an independent kingdom based in modern-day Hunan and Hubei provinces and was now starting to cause trouble. Wang Lin allied with Northern Zhou and Northern Qi to conquer the Chen capital at Jiankang. Emperor Wen first defeated the combined forces of Northern Qi and Wang Lin before preventing the forces of Northern Zhou from entering the South at Yueyang. Furthermore, through Emperor Wen's extensive efforts at good governance, the economic situation of the South was greatly improved, restoring his kingdom's national strength.\nFollowing the death of Emperor Wen, his son, the weak-willed Chen Bozong, took power and became Emperor Fei. His uncle, Chen Xu, after essentially controlling the country through his short reign, eventually deposed him and took power as Emperor Xuan. At that time, the Northern Zhou intended to conquer the Northern Qi and thus invited the Chen dynasty to help. Emperor Xuan agreed to help because he wanted to recover the lost territories south of the Huai River. In 573, he sent general Wu Mingche to assist the effort; in two years, he managed to recover he lost territories south of the Huai River. At the time, the Northern Qi was in a precarious situation with little military strength. Emperor Xuan could have taken advantage of the opportunity to defeat the Northern Qi entirely. However, he only wanted to protect his territories south of the Huai River. The Northern Zhou took advantage of the Northern Qi's weakness instead, and following their defeat of the Northern Qi, in 577, they sent troops to the territories south of the Huai River, where they decisively defeated the Chen dynasty forces. The Chen dynasty was in imminent danger.\nIn a stroke of fortune, Northern Zhou's Emperor Wu suddenly died and his general Yang Jian attempted to take the throne. This stopped the southern advance of the northern troops. The respite was short though, as after Yang Jian defeated his rival General Yuchi Jiong, he usurped the throne from Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou and established the Sui dynasty, crowning himself Emperor Wen of Sui. He proceeded to invade the south to reunify China. Emperor Xuan had just died and his incompetent son Chen Shubao (Houzhu of Chen) took power. He was licentious and wasteful, resulting in chaos and corruption in the government; many officials heavily exploited the people, causing great suffering. In planning to defeat the Chen dynasty, Emperor Wen of Sui took the suggestion of his general Gao Jiong and waited until the South were harvesting their crops to entirely burn the farmland, crippling the strength of the Chen dynasty. In 588, Emperor Wen of Sui sent his son Yang Guang (who would become Emperor Yang of Sui) to finally vanquish the Chen dynasty. Chen Shubao relied on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River and continued as always with his festive and licentious activities. The next year, Sui forces captured the Chen capital of Jiankang. Chen Shubao and his favorite concubine Zhang Lihua attempted to hide in a well but eventually were captured by Sui forces, thus ending the Chen dynasty.\nDiplomacy.\nAfter the failure of the Liu Song's efforts to form an alliance with the Rouran, Goguryeo, Tuyuhun and smaller local powers to defeat the Northern Wei, the North and South were forced into tacitly acknowledging their equal status, for example, by granting each other the highest positions as the most esteemed envoys. As the \"Wei Shu\" and \"Song Shu\" testify, there was a shift from imperial rhetoric denouncing the other side as illegitimate barbarians, towards a new conception referring to the two as distinct 'Northern' and Southern' parallels, using unique local customs to distinguish themselves and compete for legitimacy.\nDemographics.\nIt was during the Northern and Southern dynasties period that the earliest recorded mass migration of ethnic Han to southern China (south of the Yangtze River) took place. This sinicization helped to develop the region from its previous state of being inhabited by isolated communities separated by vast uncolonized wilderness and other non-Han ethnic groups. During this period, the south went from being nearly a frontier to being on a path to the thriving, urbanized, sinicized region that it became in later centuries. In his book \"Buddhism in Chinese History\", Arthur F. Wright points out this fact by stating:\n\"When we speak of the area of the Yangtze valley and below in the period of disunion, we must banish from our minds the picture of the densely populated, intensively cultivated South China of recent centuries. When the aristocrats of the remnants of the Chin [Jin] ruling house fled to the Nanking [Nanjing] area early in the 4th century, the south contained perhaps a tenth of the population of China. There were centers of Chinese culture and administration, but around most of these lay vast uncolonized areas into which Chinese settlers were slow to move\".\nDuring the Northern and Southern dynasties, the Yangtze valley transformed from a backwater frontier region with less than 25% of China's population to a major cultural center of China with 40% of China's population. After China was subsequently unified under the Tang dynasty, it became the core area of Chinese culture.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nWhen the Jin court fled south, they continued to speak in the refined common language, \"tongyu\", from the Central Plains in the North, which was regarded as highly prestigious. However, many local southern Chinese resisted adopting the speech of the newcomers. During the Southern dynasties period, beginning in the mid-4th century and spreading widely by the 5th century, elite northern emigres and southern locals around the capital of Jiankang developed a new elite speech form, with clearly distinctive pronunciation and phrasing that set it apart from the Central Plains speech. However, some of the emigres also resisted this new trend to \"prize the speech of Wu\", which they regarded as \"seductive and frivolous\". Meanwhile, the process of Han Chinese courtiers learning Xianbei and Xianbei learning Chinese led to the court speech of the North changing as well. By the 6th century, southern elites looked down on the accent of Luoyang as \"crude and clumsy\".\nPhilosophy.\nConfucianism's unchallenged domination of Chinese culture and thought was greatly weakened during the Jin dynasty, which led to a wide diversification of political thought and philosophy by the time of the Northern and Southern dynasties. This era produced a myriad of writers that advocated practical systems of governance and administration, such as Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms Period, Wang Dao and Bao Jingyan of the Eastern Jin, as well as Fan Zhen, Xing Shao (), and Fan Xun () of the Northern and Southern dynasties period. Much of the philosophy of the period is despondent and dispirited, and a number of scholars and poets became reclusive mountain hermits living apart from society. Of these various trends, the most influential was Neo-Daoism (). Neo-Daoism was highly influential during the Southern Dynasty, to the point that Emperor Wen of Liu Song established a Neo-Daoist Academy and promoted it, along with Confucianism, literature, and history, as the four great subjects of study. A phenomenon known as \"empty chat\" () became common, where educated men would meet and talk about philosophy all day without paying any attention to \"mundane\" things such as their profession or family. The phenomenon gradually waned during the Sui dynasty, though it did not fully disappear until the Tang dynasty.\nLiterature.\nLiterature was particularly vibrant during the Southern Dynasty and tended to be flowery and frilly, while Northern Dynasty literature was rougher and more straightforward. Notable writers include Yu Xin, Xing Fang, Wei Shou, and Wen Zisheng of the Northern Dynasty. In poetry, \"fu\" poetry continued to be a dominant genre, though the five-syllable form that achieved great prominence during the Tang dynasty gradually increased in popularity. In the Southern Dynasty, a type of essay known as \"pianwen\", which used metered rhyme, flowery language, and classical allusions, became popular. Writings often spoke of removing oneself from everyday material existence and jettisoning cares and anxiety.\nPoets of the Northern and Southern dynasties focused on imitating older classical poets of Ancient China, formalizing the rhyme patterns and meters that governed poem composition. However, scholars realized that ancient songs and poems, like those of the Shijing, in many instances no longer rhymed due to sound shifts over the previous centuries.\nThe introduction of Buddhism to China, which began in the late Han dynasty and continued through the Tang dynasty, introduced Chinese scholars to Sanskrit. The Brahmi script, with its sophisticated phonological organization, arrived in China in the 5th century, and was studied by Xie Lingyun, who produced a (since-lost) glossary of Chinese transcriptions of Sanskrit terms \"arranged according to the 14 sounds\".\nThe four tones of early Middle Chinese were first described by Shen Yue and Zhou Yong.\nOther arts.\nThe southern dynasties of China were rich in cultural achievement, with the flourishing of Buddhism and Daoism, especially the latter as two new canons of scriptural writings were created for the Supreme Purity sect and its rival the Numinous Treasure Sect. The southern Chinese were influenced greatly by the writings of Buddhist monks such as Huiyuan, who applied familiar Daoist terms to describe Buddhism for other Chinese. The Chinese were in contact and influenced by cultures of India and trading partners farther south, such as the kingdoms of Funan and Champa (located in modern-day Cambodia and Vietnam).\nThe sophistication and complexity of the Chinese arts of poetry, calligraphy, painting, and playing of music reached new heights during this age. The earlier Cao Zhi, son of Cao Cao, is regarded as one of the greatest poets of his day. His style and deep emotional expression in writing influenced later poets of this new age, such as Tao Qian (365\u2013427) or Tao Yuanming. Even during his lifetime, the written calligraphy of the \"Sage of Calligraphy\", Wang Xizhi (307\u2013365), was prized by many and considered a true form of personal expression like other arts. Painting became highly prized with artists such as Gu Kaizhi (344\u2013406), who largely established the tradition of landscape art in classical Chinese painting (to learn more, refer to the \"Far East\" section of the article for Painting).\nInstitutions of learning in the south were also renowned, including the Zongmingguan (Imperial Nanjing University), where the famed Zu Chongzhi (mentioned above) had studied. Zu Chongzhi devised the new Daming Calendar in 465, calculated one year as 365.24281481 days (which is very close to 365.24219878 days as we know today), and calculated the number of overlaps between sun and moon as 27.21223 (which is very close to 27.21222 as we know today). Using this number he successfully predicted 4 eclipses during a period of 23 years (from 436 to 459).\nAlthough multiple-story towers such as guard towers and residential apartments existed in previous periods, during this period the distinct Chinese pagoda tower (for storing Buddhist scriptures) evolved from the stupa, the latter originating from Buddhist traditions of protecting sutras in ancient India.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They constitute one of 203 First Nations in British Columbia and 231 federally recognized tribes in Alaska.\nTheir traditional territory include Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off the coast of British Columbia, and the southern half of Prince of Wales Island, in Southeast Alaska. Their language is Haida, a linguistic isolate. The Haida are known for their craftsmanship, trading skills, and seamanship. They are known to have frequently carried out raids and to have practiced slavery.\nIn Canada, the Haida are represented by Council of the Haida Nation (CHN), in addition to the two village band governments, Old Massett Village Council and Skidegate Band Council. Federally recognized Haida tribes in the United States include the Central Council of the Tlingit &amp; Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska and the Hydaburg Cooperative Association.\nHistory.\nPre-contact.\nHaida history begins with the arrival of the primordial ancestresses of the Haida matrilineages in Haida Gwaii. These include SGuuluu Jaad (Foam Woman), Jiila Kuns (Creek Woman), and KalGa Jaad (Ice woman). The Haida canon of oral histories and archaeological findings agree that Haida ancestors lived alongside glaciers and were present at the time of the arrival of the first tree, a lodgepole pine, on Haida Gwaii. Recent archaeological evidence suggests habitation as early as 13,100 BP.\nFor thousands of years since Haida have participated in a rigorous coast-wide legal system called Potlatch. After the Island's wide arrival of red cedar some 7,500 years ago Haida society transformed to centre around the coastal \"tree of life\". Massive carved cedar monuments and cedar big houses became widespread throughout Haida Gwaii.\nIn the early 18th century, Haida from K'iis Gwaii in the Duu Guusd region of Haida Gwaii migrated north, settling at the southern half of Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, next to Tlingit territory. This group would become known as the Kaigani Haida.\n18th century.\nThe first recorded contact between the Haida and Europeans was in July 1774 with Spanish explorer Juan P\u00e9rez, who was sailing north on an expedition to find and claim new territory for Spain. For two days in a row, the Santiago sat off the shore of Haida Gwaii waiting for the currents to settle down enough to allow them to dock and set foot on land. While they waited, several canoes of Haida sailed out to greet them, and ultimately to trade with P\u00e9rez and his men. After two days of poor conditions, however, the Santiago was ultimately unable to dock and they were forced to depart without having set foot on Haida Gwaii.\nThe Haida conducted regular trade with Russian, Spanish, British, and American maritime fur traders and whalers. According to sailing records, they diligently maintained strong trade relationships with Westerners, coastal people, and among themselves. Trade for sea-otter pelts was initiated by British Captain George Dixon with the Haida in 1787. The Haida did well for themselves in this industry and until the mid-1800s they were at the centre of the profitable China sea-otter trade.\nAlthough they had gone on expeditions as far as Washington State, at first they had minimal confrontations with Europeans. Between 1780 and 1830, the Haida came into conflict with European and American traders. Among the dozens of ships the tribe captured were the \"Eleanor\" and the \"Susan Sturgis\". The tribe made use of European weapons they acquired, using cannons and canoe-mounted swivel guns.\n19th century.\nIn 1850, gold was discovered on southern Haida Gwaii. The Haida had been instructed to look for the mineral by the Hudson's Bay Company. A Haida man, possibly Albert Edenshaw, was shown where to find gold by an elderly woman in Skidegate, which he subsequently brought to officers at Fort Simpson. This discovery instigated a brief gold rush in 1851, drawing American prospectors to the area. The Haida themselves took an active role in the mining of gold, seeing it as a new material for trade. In response to the gold rush, British colonial authorities formally annexed Haida Gwaii in 1853, establishing the Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands. It was later integrated into the Colony of British Columbia in 1858. Colonial authorities backed their claims using gunboat diplomacy, both in Haida Gwaii and more broadly throughout northeastern Pacific coastal Indigenous title territories.\nAlso in 1857, the was sent from Seattle to nearby Port Gamble, where indigenous raiding parties made up of Haida (from territory claimed by the British) and Tongass (from territory claimed by the Russians) had been attacking and enslaving the Coast Salish people there. When the Haida and Tongass (sea lion tribe Tlingit) warriors refused to acknowledge American jurisdiction and to hand over those among them who had attacked the Puget Sound communities, a battle ensued in which 26 natives and one government soldier were killed. In the aftermath of this, Colonel Isaac Ebey, a U.S. military officer and the first settler on Whidbey Island, was shot and beheaded on August 11, 1857, by a small Tlingit group from Kake, Alaska, in retaliation for the killing of a respected Kake chief in the raid the year before. Ebey's scalp was purchased from the Kake by an American trader in 1860.\nSmallpox epidemic of 1862.\nThe 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic began on March 26 when a steamship called \"Brother Jonathan\" arrived in Fort Victoria from San Francisco containing a passenger infected with smallpox. At the time, thousands of Indigenous people lived in villages outside the walls of Fort Victoria. The disease broke out amongst Tsimshian people in their community near Fort Victoria. This quickly spread into a pandemic. European public health standards at the time were well practiced and adhered-to official health standards, including vaccinations and victims isolation. Instead, as the disease spread, Victoria Police burned some one dozen homes, deliberately displacing 200 Haida on May 13. They went on to burn some 40\u201350 more indigenous villages the following day.\nFirst Nations from further north had been camping periodically outside the city limits of Victoria to take advantage of trade, and at the time of the epidemic numbered almost 2000, many of whom were Haida. The colonial government made no effort to vaccinate the First Nations in the region nor to quarantine anyone infected. In June, the encampments were forcibly cleared by police, and 20 canoes of Haidas, many of whom were likely already infected with smallpox, were forced back to Haida Gwaii, escorted by gunboats HMS \"Grappler\" and \"Forward\". Those infected did not make it home, according to the plans of the colonial governments, and passed on at Bones Bay near Alert Bay.\nLater on a group of copper miners travelled from Bella Coola aboard the \"Leonede\" under command of Captain McAlmond. The boat took 12 passengers in December. One of these passengers carried smallpox to Haida Gwaii. This might not have been a disaster should the infected miner have stayed in isolation at the mining site on , or Skincuttle Island. Instead the disease was spread throughout Haida Gwaii.\nThe disease quickly spread throughout Haida Gwaii, devastating entire villages and families, and creating an influx of refugees. The pre-epidemic population of Haida Gwaii was estimated to be 6,607, but was reduced to 829 in 1881. The only two remaining villages were Massett and Skidegate. The population collapse caused by the epidemic weakened Haida sovereignty and power, ultimately paving the way for colonization.\nArrival of missionaries.\nFrom the mid-19th century onwards, both Anglican and Methodist missions were established on Haida Gwaii, endeavouring to convert the Haida people. The first known missionary to spend time with the Haida was Jonathan Green, a missionary for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Green spent a few weeks on Haida Gwaii in the summer of 1829, though his later suggestions for the establishment of a mission on the coast were ignored.\nIn 1854 and 1868, two different Anglican missionaries tried garner support for the establishment of a mission on Haida Gwaii, to no avail. In the 1860s, several Northern Haida visited the newly founded Tsimshian community of Metlakatla, by Anglican missionary William Duncan, prompting them to request a missionary of their own. It wouldn't be until November 1876, Anglican missionary William Collison, acting on behalf of the Church Mission Society, established the first permanent mission on Haida Gwaii, located in Masset. In response to the Anglican mission established in Masset, the Haida in Skidegate petitioned for their own mission. Consequently, a Methodist mission was established there in 1883.\nPotlatch ban.\nThe potlatch () began to decline with the arrival of the missionaries, who believed it to be antithetical to their mission of converting the Haida to Christianity. Missionaries like Collison sought to replace the potlatch with Christian ceremonies, such as the singing of hymns. Others, like Methodist Charles Harrison, dissuaded potlatching through public chastisement. By the 1880s, potlatches were often conducted in secrecy, primarily as a result of pressure exerted by missionaries.\nIn 1884, the potlatch was outlawed throughout the coast, under an amendment to the Indian Act, known as the potlatch ban. The elimination of the potlatch system destroyed financial relationships and seriously interrupted the cultural heritage of coastal people. As the islands were christianized, many cultural works such as totem posts were destroyed or taken to museums around the world. This significantly undermined Haida's self-knowledge and further diminished morale.\n20th century.\nThe government began forcibly sending some Haida children to residential schools as early as 1911. Haida children were sent as far away as Alberta to live among English-speaking families where they were to be assimilated into the dominant culture.\nIn 1911, Canada and British Columbia rejected a Haida offer whereby in exchange for full rights of British citizenship Haidas would formally join the Dominion of Canada.\nLyell Island protests.\nIn November 1985, members of the Haida nation protested the ongoing logging of old-growth forests on Haida Gwaii, establishing a blockade to prevent the logging of Lyell Island by Western Forest Products. A standoff between protesters, police and loggers lasted two weeks, during which 72 Haidas were arrested. Images of elders being arrested gained media traction, which raised awareness and support for the Haida across Canada. In 1987, the governments of Canada and British Columbia signed the \"South Moresby Agreement,\" establishing the Gwaii Haanas National Park, which is cooperatively managed by the Canadian government and the Haida Nation.\nThe blockade was profiled in Christopher Auchter's 2024 documentary film \"The Stand\".\n21st century.\nIn December 2009, the government of British Columbia officially renamed the archipelago from Queen Charlotte Islands to Haida Gwaii. The Haida Nation asserts Haida title over all of Haida Gwaii and is pursuing negotiations with the provincial and federal governments. Haida authorities continue to pass legislation and manage human activities in Haida Gwaii, which includes making formal agreements with the Canadian communities established on the islands. Haida efforts are largely directed at the protection of land and water and functioning ecosystems and this is expressed in the protected status for nearly 70% of the million-hectare archipelago. The protected status applies to the landscape and water as well as smaller culturally significant areas. They have also forced a reduction of large-scale industrial activity and the careful regulation of access to resources.\nIn British Columbia, the term \"Haida Nation\" often refers to the Haida people as a whole however, it also refers to their government, the Council of the Haida Nation. All people of Haida ancestry are entitled to Haida citizenship, including the Kaigani, who as Alaskans are also part of the Central Council Tlingit Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska government.\nIn a deal negotiated between the government and the Haida nation over the preceding decades, British Columbia in 2024 transferred the title of more than 200 islands off Canada's west coast to the Haida people, recognizing the nation's aboriginal land title across all of Haida Gwaii.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nThe Haida language is considered to be an isolate. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Haida was de facto banned with the introduction of residential schools and the enforcement of the use of English language. Haida language revitalization projects began in the 1970s and continue to this day. It is estimated that there are only 3 or 4 dozen Haida-speaking people with almost all of them being the age of 70 or older.\nPotlatch.\nHaida host potlatches which were intricate economic and social-political processes that include acquisition of incorporeal wealth like names and the circulation of property in the form of gifts. They are often held when a citizen wishes to commemorate an event of importance. For example, deaths of a loved one, marriages, and other civil proceedings. The more important potlatches take years to prepare and can continue for days.\nArt.\nHaida society continues to produce a robust and highly stylized art form, a leading component of Northwest Coast art. While artists frequently have expressed this in large wooden carvings (totem poles), Chilkat weaving, or ornate jewellery, in the 21st century, younger people are also making art in a popular expression such as Haida manga.\nThe Haida also created \"notions of wealth\", and Jenness credits them with the introduction of the totem pole (Haida: \"\") and the bentwood box. Missionaries regarded the carved poles as graven images rather than representations of the family histories that wove Haida society together. Chiefly families showed their histories by erecting totems outside their homes, or on house posts forming the building.\nWell known contemporary Haida artists include Bill Reid, Robert Davidson, Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas, and Freda Diesing amongst others.\nTransformation masks.\nTransformation masks were worn ceremonially, used by dancers and represented or illustrated the connection between various spirits. The masks usually depicted an animal transforming into another animal or a spiritual or mythical being. Masks were representations of the souls of the mask owner's family waiting in the afterlife to be reborn. Masks worn during ceremonial dances were designed with strings to open the mask, transforming the spiritual animal into a carving of the ancestor underneath. There was also an emphasis on the idea of metamorphosis and reincarnation. With the banning of potlatches by the Canadian government in 1885, many masks were confiscated. Masks and many other objects are considered sacred and designed only for specific people to see. It was unknown who the wearer of the mask was as each mask was made for each individual's soul and spirit animal. Due to the confiscation of the masks and the sacred meaning to each individual who wore the mask, it is unknown if the masks in museums are truly meant to be seen or if they are an aspect of European colonialism and the rejection of Haida religious and spiritual traditions.\nFilm.\nIn 2018, the first feature-length Haida-language film, \"The Edge of the Knife\" (), was released, with an all-Haida cast. The actors learned Haida for their performances in the film, with a two-week training camp followed by lessons throughout the five weeks of filming. Haida artist Gwaai Edenshaw and Tsilhqot'in filmmaker Helen Haig-Brown directed, with Edenshaw and his brother being co-screenwriters, with Graham Richard and Leonie Sandercock.\nChristopher Auchter, the nephew of Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas, has created a number of Haida centered films. In 2017 he directed the animated film \"The Mountain of SGaana\", inspired by Haida mythology. His short documentary \"Now Is the Time\" premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.\nSocial organization.\nMoieties.\nThe Haida nation was split between two moieties, the Raven and the Eagle. Marriages between two people from the same moiety were prohibited. Due to this any children that were born after the marriage would officially become part of the moiety that the mother had come from. Each group provided its members with entitlement to a vast range of economic resources such as fishing spots, hunting or collecting areas, and housing sites. Each group also had rights to their own myths and legends, dances, songs, and music. Eagles and Ravens were very important to the Haida families as they would identify with one or the other and this would signify what side on the village they would reside on. The family would also own their own property, had specific areas for food gathering. These categories of Eagles and Ravens divided them on an even larger scale, specifying their land, history, and customs.\nThe Haida social system changed significantly by the end of the nineteenth century. At this point a majority of the Haida had taken nuclear family forms, and members of families belonging in the same moiety (Ravens and Eagles) were permitted to marry each other.\nGender.\nThe roles of the family varied between men and women. Men were responsible for all of the hunting and fishing, building homes and carving canoes and totem poles. The women's responsibilities were to stay close to home doing a majority of their work on the land. Women were responsible for all of the chores in relation to the keeping of the home. Women were also in charge of curing cedarwood to use for weaving and making clothes. It was also the duty of the women to gather berries and dig for shellfish and clams.\nOnce a boy hit puberty, his uncles on his mothers' side would educate him on his family history and how to behave now that he was a man. It was believed that a special diet would increase his abilities. For example, duck tongues helped him hold his breath under water, whereas blue jay tongues helped him to be a strong climber.\nThe aunts on the father's side of a young Haida woman would teach her about her duties to her tribe once she first began to menstruate. The young woman would go to a secluded space in her family home. They believed that by making her sleep on a stone pillow and only allowing her to eat and drink small amounts she would become tougher.\nAlthough not commonly practiced today, it was once customary for young boys and girls entering puberty to embark on vision quests. These quests would send them out alone for days. They would travel through the forests, in hopes of finding a spirit to guide them through their lives. It was believed that boys and girls who were destined for greatness could find unique spirit guides. A successful vision quest was celebrated by the wearing of masks, face paints, and costumes.\nReligion.\nHaida beliefs are varied and diverse. Modern Haida ascribe to a wide variety of faiths including Protestantism, Catholicism, and Bah\u00e1'i. Nihilist, atheist, agnostic, and absurdist perspectives also attend the nation's post-colonial context. Pre-colonial beliefs, however, may still be most popular, and potlatch maintains its elevated situation in Haida society.\nMany Haida believe in an ultimate being called \"Ne-kilst-lass\", spelt Nang Kilsdlaas in Skidegate dialect, which can manifest through the form and antics of a Raven. \"Ne-kilst-lass\" revealed the world and was an active player in the creation of life. While \"Ne-kilst-lass\" has a generous inclination, they also includes a darker, indulgent, and trickster quality.\nNang Kilsldaas is one of many dozens of supernatural beings who personify a wide variety of forces, objects, places, and phenomena. A few of the most prevalent include K_ing.gii, a deity who presides over the seas; X_yuu, the northeast wind; and Sin SG_aanuwee, a cosmological \"super-being\" that encompasses all others.\nWarfare.\nPrior to contact with Europeans, other Indigenous communities regarded the Haida as aggressive warriors and made attempts to avoid sea battles with them. There is some archeological evidence that the Northwest coast tribes, to which the Haida belong, engaged in warfare as early as 2200 BC, although it was not a regular occurrence in the archeological record until the subsequent millennium. Though the Haida were more likely to participate in sea battles, it was not uncommon for them to engage in hand-to-hand combat or long-range attacks. Hostilities were not always violent, often ritualized and some resulting in Peace Treaties still in force hundreds of years later.\nArcheological and written evidence of warfare.\nAnalyses of skeletal injuries dating from the late Archaic period and early Formative period show that Northwest coast nations, particularly in the North where most Haida communities were situated, began more frequently engaging in battles of some sort from 1800 BC to AD 500, though the number of battles is unknown. This rise in the incidence of battles during the Middle Pacific period also correlates with the erection of the first defensive fortifications in Haida communities. These fortifications continued to be in use during the 18th century as evidenced by Captain James Cook's discovery of one such hilltop fortification in a Haida village. Numerous other sightings of such fortifications were recorded by other European explorers during this century.\nCauses of warfare.\nThere were multiple motivations for the Haida people to engage in warfare. Various accounts explain that the Haida went to battle more for revenge than anything else, and would acquire slaves from their enemies in the process. According to the anthropologist Margaret Blackman, warfare on Haida Gwaii was primarily motivated by revenge. Many Northwest coast legends tell of Haida communities raiding and fighting with neighbouring communities because of insults or other disputes. Other causes included conflicts over property, territory, resources, trade routes, and even women. However, a battle between a Haida community and another often did not have simply one cause. In fact, many battles were the result of decades old disputes.\nThe Haida, like several other Northwest coast Indigenous communities, engaged in slave raiding as slaves were highly sought after for their use as labor as well as bodyguards and warriors. During the 19th century, the Haida fought physically with other Indigenous communities to ensure domination of the fur trade with European merchants. Haida groups also had feuds with these European merchants that could last years. In 1789, some Haidas were accused of stealing items from Captain Kendrick, most of which included drying linen. Kendrick seized two Haida chiefs and threatened to kill them via cannon-fire if they did not return the stolen items. Though the Haida community complied at the time, less than two years later 100 to 200 of its people attacked the same ship.\nWar parties.\nThe missionary William Collison describes having seen a Haida fleet of around forty canoes. However, he does not provide the number of warriors in these canoes, and there are no other known accounts that describe the number of warriors in a war party. The structure of a Haida war party generally followed that of the community itself, the only difference being that the chief took the lead during battles; otherwise his title was more or less meaningless. Medicine men were often brought along raids or before battles to \"destroy the souls of enemies\" and ensure victory.\nDeath in battle.\nBattles between a group of Haida warriors and another community sometimes resulted in the annihilation of either one or both of the groups involved. Villages would be burned down during a battle which was a common practice during Northwest coast battles. The Haida burned their warriors who died in battles, though it is not known if this act was done after each battle or only after battles in which they were victorious. The Haida believed that fallen warriors went to the House of Sun, which was considered a highly honorable death. For this reason, a specially made military suit was prepared for chiefs if they fell in battle. The slaves belonging to the chiefs who died in battle were burned with them.\nWeapons used.\nThe Haida used the bow and arrow until it was replaced by firearms acquired from Europeans in the 19th century, but other traditional weapons were still preferred. The weapons that the Haida used were often multi-functional; they were used not only in battle, but during other activities as well. For instance, daggers were very common and almost always the weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat, and were also used during hunting and to create other tools. One medicine man's dagger that Alexander Mackenzie came across during his exploration of Haida Gwaii, was used both for fights and to hold the medicine man's hair up. Another dagger that Mackenzie obtained from a Haida village was said to be connected to a Haida legend; many daggers had individual histories which made them unique from one another.\nBattle armour.\nThe Haida wore rod-and-slat armour. This meant greaves for the thighs and lower back and slats (a long strip of wood) in the side pieces to allow for more flexibility during movement. They wore elk hide tunics under their armour and wooden helmets. Arrows could not penetrate this armour, and Russian explorers found that bullets could penetrate the armour only if shot from a distance of less than . The Haida rarely used shields because of their developed armour.\nAnthropologists and scholars.\nThis is an incomplete list of anthropologists and scholars who have done research on the Haida.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Subtraction is an operation that represents removal of objects from a collection. For example, in the adjacent picture, there are 5 \u2212 2 peaches\u2014meaning 5 peaches with 2 taken away, resulting in a total of 3 peaches. Therefore, the \"difference\" of 5 and 2 is 3; that is, 5 \u2212 2 = 3. While primarily associated with natural numbers in arithmetic, subtraction can also represent removing or decreasing physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, vectors, decimals, functions, and matrices.\nIn a sense, subtraction is the inverse of addition. That is, \"c\" = \"a\" \u2212 \"b\" if and only if \"c\" + \"b\" = \"a\". In words: the difference of two numbers is the number that gives the first one when added to the second one.\nSubtraction follows several important patterns. It is anticommutative, meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer. It is also not associative, meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers, the order in which subtraction is performed matters. Because 0 is the additive identity, subtraction of it does not change a number. Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations, such as addition and multiplication. All of these rules can be proven, starting with the subtraction of integers and generalizing up through the real numbers and beyond. General binary operations that follow these patterns are studied in abstract algebra.\nIn computability theory, considering subtraction is not well-defined over natural numbers, operations between numbers are actually defined using \"truncated subtraction\" or monus.\nNotation and terminology.\nSubtraction is usually written using the minus sign \"\u2212\" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals sign. For example, formula_8 (pronounced as \"two minus one equals one\") and formula_9 (pronounced as \"four minus six equals negative two\"). Nonetheless, some situations where subtraction is \"understood\", even though no symbol appears; in accounting, a column of two numbers, with the lower number in red, usually indicates that the lower number in the column is to be subtracted, with the difference written below, under a line.\nThe number being subtracted is the subtrahend, while the number it is subtracted from is the minuend. The result is the difference, that is:\nformula_10.\nAll of this terminology derives from Latin. \"Subtraction\" is an English word derived from the Latin verb \"subtrahere\", which in turn is a compound of \"sub\" \"from under\" and \"trahere\" \"to pull\". Thus, to subtract is to \"draw from below\", or to \"take away\". Using the gerundive suffix \"-nd\" results in \"subtrahend\", \"thing to be subtracted\". Likewise, from \"minuere\" \"to reduce or diminish\", one gets \"minuend\", which means \"thing to be diminished\".\nOf integers and real numbers.\nIntegers.\nImagine a line segment of length \"b\" with the left end labeled \"a\" and the right end labeled \"c\".\nStarting from \"a\", it takes \"b\" steps to the right to reach \"c\". This movement to the right is modeled mathematically by addition:\n\"a\" + \"b\" = \"c\".\nFrom \"c\", it takes \"b\" steps to the \"left\" to get back to \"a\". This movement to the left is modeled by subtraction:\n\"c\" \u2212 \"b\" = \"a\".\nNow, a line segment labeled with the numbers 1, 2, and 3. From position 3, it takes no steps to the left to stay at 3, so 3 \u2212 0 = 3. It takes 2 steps to the left to get to position 1, so 3 \u2212 2 = 1. This picture is inadequate to describe what would happen after going 3 steps to the left of position 3. To represent such an operation, the line must be extended.\nTo subtract arbitrary natural numbers, one begins with a line containing every natural number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). From 3, it takes 3 steps to the left to get to 0, so 3 \u2212 3 = 0. But 3 \u2212 4 is still invalid, since it again leaves the line. The natural numbers are not a useful context for subtraction.\nThe solution is to consider the integer number line (..., \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). This way, it takes 4 steps to the left from 3 to get to \u22121:\n3 \u2212 4 = \u22121.\nNatural numbers.\nSubtraction of natural numbers is not closed: the difference is not a natural number unless the minuend is greater than or equal to the subtrahend. For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches:\nReal numbers.\nThe field of real numbers can be defined specifying only two binary operations, addition and multiplication, together with unary operations yielding additive and multiplicative inverses. The subtraction of a real number (the subtrahend) from another (the minuend) can then be defined as the addition of the minuend and the additive inverse of the subtrahend. For example, 3 \u2212 \"\u03c0\" = 3 + (\u2212\"\u03c0\"). Alternatively, instead of requiring these unary operations, the binary operations of subtraction and division can be taken as basic.\nProperties.\nAnti-commutativity.\nSubtraction is anti-commutative, meaning that if one reverses the terms in a difference left-to-right, the result is the negative of the original result. Symbolically, if \"a\" and \"b\" are any two numbers, then\n\"a\" \u2212 \"b\" = \u2212(\"b\" \u2212 \"a)\".\nNon-associativity.\nSubtraction is non-associative, which comes up when one tries to define repeated subtraction. In general, the expression\n\"\"a\" \u2212 \"b\" \u2212 \"c\"\"\ncan be defined to mean either (\"a\" \u2212 \"b\") \u2212 \"c\" or \"a\" \u2212 (\"b\" \u2212 \"c\"), but these two possibilities lead to different answers. To resolve this issue, one must establish an order of operations, with different orders yielding different results.\nPredecessor.\nIn the context of integers, subtraction of one also plays a special role: for any integer \"a\", the integer (\"a\" \u2212 1) is the largest integer less than \"a\", also known as the predecessor of \"a\".\nUnits of measurement.\nWhen subtracting two numbers with units of measurement such as kilograms or pounds, they must have the same unit. In most cases, the difference will have the same unit as the original numbers.\nPercentages.\nChanges in percentages can be reported in at least two forms, percentage change and percentage point change. Percentage change represents the relative change between the two quantities as a percentage, while percentage point change is simply the number obtained by subtracting the two percentages.\nAs an example, suppose that 30% of widgets made in a factory are defective. Six months later, 20% of widgets are defective. The percentage change is = \u2212 = %, while the percentage point change is \u221210 percentage points.\nIn computing.\nThe method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only the addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators, and is still used in modern computers.\nTo subtract a binary number \"y\" (the subtrahend) from another number \"x\" (the minuend), the ones' complement of \"y\" is added to \"x\" and one is added to the sum. The leading digit \"1\" of the result is then discarded.\nThe method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing \"0\" to \"1\" and vice versa). And adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:\n 01100100 (x, equals decimal 100)\n - 00010110 (y, equals decimal 22)\nbecomes the sum:\n 01100100 (x)\n + 11101001 (ones' complement of y)\n + 1 (to get the two's complement)\n 101001110\nDropping the initial \"1\" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)\nThe teaching of subtraction in schools.\nMethods used to teach subtraction to elementary school vary from country to country, and within a country, different methods are adopted at different times. In what is known in the United States as traditional mathematics, a specific process is taught to students at the end of the 1st\u00a0year (or during the 2nd\u00a0year) for use with multi-digit whole numbers, and is extended in either the fourth or fifth grade to include decimal representations of fractional numbers.\nIn America.\nAlmost all American schools currently teach a method of subtraction using borrowing or regrouping (the decomposition algorithm) and a system of markings called crutches. Although a method of borrowing had been known and published in textbooks previously, the use of crutches in American schools spread after William A. Brownell published a study\u2014claiming that crutches were beneficial to students using this method. This system caught on rapidly, displacing the other methods of subtraction in use in America at that time.\nIn Europe.\nSome European schools employ a method of subtraction called the Austrian method, also known as the additions method. There is no borrowing in this method. There are also crutches (markings to aid memory), which vary by country.\nComparing the two main methods.\nBoth these methods break up the subtraction as a process of one digit subtractions by place value. Starting with a least significant digit, a subtraction of the subtrahend:\n\"s\"\"j\" \"s\"\"j\"\u22121 ... \"s\"1\nfrom the minuend\n\"m\"\"k\" \"m\"\"k\"\u22121 ... \"m\"1,\nwhere each \"s\"\"i\" and \"m\"\"i\" is a digit, proceeds by writing down \"m\"1 \u2212 \"s\"1, \"m\"2 \u2212 \"s\"2, and so forth, as long as \"s\"\"i\" does not exceed \"m\"\"i\". Otherwise, \"m\"\"i\" is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the minuend digit \"m\"\"i\"+1 by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards until there is a non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the subtrahend digit \"s\"\"i\"+1 by one.\nExample: 704 \u2212 512.\nThe minuend is 704, the subtrahend is 512. The minuend digits are \"m\"3 = 7, \"m\"2 = 0 and \"m\"1 = 4. The subtrahend digits are \"s\"3 = 5, \"s\"2 = 1 and \"s\"1 = 2. Beginning at the one's place, 4 is not less than 2 so the difference 2 is written down in the result's one's place. In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend's hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is not less than 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place. We are now done, the result is 192.\nThe Austrian method does not reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it increases the subtrahend hundreds digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by asking what number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundreds place.\nThere is an additional subtlety in that the student always employs a mental subtraction table in the American method. The Austrian method often encourages the student to mentally use the addition table in reverse. In the example above, rather than adding 1 to 5, getting 6, and subtracting that from 7, the student is asked to consider what number, when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7.\nSubtraction by hand.\nAustrian method.\nExample:\nSubtraction from left to right.\nExample:\nAmerican method.\nIn this method, each digit of the subtrahend is subtracted from the digit above it starting from right to left. If the top number is too small to subtract the bottom number from it, we add 10 to it; this 10 is \"borrowed\" from the top digit to the left, which we subtract 1 from. Then we move on to subtracting the next digit and borrowing as needed, until every digit has been subtracted. Example:\nTrade first.\nA variant of the American method where all borrowing is done before all subtraction.\nExample:\nPartial differences.\nThe partial differences method is different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs depending on whether the minuend is greater or smaller than the subtrahend. The sum of the partial differences is the total difference.\nExample:\nNonvertical methods.\nCounting up.\nInstead of finding the difference digit by digit, one can count up the numbers between the subtrahend and the minuend.\nExample:\n1234 \u2212 567 = can be found by the following steps:\nAdd up the value from each step to get the total difference: 3 + 30 + 400 + 234 = 667.\nBreaking up the subtraction.\nAnother method that is useful for mental arithmetic is to split up the subtraction into small steps.\nExample:\n1234 \u2212 567 = can be solved in the following way:\nSame change.\nThe same change method uses the fact that adding or subtracting the same number from the minuend and subtrahend does not change the answer. One simply adds the amount needed to get zeros in the subtrahend.\nExample:\n\"1234 \u2212 567 =\" can be solved as follows:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are a type of Indigenous Northwest Coast art, consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar, by First Nations and Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast including northern Northwest Coast Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian communities in Southeast Alaska and British Columbia, Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth communities in southern British Columbia, and the Coast Salish communities in Washington and British Columbia.\nThe word \"totem\" derives from the Algonquian word \"odoodem\" [] meaning \"(his) kinship group\". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate ancestors, cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of these various carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer's knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded. Contrary to common misconception, they are not worshipped or the subject of spiritual practice, nor were they were used by all Indigenous peoples in the Americas.\nHistory.\nTotem poles serve as important illustrations of family lineage and the cultural heritage of the Indigenous peoples in the islands and coastal areas of North America's Pacific Northwest, especially British Columbia, Canada, and coastal areas of Washington and southeastern Alaska in the United States. Families of traditional carvers come from the Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka\u2019wakw (Kwakiutl), Nuxalk (Bella Coola), and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka), among others. The poles are typically carved from the highly rot-resistant trunks of \"Thuja plicata\" trees (popularly known as giant cedar or western red cedar), which eventually decay in the moist, rainy climate of the coastal Pacific Northwest. Because of the region's climate and the nature of the materials used to make the poles, few examples carved before 1900 remain. Noteworthy examples, some dating as far back as 1880, include those at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, the Museum of Anthropology at UBC in Vancouver, the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, and the Totem Heritage Center in Ketchikan, Alaska.\nTotem poles are the largest, but not the only, objects that coastal Pacific Northwest natives use to depict spiritual reverence, family legends, sacred beings and culturally important animals, people, or historical events. The freestanding poles seen by the region's first European explorers were likely preceded by a long history of decorative carving. Stylistic features of these poles were borrowed from earlier, smaller prototypes, or from the interior support posts of house beams.\nAlthough 18th-century accounts of European explorers traveling along the coast indicate that decorated interior and exterior house posts existed prior to 1800, the posts were smaller and fewer in number than in subsequent decades. Prior to the 19th century, the lack of efficient carving tools, along with sufficient wealth and leisure time to devote to the craft, delayed the development of elaborately carved, freestanding poles. Before iron and steel arrived in the area, artists used tools made of stone, shells, or beaver teeth for carving. The process was slow and laborious; axes were unknown. By the late 18th century, the use of metal cutting tools enabled more complex carvings and increased production of totem poles. The tall monumental poles appearing in front of homes in coastal villages probably did not appear until after the beginning of the 19th century.\nEddie Malin has proposed that totem poles progressed from house posts, funerary containers, and memorial markers into symbols of clan and family wealth and prestige. He argues that the Haida people of the islands of Haida Gwaii originated carving of the poles, and that the practice spread outward to the Tsimshian and Tlingit, and then down the coast to the Indigenous people of British Columbia and northern Washington. Malin's theory is supported by the photographic documentation of the Pacific Northwest coast's cultural history and the more sophisticated designs of the Haida poles.\nAccounts from the 1700s describe and illustrate carved poles and timber homes along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. By the early 19th century, widespread importation of iron and steel tools from Great Britain, the United States, and elsewhere led to easier and more rapid production of carved wooden goods, including poles.\nIn the 19th century, American and European trade and settlement initially led to the growth of totem-pole carving, but United States and Canadian policies and practices of acculturation and assimilation caused a decline in the development of Alaska Native and First Nations cultures and their crafts, and sharply reduced totem-pole production by the end of the century. Between 1830 and 1880, the maritime fur trade, mining, and fisheries gave rise to an accumulation of wealth among the coastal peoples. Much of it was spent and distributed in lavish potlatch celebrations, frequently associated with the construction and erection of totem poles. The monumental poles commissioned by wealthy family leaders to represent their social status and the importance of their families and clans. In the 1880s and 1890s, tourists, collectors, scientists and naturalist interested in Indigenous culture collected and photographed totem poles and other artifacts, many of which were put on display at expositions such as the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978, the practice of Indigenous religion was outlawed, and traditional Indigenous cultural practices were also strongly discouraged by Christian missionaries. This included the carving of totem poles. Missionaries urged converts to cease production and destroy existing poles. Nearly all totem-pole-making had ceased by 1901. Carving of monumental and mortuary poles continued in some, more remote villages as late as 1905; however, as the original sites were abandoned, the poles and timber homes were left to decay and vandalism.\nBeginning in the late 1930s, a combination of cultural, linguistic, and artistic revivals, along with scholarly interest and the continuing fascination and support of an educated and empathetic public, led to a renewal and extension of this artistic tradition. In 1938 the United States Forest Service began a program to reconstruct and preserve the old poles, salvaging about 200, roughly one-third of those known to be standing at the end of the 19th century. With renewed interest in Indigenous arts and traditions in the 1960s and 1970s, freshly carved totem poles were erected up and down the coast, while related artistic production was introduced in many new and traditional media, ranging from tourist trinkets to masterful works in wood, stone, blown and etched glass, and other traditional and non-traditional media.\nIn June 2022 during the biennial Celebration festival in Juneau, Alaska, the Sealaska Heritage Institute unveiled the first 360-degree totem pole in Alaska: the \"Sealaska Cultural Values Totem Pole\". The structure, carved out of a 600-year-old cedar tree, \"represents all three tribes of Southeast Alaska \u2014 Ling\u00edt, Haida and Tsimshian.\"\nMeaning and purpose.\n \nTotem poles can symbolize characters and events in mythology, or convey the experiences of recent ancestors and living people. Some of these characters may appear as stylistic representations of objects in nature, while others are more realistically carved. Pole carvings may include animals, fish, plants, insects, and humans, or they may represent supernatural beings such as the Thunderbird. Some symbolize beings that can transform themselves into another form, appearing as combinations of animals or part-animal/part-human forms. Consistent use of a specific character over time, with some slight variations in carving style, helped develop similarities among these shared symbols that allowed people to recognize one from another. For example, the raven is symbolized by a long, straight beak, while the eagle's beak is curved, and a beaver is depicted with two large front teeth, a piece of wood held in his front paws, and a paddle-shaped tail. \nThe meanings of the designs on totem poles are as varied as the cultures that make them. Some poles celebrate cultural beliefs that may recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events, while others are mostly artistic. Animals and other characters carved on the pole are typically used as symbols to represent characters or events in a story; however, some may reference the moiety of the pole's owner, or simply fill up empty space on the pole. Depictions of thrusting tongues and linked tongues may symbolize socio-political power.\nThe carved figures interlock one above the other to create the overall design, which may rise to a height of or more. Smaller carvings may be positioned in vacant spaces, or they may be tucked inside the ears or hang out of the mouths of the pole's larger figures.\nSome of the figures on the poles constitute symbolic reminders of quarrels, murders, debts, and other unpleasant occurrences about which the Native Americans prefer to remain silent... The most widely known tales, like those of the exploits of Raven and of Kats who married the bear woman, are familiar to almost every native of the area. Carvings which symbolize these tales are sufficiently conventionalized to be readily recognizable even by persons whose lineage did not recount them as their own legendary history.\nPeople from cultures that do not carve totem poles often assume that the linear representation of the figures places the most importance on the highest figure, an idea that became pervasive in the dominant culture after it entered into mainstream parlance by the 1930s with the phrase \"low man on the totem pole\" (and as the title of a bestselling 1941 humor book by H. Allen Smith). However, Native sources either reject the linear component altogether, or reverse the hierarchy, with the most important representations on the bottom, bearing the weight of all the other figures, or at eye-level with the viewer to heighten their significance. Many poles have no vertical arrangement at all, consisting of a lone figure atop an undecorated column.\nTypes.\nThere are six basic types of upright, pole carvings that are commonly referred to as \"totem poles\"; not all involve the carving of what may be considered \"totem\" figures: house frontal poles, interior house posts, mortuary poles, memorial poles, welcome poles, and the ridicule or shame pole.\nHouse frontal poles.\nThis type of pole, usually tall is the most decorative. Its carvings tell the story of the family, clan or village who own them. These poles are also known as heraldic, crest, or family poles. Poles of this type are placed outside the clan house of the most important village leaders. Often, watchman figures are carved at the top of the pole to protect the pole owner's family and the village. Another type of house frontal pole is the entrance or doorway pole, which is attached to the center front of the home and includes an oval-shaped opening through the base that serves as the entrance to the clan house.\nHouse posts.\nThese interior poles, typically in height, are usually shorter than exterior poles. The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house and include a large notch at the top, where the beam can rest. A clan house may have two to four or more house posts, depending on the cultural group who built it. Carvings on these poles, like those of the house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device and help tell the story of the owners' family history. House posts were carved by the Coast Salish and were more common than the free-standing totem poles seen in Northern cultural groups.\nMortuary pole.\nThe rarest type of pole carving is a mortuary structure that incorporates grave boxes with carved supporting poles. It may include a recessed back to hold the grave box. These are among the tallest and most prominent poles, reaching in height. The Haida and Tlingit people erect mortuary poles at the death of important individuals in the community. These poles may have a single figure carved at the top, which may depict the clan's crest, but carvings usually cover its entire length. Ashes or the body of the deceased person are placed in the upper portion of the pole.\nMemorial pole.\nThis type of pole, which usually stands in front of a clan house, is erected about a year after a person has died. The clan chief's memorial pole may be raised at the center of the village. The pole's purpose is to honor the deceased person and identify the relative who is taking over as his successor within the clan and the community. Traditionally, the memorial pole has one carved figure at the top, but an additional figure may also be added at the bottom of the pole.\nMemorial poles may also commemorate an event. For example, several memorial totem poles were erected by the Tlingits in honor of Abraham Lincoln, one of which was relocated to Saxman, Alaska, in 1938. The Lincoln pole at Saxman commemorates the end of hostilities between two rival Tlingit clans and symbolizes the hope for peace and prosperity following the American occupation of the Alaskan territory. The story begins in 1868, when the United States government built a customs house and fort on Tongass Island and left the US revenue cutter \"Lincoln\" to patrol the area. After American soldiers at the fort and aboard the \"Lincoln\" provided protection to the Tongass group against its rival, the Kagwantans, the Tongass group commissioned the Lincoln pole to commemorate the event.\nWelcome pole.\nCarved by the Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl), Salish and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, most of the poles include large carvings of human figures, some as tall as . Welcome poles are placed at the edge of a stream or saltwater beach to welcome guests to the community, or possibly to intimidate strangers.\nShame/ridicule pole.\nPoles used for public ridicule are usually called shame poles, and were created to embarrass individuals or groups for their unpaid debts or when they did something wrong. The poles are often placed in prominent locations and removed after the debt is paid or the wrong is corrected. Shame pole carvings represent the person being shamed. \nOne famous shame pole is the Seward Pole at the Saxman Totem Park in Saxman, Alaska. Originally carved in the c.\u20091885, the pole shamed former U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward for his \"lack of recognition of Indigenous peoples at an early point in Alaska\u2019s U.S. history,\" as well as not reciprocating the generosity of his Tlingit hosts following an 1869 potlatch given in his honor. The figure's red-painted nose and ears may symbolize drunkenness or Seward's stinginess. In the 1940s, a second iteration of the pole was built by Tlingit men enrolled in the Civilian Conservation Corps; according to the Alaska Historical Society, the United States government was unaware that the pole's intent was to shame Seward until after the completion of the project. In 2014, this second pole began to fall apart; a renewed version was carved in 2017 by local Tlingit artist Stephen Jackson, who combined political caricature with Northwest Coast style.\nAnother example of the shame pole is the Three Frogs pole on Chief Shakes Island, at Wrangell, Alaska. This pole was erected by Chief Shakes to shame the Kiks.\u00e1di clan into repaying a debt incurred for the support of three Kiks.\u00e1di women who were allegedly cohabiting with three slaves in Shakes's household. When the Kiks.\u00e1di leaders refused to pay support for the women, Shakes commissioned a pole with carvings of three frogs, which represented the crest of the Kiks.\u00e1di clan. It is not known if the debt was ever repaid. The pole stands next to the Chief Shakes Tribal House in Wrangell. The pole's unique crossbar shape has become popularly associated with the town of Wrangell, and continues to be used as part of the \"Wrangell Sentinel\" newspaper's masthead.\nIn 1942, the U.S. Forest Service commissioned a pole to commemorate Alexander Baranof, the Russian governor and Russian American Company manager, as a civilian works project. The pole's original intent was to commemorate a peace treaty between the Russians and Tlingits that the governor helped broker in 1805. George Benson, a Sitka carver and craftsman, created the original design. The completed version originally stood in Totem Square in downtown Sitka, Alaska. When Benson and other Sitka carvers were not available to do the work, the U.S. Forest Service had CCC workers carve the pole in Wrangell, Alaska. Because Sitka and Wrangell native groups were rivals, it has been argued that the Wrangell carvers may have altered Benson's original design. For unknown reasons, the Wrangell carvers depicted the Baranov figure without clothes. Following a Sitka Tribe of Alaska-sponsored removal ceremony, the pole was lowered due to safety concerns on October 20, 2010, using funds from the Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services. The \"Sitka Sentinel\" reported that while standing, it was \"said to be the most photographed totem [pole] in Alaska\". The pole was re-erected in Totem Square in 2011.\nOn March 24, 2007, a shame pole was erected in Cordova, Alaska, that includes the inverted and distorted face of former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond. The pole represents the unpaid debt of $5 billion in punitive damages that a federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, determined Exxon owes for its role in causing the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.\nTotem poles outside of original context.\nSome poles from the Pacific Northwest have been moved to other locations for display out of their original context.\nIn 1903, Alaska's district governor, John Green Brady, collected 15 Tlingit and Haida totem poles for public displays from villages in southeastern Alaska. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (the world's fair held in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904), 14 of them were initially installed outside the Alaska pavilion at the fair; the other one, which had broken in transit, was repaired and installed at the fair's Esquimau Village. Thirteen of these poles were returned to Alaska, where they were eventually installed in the Sitka National Historical Park. The other two poles were sold; one pole from the Alaska pavilion went to the Milwaukee Public Museum and the pole from the Esquimau Village was sold and then given to industrialist David M. Parry, who installed it on his estate in what became known as the Golden Hill neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana. Although the remains of the original pole at Golden Hill no longer exist, a replica was raised on April 13, 1996, on the front lawn of The Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis. Approximately two years later, the replica was moved inside the museum, and in 2005, it was installed in a new atrium after completion of a museum expansion project.\nIndian New Deal.\nThe Indian New Deal of the 1930s strongly promoted native arts and crafts in the United States, and in the totem pole they discovered an art that was widely appreciated by white society. In Alaska the Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps restored old totem poles, copied those beyond repair, and carved new ones. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board, a U.S. federal government agency, facilitated their sale to the general public. The project was lucrative, but anthropologists complained that it stripped the natives of their traditional culture and stripped away the meaning of the totem poles.\nAnother example occurred in 1938, when the U.S. Forest Service began a totem pole restoration program in Alaska. Poles were removed from their original places as funerary and crest poles to be copied or repaired and then placed in parks based on English and French garden designs to demystify their meaning for tourists.\nIn England at the side of Virginia Water Lake, in the south of Windsor Great Park, there is a Canadian totem pole that was given to Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of British Columbia. In Seattle, Washington, a Tlingit funerary totem pole was raised in Pioneer Square in 1899, after being taken from an Alaskan village. In addition, the totem pole collections in Vancouver's Stanley Park, Victoria's Thunderbird Park, and the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia were removed from their original locations around British Columbia. In Stanley Park, the original Skedans Mortuary Pole has been returned to Haida Gwaii and is now replaced by a replica. In the late 1980s, the remaining carved poles were sent to various museums for preservation, with the park board commissioning and loaning replacement carvings.\nConstruction and maintenance.\nCarvers select a tree to be used for the totem pole (often red cedar), then it is cut down and moved to the carving site, where the bark and outer layer of wood (sapwood) is removed. Next, the side of the tree to be carved is chosen and the back half of the tree is removed. The center of the log is hollowed out to make it lighter and to keep it from cracking. Early tools used to carve totem poles were made of stone, shell, or bone, but beginning in the late 1700s, the use of iron tools made the carving work faster and easier. In the early days, the basic design for figures may have been painted on the wood to guide the carvers, but today's carvers use paper patterns as outlines for their designs. Carvers use chain saws to make the rough shapes and cuts, while adzes and chisels are used to chop the wood. Carvers use knives and other woodworking tools to add the finer details. When the carving is complete, paint is added to enhance specific details of the figures.\nRaising a totem pole is rarely done using modern methods, even for poles installed in modern settings. Most artists use a traditional method followed by a pole-raising ceremony. The traditional method calls for a deep trench to be dug. One end of the pole is placed at the bottom of the trench; the other end is supported at an upward angle by a wooden scaffold. Hundreds of strong men haul the pole upright into its footing, while others steady the pole from side ropes and brace it with cross beams. Once the pole is upright, the trench is filled with rocks and dirt. After the raising is completed, the carver, the carver's assistants, and others invited to attend the event perform a celebratory dance next to the pole. A community potlatch celebration typically follows the pole raising to commemorate the event. \nTotem poles are typically not well maintained after their installation and the potlatch celebration. The poles usually last from 60 to 80 years; only a few have stood longer than 75 years, and even fewer have reached 100 years of age. Once the wood rots so badly that the pole begins to lean and pose a threat to passersby, it is either destroyed or pushed over and removed. Older poles typically fall over during the winter storms that batter the coast. The owners of a collapsed pole may commission a new one to replace it.\nCultural property.\nEach culture typically has complex rules and customs regarding the traditional designs represented on poles. The designs are generally considered the property of a particular clan or family group of traditional carvers, and this ownership of the designs may not be transferred to the person who has commissioned the carvings. There have been protests when those who have not been trained in the traditional carving methods, cultural meanings and protocol, have made \"fake totem poles\" for what could be considered crass public display and commercial purposes. The misappropriation of coastal Pacific Northwest culture by the art and tourist trinket market has resulted in production of cheap imitations of totem poles executed with little or no knowledge of their complex stylistic conventions or cultural significance. These include imitations made for commercial and even comedic use in venues that serve alcohol, and in other settings that are insensitive or outright offensive to the sacred nature of some of the carvings.\nIn the early 1990s, the Haisla First Nation of the Pacific Northwest began a lengthy struggle to repatriate the G\u02bcpsgolox totem pole from Sweden's Museum of Ethnography. Their successful efforts were documented in Gil Cardinal's National Film Board of Canada documentary, \"Totem: The Return of the G'psgolox Pole\".\nIn October 2015, a Tlingit totem pole was returned from Hawaii to Alaska after being taken from a village by Hollywood actor John Barrymore in 1931.\nExamples.\nThe title of \"The World's Tallest Totem Pole\" is or has at one time been claimed by several coastal towns of North America's Pacific Northwest. Disputes over which is genuinely the tallest depends on factors such the number of logs used in construction or the affiliation of the carver. Competitions to make the tallest pole remain prevalent, although it is becoming more difficult to procure trees of sufficient height. The tallest poles include those in:\nThe thickest totem pole ever carved to date is in Duncan, British Columbia. Carved by Richard Hunt in 1988 in the Kwakwaka'wakw style, and measuring over in diameter, it represents Cedar Man transforming into his human form.\nNotable collections of totem poles on display include these sites:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Carmine Infantino, she debuted in \"Batman\" #181 (June 1966) and has become one of the superhero Batman's most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.\nIn her comic book appearances, Poison Ivy is depicted as a doctor of botany-turned-misanthropic ecoterrorist in Gotham City named Pamela Lillian Isley, PhD ( ) with the ability to control all plant life. Empowered by an elemental force known as the \"Green\", Ivy attempts to protect the sanctity and supremacy of nature at all costs by lashing out against humanity, which brings her into conflict with Batman. While usually portrayed as a supervillain, Ivy has also been an antiheroine at times as well as the primary love interest of Harley Quinn as of The New 52 and DC Rebirth relaunches. A one-piece costume adorned with leaves and vines serves as Poison Ivy's visual motif.\nPoison Ivy has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed by Uma Thurman in the 1997 film \"Batman &amp; Robin\"; Clare Foley, Maggie Geha and Peyton List in the Fox television series \"Gotham\"; and Bridget Regan in The CW's Arrowverse series \"Batwoman\". Diane Pershing, Tasia Valenza, Lake Bell, Tara Strong, and others have provided the character's voice ranging from animation to video games.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPublication history.\nPoison Ivy was created by Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino; the character first appeared in \"Batman\" #181 (June 1966). Infantino discussed how the character was created: \"The only reason she came about was because of Catwoman on the Batman show. They wanted more female villains. What was the other one I did... the Silver Fox! And then Batgirl. That show, because of it we were selling a million copies a month. But that show, when it died, so did the comic books.\"\nPoison Ivy's origin is depicted in Neil Gaiman's short story \"Pavane\" (\"Secret Origins\" #36, 1988), during which she declares herself to be nature's daughter and the world's rightful ruler; it is later revealed that her powers were gifted to her by the environmental force known as the Green. Ivy is considered extremely beautiful within the DC Universe, and is often presented as a temptress. She is typically depicted barefoot with long flowing hair, plant vines extending over her limbs, and a green one-piece suit adorned with leaves, with occasional variations to her skin tone.\nWriter J. T. Krul, who helped further define Poison Ivy's personality, summed up her character with the following quote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The thing I love most about Poison Ivy is her walking that line between bastion of Mother Nature and psycho Eco-terrorist. She sees herself as the hand of Mother Nature. If Mother Nature were \"God,\" then Ivy would be her \"Jesus.\" She defends the defenseless nature of the world and truly believes in her cause. Maiming, mauling, and mutilating are extreme measures, but it's nothing compared to what irredeemable cruelties humanity's done to the world of nature. Ivy always sees the greater good as she punishes those who deserve it.\u2014\u200a\nAfter appearing in various DC Comics publications, Poison Ivy starred in her first solo comic book series with the 2016 miniseries '. This was followed by the 2021 graphic novel ', and the eponymously titled \"Poison Ivy\", an ongoing comic book series first published in 2022. The character also co-starred in the miniseries \"Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy\" (2019\u20132020).\nFictional character biography.\nPre-Crisis.\nDr. Lillian Rose, PhD is a promising botanist who is persuaded by Marc LeGrand into assisting him with the theft of an Egyptian artifact containing ancient herbs. Fearing she would implicate him in the theft, he attempts to poison her with the herbs, which are deadly and untraceable. She survives this murder attempt and discovers she has acquired an immunity to all natural toxins and diseases.\nPost-Crisis.\nFollowing the events of the DC maxi-series comic \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", which massively rebooted DC Universe history and continuity, Poison Ivy's origins were revised in \"Secret Origins\" #36, 1988, written by Neil Gaiman. Her real name is Dr. Pamela Isley, PhD, a Gotham City botanist. She grows up wealthy with emotionally distant parents and later studies advanced botanical biochemistry at a university with Alec Holland under Dr. Jason Woodrue. Isley, a shy girl, is easily seduced by her professor. Woodrue injects Isley with poisons and toxins as an experiment, causing her transformation. She nearly dies twice as a result of these poisonings, driving her insane. Later, Woodrue flees from the authorities leaving Isley in the hospital for six months. Enraged at the betrayal, she suffers from violent mood swings, being sweet one moment and evil the next. When her boyfriend has a car accident after mysteriously suffering from a massive fungal overgrowth, Isley drops out of school and leaves Seattle, eventually settling in Gotham City.\nShe begins her criminal career by threatening to release her suffocating spores into the air unless the city meets her demands. Batman, who appears in Gotham that very same year, thwarts her scheme, and she is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. From this point on, she has a kind of obsession with Batman, him being the only person she could not control due to his strong will and focus. Over the years, she develops plant-like superpowers, the most noticeable being a lethal toxin in her lips; she is literally able to kill with a kiss.\nIn subsequent issues, she states that she only started a life of crime to attain sufficient funds to find a location to be alone with her plants, undisturbed by humanity. A few years later, she attempts to leave Gotham forever, escaping Arkham to settle on a desert island in the Caribbean. She transforms the barren wasteland into a second Eden, and is, for the first time in her life, happy. It is soon firebombed, however, when an American-owned corporation tests their weapons systems out on what they think is an abandoned island. Ivy returns to Gotham with a vengeance, punishing those responsible. After being willingly apprehended by Batman, she resolves that she can never leave Gotham, at least not until the world was safe for plants. From then on, she dedicates herself to the impossible mission of \"purifying\" Gotham.\nAt one point, Batman travels to Seattle to ascertain information on Pamela Isley's life before she became Poison Ivy. Here, Batman states that both of Pamela's parents are dead. When and why they died has been left undetermined.\nWhile in Arkham, Poison Ivy receives a message through flowers that someone is to help her escape. That night, two women, Holly and Eva, successfully break Ivy out and bring her back to their employer. She is less than happy to discover that it is the Floronic Man, formerly known as Dr. Jason Woodrue, her former college professor that conducted the experiments on her. The only human portion of him remaining is his head, while the rest of his body is plant-based.\nAfter striking a deal with him in the tunnels of Gotham, Ivy receives a trunk full of money in return for samples of her DNA. Woodrue intends to combine their DNA to create a \"child\", all while flooding the streets of Gotham with high-grade marijuana. The purpose of this is to create a world economy run on hemp and to have their offspring control it. Batman intervenes, but is overcome by Woodrue's henchwomen, Holly and Eva. However, Ivy turns on Floronic Man and lets Batman go to fight the intoxicated maniac. In the end, Batman decapitates the Floronic Man, and Ivy escapes with her money.\nAt times, Ivy demonstrates positive and maternal traits. When Gotham City is destroyed in an and declared , she holds dominion over Robinson Park and turns it into a tropical paradise rather than fight over territory like most of Batman's enemies. Sixteen children who are orphaned during the quake come to live with her as she sympathizes with them having suffered a traumatic childhood herself. She cares for them like sons and daughters, despite her usual misanthropy. That winter, Clayface (Basil Karlo) pays Ivy a visit, hoping to form a bargain with her. This would entail her growing fruits and vegetables, having the orphans harvest them, and him selling the produce to the highest bidder. She wants nothing to do with the plan, and she attempts to kill him with a kiss. Clayface overpowers her, however, and imprisons Ivy and the orphans for six months in a chamber under the park's lake. He feeds her salt and keeps her from the sun to weaken her. Eventually, Batman comes and discovers the imprisoned orphans and Ivy. The two agree to work together to take Karlo down. Batman battles Clayface and instructs Robin to blow up the lake bed above, allowing the rushing water to break apart the mud, effectively freeing Ivy. She fights Karlo, ensnaring him in the branches of a tree and fatally kissing him. She then proceeds to sink him down into the ground, where he becomes fertilizer for Ivy's plants. Batman, originally intending to take the orphans away from Ivy, recognizes that staying with her is what is best for them, and they remain in her care until the city is restored. Also, as part of a bargain to keep her freedom, Batman arranges it so that Ivy provides fresh produce to the starving hordes of earthquake survivors. Soon after, Ivy finds Harley Quinn, who had almost been murdered by the Joker, among the debris of the earthquake and nurses her back to health. The two have been best friends and partners-in-crime ever since.\nAfter Gotham City is reopened to the public, the city council wants to evict her from the park and send her back to Arkham Asylum, as they are uncomfortable with the thought of a \"psychotic eco-terrorist controlling the equivalent of 30-odd square blocks.\" They also mistakenly believe that the orphans in Ivy's care are hostages. The Gotham City Police Department threaten to spray the park with R.C. Sixty, a powerful herbicide that most certainly would have killed every living plant in the park, including Ivy, and more than likely do harm to the children. Ivy refuses to leave the park to the city and let them destroy the paradise she had created, so she chooses martyrdom. It is only after Rose, one of the orphans, is accidentally poisoned by Ivy that the hardened eco-terrorist surrenders herself to the authorities to save the girl's life. Batman says that, as much as she would hate to admit it, Ivy is still more human than plant.\nLater on, she and other Gotham characters are manipulated by the Riddler and Hush. Her task is to hypnotize both Superman and Catwoman, using Catwoman to steal ransom money from Bane after the original plan is interrupted by Batman while Superman serves as a 'bodyguard' when she hides in Metropolis. However, she abandons Catwoman to be killed by Killer Croc, and Batman is able to keep Superman busy in a fight (aided by the Kryptonite ring he was given long ago) long enough for him to escape Ivy's control. Soon afterwards, the Riddler, who is being chased and attacked by Hush, approaches Ivy and seeks her protection. Ivy, who is angered by the manipulation, battles the Riddler physically and psychologically. She comes to physically dominate her opponent, humiliating Riddler and temporarily breaking his spirit.\nIvy comes to believe that her powers are killing the children she had looked after, so with Bruce Wayne's help, she willingly undergoes treatment to become human again. Soon after, she is convinced by Hush to take another serum to restore her powers and apparently dies in the process. However, in \"Batman: Gotham Knights\", when her grave is visited shortly thereafter, it is covered with ivy, creating the impression her death would be short-lived.\nShortly after, Poison Ivy appears briefly in Robinson Park, killing two corrupt cops who killed one of her orphans (although whether this takes place before or after the aforementioned storyline is unknown).\n\"One Year Later\", Ivy is alive and active. Her control over flora has increased, referred to as being on a par with Swamp Thing or Floronic Man. She also appears to have resumed her crusade against the corporate enemies of the environment with a new fanaticism, regarding Batman no longer as a main opponent, but as a \"hindrance\". After arriving back from a year-long absence, Batman discovers that Ivy has been feeding people including \"tiresome lovers\", \"incompetent henchmen\", and those who \"returned her smile\" to a giant plant which would digest the victims slowly and painfully. She refers to these murders as a \"guilty pleasure\". In an unprecedented event, her victims' souls merge with the plant, creating a botanical monster called \"Harvest\", who seeks revenge upon Poison Ivy. With the intervention of Batman however, she is saved. Poison Ivy is left in critical condition, and the whereabouts of Harvest are unknown.\nOther storylines.\nIn \"Countdown\" #37, the Pied Piper and the Trickster are hiding out in a greenhouse, picking fruits and vegetables from the plants. They run into Ivy, who is talking to her plants (presumably being told that Piper and Trickster hurt them), to which she reacts by tying them up in vines with the intention of killing them. She is then shown to have joined the Injustice League Unlimited and is one of the villains featured in \"Salvation Run\".\nIn the \"Battle for the Cowl\" storyline, she is coerced by a new Black Mask into joining his group of villains that aims to take over Gotham. She and Killer Croc unsuccessfully attempt to murder Damian Wayne.\nShortly after, she escapes from Black Mask's control and forms an alliance with Catwoman and Harley Quinn, leading into the ongoing series \"Gotham City Sirens\".\nDuring Hush's ploy to hurt Batman through hurting his loved ones, Hush kidnaps Catwoman and surgically removes her heart. After being saved by Batman, Catwoman is operated on by some of the most gifted surgeons in the world, including Doctor Mid-Nite and Mr. Terrific. Zatanna also gives her a magic antidote to help heal her wounds. To get even with Hush, Selina enlists the help of Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Oracle, Holly Robinson, and Slam Bradley to track down all of Hush's accounts, pilfer them, and leave him penniless. Selina pays Holly, Harley, and Ivy over $30 million each, hoping that they would use the funds to leave Gotham to start fresh somewhere else. However, Harley uses her money to go on a shopping spree, while Ivy gives her money away to organizations in Madagascar and Costa Rica dedicated to reforestation.\nAfter rescuing Catwoman from Boneblaster, a new villain trying to make a name for himself, Poison Ivy takes Catwoman back to the Riddler's townhouse. When there, Catwoman sees that Ivy has been keeping the Riddler under mind control so that she and Harley could use his townhouse as a hideout. Here, Catwoman decides that with Gotham City more dangerous than ever with all the gang wars and a new Batman, a partnership with the other two women would be advantageous. However, Ivy fears that Catwoman has lost her edge and prowess, and consults with Zatanna on the nature of Catwoman's injuries. Zatanna responds that Catwoman has psychological wounds that would need healing. Ivy resolves that she and Harley would provide Catwoman with \"positive female reinforcement\". The three then agree to become a team. However, Harley and Ivy have one condition that Catwoman is to reveal to them Batman's secret identity.\nEventually, Ivy and the other Sirens ambush the Riddler at his office (with Ivy using her plants to truss and gag his secretary), telling him that they've been framed for the murder of a young nurse. He agrees to help clear their names, and during the discussion Ivy reveals that she has recently taken up a job at the Gotham division of S.T.A.R. Labs under an assumed name (Dr. Paula Irving). She is eventually kidnapped and placed in a specialized containment unit by a researcher named Alisa Adams, but escapes and turns the table on her captor by binding her with vines. Ivy initially informs Adams that she plans to kill her, but instead decides to let her live after seeing a photograph of Alisa's young daughter. Ivy then threatens Alisa into keeping her mouth shut about her true identity, telling her that she will change her mind and kill her if she reveals her secret to anyone.\nWhen Harley Quinn betrays her friends and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker, she ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility. Poison Ivy arrives and tries to convince Harley Quinn that the Joker is evil, but Harley Quinn refuses to believe her and knocks Poison Ivy unconscious. After they are defeated by Catwoman and Batman, Catwoman then tells Poison Ivy that they are no longer friends, after Ivy had drugged Catwoman in an attempt to discover Batman's identity. Poison Ivy is taken to Arkham Asylum. Ivy soon escapes and ambushes Harley in her cell, binding and gagging her former friend before she can defend herself. Ivy struggles with the decision to execute Harley for her betrayal, but ultimately releases her after realizing that she is still her friend. Together, the two set off to find Catwoman and make her pay for leaving them behind. The two of them find Catwoman and fight her on the streets. While fighting, Catwoman confesses that she saw good in the both of them and only wanted to help them. When she tells them that she only kept tabs on them because Batman wanted to keep them under control, Ivy lashes out onto the city by using giant vines to destroy buildings, cursing at Batman for manipulating her. Batman is about to arrest them, but Catwoman helps the two of them escape.\nThe New 52.\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe. Poison Ivy is recruited into the covert-ops group known as the Birds of Prey. Though she is specifically hand-picked by the team's leader, Black Canary, the other members of the group protest Ivy's inclusion, citing her violent past and connections to various murders. These suspicions are proven correct when Ivy poisons the team and forces them to attack corrupt companies she wants to destroy, until Katana apparently kills her.\nIvy survives the injuries and returns to Gotham, breaking out Clayface/Basil Karlo to manipulate him into becoming her husband. Batman intervenes to help her, mainly because the locations she attacked were the Penguin's properties. Poison Ivy ends up captured by Penguin's men. She is buried alive by them, but survives long enough to be rescued by Penguin's right-hand man Emperor Penguin who has taken over his boss' businesses after the Joker's return. He proposes an alliance with her. However, Karlo, whom Batman had set free from Ivy's control, tracks down and attacks Poison Ivy. Emperor Penguin later calls in a favor from Poison Ivy. This led to Emperor Penguin empowering himself with a chemical that is made from one of Poison Ivy's plant concoctions, the Man-Bat Serum, and the Venom drug.\nThe character's origin, in this new DC universe, was presented in a special issue of \"Detective Comics\" (#23.1), during the \"Villains Month\" event in September 2013. Pamela Isley was born with a skin condition that prevented her from leaving her home. She spent most of her limited time outside in her family's garden. Her abusive father murdered her mother and buried her in the garden. While in college, Pamela sold pheromone pills to other students to study its effects until she was caught by police. She used a powerful version of the pills to control the dean's mind so he would drop the charges and let her graduate with honors. While visiting her father in prison, she kissed him, and the poison that was secreted from her lips killed him. Later she landed an internship in Wayne Enterprises' Bio-Chemistry Division developing pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. She was fired after Bruce Wayne discovered her using company resources for an unauthorized project to brainwash people through plant pheromones. In an accident similar to that which created Mr. Freeze, Pamela attacks the security guards sent to escort her out and is exposed to lethal doses of her chemicals, triggering a mutation that gives her green skin, immunity to all toxins, and the ability to manipulate plant life.\n\"Cycle of Life and Death\".\nIn January 2016, DC Comics debuted Ivy's first solo comic book series, \"\". The series begins with Ivy attempting to go straight by returning to her science career. Under her human identity of Dr. Pamela Isley, she joins the plant sciences department at the famed Gotham Botanical Gardens, but things quickly get complicated when Luisa Cruz, Ivy's friend and mentor, is murdered via poisoning. Ivy investigates the murder whilst completing a genetic engineering research project begun by Cruz that culminates in the creation of two plant-human hybrid children known as Rose and Hazel.\nWith the help of Selina Kyle and fellow researcher Darshan, Poison Ivy finds that the Gotham Botanical Gardens are performing experiments, using Ivy's research, which result in the creation of another plant-human hybrid child known as Thorn. Ivy destroys the laboratory and rescues the child. Ivy raises Rose, Hazel and Thorn who grow to adult size at an exponential rate, becoming young women within 35 weeks. When the girls sneak out to see Gotham City at night for the first time, they cause an incident at a strip club that gets the police involved, and Ivy has to help them escape.\nReturning to the apartment, Ivy locks Rose, Hazel and Thorn away so they will not leave again. Ivy finds Doctor Eric Grimley, Chair of the Gotham Botanical Gardens Research Department, waiting for her. Grimley had been conducting experiments with Ivy's research to cure his own cancer; he had then murdered Luisa because she was suspicious of the experiments he was performing. Now, with his cancer returning, he intends to harvest Rose, Thorn, and Hazel for spores to be used as another cure. He attacks Ivy, and transforms into a giant, plant-like monster. Darshan arrives and releases the girls. Ivy, Rose, Hazel, Thorn, and Darshan, along with Swamp Thing (who seeks to kill Grimley for trying to break the cycle of life and death) fight and defeat Grimley, with Thorn hacking him up with a machete.\nDarshan later helps Rose, Thorn, and Hazel leave Ivy, reasoning that they were getting so restless they would go eventually with or without his help. They set off away from Gotham to places unknown, saying they plan to live out their lives regardless of how short they may be.\nDC Universe.\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles, called \"DC Rebirth\", in June 2016. DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \"DC Universe\" name in December 2017, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth. In the \"Better Together\" story arc of \"Trinity\", Poison Ivy finds a dreamworld and the White Mercy entity, both created by the Black Mercy plant for Mongul, through her connection to the Green. After capturing Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman, she places them into the dreamworld and intends to use the solar energy emitted from Superman's body to open a gateway to bring the White Mercy\u2014whom she considers as a daughter\u2014over from the dreamworld. It is later revealed that Mongul deceived Poison Ivy and intended to conquer Earth using Superman as a vessel. Mongul is defeated by the White Mercy, using Batman as a temporary and willing vessel. As Poison Ivy and the White Mercy bid farewell to each other, the White Mercy uses her connection to the Green to make Poison Ivy lose her memories of the incident, so Ivy does not need to suffer any heartache. In the continuity, the \"Better Together\" story arc takes place after the events in \"\" involving Ivy's children.\nIn \"Batgirl\", Poison Ivy helps Batgirl save an airplane and its passengers from a plant, one of Ivy's specimen, that is growing uncontrollably in the cargo bay. In the end, she reluctantly allows Batgirl to kill it.\nIn the \"Ends of the Earth\" arc of \"All-Star Batman\", Poison Ivy goes into Death Valley where she conducts research on a barren tree to discover cures. Here, Batman asks Poison Ivy for help with a deadly bacteria, which was unleashed by Mr. Freeze, informing her about an infected girl and giving her samples of it. Upon examining it, Ivy realizes that the infected girl is already dead and Batman wanted to evoke her sympathy as he is actually seeking for a cure to combat the spread of the disease. She also reveals that, when she was still working at Wayne Enterprises, she had presented her research wrongly as she thought Bruce Wayne wanted something to manipulate people but she was actually researching pheromones to make people feel good. Batman warns Ivy that an unknown strike force is after her, because they know Ivy is able to pull biological weapons from the tree. After Batman helps Ivy in the fight, Ivy synthesizes a selective agent that can destroy the spores without harming the hosts.\nIn \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\" story arc of \"Batman\", Poison Ivy has allied herself with the Riddler in his war against the Joker. In the arc, when the Riddler was trying to convince her to join his side, she is seen stopping Carmine Falcone's men\u2014who are sent to kill the Riddler\u2014by capturing them in vines.\nIn the \"Gotham Resistance\" tie-in story arc for \"\", Poison Ivy controls a jungle-like realm within a Gotham City warped by the dark energy emitted from the dark metal in the cards given by the Batman Who Laughs to various enemies of Batman including Poison Ivy herself. Poison Ivy captures Harley Quinn\u2014who realizes that Poison Ivy is not herself\u2014Green Arrow, Nightwing, Robin, and Killer Croc as they try to solve what is going on and stop it. They escape when Poison Ivy violently reacts to her plants being harmed during an attack by several members of the Teen Titans and Suicide Squad, who all also have been twisted, as well as a Dark Robin.\nIn the \"Source Code\" story arc of \"Batgirl and the Birds of Prey\", Poison Ivy infiltrates and tries to take down Terracare, a company whose fertilizers contain a secret ingredient destructive to bee populations. She comes across the Birds of Prey (Huntress, Black Canary, and Batgirl) and Catwoman who were trying to save the Calculator's family held hostage by Terracare. Terracare had namely traced back a data breach to the Calculator who sold the information to Catwoman, so she could steal a vial of the ingredient from Terracare for Poison Ivy. She did this for Ivy, as Ivy once saved her from Boneblaster. After they stopped those responsible at Terracare, Batgirl arranges that Poison Ivy becomes the chemist in charge of the fertilizers. After this arc, Poison Ivy is occasionally seen working at Terracare (now acquired by Gordon Clean Energy) or helping the Birds of Prey against villains (such as the Daughters of Gotham or the Calculator).\nIn the \"Unnatural Disaster\" storyline of \"Damage\", Poison Ivy has fallen under the influence of forces that led to a desire to destroy humanity. She partnered with Gorilla Grodd for that purpose. They fought against Damage (Ethan Avery) who is trying to protect people from them. However, Poison Ivy eventually resists the control of these forces, as she thinks that people are worth saving and does not want to be a killer. At the end, Swamp Thing (Alec Holland) reveals to Ethan Avery that the Green is trying to change Poison Ivy but has not succeeded.\n\"Batman\" (vol. 3) #41\u201343 features a Poison Ivy arc titled \"Everyone Loves Ivy\". Fueled by her guilt over the men she thought she killed in \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\", Poison Ivy uses her powers to take control of everyone on earth, except Batman and Catwoman. With the help of Harley Quinn, Batman and Catwoman convince Poison Ivy to release the world from her control. At the end of arc, Poison Ivy enters a facility known as the Sanctuary for rehabilitation.\nIn \"Heroes in Crisis\", at the mental health institution Sanctuary, Poison Ivy is seen giving a confession in which she states that she should not be there because they are made for heroes and she is a terrorist. Earlier, Harley Quinn had told Poison Ivy to go to Sanctuary and followed her there. Ivy and several others are killed when Wally West loses control of the Speed Force, but Wally revives Ivy from the Green by using the Speed Force on a rose that was a part of Ivy given to Harley. The following \"Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy\" limited series shows Ivy still struggling to completely regenerate. With Harley's aid, Ivy is eventually restored fully, but accidentally creates an identical plant duplicate of herself during her recovery. Both innocently unaware of being a duplicate, the Ivy-double and Harley go on the run together when enemies attack, leaving behind the real Ivy feeling abandoned and betrayed. By the time the pair learn of their mistake, Ivy is murderously insane towards Harley, forcing the double to sacrifice herself to save Harley and stabilize Ivy's sanity.\n\"Harley Quinn\" comic.\n\"Harley Quinn\" features Ivy as Harley's best friend and then lover. Ivy has helped Harley out on several adventures between her ecological terrorism gigs back in Harley's new home on Coney Island. She helps Harley explain to the local assassins that Harley posted her own bounty while sleepwalking and that trying to kill her would just lead to their deaths and no pay day. Harley rescued her from a super villain's mind control while Ivy was secretly held prisoner and used by said villain in Arkham. She assisted in hiring the Gang of Harleys and nursing Harley back to health when Captain Strong's seaweed put her in the hospital. She and Catwoman joined Harley on a road trip when Harley's uncle died and found that while both she and Harley are immune to most toxins, that does not include some secret drink brewed up on an Indian reservation. She and Harley were invited to spend a romantic week in Bermuda on a nudist colony by Sy Borgman. When there was a dispute over some real estate Ivy helped turn it into protected swampland. Also, when the Penguin attacks New York with giant killer penguins, she helps defeat him by growing a giant daisy in what their friend Eggy calls \"the worst Kaiju fight ever.\"\nTee Franklin, one of the writers of the \"Harley Quinn\" comics, has stated that she wrote Ivy as autistic, but \"figured DC would be against\" this being mentioned in the comics.\nActivism.\nIvy calls herself an \"ecoterrorist of global importance\" and has demonstrated philanthropic contributions to conservation efforts. The \"Gotham Girls\" episode \"https://\" has her going out of her way to get Gotham's mayor to prevent bulldozing of a park because he swore he would not do it in his election campaign. In \"Gotham City Sirens\", Ivy reveals that she donated her $30 million share of Hush's money to a reforestation fund.\nPowers and abilities.\nInitially thought to have been transformed by human experiments, Isley is later revealed to be gifted by the Green, an interplanetary force which grants her a supernatural control over plant life, enhanced strength and stamina, the power to transfer poison through touch, complete immunity to all toxins and poisons, and the ability to project mind-controlling pheromones. With the latter power at its full potential, she proves capable of controlling every person on Earth, including other super-powered beings. If her mind-control spores are laced with Kryptonite, Ivy can affect and control Superman as well.\nShe has the ability to control and mutate all forms of plant life on a molecular level, making it respond to her will and command. In volume three of \"Batman\", she causes giant plant roots to become uprooted at a moment's notice, and directs them to entangle her enemies. While in Arkham Asylum, she manipulates and animates plants, using roots to form supports for a tunnel she and another inmate named Magpie dig to escape, and also spawning glowing fungi to entertain Magpie. Plant vines are also commonly seen extending over her limbs and neck, creating part of her overall appearance. She controlled an entire tree to come down on Clayface, ensnaring him in its branches, and once brought a whole skyscraper down with giant vines.\nSome versions of the character depict her as more plant than human, such as breathing carbon dioxide and undergoing photosynthesis. Her special pheromones let her mesmerize and manipulate people around her, men in particular, although strong-minded people like Batman are usually capable of resisting. She can also create the most potent floral toxins in Gotham City, ranging from truth serums to love potions. Often these toxins are secreted from her lips and administered in her preferred way, a poisonous kiss. Ironically her immunity to poisons has resulted in her becoming sterile and unable to give birth.\nPoison Ivy is identified by the Swamp Thing as a being with an elemental mystical component, whom he calls the \"May Queen\". Ivy is able to communicate over great distances with this talent, as she manifests in a vase of roses in Zatanna's dressing room to talk to the magician. Since her death and rebirth, her control over plants increased to the point she can grow giant animated plants from seedlings in seconds, hear through plants, and channel her consciousness into plant material from long distances.\nThe character carries a certain number of live vines: coupled with her natural ability to commune with plant life, they act as weaponry, or defensive/grabbing appendages. Their supply is, however, limited.\nBeyond her metahuman traits, Ivy is shown to be exceptionally physically fit both due to gymnastics and her enhanced health; being similar to Harley Quinn in skill as well as showing enough hand-to-hand combat prowess to challenge Batman without relying solely on her powers.\nPamela Isley is an expert in botany, toxicology and genetics. Though mentally unstable, she has a genius level of intelligence, particularly when it comes to anything related to plants, and she may be the world's foremost botanist. Her specialization in these fields had earned her a career as a scientist and she initially used her knowledge for perfumes, makeup and medicine. Additionally, her expertise in biochemistry has enabled her to develop mutant plants and to create and give life to plants that have long been thought to be extinct. In \"Batman\" The Animated Series\", a captive Batman calls her a genius combined with a fanatic \u2013 a description she does not dispute.\nShe is famous for being able to seduce men and women alike, often using her pheromones to do so, but also without: her beauty is a resource she can use. Pamela Isley has always been a beautiful woman, but she never used her looks or talents for personal gain until she became Poison Ivy.\nRomantic relationships.\nBatman.\nIvy and Batman have worked together in achieving common goals and are frequently depicted as having a romantic relationship. Batman's attraction to Ivy is present in some way in several mediums in which the characters appear. There has always been a sexual tension between the two, most notably in their canonical earlier encounters.\nIn her first appearance, Ivy is established as having an attraction to Batman, and tries to convince Batman to join her side and creates love potions that ensnare him.\nIn the 1997 story \"Batman: Poison Ivy\", Christopher DeJardin tries to kill Ivy, and Batman takes the bullet. Batman, who was wearing body armor, knocks him out. Ivy considers his saving her from death as proof he loves her, though he responds that she does not know the meaning of the word.\nHer attraction is confirmed in \"\".\nAt first, Ivy's infatuation with Batman was one-sided; later stories presented the attraction as more mutual, but hindered by reluctance on Batman's part. She later kisses Bruce during a robbery, poisoning him. But when she subsequently kisses a dying Batman, she unknowingly cures her intended victim and establishes a budding romantic tension between them. During the \"No Man's Land\" arc, Batman comes to her rescue while she is held captive by Clayface, with Ivy remarking that she knew he would.\nIn \"Batman: Pavane\" (1989), while being interviewed as a potential candidate for the Suicide Squad, Pamela reveals to Inspector Stuart on how she became Poison Ivy. When she heard about Batman, she instantly fell in love with him\u2014believing him to be the \u201cperfect man\u201d; going so far as to make a love shrine of him. With her goal set, she moved to Gotham, created a costume and renamed herself \u201cPoison Ivy\u201d; she then began committing crimes for the purpose of getting his attention in the hopes of them becoming the #1 crime couple. Unfortunately for Pamela, it did not work out the way she wanted it to, and so she was apprehended and sent to Arkham Asylum.\nIn \"Batman: Hothouse\" (1992), Batman gains an obsession with Isley. Later, she kisses him. Now completely deranged, Ivy thinks herself \"Titania, Queen of the May\", and Batman her Oberon\u2014as Batman struggles with the hallucinations induced by the kiss, she pins him down and prepares to unmask him. With his last burst of strength, Batman kicks the greenhouse's sprinklers on, washing away Ivy's pheromones. The sobered Batman chases an increasingly desperate Ivy onto the greenhouse's catwalks, where he barely manages to save Ivy from falling to her death. Subsequently, Ivy is returned to Arkham Asylum, her twisted love for Batman stronger than ever.\nIn one of the annuals of \"\", a mutual attraction between Poison Ivy and the Batman is obvious: Ivy considers Batman \"the perfect man\", and in a conversation with his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, he admits to finding her attractive and more appealing than Catwoman. She subsequently targets Bruce Wayne as one of those she blames for recent environmental 'crimes', giving him her poisoned kiss, but when she kisses Batman later and brags about how a second kiss is the antidote, Batman thus creates the impression that he is immune to her poisons.\nIn the \"Batman Chronicles\" (1995) story \"Passion's Fruit\" (1997), Ivy is depicted as feeling lonely and deeply missing Batman while at Arkham Asylum. She hatches a scheme to unleash some of her plant creations to cause havoc in Gotham, multiplying at contact with water, until Batman finally pays her a visit at the asylum. In exchange for the visit and a kiss, she morphs her creations into harmless strawberry plants. At the end of the story she is seen to be in improved spirits.\nIn \"\" (2004), Batman and Ivy work together to find a killer carrying out a series of Ivy-like murders at Arkham. His butler, Alfred Pennyworth, notes that Batman has been poisoned by the flowers. Batman tells Alfred he must kiss Ivy for the cure, and that if he fails Alfred must kill him. Ivy and Batman confront each other, where Batman warns Ivy that he'll have to knock her out to kiss her to make sure that she does not kill him when he passes out after being cured. Ivy insists for him to trust her, despite Batman's doubts. Batman at first decides to punch her, hesitates, then they embrace and kiss passionately instead. Upon being cured, he falls, but saves himself, and saves Ivy as Gotham Tower collapses when \u2014 assuming Batman dead \u2014 Ivy tries to kill herself, once more insinuating that it is more than just lust she feels for him. Ivy and Batman share a moment together speaking, watching her plant creations create light, and Batman compliments her on her talent. Batman takes Ivy back to Arkham Asylum, so that Ivy can finish her rehabilitation. Discouraged, Ivy complains to Batman about the lack of light in her cell, and Batman responds that there is nothing he can do about it, before departing. Transferred to a new cell the next morning, Ivy is stunned when she discovers that her room has been moved to a special cell where she can be in the sunlight, and has been filled with flowers as a gift. Upon being told some \"anonymous benefactor\" wanted to make sure her time is not as daunting as it might have been, a touched Ivy smiles and thanks Batman.\nIn \"Detective Comics\" (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013), Ivy kisses Batman, trying to gain control over him via her toxins, and saying, \u201cYou're the only one for me Batman, you know that right? Nobody else even comes close. Not anybody.\u2063\u2063\u2063\u201d Rather than using an antidote, he rigs his visor to show him certain set of visual stimuli that will effectively erase his short-term memory, thereby erasing any commands she gives him as well. Aware of his resistance, she tries to appeal to his sense of morality.\nIn \"Gothtopia\", Batman comes to her rescue when he realizes she was telling him the truth, even though he put her in Arkham. First she punches him for not believing her claims, and then she kisses him for coming to her rescue, poisoning him with her mind control toxin. Resisting it, he warns that they would be best off helping each other for now. Thanks to her own resistance and the kiss he received, both Batman and Ivy become immune to Scarecrow's gas effect.\nIn the 2021 Fear State Comic Series, Batman: 113 features an exploration into Batman's mind and shows Poison Ivy kissing him, alongside both Catwoman and Talia al Ghul seemingly confirming towards a past relationship between the two characters in the current canon universe. In the thirteenth issue of the Poison Ivy Solo Series, Bruce refers to their past romantic relationship when talking to Pamela once she returns to Gotham.\nThe relationship even briefly deviated from the Batman/Ivy relationship into a Bruce/Pamela one when, in the comic series \", he helps her return to normal.\nIn \", Bruce and Ivy engage in a sexually implied relationship during the three month time period Bruce was under her mind control as instructed by mob boss Carmine Falcone.\nHarley Quinn.\nPrior to the New 52 reboot, Ivy is shown as teamed up on occasion with fellow villain Harley Quinn with Harley being her best friend and recurring ally. They are sometimes shown as romantically involved. Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect. Ivy sincerely wants to save Harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the Joker. Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the \"Gotham City Sirens\" series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her. The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified, and the series ended with the New 52 reboot before their relationship could be addressed.\nIn June 2015, Poison Ivy was revealed to be romantically involved with Harley Quinn by \"Harley Quinn\" series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, stating that she is in a romantic relationship with Harley \"without the jealousy of monogamy\".\nIn \"Harley Quinn\" (vol. 1) #8, Harley went on a vacation with Ivy to a nudist colony in which she tried to convince Ivy to move in with her, but while Ivy admitted that she loves Harley more than any other person on Earth and would love to spend as much time with her as possible, she is currently more dedicated to saving the environment. Harley was disappointed and very sad, but accepted it and the two parted with promises to meet again.\nIn \"Injustice 2\" #70, which takes place in an alternate universe, Poison Ivy states that she was married to Harley Quinn.\nTeams.\nIvy teamed up on occasion with fellow villain, Harley Quinn with Harley being her close friend and recurring ally. The partnership between Harley and Ivy has also at times included Catwoman, such as in episodes and issues of the \"Gotham Girls\" webtoon and comic book series. In the mainstream DC Universe, the three formed an alliance in the pages of \"Gotham City Sirens\".\nPoison Ivy was invited to join the Birds of Prey by Black Canary in The New 52 continuity reboot. Katana and Starling reject the idea and even attack Ivy, but after a brief scuffle, the women begin working together as a team. She remained with the team for a time, but eventually betrayed them, shortly before the team split-up. When the Birds were reformed under the leadership of Batgirl, Poison Ivy was not invited back.\nPoison Ivy joins Two-Face's gang for a short period of time during \"\", when she murders crime boss Lucia Viti on Two-Face's orders. She is notably the only member of the gang to be upset by Two-Face's casual murder of fellow gang member Solomon Grundy, a plant-based entity. The gang is broken up after Two-Face's apparent death at the hands of the Joker.\nPoison Ivy is a member of the original Injustice Gang of the World, which fights the Justice League on several occasions.\nShe joins the Secret Society of Super Villains for a mission against the Justice League. She later joins Alexander Luthor Jr.'s incarnation of the Society.\nShe is coerced into being a member of the Suicide Squad. During this time, she uses her abilities to enslave Count Vertigo.\nReception.\nIGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Poison Ivy as #64. She was ranked 21st in \"Comics Buyer's Guide\"'s \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\nIn other media.\nTelevision.\nAnimation.\nDC Animated Universe.\nPoison Ivy appears in media set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), voiced by Diane Pershing.\nVideo games.\n\"Batman: Arkham\".\nPoison Ivy appears in the \" series, voiced primarily by Tasia Valenza.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74159", "revid": "37919430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74159", "title": "Andromeda (TV series)", "text": "Space opera television series\nAndromeda (formally titled Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda) is a space opera television series, based on unused material by Gene Roddenberry, developed by Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and produced by Roddenberry's widow, Majel Barrett. The series follows Kevin Sorbo as Captain Dylan Hunt of the Systems Commonwealth, an intergalactic government that presided over an extended period of peace and prosperity until its destruction from a rebellion led by the warmongering Nietzcheans and parasitic Magog. The series premiered on October 2, 2000, and ended on May 13, 2005.\n\"Andromeda\" was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and produced by Andromeda Productions, Tribune Entertainment, Fireworks Entertainment and MBR Productions. In Canada, the show aired on Global Television Network (Fireworks' parent company) and ran in first-run broadcast syndication in the United States.\n\"Andromeda\" is one of two television series (alongside \"\") produced after Roddenberry's death based on concepts he had created as early as the 1960s and 1970s; Roddenberry died in 1991, nine years prior to the series premiere. The name Dylan Hunt had previously been used for the hero of two television pilots Roddenberry had produced in the mid-1970s \u2013 \"Genesis II\" and \"Planet Earth\" \u2013 all of which shared a similar dystopian post-apocalyptic premise.\nPremise.\nThousands of years in the future, the Systems Commonwealth is a constitutional monarchy spanning the Milky Way, Triangulum, and Andromeda galaxies, with the capital of Tarn-Vedra near Andromeda's core. The Commonwealth is at war with the Magog, a parasitic humanoid species spreading across the galaxies. Peace talks led the Commonwealth to cede a key world to the Magog, that of the Nietzscheans; in response, the Nietzscheans secretly attempted to usurp control of the Commonwealth.\nDylan Hunt is the captain of the Commonwealth starship \"Andromeda Ascendant\". Its computer is a powerful artificial intelligence which Dylan has nicknamed \"Andromeda\" or \"Rommie\". Caught in a surprise attack in the first engagement of the Nietzschean uprising, the \"Andromeda\" is crippled, prompting Dylan to order the crew to evacuate. During the attack, Dylan's Nietzschean first officer, Gaheris Rhade, betrays Dylan and attempts to kill him. Dylan kills Gaheris as \"Andromeda\" is caught at the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, freezing both in time.\n303 years later, in CY 10087 (approx 5167 AD), the \"Andromeda\" is pulled from the event horizon by the crew of the salvage ship \"Eureka Maru,\" captained by con-artist and expert pilot Beka Valentine, super-genius engineer Seamus Zelazny Harper, doctor and alien of unknown origin Trance Gemini, and pacifist Magog Rev Bem (the salvage crew's beneficiary also secretly brings Nietzschean mercenary Tyr Anasazi). The Systems Commonwealth has fallen, and the era known as \"The Long Night\" has begun. Hunt recruits the crew to join him in restoring the Systems Commonwealth and to \"rekindle the light of civilization\".\n\"Andromeda\" universe.\nSlipstream.\nSlipstream is the primary mode of travel for ships in the \"Andromeda\" universe, and the only known method of traveling faster than the speed of light. The Vedran discovery of the slipstream was instrumental in the formation of their interstellar empire, which became the precursor of the Systems Commonwealth.\nSlipstream cannot be navigated by AIs (they only have a 50% chance of choosing the correct path). Only organic pilots can \"sense\" a way to their destination (they have a 99% chance of choosing the correct path), and although AIs are fitted on all large ships, they always require an organic pilot for interstellar travel. It is implied that the process of choosing a path is what makes it the correct one.\nA function of slipstream is that apparent objective velocities are extremely variable, as it enables travel across millions of light years seemingly as swiftly as traveling between neighboring stars only tens of light years apart. Further, slipstream is a non-linear method of travel; the fastest or safest way to slipstream between two points, though they might be in the same galaxy, may involve slipstreaming to another galaxy entirely. The more frequently used routes are often easier, faster and more predictable. Locations relatively nearby in ordinary space may be difficult or impossible to access via slipstream.\nSystems Commonwealth.\nThe Systems Commonwealth was a huge utopian civilization, spanning three major galaxies of the Local Group. It was founded by the Vedrans, the first race to discover slipstream, who initially used it to conquer the Andromeda Galaxy. After a long and bitter war of attrition with the major powers of the Triangulum Galaxy, the Vedran Empire was reorganized as the democratic Systems Commonwealth. The Commonwealth served as a peaceful intergalactic government for almost 10,000 years until the Nietzschean revolt.\nProduction.\nMajel Barrett and Tribune Entertainment began developing series from Gene Roddenberry's archive in 1997. Robert Hewitt Wolfe was brought in to develop the series. Fireworks Entertainment was brought in to co-finance and for international distribution. In early 1999, actor Kevin Sorbo was recruited to star in the series while he starred in \"\". Eric Gold, and Barrett were also to be executive producers and Wolfe as co-executive producer. Bette Chadwick was in charge of casting, while visual effects were initially handled by Lost Boys Studios and Northwest Imaging &amp; FX. By September 9, 1999, Tribune had stations committed for two years in 24 of the top 30 markets with 22 Tribune and 38 Sinclair stations for a 60% national clearance giving the series a green light. The show was offered barter terms with an eight national/six local advertising split.\nThe \"Andromeda\" theme music used in season one was composed by Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the Canadian progressive rock band Rush.\n\"Andromeda\"'s first episode was aired on syndication in the United States on October 2, 2000 while being carried on Global Television Network in Canada. Tribune Broadcasting station signed on to carry the show in its first season. On January 20, 2002, \"Andromeda\" was renewed for two seasons, its third and fourth, having gotten two year deals with stations in 39 out the top 40 markets. By January 31, 2003, the show was renewed for its fourth season, 2003\u20132004, in 148 markets representing 88% of the United States. The show was averaging 2.2 rating for the 2002\u20132003 season, third behind \"Stargate SG-1\". For the 2003\u20132004 season, the show is one of only four first-run scripted series in syndication along with its Tribune stable mate, \"Mutant X\".\nOn January 14, 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel made a deal for the show and all its episodes plus fellow Tribune syndicated but discontinued show \"Beastmaster\". In March, the cable channel would start showing season four episodes which would then be seen in syndication seven to ten days later. With the deal, the series was renewed for its fifth and final season. The show began its run on Sci-Fi with a re-airing of the two-hour pilot episode.\nOn April 23, 2004, CanWest Global Communications announced the closure of Fireworks Entertainment and placing Fireworks' library up for sale. With Fireworks being the primary production company, this was effectively the show's cancellation notice. However, two of Fireworks' shows were shifted to fellow CanWest subsidiary Global Television. Tribune had ordered the show and \"Mutant X\" into production for the 2004\u20132005 season under the show's contract options. Fireworks Entertainment took Tribune to court to get an order releasing them from production and financing the two series.\nRobert Hewitt Wolfe's departure.\nDuring filming of season two, series developer and executive producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe announced he had been released from the show's production and was replaced by Bob Engels. The change was purportedly to make the show more episodic and open to casual viewing since Wolfe's version\u2014although episodic\u2014had many plotlines and story arcs. After the show's final episode aired, Wolfe wrote and published a one-act play entitled \"Coda\" that explained his intended plans for the show without contradicting the aired episodes. This play is now hosted on \"Drive Back the Night \u2013 An Andromeda Podcast\".\nIn discussion on his website's forums and various interviews, Wolfe has elaborated that he was released from the production staff after he refused to shift the show's focus more onto Kevin Sorbo's character, Dylan Hunt, by essentially making all of the show's episodes Hunt-centric. The events of the episode \"Ouroboros\", the final episode written by Wolfe, introduced the last major changes that Wolfe was willing to make to the series.\nHome media.\nBy 2003, ADV Films had home video/DVD rights for the show in the USA. The company released the entire series on DVD in region 1 between 2003 and 2006. In December 2003, ADV released Season 3, Collection 2. On October 3, 2006, they released a complete series DVD box set known as \"Andromeda: The Slipstream Collection\".\nAlliance Home Entertainment (under license from CanWest Global Communications) has released all five seasons on DVD in Canada only.\nIn Region 2, Revelation Films has released the first four seasons on DVD in the United Kingdom. The fifth and final season was released on November 24, 2014.\nOn January 26, 2015, Revelation Films released a complete series set on DVD in the United Kingdom.\nIn Region 4, Beyond Home Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD in Australia. In 2007/2008, they re-released all five seasons in new collector's editions that featured new packaging and all episodes were digitally re-mastered in widescreen format.\nA region B Blu-ray release of the first season was released on June 24, 2013, in the United Kingdom, with the next two seasons following by the end of that year.\nThe all-region Blu-ray release of the complete box set of all five seasons was released on September 19, 2016.\nReception.\nThe first season received mixed to negative reviews. \"Starburst\" described \"Andromeda\" as a \"delightfully motley cast of characters, and the scripts by Wolfe and his writing team are brimming with witty interplay.\" A mixed review from \"Variety\" says \"Andromeda\" \"could offer a few campy laughs on a weekend afternoon\". In a retrospective, Digital Spy remarks \"this show hasn't exactly aged that well... but if you remotely like sci-fi, we also bet you'll find yourself sucked into this nostalgia-fest in no time\".\n\"Andromeda\" received negative reviews from the \"Los Angeles Times\" (\"Don't expect much excitement... 'Andromeda' isn't intended to be taken too seriously, but that doesn't excuse its penchant for dopey dialogue\"), \"Entertainment Weekly\" (\"After surviving a hilariously bad slow motion fight sequence.. Sorbo meets up with a band of misfit scavengers who may not be as bad as they seem, but make up for it by being twice as annoying\"), Common Sense Media (\"this series lacks the spark that made Star Trek so much fun. The politics sometimes seem overly confusing, and some of the characters are thinly developed\"), SciFiNow (\"It's a cliche but decent enough... but the problem is that Andromeda falls into Star Trek: Voyager territory by playing it safe and not doing enough to develop its characters\") and \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" (\"it's kiddie-minded science-fiction with average special effects... and a set that was clearly built on a lower budget than the 'Star Trek' shows.\").\nAwards.\n\"Andromeda\" was nominated for 39 awards at organizational events spanning the years 2001 to 2006. The nominations comprised six Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, USA awards, five Chicago International Film Festival awards, eight Gemini Awards, fifteen Leo Awards, and five WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival awards.

He has had starring roles in two television series: as Hercules in \"\" (1995\u20131999) and as Captain Dylan Hunt in \"Andromeda\" (2000\u20132005). Sorbo played his first leading film role in the 1997 fantasy film \"Kull the Conqueror\".\nSorbo is also known for acting in Christian films, such as \"God's Not Dead\" (2014) and \"Let There Be Light\" (2017).\nEarly life and education.\nSorbo was born in Mound, Minnesota, on September 24, 1958. He is of Norwegian descent. He was raised in a Lutheran family. Sorbo attended Minnesota State University Moorhead, where he double majored in marketing and advertising. To help pay for tuition, he began to work as a model for print and television advertising.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nIn the mid-1980s, Sorbo travelled around Europe and Australia working in television commercials and also modelling for print advertisements. During this period, he made his acting debut in an episode of the soap opera \"Santa Barbara\" in 1986. His second television appearance was in an episode of the sitcom \"1st &amp; Ten\" in 1988. He continued working in advertising and by the early 1990s, he had appeared in over 150 commercials. One of the popular commercials he appeared in was for Jim Beam bourbon whiskey, known for Sorbo's repeated catchphrase, \"This ain't Jim Beam\". \nHis acting career continued in the early 1990s with guest appearances in \"Murder She Wrote\" and \"The Commish\". In 1992, he played his first leading role in an unsuccessful television pilot for a medical drama series titled \"Condition: Critical\", which was not picked up, but aired as a television film on ABC. In 1993, he was considered for and lost out to Dean Cain as Superman in the TV series \"\" and was one of the possible contenders for the role of Fox Mulder in \"The X-Files\", which went to David Duchovny. In 1993, he made his film debut in \"Slaughter of the Innocents\".\nProfessional breakthrough with \"Hercules\", \"Kull\", and other film offers.\nIn 1993, Sorbo received his breakthrough leading role as the ancient greek demigod Hercules in a series of five television films that aired as part of Universal Television's Action Pack. The first film to premiere was \"Hercules and the Amazon Women\", which aired in April 1994, the others following later in the year. The ratings success of the films paved the way for the commission of the television series \"\", which started airing in syndication from January 1995 and ran for six seasons. The series made Sorbo an international star and was one of the highest rated syndicated television shows at the time. The show was filmed in New Zealand.\nThe success of the show spawned the popular spin-off series ' starring Lucy Lawless, who was introduced in a three-episode arc in the first season of \"Hercules\". This allowed Sorbo as well as several other characters from both shows to make crossover appearances. In 1998, a spin-off direct-to-video, animated film titled ' was released with both Sorbo and Lawless voicing the characters.\n\"Hercules\" was canceled midway through the filming of Season Six, of which only eight episodes were produced. The final episode aired in November 1999. Although it was not revealed at the time, health issues reduced Sorbo's abilities to perform the physically demanding role during the later seasons. Sorbo made his final appearance as Hercules on \"Xena\", in the Season Five episode \"God Fearing Child\", which aired in February 2000.\nIn between his years playing Hercules, Sorbo played his first leading film role in the 1997-released film \"Kull the Conqueror\". The actor was selected for the role in December 1995, and the picture was shot in Slovakia and Croatia between August and October 1996. In a mostly negative review, \"The New York Times\" writes, \"Mr. Sorbo provides the requisite oiled torso, a hint of humor and the professionalism and good grace to act as if \"Kull the Conqueror\" mattered.\"\nIn July 1997, it was announced that Sorbo would star in \"Black Dog\" for around $3 million, with Kevin Hooks slated to direct and produce and the intention to shoot in September during Sorbo's hiatus from \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\". During an interview, Sorbo described the film as \"\"Die Hard\" meets \"Speed\".\" In September 1997, Meat Loaf and Randy Travis were signed to star opposite Sorbo. However, by November of that year, it was reported that Patrick Swayze had replaced Sorbo in \"Black Dog\".\nPost-\"Hercules\" work.\nAfter \"Hercules\" ended, Sorbo played the starring role of Captain Dylan Hunt in the science-fiction drama series \"Andromeda\" from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, he played a recurring role on the final season of \"The O.C.\"\nIn 2007, he starred in two direct-to-video sequels to \"Walking Tall\", ' and '. In the Hallmark Channel film \"Avenging Angel\", he co-starred with his real wife, Sam Jenkins.\nIn 2008, he appeared in the spoof film titled\" Meet the Spartans\", which was a box office success despite poor reviews.\nIn the first of what would be several voice acting jobs, Sorbo performed one of the main protagonists, Prometheus, in the video game \"The Conduit\". He also reprised the role of Hercules in the video game \"God of War III\" and worked together with his wife on the game \"Cloudberry Kingdom\".\nIn 2014, Sorbo co-starred in \"God's Not Dead\", a Christian film in which he portrayed an atheist college professor who requires his students to disown their religions on the first day of his class.\nAlthough heavily panned by critics, it was a commercial success and the first of a sequence of Christian films that Sorbo would produce or perform.\nSorbo appeared in the 2015 romantic comedy \"Single in South Beach\", starring Haley Webb. On Twitter, in 2019, she accused Sorbo of sexual advances and of sexually harassing her on the set. However, Webb did not elaborate on any of her accusations, and he did not respond to her tweet.\nIn 2017, Sorbo directed and starred in the Christian drama film \"Let There Be Light\", which featured conservative pundit Sean Hannity, who was also an executive producer. It was described by the \"New Yorker\" as \"a cynical, xenophobic morality tale, as bitter as it is saccharine\" that closes with \"a d\u00e9nouement of bald Islamophobia\". \"The Los Angeles Times\", although critical, says that it provides \"an involving bonanza\" for its intended Christian audience. Sorbo is described as bringing \"puckish charm and credible warmth to his role\".\nIn 2024, he appeared in the Ronald Reagan biopic opposite Dennis Quaid, who plays the title role.\nPersonal life.\nSorbo is a Christian. Although he grew up Lutheran, he attends a nondenominational church. On January 5, 1998, Sorbo married actress Sam Jenkins, whom he met the previous year when she had a small recurring role on \"Hercules\" (Season 3, Episode 8 \"Prince Hercules\"). They have three children, including Braeden Sorbo. Sorbo is the spokesman and chair of A World Fit for Kids! (AWFFK!), a non-profit organization that trains teenagers to become mentors to younger children.\nIn 2001, Sorbo was featured on a celebrity edition of the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", winning $32,000. The money was donated to his charity, A World Fit For Kids.\nHealth.\nIn late 1997, while on a publicity tour for \"Kull the Conqueror\" and between the fourth and fifth seasons of \"Hercules\", Sorbo experienced an aneurysm in his shoulder which caused three strokes. As a result, he was weakened for the next several years, a condition kept secret from the public while he recovered. During the last two seasons of \"Hercules\" (the fifth and sixth, which aired in 1998 and 1999), Sorbo had a reduced filming schedule to accommodate his condition, and more guest stars were featured in the show in order to reduce Sorbo's duties. In his 2011 autobiography \"True Strength\", Sorbo revealed the details of his injury and how his wife Sam helped him recover.\nIn 2013, Sorbo received the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Brain Foundation for his efforts raising awareness about stroke. He also received the 2013 Inspiration Honors Award from the Invisible Disabilities Association.\nPolitics.\nIn 2014, during an interview with Jerry Newcombe on the radio show \"Vocal Point\", Sorbo defended Mel Gibson against allegations that his 2004 film \"The Passion of the Christ\" was anti-Semitic with the words: \"News bulletin: you did kill Jesus!\" Sorbo later stated he could have rephrased his statements, but defended his stance.\nIn February 2021, Sorbo's Facebook page was removed due to \"repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines\". In June 2023, Sorbo shared an article repeating the unsubstantiated claim that actor Jamie Foxx had been injured by a COVID-19 vaccine.\nAfter Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Sorbo repeatedly made remarks defending Trump's false claims of election fraud. Although he initially supported the January 6 United States Capitol attack participants and encouraged them to respect the police, Sorbo subsequently backtracked and blamed the violence on antifa. This led to a widely reported Twitter exchange between him and his former co-star Lucy Lawless, who have exchanged conflicting views on personal and political matters throughout the past 20 years.\nIn 2022, Sorbo was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He wore a suit lined with his own tweets. In 2023, Sorbo published a children's book entitled \"The Test of Lionhood\", which explores the theme of masculinity from a Christian perspective for young boys, as part of a larger fight in defense of the virtues of masculinity, which he says are being eroded in Hollywood and in society at large.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It emerged in the Centre-du-Qu\u00e9bec region of Quebec in the late 1950s, though its exact origins are uncertain, and there are several competing claims regarding its origin. For many years, it was used by some to mock Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to its growing popularity throughout the rest of Canada.\nAnnual poutine celebrations occur in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville, as well as Toronto, Ottawa, New Hampshire, and Chicago. It has been called Canada's national dish, though some critics believe this labeling represents cultural appropriation of the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois or Quebec's provincial identity. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches or dumplings.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe dish was created in the Centre-du-Qu\u00e9bec area in the late 1950s. Several restaurants in the area claim to be the originators of the dish, but no consensus exists.\nAccording to Canadian food researcher Sylvain Charlebois, while Warwick is the birthplace of poutine, Drummondville's Jean-Paul Roy is the true inventor since Le Roy Jucep was the first to sell poutine with three combined ingredients, in 1964. \"The Oxford Companion to Cheese\" takes a different perspective, stating that the inventors were not chefs but the customers who chose to add cheese curds to their fries.\nDevelopment.\nPoutine was consumed in small \"greasy spoon\" diners (commonly known in Quebec as or ), pubs, at roadside chip wagons (commonly known as , literally \"potato shacks\"), and in ice hockey arenas. For decades, it remained a country snack food in Quebec's dairy region, due to the narrow freshness window of cheddar cheese curds. In 1969, poutine was brought to Quebec City in Ashton Leblond's food truck (a business which grew into the Chez Ashton fast-food chain). In the early 1970s, La Banquise began serving poutine in Montreal, followed by the Burger King chain in 1983. Others that followed used inferior cheese and the dish's reputation declined. Poutine was largely perceived as an unsophisticated backwoods creation or unhealthy junk food to be consumed after a night of drinking.\nMontreal chefs would make poutine to feed their staff but had not dared to put it on their menus. In the 1990s, attempts were made to elevate the dish by using baked potatoes and duck stock. In November\u00a02001, Martin Picard of bistro Au Pied de Cochon began serving a foie gras poutine which was praised by customers and food critics. This influenced chefs in Toronto and Vancouver to feature poutine on upscale menus. Chef Mark McEwan served lobster poutine at his Bymark eatery, and chef Jamie Kennedy served braised beef poutine at his eponymous restaurant. Over the next decade, poutine gained acceptance and popularity in all types of restaurants, from haute cuisine to fast food, and spread across Canada and internationally. Poutine became extremely trendy in the early 2010s, with an explosion of poutineries in cities like Toronto, leading to stories about poutine's association with romance and events like the IBM Watson Cognitive Cooking Poutine Event, where the computer generated unique poutine recipes based on the demographics of Toronto and Montreal.\nEtymology.\nThe \"Dictionnaire historique du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\" lists 15 meanings of in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and Acadian French, most of which are for kinds of food; the word \"poutine\" in the meaning \"fries with cheese and gravy\" is dated to 1982 in English. Other senses of the word have been in use since at least 1810.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, a popular etymology is that \"poutine\" is from a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois slang word meaning \"mess\", and that others attribute it to the English word \"pudding\". The exact provenance of the word \"poutine\" is uncertain.\nThe \"Dictionnaire historique\" mentions the possibility that the form \"poutine\" is simply a gallicization of the word \"pudding\". However, it considers it more likely that the term was inherited from regional languages in France, with some meanings shaped later by the influence of the similarly sounding English word \"pudding\". It cites the Proven\u00e7al forms \"bad stew\" and \"hodgepodge\" or \"crushed fruit or foods\"; \"mixture of various things\" in Languedocien; and or \"bad stew\" in Franche-Comt\u00e9 as possibly related to \"poutine\". The meaning \"fries with cheese and gravy\" of \"poutine\" is among those held as probably unrelated to \"pudding\", provided the latter view is correct.\nRecipe.\nThe traditional recipe for poutine consists of:\nTo maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curds and gravy are added immediately before serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over room-temperature cheese curds, so they are warmed without melting completely. The thin gravy allows all the fries to be coated. The serving dish typically has some depth to act as a basket for the fries so that they retain their heat. It is important to control the temperature, timing, and the order in which the ingredients are added to obtain the right food textures\u2014an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.\nFreshness and juiciness of the curds is essential. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, altering their acidity level. This causes proteins to lose their elasticity, and the curds to lose their complex texture and characteristic squeaky sound when chewed. The curds should be less than a day old, which requires proximity to a dairy. While Montreal is from a cheese plant in Mirabel, restaurants and specialty cheese shops outside of dairy regions may be unable to sell enough curds to justify the expense of daily deliveries. Furthermore, Canadian food safety practices require curds to be refrigerated within 24\u00a0hours, which suppresses the properties of their texture. This has resulted in \"poutineries\" which specialize in the dish; busy poutineries may use of curds per day. Poutineries which are too distant from dairies may make their own cheese curds on site, in batches every few hours, to ensure a fresh and steady supply.\nVariations.\nThe texture, temperature and viscosity of poutine's ingredients differ and continuously change as the food is consumed, making it a dish of highly dynamic contrasts. Strengthening these contrasts, superior poutines are identified by the crispiness of the fries, freshness of the curds, and a unifying gravy. Even small variations in ingredients or preparation\u2014the oil used for frying, the origin of the curds, or spices in the gravy\u2014can result in a distinctly different experience of eating the poutine.\nSome recipes eliminate the cheese, but most Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would call such a dish a (), not poutine. When curds are unavailable, mozzarella cheese may be an acceptable alternative. Shredded mozzarella is commonly used in Saskatchewan. Sweet potato may be used as a healthier alternative to french fries, adding more dietary fibre and vitamins.\nPoutineries, like Montreal's La Banquise, which is credited for much of the innovation and popularization of poutine, have dozens of varieties of poutine on their menus. Many of these are based on the traditional recipe with an added meat topping such as sausage, chicken, bacon, brisket, or Montreal-style smoked meat, with the gravy adjusted for balance. The Quebec City-based chain Chez Ashton is known for its poutine Galvaude (topped with chicken and green peas) and Dulton (with ground beef). New variations are frequently introduced. Pulled pork was popular around 2013, followed a couple years later by Asian-fusion poutines.\nMontreal's high immigrant population has led to many takes on the dish inspired by other cuisines, such as Haitian, Mexican, Portuguese, Indian, Japanese, Greek, Italian and Lebanese. These poutines may bear little resemblance to the traditional recipe. They replace some or all of the ingredients but maintain the dynamic contrasts of textures and temperatures with a crispy element, a dairy or dairy-like element, and a unifying sauce. Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches, dumplings, soups, and flatbreads.\nPoutineries will frequently offer limited-time promotional specials, such as a Thanksgiving poutine with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. In anticipation of the legalization of cannabis in Canada, Montreal's Le Gras Dur served a \"pot poutine\" with a gravy that included hemp protein, hemp seeds and hemp oil, offered with a joint-like roll of turkey, wild mushrooms and arugula.\nGourmet poutine with three-pepper sauce, merguez sausage, foie gras or caviar and truffle can be found. This is a trend that began in the 1990s and is credited to David McMillan of Montreal's Joe Beef and Globe restaurants. Savoury sauces like Moroccan harissa, lobster sauce, and red-wine veal \"jus\" have been used to complement artisanal cheeses and rich ingredients.\nChains such as Smoke's Poutinerie, New York Fries, McDonald's, Wendy's, A&amp;W, KFC, Burger King, Harvey's, Mary Brown's, Arby's, and Wahlburgers restaurants also sell versions of poutine in Quebec and the rest of Canada (although not always country-wide). Tim Hortons began selling poutine in 2018. Fast-food combination meals in Canada often have the options to have french fries \"poutinized\" by adding cheese curds and gravy, or substituting a poutine for a fries side.\nInternationally.\nPoutine is found in the northern border regions of the United States, including New England and the larger Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and the Upper Midwest. These regions offer further variations of the basic dish, usually by utilizing cheeses other than fresh curds, which are not widely available in the US. In the country culture, a mixed fry can also come with cooked ground beef on top and is referred to as a hamburger mix, though this is less popular than a regular mix. In the Pacific Northwest, one variation replaces the gravy with chowder featuring local seafood.\nDisco fries, french fries typically covered in mozzarella cheese and brown gravy, were popularized in New Jersey in the 1990s. They gained their name in the 1970s for being a favourite of late-night diners, who often came from dancing at disco clubs. The dish is also popular in New Orleans including variations called Cajun poutine.\nPoutine spread to the United Kingdom, Korea and Russia, where it has been referred to as \"Raspoutine\". The first poutinerie in Paris, La Maison de la Poutine, opened in 2017 and quickly gained attention from mainstream media and gastronomers.\nA similar dish known as chips, cheese and gravy, consisting of thick-cut chips covered in shredded Manx Cheddar cheese and topped with a thick beef gravy, is popular in the Isle of Man.\nCultural aspects.\nA cultural marker, poutine had long been Quebec's adored junk food before spreading across the rest of Canada and the United States. It had by then made inroads with food critics and established culinary circles, challenging its junk food status. Food critic Jacob Richler noted in 2012 that Canadian dishes are too similar to their European roots to be considered original, with the exception of poutine, which he credited as the country's most famous culinary creation. In May 2014, the word \"poutine\" was added to the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" of the English language.\nIn 2007, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation declared the results of an online survey on the greatest Canadian inventions, in which poutine ranked at No.\u00a010. \"Maclean's\" 2017 survey of \"favourite iconic Canadian food\" placed poutine first with 21% of respondents, ahead of maple syrup with 14%. By 2011, media outlets were reporting 11\u00a0April as National Poutine Day.\nIn March 2016, poutine was served at the White House during the first state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Poutine has been a highlight of Canada Day celebrations in Trafalgar Square in London, England, for several years, and was a comfort food for the local community after the 2013 Lac-M\u00e9gantic rail disaster. It was served at the inaugural Canadian Comedy Awards.\nThe first poutine festival was held in Warwick, Quebec, in 1993. This annual event expanded to become the largest cheese festival in Canada. In 2014, it was moved to the larger town of Victoriaville. Montreal has hosted La Poutine Week, an annual festival, food tour, and competition held 1\u20137\u00a0February, since 2013. It spread across Canada and internationally, and by 2021 had become the largest poutine festival in the world, with over 700 restaurants serving more than 350,000 poutines. Le Grand Poutinefest is a poutine festival founded in 2015 which tours cities and towns in Quebec, operating most weekends from April to September. Poutine festivals are also held in Drummondville (since 2008), Ottawa-Gatineau, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, Moncton, Quebec City and Sherbrooke. In the US, major festivals have been held in Chicago, Illinois, Manchester, New Hampshire, Knoxville, Tennessee, Portland, Maine, Burlington, Vermont, and in Rhode Island.\nSince 2010, the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFCE) has held a world poutine-eating championship sponsored by Toronto-based chain Smoke's Poutinerie. There was criticism that the inaugural contest was held outside of Quebec and excluded Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The IFCE stated that Montreal poutineries had not expressed any interest in holding the competition. Regulations for contests in Quebec make it difficult to include the province, which is often absent from national contests. Smoke's has since sponsored a cross-Canada poutine eating tour. In 2011, chef Chuck Hughes won on \"Iron Chef America\" (episode 2 of ) by beating Bobby Flay with a plate of lobster poutine.\nJones Soda Co., an originally Canadian company now based in the US, created a poutine-flavoured limited-edition soft drink in 2013, which received international pop culture attention. Bacon-poutine was one of four flavours selected as a finalist in the 2014 Lay's Canada Do Us A Flavour potato chip contest. Though it did not win, Lay's later added a bacon-poutine variety in its Canada entry for the World Flavourites. Loblaws' President's Choice and Ruffles brands also offer poutine-flavoured potato chips in Canada.\nGiapos Ice Cream of New Zealand has served a \"poutine ice cream\" of oolong matcha tea, ice cream and caramel sauce over hand-cut fries since 2017. \nIn a 2018 promotional campaign for the film \"Crazy Rich Asians\", \"the world's richest poutine\" was created with wagyu steak, lobster, truffles, shiitake and chanterelle mushrooms, edible orchids, and gold flakes, priced just under $450.\nJoel Edmundson, of the 2018\u201319 National Hockey League champion team St. Louis Blues, ate poutine from the Stanley Cup during celebrations attended by over 4,000 fans in his hometown of Brandon, Manitoba. Mathieu Joseph, a Chambly, Quebec, native who won the Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021, also ate poutine from the Cup during a celebration with the Cup in 2021.\nNutrition.\nHealth advocates have been critical of poutine since the 1980s. In a 2013 study of Canadian restaurants, poutine was found to have the second-highest sodium (1547\u00a0mg average and as high as 2227\u00a0mg) among single meal items, after stir-fry entr\u00e9es.\nSocial mobility and appropriation.\nThe social status of poutine has evolved dramatically since its origins in rural Quebec in the 1950s. The dish was long mocked as a culinary invention and used as a means of stigmatization by non-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois against Quebec society to reduce its legitimacy. While the first generations that suffered from the poutine stigma opted to disidentify from the dish, younger people in Quebec began to reappropriate poutine as a symbol of Quebecois cultural pride. Today, the dish is celebrated in many annual poutine festivals in Quebec, the rest of Canada, and in the United States.\nThe evolution of the different symbols associated with poutine was first studied in \"Maudite Poutine!\" by Charles-Alexandre Th\u00e9or\u00eat. Th\u00e9or\u00eat revisited many of these stigmas in an interview given at \"Tout le monde en parle\" on 11 November 2007.\nAs poutine gained popularity beyond the provincial borders of Quebec in the mid-2000s, the dish gradually stopped being mocked and was eventually introduced into the popular discourse as a symbol of Canadian identity. Today, the dish is often presented as being a part of Canadian cuisine, even as Canada's national dish. Nicolas Fabien-Ouellet suggested in the peer-reviewed journal \"CuiZine\" that this \"Canadization\" of poutine constitutes cultural appropriation. This appropriation is not linked to its preparation or consumption outside Quebec, but strictly to its presentation as a Canadian dish instead of a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois dish. Fabien-Ouellet explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;as soon as a Quebec cultural trait begins to be appreciated internationally, it begins to be identified as typically Canadian, this prevents Quebec culture from shining, and becomes part of absorption and assimilation processes. All this is reminiscent of the reasons why Cajun cuisine is differentiated in the US context.\nIn politics.\nIn a \"Talking to Americans\" segment on the Canadian mock television news show \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\", during the 2000 US election, comedian Rick Mercer posed as a reporter and asked US politicians what they thought of \"Prime Minister Jean Poutine\" and his endorsement of George W. Bush for president. (The Prime Minister of Canada at the time was Jean Chr\u00e9tien.) None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of \"Poutine\" and Bush pledged to \"work closely\" with Mr. Poutine. A few years later, when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as president, he joked in a speech, \"There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him [...] I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine.\" The remark was met with laughter and applause.\nIn French, Russian president Vladimir Putin's surname is spelled \"Poutine\", with the two having identical pronunciation. The similarity has been a source of confusion; in commenting on the \"Talking to Americans\" prank on Bush, \"Washington Post\" columnist Al Kamen mistakenly believed that Mercer's fictional Jean Poutine was a reference to Putin. In 2017, Russian-themed poutinerie Vladimir Poutine opened in Montreal, with dishes named for political figures from Rasputin to Donald Trump. In the week following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, frequent insults and threats were received by the three Maison de la Poutine restaurants in Paris, some stating a belief that they worked for the Russian state. Another poutinerie in Lyon changed the name of its 20-year signature dish, Vladimir poutine, stating that it \"was no longer funny\". In Quebec, Le Roy Jucep announced that it was retiring the word \"poutine\" in support of Ukraine and reverted to \"\" on its menus and branding.\nDuring the 2011 Canadian federal election, some voters reported receiving robocalls claiming to be from Elections Canada, from a phone number registered to \"Pierre Poutine\". The calls targeted voters who had previously indicated they would not vote for the Conservative Party. The calls, made on election day or the day before, falsely advised voters that their polling station had been changed, in an attempt to prevent them from voting. The allegations became known as the Robocall scandal, and subsequent investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police resulted in Michael Sona, a junior Conservative Party staffer, being convicted of violating the \"Elections Act\".\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel had a Canadian lunch with counterpart Justin Trudeau on 16\u00a0June 2017, during which they ate hotdogs and poutine. Michel tweeted later that this was \"A great way to meet a dear friend though our fries are better\", referring to the popular claim that fries were originally invented in Belgium.

Growing to tall, it is characterized by small whitish flowers, a tall stem of fernlike leaves, and a pungent odor.\nThe plant is native to temperate regions of Eurasia and North America. It has been introduced as feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia. It has some potential uses, including in traditional medicine.\nDescription.\n\"Achillea millefolium\" is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant that produces one to several stems in height, and has a spreading rhizomatous growth form. Cauline and more or less clasping, the leaves appear spirally and evenly along the stem, with the largest and most petiolate towards the base; they are long and fernlike, divided bipinnately or tripinnately.\nThe inflorescence has 4 to 9 phyllaries and contains ray and disk flowers which are white to pink, blooming from March to October. There are generally 3 to 8 ray flowers, which are long and ovate to round. The tiny disk flowers range from 10 to 40. The inflorescence is produced in a flat-topped capitulum cluster and the inflorescences are visited by many insect species, and has a generalized pollination system. The small achene-like fruits are called cypsela.\nThe plant has a distinct spicy scent that persists when dried and may be irritating to some.\nChemistry.\nThe dark blue essential oil of yarrow contains chemicals called proazulenes.\nChamazulene and \u03b4-Cadinol are chemical compounds found in \"A.\u00a0millefolium\". The chromophore of azulene was discovered in yarrow and wormwood and named in 1863 by Septimus Piesse.\nYarrow contains isovaleric acid, salicylic acid, asparagine, sterols, and flavonoids. It also contains phenolic acids such as gallic acid, 3,\u00a04-dihydroxy benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, ferulic acid, cinnamic acid and flavonoid such as myricetin, hesperidin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, apigenin, rutin, hyperoside.\nTaxonomy.\nSubdivision.\nThe several varieties and subspecies include:\nEtymology.\nThe genus name \"Achillea\" is derived from mythical Greek character Achilles, who by legend, carried it with his army to treat battle wounds. The specific epithet \"millefolium\" comes from the featherlike leaves which are minutely divided.\nDistribution and habitat.\nYarrow is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, being found in Europe, Asia, and North America.\nThe plant grows from sea level to in elevation. Common yarrow is frequently found in the mildly disturbed soil of grasslands and open forests. Active growth occurs in the spring.\nIn North America, both native and introduced genotypes, and both diploid and polyploid plants are found. It is found in every habitat throughout California except the Colorado and Mojave Deserts. Common yarrow produces an average yield of , with a total dry weight of .\nIt has been introduced as a feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia, where it is a common weed of both wet and dry areas, such as roadsides, meadows, fields and coastal places.\nEcology.\nSeveral cavity-nesting birds, including the common starling, use yarrow to line their nests. Experiments conducted on the tree swallow, which does not use yarrow, suggest that adding yarrow to nests inhibits the growth of parasites.\n\"Achillea millefolium\" is a food source for many species of insects, including the larvae of a number of moths, although is not particularly attractive to ladybirds. \n\"Aceria kiefferi\" is a mite that causes galls on \"A.\u00a0millefolium\".\nCultivation.\n\"Achillea millefolium\" is cultivated as an ornamental plant by many plant nurseries. It is planted in gardens and natural landscaping settings of diverse climates and styles. They include native plant, drought-tolerant, and wildlife gardens. The plant is a frequent component of butterfly gardens. The plant prefers well-drained soil in full sun, but can be grown in less ideal conditions.\nPropagation.\nFor propagation, seeds require light for germination, so optimal germination occurs when planted no deeper than . Seeds also require a germination temperature of . It has a relatively short life in some situations, but may be prolonged by division in the spring every other year, and planting apart. It can become invasive.\nCultivars.\nThe species use in traditional gardens has generally been superseded by cultivars with specific 'improved' qualities. Some are used as drought-tolerant lawns, with periodic mowing. The many different ornamental cultivars include: 'Paprika', 'Cerise Queen', 'Red Beauty', 'Red Velvet', 'Saucy Seduction', 'Strawberry Seduction' (red), 'Island Pink' (pink), 'Calistoga' (white), and 'Sonoma Coast' (white). The following are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\nThe many hybrids of this species designated \"Achillea\" \u00d7 \"taygetea\" are useful garden subjects, including: 'Appleblossom', 'Fanal', 'Hoffnung', and 'Moonshine'.\nToxicity.\nYarrow can cause allergic skin rashes.\nAccording to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, yarrow is toxic to dogs, cats, and horses, causing increased urination, vomiting, diarrhea and dermatitis. When consumed by cows, an unfavorable flavor is given to their milk.\nUses.\nTraditional medicine.\n\"A. millefolium\" was used in traditional medicine, in part due to its astringent properties and the mild laxative effect of its leaves. It was used in ancient times to heal wounds and stop bleeding, and in the 16th century, the crushed leaves were used to stop nosebleeds. \nNorth American varieties were traditionally used by many Native American nations. The Navajo considered it a \"life medicine\" and chewed the plant for toothaches and used its infusions for earaches. The Miwok in California used the plant as an analgesic and head cold remedy. Native American nations used the plant for healing cuts and abrasions, relief from earaches and throat infections, as well as for an eyewash. Yarrow was used by Plains indigenous peoples to reduce pain or fever and aid sleep. Some Ojibwe people used a decoction of yarrow leaves on hot stones and inhaled it to treat headaches, or applied decoctions of the root onto skin for its stimulating effect.\nFood.\nThe entire plant is reportedly edible and nutritious, but it is advised not to consume much. The foliage is pungent; both its leaves and flowers are bitter and astringent. The leaves can be eaten young; raw, they can be added to salad. The leaves, with an aniseed-grass flavor, can be brewed as tea.\nIn the Middle Ages, yarrow was part of a herbal mixture known as gruit used in the flavoring of beer prior to the use of hops. However, medieval Dutch and German city accounts from the gruit area do not mention yarrow. It is noted by the Swedish biologist Linnaeus that the Dalecarnians infused the herb in beer. The flowers and leaves are still used in making some liquors and bitters.\nOther uses.\nYarrow is used as a companion plant, attracting some beneficial insects and repelling some pests.\n\"A. millefolium\" can be planted to combat soil erosion due to the plant's resistance to drought. Before the arrival of monocultures of ryegrass, both grass and pasture contained \"A.\u00a0millefolium\" at a density of about 0.3\u00a0kg/ha. One factor for its use in grass mixtures was its deep roots, with leaves rich in minerals, minimizing mineral deficiencies in ruminant feed. It was introduced into New Zealand as a drought-tolerant pasture.\nYarrow can be used for dying wool; depending on the mordant, the color may be green to yellow.\nCulture.\nYarrow has been found with Neanderthal burials, suggesting its association with human species dates to at least 60,000 years ago.\nChina.\nYarrow and tortoiseshell are considered to be lucky in Chinese tradition.\nDried yarrow stalks are used in I\u00a0Ching divination.\nWestern world.\nIn antiquity, the plant was known as herba militaris for its use in stanching the flow of blood from wounds. In the Classical Greek epic \"Iliad\", Homer tells of the centaur Chiron, who conveyed herbal secrets to his human pupils and taught Achilles to use yarrow on the battlegrounds of Troy. The genus name \"Achillea\" is inspired by the alleged use of the herb by Achilles to treat his soldiers' wounds. Other names implying the plant's historical use in healing\u2014particularly in the military\u2014include bloodwort, knight's milfoil, staunchweed, and, from its use in the United States Civil War, soldier's woundwort. Its use in either starting or stopping nosebleeds led to the common name nosebleed.\nThe English name yarrow comes from its Saxon (Old English) name \"gearwe\", which is related to both the Dutch word \"gerw\" (alternately \"yerw\") and the Old High German word \"garawa\". In the eastern counties it may be called yarroway. It was called old man's pepper due to its pungent flavor, while the name field hop came from its use in beer making in Sweden.\nIn the Hebrides, a leaf held against the eyes was sometimes believed to give second sight. In the witchcraft trial of Elspeth Reoch in March 1616, she was alleged to have plucked \"melefour\", thought to be another name for yarrow, and said \"In nomine Patris, Fiili, et Spiritus Sancti\" to become able to cure distemper (disorders of the four humours) and impart the faculty of prediction. For its association with the Abrahamic devil it was called bad man's plaything, devil's nettle, and devil's plaything. Yarrow was thought to bring luck due to being, according to one woman cited by James Britten (c.\u20091878), \"the first herb our Saviour put in His hand when a child\". This is apparently a corruption of the Achilles myth in which Jesus uses the plant to heal his adoptive father. For this reason, in France, it was called herbe de St.\u00a0Joseph, and it has also been called carpenter's weed in this regard.\nVarious other common names include arrowroot, death flower, eerie, hundred-leaved grass, knyghten, old man's mustard, sanguinary, seven-year's love, snake's grass, and soldier. The names milfoil and thousand leaf come refer to the minutely divided leaves. In Spanish, it is known as gordaldo and, in New Mexico and southern Colorado, plumajillo (Spanish for 'little feather').\nIn Sussex and Devonshire superstition, yarrow was used for finding one's real sweetheart. One would pluck yarrow growing on a young man's grave while reciting:\nYarrow, sweet yarrow, the first that I have found,in the name of Jesus Christ, I pluck it from the ground;As Joseph loved sweet Mary, and took her for his dear,so in a dream this night, I hope, my true love will appear.\nand go to sleep with the yarrow under the pillow.\nIn a similar tradition in Wicklow, girls would pick yarrow on Hallow Eve and recite:\nThou pretty herb of Venus' tree,Thy true name is yarrow;Now who my bosom friend may be,Pray tell thou me to-morrow.\nthen retire for the night without speaking and go to sleep with an ounce of yarrow sewn in flannel under the pillow.\nIn Suffolk a leaf was placed in the nose so it would bleed, while reciting\nGreen 'arrow, green 'arrow, you bears a white blow,If my love love me, my nose will bleed now;If my love don't love me, it 'on't bleed a drop,If my love do love me, 'twill bleed every drop.\nIn Dublin on May Day or the night before, women would place a stocking full of yarrow under their pillow and recite:\nGood morrow, good yarrow, good morrow to thee,I hope by the yarrow my lover to see;And that he may be married to me.The colour of his hair and the clothes he does wear,And if he be for me may his face be turned to me,And if he be not, dark and surely may he be,And his back be turned toward me.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It began as a country house, built in the 13th century. From 1462 to 1539, it was the seat of the Boleyn (originally 'Bullen') family.\nAnne Boleyn, the second queen consort of King Henry VIII of England, spent her early youth there after her father, Thomas Boleyn, inherited it in 1505. The castle passed to him upon the death of his father, Sir William Boleyn. It later came into the possession of King Henry VIII's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves.\nThe Grade I listed castle is now owned by the Guthrie family's Broadland Properties.\nHistory.\nThere have been three main periods in the construction of this historic castle. The castle's oldest part dates to 1270 and consisted of the gatehouse and a walled bailey. It was then owned by James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele. The second period was when the castle, then in need of repair, was converted into a manor in 1462 by Geoffrey Boleyn, younger brother of Thomas Boleyn, Master of Gonville Hall, Cambridge. He added a Tudor dwelling within the walls. The third period of repair and renovation was in the 20th century, when it was acquired by William Waldorf Astor. \nGeoffrey Boleyn's grandson, Thomas Boleyn, inherited the castle in 1505. He lived there with his wife Lady Elizabeth Howard and their children George, Mary and Anne (the future wife of Henry VIII). It is not known if Anne was born at Hever (the year of her birth is not certain), but she lived there until she was sent to the Habsburg Netherlands in 1513 to receive an education at the court of the Archduchess Margaret. Henry VIII often used the nearby Bolebroke Castle to conduct his courtship with Anne.\nThe property came into the possession of Henry VIII after the death of Anne's father, Thomas Boleyn, in 1539. He bestowed it upon Anne of Cleves in 1540 as part of the settlement following the annulment of their marriage. Hever Castle still has one of Henry VIII's private locks, taken with him on his various visits to noblemen's houses and fitted to every door for his security.\nThe property subsequently passed through various owners, including the Waldegrave family from 1557 to 1715, the Humfreys family to 1749 and the Meade-Waldo family from 1749 to 1903. During this latter period of ownership, the castle fell into a poor state of repair, during which time it was leased to various private tenants.\nIn 1903, it was acquired and restored by the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor, who used it as a family residence. He completed a restoration, added the Tudor village (also known as the Astor Wing) and also added the Italian Garden to display his collection of statuary and ornaments.\nThe castle has been Grade I listed since 10 September 1954; that was after the addition of the Tudor village, \"a picturesque cluster of guest cottages\".\nIn 1983, the Astor family sold the castle to John Guthrie (1906-1992), chairman of the family-run business, Broadland Properties Limited.\nAttractions for tourists.\nHever Castle is now a tourist attraction, drawing on its links to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, its mazes, gardens and lakes. There is an annual event programme with assorted events, including jousting tournaments and archery displays in the summer months and an annual patchwork and quilting exhibition in September. The castle has also become the venue for a triathlon and open water swimming. The castle has three floors containing antique furniture, Anne Boleyn's prayer books, instruments of torture, and a large collection of Tudor paintings. There is also a museum of the Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry.\nThe remains of the original country house timbers can still be seen within the stone walls of the fortification, while the gatehouse is the only original part of the castle. It has the oldest working original portcullis in England. The grounds of the castle include a hedge maze of yew trees planted in 1904. There is also a water maze, opened in 1999, the object of which is to reach the folly at the centre without getting wet. In the children's adventure playground, there is a tower maze (currently undergoing reconstruction). The castle gardens contain a wide range of features, including an Italianate garden (including Fernery), rose gardens, herb garden, and topiary.\nThe castle has 28 B&amp;B rooms that can be rented in a B&amp;B format. The castle has three restaurants, located in the gardens.\nIn popular culture.\nThe castle has been used as a location for music videos. \nThe 2020 drama-thriller television series \"The Third Day\" used the castle as a filming location. The Loggia on the lake was used as the location for a peace conference in the comedy-drama tevelvision series \"The Great\". Scenes from the second season of the Star Wars series \"Andor\" were filmed at the castle, doubling for Naboo. It was previously used for \"\".\nMovie productions that have filmed on the property include \"The Princess Bride\" and \"Inkheart\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Berkeley Plantation was originally called Berkeley Hundred, named after the Berkeley Company of England. In 1726, it became the home of the Harrison family of Virginia, after Benjamin Harrison IV located there and built one of the first three-story brick mansions in Virginia. It is the ancestral home of two presidents of the United States: William Henry Harrison, who was born there in 1773 and his grandson Benjamin Harrison. It is now a museum property, open to the public.\nAmong the many American \"firsts\" that occurred at Berkeley Plantation are:\nHistory.\nThe Berkeley Hundred was created through a land grant in 1618 of the Virginia Company of London to Sir William Throckmorton, Sir George Yeardley, George Thorpe, Richard Beverley, and John Smith (or Smyth) (1567\u20131641) of Nibley, a parish in the Hundred of Berkeley in Gloucestershire. Smyth was also the historian of the Berkeley group, collecting over 60 documents relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and 1634 which have survived to modern times. It consisted of about on the north bank of the James River near Herring Creek in an area then known as Charles Cittie (sic). It was named for one of the original founders, Richard Berkeley, a member of the Berkeley family of Gloucestershire, England. It was about 20 miles upstream from Jamestown, where the first permanent settlement of the Colony of Virginia was established on May 14, 1607. \nThe Berkeley Hundred was the next plantation down river from the Shirley Plantation.\nIn 1619, the ship \"Margaret\" of Bristol, England sailed for Virginia under Captain John Woodliffe and brought thirty-eight settlers to the new Town and Hundred of Berkeley. The Margaret landed her passengers at Berkeley Hundred on December 4, 1619. The group's London Company charter required that the day of arrival be observed as a day of thanksgiving to God. On that first day, Captain John Woodlief held a service pursuant to the charter which specified, \"Wee ordaine that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned for plantacon in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually keept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God.\". Because of this, the Berkeley Plantation had one of the first recorded celebrations of Thanksgiving in the United States, establishing the tradition two years and 17 days before the Pilgrims arrived aboard the \"Mayflower\" at Plymouth, Massachusetts to establish their Thanksgiving Day in 1621.\nOn March 22, 1622, Opchanacanough, head of the Powhatan Confederacy, began the Second Anglo-Powhatan War with a coordinated series of attacks against English settlements along the James River, known in English histories as the Indian massacre of 1622. Nine colonists were killed at Berkeley. The assault took a heavier toll elsewhere, killing about a third of all the colonists, and virtually wiping out Wolstenholme Towne on Martin's Hundred and Sir Thomas Dale's progressive development and new college at Henricus. Jamestown was spared through a timely warning and became the refuge for many survivors who abandoned outlying settlements. A myth about the March 22 date was that it occurred on Good Friday. This is incorrect.\nIn 1634, Charles Cittie became part of the first eight shires of Virginia, as Charles City County, one of the oldest in the United States, and is located along Virginia State Route 5, which runs parallel to the river's northern borders past sites of many of the James River Plantations between the colonial capital city of Williamsburg (now the site of Colonial Williamsburg) and the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia at Richmond.\nIn 1636 William Tucker, Maurice Thompson, George Thompson, William Harris, Thomas Deacon, James Stone, Cornelius Lloyd of London, merchants and Jeremiah Blackman of London, mariner, and their associates and company patented the 8,000 acres known as Berkeley Hundred. After several decades, the site of Berkeley Hundred became the property of Theodorick Bland of Westover. A portion of the Berkeley Hundred patent was purchased from descendant Giles Bland by Benjamin Harrison III. His son Benjamin Harrison IV built the three-story brick mansion that became the seat of the Harrison family, one of the First Families of Virginia.\nUsing bricks fired on the Berkeley plantation, Benjamin Harrison IV built a Georgian-style two-story brick mansion on a hill overlooking the James River in 1726. Harrison's son, Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and a governor of Virginia, was born at Berkeley Plantation, as was his son William Henry Harrison, a war hero in the Battle of Tippecanoe, governor of Indiana Territory, and ninth president of the United States. Berkeley would later earn a distinction shared only with Peacefield in Quincy, Massachusetts, as the ancestral home for two United States presidents, though this connection is tenuous, as William Henry Harrison's grandson, the 23rd president, Benjamin Harrison, was born and reared in North Bend, Ohio, and his father, John Scott Harrison, was born in Vincennes, Indiana, while his father (William Henry Harrison) was the first territorial governor of the Indiana Territory.\nThe first 10 U.S. presidents were all hosted by the Harrison family on this property at some point: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison (who was born on the property), and John Tyler (who lived nearby) are all known to have visited Berkeley.\nBy the time Benjamin Harrison VII inherited Berkeley in 1799, the land was worn out after more than two centuries of mono-culture tobacco and cotton crops and the plantation was drifting towards financial ruin. After 150 years of Harrison family ownership plantation was foreclosed on by a local bank and the family evicted. Benjamin Harrison VII was the last Harrison to own Berkeley.\nDuring the American Civil War, Union troops occupied Berkeley Plantation, and President Abraham Lincoln twice visited there in the summer of 1862 to confer with Gen. George B. McClellan. The Harrisons were unable to regain possession of the plantation after the war, and it was rented out by the bank from time to time to tenant farmers and the mansion was eventually used as a barn, falling into such disrepair that it was uninhabitable. Also in 1862, amid fighting in the Civil War, the area was the scene of the creation and first bugle rendition of present-day \"Taps\".\nRestoration.\nJohn Jamieson, a lumber tycoon who as a youth had been at Berkeley as a drummer boy in McClellan's army, purchased the property in 1907. In 1925, his son Malcolm inherited the property, expending large sums of money to turn the ruined main house into a livable and stately home for himself and his bride Grace Eggleston. The project took over a decade and the mansion was finally occupied by the Jamisons in 1938. \nThe ground floor of the mansion was turned into a museum in the 1960s. Today the house attracts visitors from the United States and other parts of the world.\nThe architecture is original, and the house has been filled with antique furniture and furnishings that date from the period when it was built. The grounds, too, have been restored, and cuttings from the boxwood gardens are available as living souvenirs for its visitors.\nBerkeley is still a working farm; corn, soybeans, wheat, tomatoes, and other vegetables are grown here.\nThere is also a small family cemetery on the property. Among those buried here are Benjamin Harrison V, Grace Jamieson, and Malcolm Jamieson.\nReconstructed slave quarters were built on the property in 2018 by the producers of \"Harriet\", a movie about Harriet Tubman that was filmed in part at the plantation. The original quarters were no longer extant at that point. Plantation owner Benjamin Harrison V held 110 people in slavery at the time of his death in 1791.\nExterior.\nThe main house is the centerpiece of ten acres of formal gardens and parterres. The house is surrounded by boxwood hedges forming all\u00e9es. Large pillars with decorative spires support large hinged gates.\nThe house is constructed of red brick with thin mortar joints. The two-story building's main entrance is in the center of the house, with two symmetrical windows on either side and a central window directly above the door. These windows are double sashed with 12 panes per sash. An entablature with dentil moldings support the gabled roof, which is pierced by three dormer windows and two large brick chimneys.\nThe grounds include a two-story gabled guest house, with symmetrical one-story wings on each side. In 1862, during the American Civil War and while the Union Army of the Potomac was camped at Berkeley Plantation, Confederates under General J.E.B. Stuart shot a cannonball into the side of the house from the nearby James River. The cannonball was never removed, and is still visible today. It is indicated with a small marker.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
