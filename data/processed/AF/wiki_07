The two counties were divided by the Suwannee River. All of the other counties were created later from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County. Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. Florida's most populous county is Miami-Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the nation, with a population of 2,701,767 as of the 2020 census.\nIn 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters. All but two of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities: the exceptions are Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County, and East Naples, located outside Naples city limits in Collier County.\nThe names of Florida's counties reflect its cultural heritage. Some are named for Confederate political leaders and Spanish explorers, marking the influence of Spanish sovereignty, while others are named for Christian saints, Native American sites, as well as political leaders of the United States. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants on both sides of the Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for the war's native Muscogee-Seminole resistance leader Osceola.\nPopulation figures are based on the 2024 vintage Census population estimates. The population of Florida is 23,372,215, an increase of 8.5% from 2020. The average population of Florida's counties is 348,839; Miami-Dade County is the most populous (2,838,461) and Liberty County is the least (7,955). The average land area is 805\u00a0sq mi (2,085\u00a0km2). The largest county is Collier County as per 2020 Census bureau of 1,998.32 sq mi.https://\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the U.S. government to uniquely identify counties and is provided for each entry. These codes link to the United States Census Bureau's \"quick facts\" for each county. Florida's FIPS code of 12 is used to distinguish from counties in other states. For example, Orange County's unique nationwide identifier is 12095.\nUnder the Florida Constitution the state government has the power to create and abolish counties. Each county in Florida is required to have a county seat under the state constitution.\nFormer counties.\nFayette County was created in 1832 from the portion of Jackson County east of the Chipola River, with its county seat at Ochesee (now in Calhoun County east of Altha). In 1834, it was merged back into Jackson County.\nRenamed counties.\nFive counties in Florida have been renamed. Most renamings occurred between 1845 and 1861, during the first sixteen years of Florida's statehood. One occurred in 1997, when Dade County changed its name to Miami-Dade County.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Vincennes Tract, Clark's Grant and an area known as \"The Gore\" in southeastern Indiana (resulting from the Treaty of Greenville 1795) existed during the Northwest Territory. The remainder of Indiana land was acquired by Indian Removal Act and purchases by treaty between 1804 and 1840. The largest purchase (called \"Delaware New Purchase\" or just \"New Purchase\") resulted from the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818) which acquired about 1/3 of the state in the central portion. All or most of 35 counties were eventually carved from the area. The oldest counties are generally in the south near the Ohio River, whereas newer ones were in the north in territory acquired later. Many of the final counties were formed subsequent to the acquisition and break up of the Big Miami Reserve (encompassing present day Howard County and parts of surrounding counties) between 1834 and 1840. The oldest and newest counties in Indiana are Knox County, created in 1790, and Newton County, created in 1859.\nAs of the 2024 Census estimates, the population of Indiana was 6,924,275, the average population of Indiana's 92 counties is 75,264, with Marion County as the most populous (981,628), and Ohio County (5,996) the least. 54 counties have 30,000 or more people; 17 counties have populations exceeding 100,000, five of which exceed 250,000; and only six counties have fewer than 10,000 people.

According to the Constitution of Indiana, no county may be created of less than , nor may any county smaller than this be further reduced in size, which precludes any new counties.\nCounty government in Indiana consists of two bodies, the county council and the commissioners.\nMany Indiana counties are named for United States Founding Fathers and personalities of the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and Battle of Tippecanoe; early leaders of Indiana Territory and Indiana, as well as surrounding states like Michigan and Kentucky; plus Native American tribes and geographical features.\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Indiana's code is 18, which when combined with any county code would be written as 18XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.\nIn Indiana, the most commonly seen number associated with counties is the state county code, which is a sequential number based on the alphabetical order of the county.\nIt has been used on automobile license plates since 1963. It first held a prominent place on the left side of the plates as part of the license plate number until the year 2008 when it was moved above the serial number and 2012 when it was moved to the lower right corner.

Thermal diffusivity is usually denoted by lowercase alpha (\u03b1), but a, h, \u03ba (kappa), K, D, formula_1 are also used.\nThe formula is\nformula_2\nwhere\n k is thermal conductivity (W/(m\u00b7K)),\n cp is specific heat capacity (J/(kg\u00b7K)),\n \u03c1 is density (kg/m3).\nTogether, \u03c1cp can be considered the volumetric heat capacity (J/(m3\u00b7K)).\nThermal diffusivity is a positive coefficient in the heat equation:\nformula_3\nOne way to view thermal diffusivity is as the ratio of the time derivative of temperature to its curvature, quantifying the rate at which temperature concavity is \"smoothed out\". In a substance with high thermal diffusivity, heat moves rapidly through it because the substance conducts heat quickly relative to its energy storage capacity or \"thermal bulk\".\nThermal diffusivity and thermal effusivity are related concepts and quantities used to simulate non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Diffusivity is the more fundamental concept and describes the stochastic process of heat spread throughout some \"local volume\" of a substance. Effusivity describes the corresponding transient process of heat flow through some \"local area\" of interest. Upon reaching a steady state, where the stored energy distribution stabilizes, the thermal conductivity (k) may be sufficient to describe heat transfers inside solid or rigid bodies by applying Fourier's law.\nThermal diffusivity is often measured with the flash method.

The Prandtl number is given as:\nformula_1|border colour=#0073CF|background colour=#F5FFFA}}where:\nNote that whereas the Reynolds number and Grashof number are subscripted with a scale variable, the Prandtl number contains no such length scale and is dependent only on the fluid and the fluid state. The Prandtl number is often found in property tables alongside other properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity.\nThe mass transfer analog of the Prandtl number is the Schmidt number and the ratio of the Prandtl number and the Schmidt number is the Lewis number.\nExperimental values.\nTypical values.\nFor most gases over a wide range of temperature and pressure, Pr is approximately constant. Therefore, it can be used to determine the thermal conductivity of gases at high temperatures, where it is difficult to measure experimentally due to the formation of convection currents.\nTypical values for Pr are:\nFormula for the calculation of the Prandtl number of air and water.\nFor air with a pressure of 1 bar, the Prandtl numbers in the temperature range between \u2212100\u00a0\u00b0C and +500\u00a0\u00b0C can be calculated using the formula given below.

The temperature is to be used in the unit degree Celsius. The deviations are a maximum of 1% from the literature values.\nformula_12\nPhysical interpretation.\nSmall values of the Prandtl number, Pr \u226a 1, means the thermal diffusivity dominates. Whereas with large values, Pr \u226b 1, the momentum diffusivity dominates the behavior.\nFor example, the listed value for liquid mercury indicates that the heat conduction is more significant compared to convection, so thermal diffusivity is dominant.\nHowever, engine oil with its high viscosity and low heat conductivity, has a higher momentum diffusivity as compared to thermal diffusivity.\nThe Prandtl numbers of gases are about 1, which indicates that both momentum and heat dissipate through the fluid at about the same rate. Heat diffuses very quickly in liquid metals (Pr \u226a 1) and very slowly in oils (Pr \u226b 1) relative to momentum. Consequently thermal boundary layer is much thicker for liquid metals and much thinner for oils relative to the velocity boundary layer.\nIn heat transfer problems, the Prandtl number controls the relative thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layers. When Pr is small, it means that the heat diffuses quickly compared to the velocity (momentum). This means that for liquid metals the thermal boundary layer is much thicker than the velocity boundary layer.\nIn laminar boundary layers, the ratio of the thermal to momentum boundary layer thickness over a flat plate is well approximated by\n formula_13\nwhere formula_14 is the thermal boundary layer thickness and formula_15 is the momentum boundary layer thickness.\nFor incompressible flow over a flat plate, the two Nusselt number correlations are asymptotically correct:\n formula_16\n formula_17\nwhere formula_18 is the Reynolds number.

Total heat transfer combines conduction and convection. Convection includes both advection (fluid motion) and diffusion (conduction). The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the convective but for a hypothetically motionless fluid. It is a dimensionless number, closely related to the fluid's Rayleigh number.\nA Nusselt number of order one represents heat transfer by pure conduction.336 A value between one and 10 is characteristic of slug flow or laminar flow. A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100\u20131000 range. \nA similar non-dimensional property is the Biot number, which concerns thermal conductivity for a solid body rather than a fluid. The mass transfer analogue of the Nusselt number is the Sherwood number.\nDefinition.\nThe Nusselt number is the ratio of total heat transfer (convection + conduction) to conductive heat transfer across a boundary. The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case.\nformula_1\nwhere \"h\" is the convective heat transfer coefficient of the flow, \"L\" is the characteristic length, and \"k\" is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.\nIn contrast to the definition given above, known as \"average Nusselt number\", the local Nusselt number is defined by taking the length to be the distance from the surface boundary to the local point of interest.\nformula_2\nThe \"mean\", or \"average\", number is obtained by integrating the expression over the range of interest, such as:\nformula_3\nContext.\nAn understanding of convection boundary layers is necessary to understand convective heat transfer between a surface and a fluid flowing past it.

As of 2024, there were 532 gambling operations run by 243 tribes, with a total annual revenue of $43.9 billion.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1970s, Russell and Helen Bryan, a married Chippewa couple living in a mobile home on Indian lands in northern Minnesota, received a property tax bill from the local county, Itasca County. The Bryans had never received a property tax bill from the county before. Unwilling to pay it, they took the tax notice to local legal aid attorneys at Leech Lake Legal Services, who brought suit to challenge the tax in the state courts. The Bryans lost their case in the state district court, and they lost again on appeal in a unanimous decision by the Minnesota Supreme Court. They then sought review at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court granted review, and in a sweeping and unanimous decision authored by Justice Brennan, the Supreme Court held not only that states do not have authority to tax Natives on their reservations, but that they also lack the authority to \"regulate\" Native activities on their reservations. Within a few years, enterprising Natives and tribes began to operate Indian bingo operations in numerous different locations around the United States.\nUnder the leadership of Howard Tommie, the Seminole Tribe of Florida built a large high-stakes bingo building on their reservation near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The tribe planned for the bingo hall to be open six days a week, contrary to Florida state law which only allows two days a week for bingo halls to be open, as well as going over the maximum limit of $100 jackpots. The law was enacted from the charity bingo limits set by Catholic Churches. The sheriff of Broward County, where the Native reservation lies, made arrests the minute the bingo hall opened, and the tribe sued the county (\"Seminole Tribe v. Butterworth\"), stating that Native tribes have sovereignty rights that are protected by the federal government from interference by state government. A District Court ruled in favor of the Natives, citing Chief Justice John Marshall in \"Worcester v. Georgia\".\nControversy arose when Natives began putting private casinos, bingo rooms, and lotteries on reservation lands and began setting gaming prizes which were above the maximum legal limit of the state. The Natives argued for sovereignty over their reservations to make them immune from state laws such as Public Law 280, which granted states to have criminal jurisdiction over Native reservations. States were afraid that Natives would have a significant competitive advantage over other gambling establishments in the state which were regulated, which would thus generate a vast amount of income for tribes.\nIn the late 1970s and continuing into the next decade, the delicate question concerning the legality of tribal gaming and immunity from state law hovered over the Supreme Court. The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 made it illegal to conduct gaming on tribal lands if said gaming would violate state laws, although the federal government did not take steps to enforce this statute. A report by the Department of Justice presented to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs on March 18, 1992, concluded that through several years of FBI investigation, organized crime had failed to infiltrate Native gaming and that there was no link between criminal activity in Native gaming and organized crime.\nA Supreme Court ruling issued on July 9, 2020, which expanded tribal jurisdiction for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma also opened the possibility for Native Americans to have more power to regulate casino gambling.\nCabazon Band, 1980.\nIn the early 1960s, the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, near Indio, California, were extremely poor and did not have much land because of neglected treaties in the 1850s by state senators. Historian Stuart Banner stated that the Cabazon Band and the neighboring Morongo Reservation had \"some HUD buildings and a few trailers, but that was about it. There was nothing really there. The people simply didn't have a lot.\" The Cabazon Band turned to casino operations, opening bingo and poker halls in 1980. Shortly thereafter, the Indio police and the Riverside County Sheriff shut down the gambling halls and arrested numerous Natives while seizing any cash and merchandise held in the tribe's possession. The Cabazon Band sued in federal court (\"California v. Cabazon Band\") and won, as did the Seminole Tribe in Florida.\nThe Supreme Court reviewed the case in 1986 to reach a decision over whether Native reservations are controlled by state law. The Court again ruled that Native gaming was to be regulated exclusively by Congress and the federal government, not state government. With tribal sovereignty upheld, the benefits of gaming became available to many tribes.\nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nIn 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (signed by President Ronald Reagan) which kept tribal sovereignty to create casino-like halls, but the states and Natives must be in Tribal-State compacts and the federal government has the power to regulate the gaming. These compacts have been used by state officials to confiscate Native casino revenue which serves as a \"special\" tax on Native reservations. Essentially, the tribes still have \"exclusive right\" to all classes of gaming except when states do not accept that class or it clashes with federal law.\nClass III Native gaming became a large issue for the states and federal government, because of these court cases, as Congress debated over a bill for Native gaming called the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\nCurrently, all attempts to challenge the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act on constitutional grounds have failed.\nIn 1988, when President Reagan signed the IGRA, Native gaming revenue stood at $100 million. By 1995, revenues had risen to $5.4 billion, and by 2004 they reached $19.4 billion. The National Indian Gaming Commission was created in 1988 following the IGRA's enactment to regulate Native gaming.\nThe Commission consists of three members: a chairman who is appointed by the US president with the consent of the Senate, and two associate members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. Each member serves a three-year term and must pass a detailed background check by the US Attorney General.\nThe NIGC withholds certain powers over Class II and Class III gaming. These include budget approval, civil fines, fees, subpoenas, and permanent orders. The NIGC monitors Class II gaming on Native lands on a continuing basis through inspection, investigation, access to records, and contracts. As for Class III gaming, all contracts must be approved by the chairman of the NIGC. 200 of the 562 federally recognized tribes created Class III gaming of large casinos and high jackpots.\nThis rise of gaming not only brought great revenue but also corruption. In January 2006, a court case involving lobbyists convicted of felonies such as conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion. This was known as the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. These lobbyists, Jack Abramoff, Ralph Reed, Grover Norquist, and Michael Scanlon, bribed members of Congress when lobbying for Native casinos, then overcharged their Native clients; this generated around $90 million in fees from the Natives.\n2006 legislation.\nIn 2006, Congress introduced legislation to protect their own casino interests from those tribes that are outside reservations. Further, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has faced increasing pressure to tighten regulatory policy and oversight of casino approvals. In particular, the BIA has been instructed by Congress to implement new procedures after two decades of IGRA's existence. These procedures would allow local communities to have more influence in the siting of casinos in their community and would make the process of casino approval more transparent. To many tribes, however, the proposed regulations will further encroach on tribal sovereignty.\nRegulatory schemes.\nStatistics provided by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), indicate that there are 460 Native gaming establishments in the US. These casinos are operated by 240 federally recognized tribes and offer Class I, Class II and Class III gaming. Gaming is divided into 3 classes with a different regulatory scheme for each:\nClass I.\nClass I gaming is defined as (1) traditional Indian gaming, which may be part of tribal ceremonies and celebrations, and (2) social gaming for minimal prizes. Regulatory authority over class I gaming is vested exclusively in tribal governments and is not subject to IGRA's requirements.\nClass II.\nClass II gaming is defined as the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith) and, if played in the same location as the bingo, pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank. The Act specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of any game of chance from the definition of class II games.\nTribes retain their authority to conduct, license, and regulate class II gaming so long as the state in which the Tribe is located permits such gaming for any purpose, and the Tribal government adopts a gaming ordinance approved by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). Tribal governments are responsible for regulating class II gaming with Commission oversight. Only Hawaii and Utah continue to prohibit all types of gaming.\nClass III.\nThe definition of class III gaming is broad. It includes all forms of gaming that are neither class I nor II. Games commonly played at casinos, such as slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette, clearly fall in the class III category, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. Generally, class III is often referred to as casino-style gaming. As a compromise, the Act restricts Tribal authority to conduct class III gaming.\nBefore a Tribe may lawfully conduct class III gaming, the following conditions must be met:\nThe regulatory scheme for class III gaming is more complex than a casual reading of the statute might suggest. Although Congress clearly intended regulatory issues to be addressed in Tribal-State compacts, it left a number of key functions in federal hands, including approval authority over compacts, management contracts, and Tribal gaming ordinances. Congress also vested the commission with broad authority to issue regulations in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the Commission plays a key role in the regulation of class II and III gaming.\nThe revenue generated in these establishments was close to $27.1 billion in 2011 up from $12.8 billion in 2001. The regions with largest revenues in 2011 were Sacramento ($6.9 billion) and Washington State ($6.7 billion). The Native American gaming industry has been described as \"recession-resistant\", although tribes in many states (including Arizona, California, Connecticut and New Mexico) saw revenues fall at a similar rate to commercial casinos during the Great Recession of 2007\u20132009.\nTribal casinos in the eastern US generated roughly $3.8 billion in FY02. Those in the Central US recorded gross revenues of approximately $5.9 billion, while those in the Western US generated nearly $4.8 billion. Most of the revenues generated in the Native gaming are from casinos located in or near large metropolitan areas. Currently, 12% of Native gaming establishments generate 65% of Native gaming revenues. Native gaming operations located in the populous areas of the West Coast (primarily California) represent the fastest growing sector of the Native gaming industry. As suggested by the above figures, the vast majority of tribal casinos are much less financially successful, particularly those in the Midwest and Great Plains. Many tribes see this limited financial success as being tempered by decreases in reservation unemployment and poverty rates, although socioeconomic deficits remain.\nAs of 2008 there are 562 federally recognized tribes in the United States, many of which have chosen not to enter the gambling industry.\nBy state.\nCalifornia.\nThe largest casino in the state of California is the Yaamava' Resort &amp; Casino in Highland, with over 7,000 slot machines and 290,000 square feet of gaming area. Other large gaming operations include the Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, with 3,000+ slot machines and approximately of gaming space, Morongo Casino, Resort &amp; Spa, Chumash Casino Resort, Harrah's Resort Southern California, Barona Casino, Pala Casino Resort and Spa, Thunder Valley Casino Resort, Graton Resort &amp; Casino and Cache Creek Casino Resort. Tribal casinos in California generate $9 billion in revenue annually.\nConnecticut.\nThe Foxwoods Resort Casino opened in 1992 in Ledyard, Connecticut. Operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and earning $1.5 billion, it was more profitable than any one casino in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. With 7,200 slot machines and 380 table games, the Foxwoods Resort Casino is the largest casino in the US and second largest in the world after Venetian Macao. Today, the property spans 1.5 miles from end to end, with 6 casinos, four hotels, more than 30 restaurants, two theaters, two spas, and more than one hundred retailers. The agreement between the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the State of Connecticut promises the state $80 million or 25% of their annual slot revenue. Since Foxwoods opened in 1992, the state of Connecticut has received more than $4 billion in slot revenue from Foxwoods alone.\nThe Mohegan Sun Resort &amp; Casino is also located in Connecticut, and is owned and operated by the Mohegan Tribe. The Mohegan Tribe approached the Mashantucket Pequots in the early 1990s for permission to pursue gaming. Although doing so would relinquish their gaming monopoly in Connecticut, the Mashantuckets granted the Mohegans their request, who then opened Mohegan Sun in 1996. This enterprise is and consists of 6,500 slot machines and 180 table games. It is the second largest casino in the United States, located 7 miles away from Foxwoods in Uncasville, Connecticut. Since opening in 1996, the state of Connecticut has received more than $3 billion in slot revenue from Mohegan Sun alone.\nThe success of both casinos is due in no small part to their location roughly halfway between New York City and Boston.\nThe economic recession that began in 2007 took a heavy toll of receipts, and by 2012 both Foxwoods in Connecticut and its nearby rival the Mohegan Sun were deeply in debt. \"The New York Times Magazine\" said \"Foxwoods is fighting for its life\", with debts of $2.3 billion. In August 2012, the tribe owning the Foxwoods Casino restructured over a billion dollars in debt in an attempt to remain profitable.\nFlorida.\nThe Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, also known as \"The Guitar Hotel\", is a hotel and casino resort near Hollywood, Florida, United States, located on 100 acres (40 ha) of the Hollywood Reservation of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The property currently has one hotel tower, a 140,000 sq ft (13,000 m2) casino, large poker room, a 4 acres (1.6 ha) lagoon-style pool facility with a center bar and many private cabanas, restaurants, shops, spa, bars and nightclubs, and the Hard Rock Event Center. A large expansion was completed in October 2019.\nIdaho.\nThe Coeur d\u2019Alene Casino is located in Idaho, US. Founded in 1993, the establishment consists the Circling Raven Golf Club, two luxury hotels, 100,000 square feet of casino space, and various restaurants. The Coeur d\u2019Alene Casino currently employs an average of 1000 local residents, making it one of the largest employers in the region. A part of the casino's profits are invested back to the Coeur d'Alene people in education and various investment projects.\nThe Shoshone-Bannock Tribe also operates a slots-only casino in Fort Hall, Idaho, located just outside Pocatello, Idaho.\nIndiana.\nThe state of Indiana's first tribal casino was opened on 16 January 2017. The 175,000-square-foot Four Winds Casino is located in South Bend and is operated by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians.\nMinnesota.\nThe biggest casino in Minnesota is Mystic Lake Casino Hotel. Mystic Lake Casino Hotel is owned and operated by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) in Prior Lake, Minnesota, United States, southwest of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. With 4,100 employees, the SMSC \u2013 including Mystic Lake Casino Hotel and Little Six Casino \u2013 is the largest employer in Scott County. The casino's gambling options include slots, bingo, video roulette, pulltabs, and live dealer blackjack. Mystic Lake also offers bars, restaurants, shows, special events, and accommodations.\nThe Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino is a tribal gaming facility owned and operated by the Prairie Island Indian Community (PIIC) in Welch, MN \u2013 Goodhue County. It is the only casino resort in southern Minnesota located on the Mississippi River. The casino's gaming options include slot machines; video roulette, blackjack and keno; live dealer blackjack, poker and other table games; and bingo. Additional amenities to the property include a hotel, the Island Event Center, a marina, RV-park, a cruise yacht, a 24-lane bowling center, several restaurants; and a water park and spa. Employing nearly 1,500 people, Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino is the largest employer in Goodhue County.\nNew York.\nIn March 1994 the Mohawk people created a joint venture with Alpha Hospitality to develop and operate a gaming facility on tribal lands. In January 1996 they entered into a memorandum with Robert A. Berman's Catskill Development, L.L.C. regarding the development and management of a casino adjacent to the Monticello Raceway. The project received approval from the National Indian Gaming Commission.\nIn 1999, however, the Mohawk tribe signed an agreement to build the casino with Park Place Entertainment instead. The Akwesasne Mohawk Casino (AMC) was inaugurated that same year in Hogansburg, New York. The facility comprises 140,000 square feet of casino floor space that includes over 1,800 slot machines and 30 table games, as well as a luxury hotel, spas, restaurants, and a number of entertainment venues. The casino is managed by the Mohawk Nation.\nOklahoma.\nNative gaming revenues in Oklahoma rose to $3.23 billion in 2010, representing 44 percent of all U.S. casinos. Oklahoma surpassed Connecticut as second in the United States for gaming revenue, according to Alan Meister, an economist with Nathan Associates Inc.\nOklahoma has 113 tribal casinos, more than any other state in the U.S. A 2015 report on U.S. Gaming says that Oklahoma has the most gaming machines. WinStar World Casino in Thackerville, Oklahoma, is the third largest casino in North America with more than 500,000 square feet of gaming floor. Much of this success is due to geography: the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is roughly an hour's drive from the Oklahoma state line, and Texas does not permit casino gambling. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 mandates that net revenues of such gaming be directed to tribes for government, economic development and general welfare use; to charitable organizations and to help fund local governments. Approved by voters in 2004, Oklahoma's State-Tribal Gaming Act created a tribal gaming compact allowing federally recognized American Indian tribes to operate, electronic bonanza-style bingo games, electronic amusement games, electronic instant bingo games and non house-banked card games. The current compact automatically renews on Jan. 1, 2020. The Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act allowed any recognized tribe in Oklahoma to be federally incorporated, have the right to self-determination and make their own bylaws.\nSouth Dakota.\nTribal gaming in South Dakota is regulated through tribal-state compacts negotiated with individual tribes, with the oversight of the South Dakota Commission on Gambling. Casino games in Class II and Class III are permitted. Sports betting is legal in tribal casinos but mobile sports betting is not currently allowed. Among the 12 tribal casinos operated by 7 South Dakota Native American tribes, the Sioux-owned Royal River Casino in Flandreau is the largest, featuring 400 slot machines, a dozen gambling tables, and two restaurants.\nWyoming.\nThe development of Indian gaming in Wyoming experienced significant challenges. The Northern Arapaho Tribe, after several unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a compact with the state, initiated a lawsuit in federal court. Their claim was rooted in the assertion that Wyoming's refusal to negotiate constituted bad faith, especially considering that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 permitted casino-style gaming on tribal lands, as such gaming was already allowed within Wyoming for fundraising purposes.\nIn 2005, a pivotal court decision favored the Northern Arapaho Tribe, granting them the right to offer comprehensive casino-style Class III gambling on their lands. This ruling was a consequence of Wyoming's actions, which ultimately led to the state forfeiting any claim to revenue sharing from Class III gaming income generated by the tribe.\nFollowing this judicial outcome, in May 2006, Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe entered into the state\u2019s first Class III gaming compact. This agreement, negotiated in April 2006, was made possible after the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that all types of Class III gaming were accessible to tribes within the state. Both the Northern Arapaho Tribe and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe have since operated casinos near their shared Wind River Indian Reservation.\nIn Wyoming, while there are no commercial casinos, tribal gaming is conducted by the Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho Tribes with casinos located on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Fremont County near Lander and Riverton. The Eastern Shoshone Tribe operates under a state compact, while the Northern Arapaho Tribe's gaming activities are authorized by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). When interacting with these tribes for business purposes, it is crucial to adhere to each tribe\u2019s specific policies and procedures, as well as any additional tribal laws or regulations.\nImpact on Native American economics.\nNative American gaming has, in some instances, changed the face of tribal economies, but it has also proven to be very ineffective in other situations. Although tribal victories over the governmental and cultural oppression in the 1950s yielded a dynamic transformation, economic success fell short in comparison. Unemployment was down and personal income had increased, but only a handful of tribes had made economic changes. Their strides were spotty and fluctuated greatly from each Native reservation. This was happening because, for most tribes, their lands were not economically productive, infrastructure was poor, and they were far away from prospering markets of large populations. In order to address the issue of poverty, Native tribes were required to fuel some type of economic development. Natives sold some of their tribal land to prospecting non-Natives in order to stimulate economic growth, but tribal gaming has proved to be the single largest source of income in the Native community. However, the United States government intervened in tribal affairs throughout the rise of Native gaming.\nMany tribal governments have seen substantial improvements in their ability to provide public services to their members, such as building schools, improving infrastructure, and shoring up the loss of native traditions. Tribal gaming operations have not been without controversy, however. A small number of tribes have been able to distribute large per-capita payments, generating considerable public attention. Additionally, the national expansion of Native gaming has led to a practice critics call \"reservation shopping\". This term describes tribes that, with the backing of casino investors, attempt to locate a casino off their reservation, usually near a large urban center. However, although authorized by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, only three \"off-reservation\" casinos have been built to date.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It frequently arises in the study of situations involving natural convection and is analogous to the Reynolds number (Re).\nDefinition.\nHeat transfer.\nFree convection is caused by a change in density of a fluid due to a temperature change or gradient. Usually the density decreases due to an increase in temperature and causes the fluid to rise. This motion is caused by the buoyancy force. The major force that resists the motion is the viscous force. The Grashof number is a way to quantify the opposing forces.\nThe Grashof number is:\nformula_1 for vertical flat plates\nformula_2 for pipes and bluff bodies\nwhere:\nThe L and D subscripts indicate the length scale basis for the Grashof number.\nThe transition to turbulent flow occurs in the range 108 &lt; Gr\"L\" &lt; 109 for natural convection from vertical flat plates. At higher Grashof numbers, the boundary layer is turbulent; at lower Grashof numbers, the boundary layer is laminar, that is, in the range 103 &lt; Gr\"L\" &lt; 106.\nMass transfer.\nThere is an analogous form of the Grashof number used in cases of natural convection mass transfer problems. In the case of mass transfer, natural convection is caused by concentration gradients rather than temperature gradients.\nformula_3\nwhere\nformula_4\nand:\nRelationship to other dimensionless numbers.\nThe Rayleigh number, shown below, is a dimensionless number that characterizes convection problems in heat transfer. A critical value exists for the Rayleigh number, above which fluid motion occurs.\nformula_5\nThe ratio of the Grashof number to the square of the Reynolds number may be used to determine if forced or free convection may be neglected for a system, or if there's a combination of the two. This characteristic ratio is known as the Richardson number (Ri). If the ratio is much less than one, then free convection may be ignored. If the ratio is much greater than one, forced convection may be ignored. Otherwise, the regime is combined forced and free convection.\nformula_6 \nformula_7\nformula_8\nDerivation.\nThe first step to deriving the Grashof number is manipulating the volume expansion coefficient, formula_9 as follows.\nformula_10\nThe formula_11 in the equation above, which represents specific volume, is not the same as the formula_11 in the subsequent sections of this derivation, which will represent a velocity. This partial relation of the volume expansion coefficient, formula_9, with respect to fluid density, formula_14, given constant pressure, can be rewritten as\nformula_15\nwhere:\nThere are two different ways to find the Grashof number from this point. One involves the energy equation while the other incorporates the buoyant force due to the difference in density between the boundary layer and bulk fluid.\nEnergy equation.\nThis discussion involving the energy equation is with respect to rotationally symmetric flow. This analysis will take into consideration the effect of gravitational acceleration on flow and heat transfer. The mathematical equations to follow apply both to rotational symmetric flow as well as two-dimensional planar flow.\nformula_19\nwhere:\nIn this equation the superscript n is to differentiate between rotationally symmetric flow from planar flow. The following characteristics of this equation hold true.\nThis equation expands to the following with the addition of physical fluid properties:\nformula_28\nFrom here we can further simplify the momentum equation by setting the bulk fluid velocity to 0 (formula_29).\nformula_30\nThis relation shows that the pressure gradient is simply a product of the bulk fluid density and the gravitational acceleration. The next step is to plug in the pressure gradient into the momentum equation.\nformula_31\nwhere the volume expansion coefficient to density relationship formula_32 found above and the kinematic viscosity relationship formula_33 were substituted into the momentum equation.formula_34\nTo find the Grashof number from this point, the preceding equation must be non-dimensionalized. This means that every variable in the equation should have no dimension and should instead be a ratio characteristic to the geometry and setup of the problem. This is done by dividing each variable by corresponding constant quantities. Lengths are divided by a characteristic length, formula_35. Velocities are divided by appropriate reference velocities, formula_36, which, considering the Reynolds number, gives formula_37. Temperatures are divided by the appropriate temperature difference, formula_38. These dimensionless parameters look like the following:\nThe asterisks represent dimensionless parameter. Combining these dimensionless equations with the momentum equations gives the following simplified equation.\nformula_44\nformula_45\nwhere:\nformula_46 is the surface temperature\nformula_47 is the bulk fluid temperature\nformula_35 is the characteristic length.\nThe dimensionless parameter enclosed in the brackets in the preceding equation is known as the Grashof number:\nformula_49\nBuckingham \u03c0 theorem.\nAnother form of dimensional analysis that will result in the Grashof number is known as the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem. This method takes into account the buoyancy force per unit volume, formula_50 due to the density difference in the boundary layer and the bulk fluid.\nformula_51\nThis equation can be manipulated to give,\nformula_52\nThe list of variables that are used in the Buckingham \u03c0 method is listed below, along with their symbols and dimensions.\nWith reference to the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem there are 9 \u2013 5 \n 4 dimensionless groups. Choose L, formula_53 k, g and formula_54 as the reference variables. Thus the formula_55 groups are as follows:\nformula_56,\nformula_57,\nformula_58,\nformula_59.\nSolving these formula_60 groups gives:\nformula_61,\nformula_62,\nformula_63,\nformula_64\nFrom the two groups formula_65 and formula_66 the product forms the Grashof number:\nformula_67\nTaking formula_33 and formula_69 the preceding equation can be rendered as the same result from deriving the Grashof number from the energy equation.\nformula_70\nIn forced convection the Reynolds number governs the fluid flow. But, in natural convection the Grashof number is the dimensionless parameter that governs the fluid flow. Using the energy equation and the buoyant force combined with dimensional analysis provides two different ways to derive the Grashof number.\nPhysical Reasoning.\nIt is also possible to derive the Grashof number by physical definition of the number as follows:\nformula_71\nHowever, above expression, especially the final part at the right hand side, is slightly different from Grashof number appearing in literature. Following dimensionally correct scale in terms of dynamic viscosity can be used to have the final form.\nformula_72Writing above scale in Gr gives;\nformula_73Physical reasoning is helpful to grasp the meaning of the number. On the other hand, following velocity definition can be used as a characteristic velocity value for making certain velocities nondimensional.\nformula_74\nEffects of Grashof number on the flow of different fluids.\nIn a recent research carried out on the effects of Grashof number on the flow of different fluids driven by convection over various surfaces. Using slope of the linear regression line through data points, it is concluded that increase in the value of Grashof number or any buoyancy related parameter implies an increase in the wall temperature and this makes the bond(s) between the fluid to become weaker, strength of the internal friction to decrease, the gravity to becomes stronger enough (i.e. makes the specific weight appreciably different between the immediate fluid layers adjacent to the wall). The effects of buoyancy parameter are highly significant in the laminar flow within the boundary layer formed on a vertically moving cylinder. This is only achievable when the prescribed surface temperature (PST) and prescribed wall heat flux (WHF) are considered. It can be concluded that buoyancy parameter has a negligible positive effect on the local Nusselt number. This is only true when the magnitude of Prandtl number is small or prescribed wall heat flux (WHF) is considered. Sherwood number, Bejan Number, Entropy generation, Stanton Number and pressure gradient are increasing properties of buoyancy related parameter while concentration profiles, frictional force, and motile microorganism are decreasing properties.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Phthiraptera was previously recognized as an order, until a 2021 genetic study determined that they are a highly modified lineage of the order Psocodea, whose members are commonly known as booklice, barklice or barkflies.\nLice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts, which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, and bats. Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, whereas sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs, called nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.\nHumans host two species of louse\u2014the head louse and the body louse are subspecies of \"Pediculus humanus\"; and the pubic louse, \"Pthirus pubis\". Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus. Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as \"The Kilkenny Louse House\", and novels such as James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\nThe body louse has the smallest genome of any known insect; it has been used as a model organism and has been the subject of much research. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse was one of the early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, \"Micrographia\". \nThe oldest known fossil lice are from the Cretaceous.\nClassification.\nLice are classified as an infraorder called Phthiraptera, named by Ernst Haeckel in 1896. Phthiraptera was previously recognized as an order, and was considered the sister taxon to the order Psocoptera, which contains booklice, barklice and barkflies, all within the greater group called Psocodea. However, a 2021 genetic study determined that Phthiraptera lice are a highly modified lineage within the Psocoptera group, thus rendering Psocoptera paraphyletic and necessating a classification change. Phthiraptera is now nested within the suborder Troctomorpha, belonging to the now-ranked order Psocodea. Within Psocodea, the Phthiraptera lice are most closely related to family Liposcelididae.\nA cladogram showing the position of Phthiraptera within Psocodea is shown below:\nInternal classification.\nPhthiraptera is clearly a monophyletic grouping, united as the members are by a number of derived features, including their parasitism on warm-blooded vertebrates and the combination of their metathoracic ganglia with their abdominal ganglia to form a single ventral nerve junction.\nThe order has traditionally been divided into two suborders, the sucking lice (Anoplura) and the chewing lice (Mallophaga). However, subsequent classifications indicated that the Mallophaga are paraphyletic, and four suborders were then recognized.\nUpon finding that Phthiraptera was nested within Psocoptera in 2021, de Moya \"et al.\" reduced the rank of Phthiraptera to infraorder, and the suborders were reduced down to parvorder. Also, based on the paraphyletic nature of one of the parvorders - Ischnocera - they proposed creation of a fifth parvorder Trichodectera to be created and split off from Ischnocera. Here are the five proposed parvorders within Phthiraptera:\nEvolutionary history.\nThe oldest confirmed fossil louse is \"Archimenopon myanmarensis\", an amblyceran from the Cretaceous amber from Myanmar. Another early representative of the group is a bird louse, \"Megamenopon rasnitsyni\", from Eckfelder Maar, Germany, which dates to the Eocene, around 44 million years ago. \"Saurodectes vrsanskyi\" from the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) Zaza Formation of Buryatia, Russia, has also been suggested to be a louse, but this is tentative.\nPlacental mammal lice had a single common ancestor that lived on Afrotheria with this arising from host-switching from an ancient avian host.\nDescription.\nNearly 5,000 species of louse have been identified, about 4,000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent in all the habitats that their host animals occupy. They are found even in the Antarctic, where penguins carry 15 species of lice (in the genera \"Austrogonoides\" and \"Nesiotinus\").\nLice are divided into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their nourishment from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding on skin, fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co-evolved with it. In some cases, they live on only a particular part of the body. Some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host.\nSucking lice range in length from . They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no ocelli, and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their antennae are short with three to five segments, and their mouthparts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for piercing and sucking. There is a cibarial pump at the start of the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, containing a salivary canal (ventrally) and a food canal (dorsally). The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.\nChewing lice are also flattened and can be slightly larger than sucking lice, ranging in length from . They are similar to sucking lice in form but the head is wider than the thorax and all species have compound eyes. There are no ocelli and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The antennae have three to five segments and are slender in the suborder Ischnocera, but club-shaped in the suborder Amblycera. The legs are short and robust, and terminated by one or two claws. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die.\nLice are usually cryptically coloured to match the fur or feathers of the host. A louse's colour varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker.\nFemale lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.\nHumans host three different kinds of lice: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice. Head lice and body lice are subspecies of \"Pediculus humanus\", and pubic lice are a separate species, \"Pthirus pubis\". Lice infestations can be controlled with lice combs, and medicated shampoos or washes.\nEcology.\nThe average number of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an aggregated distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial\u2014more social\u2014bird species. Host organisms that dive under water to feed on aquatic prey harbour fewer taxa of lice. Bird taxa that are capable of exerting stronger antiparasitic defence\u2014such as stronger T cell immune response or larger uropygial glands\u2014harbour more taxa of Amblyceran lice than others. Reductions in the size of host populations may cause a long-lasting reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.\nLice may reduce host life expectancy if the infestation is heavy, but most seem to have little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably an attempt by the birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others. Lice infestation is a disadvantage in the context of sexual rivalry.\nIn human culture.\nIn social history.\nLice have been intimately associated with human society throughout history. In the Middle Ages, they were essentially ubiquitous. At the death of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1170, it was recorded that \"The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and the onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughing\". The clergy often saw lice and other parasites as a constant reminder of human frailty and weakness. Monks and nuns would purposely ignore grooming themselves and suffer from infestations to express their religious devotion. A mediaeval treatment for lice was an ointment made from pork grease, incense, lead, and aloe.\nRobert Hooke's 1667 book, \"Micrographia: or some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses with observations and Inquiries thereupon\", illustrated a human louse, drawn as seen down an early microscope.\nMargaret Cavendish's satirical \"The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World\" (1668) has \"Lice-men\" as \"mathematicians\", investigating nature by trying to weigh the air like the real scientist Robert Boyle.\nIn 1935 the Harvard medical researcher Hans Zinsser wrote the book \"Rats, Lice and History\", alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans. Despite this, the modern view is that only the body louse can transmit the disease.\nSoldiers in the trenches of the First World War suffered severely from lice, and the typhus they carried. The Germans boasted that they had lice under effective control, but themselves suffered badly from lice in the Second World War on the Eastern Front, especially in the Battle of Stalingrad. \"Delousing\" became a euphemism for the extermination of Jews in concentration camps such as Auschwitz under the Nazi regime.\nIn the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis, patients express a persistent irrational fear of animals such as lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with \"an unshakable false belief that live organisms are present in the skin\".\nIn literature and folklore.\nJames Joyce's 1939 book \"Finnegans Wake\" has the character Shem the Penman infested with \"foxtrotting fleas, the lieabed lice,\u00a0... bats in his belfry\".\nClifford E. Trafzer's \"A Chemehuevi Song: The Resilience of a Southern Paiute Tribe\" retells the story of Sinawavi (Coyote)'s love for Poowavi (Louse). Her eggs are sealed in a basket woven by her mother, who gives it to Coyote, instructing him not to open it before he reaches home. Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.\nThe Irish songwriter John Lyons (b. 1934) wrote the popular song \"The Kilkenny Louse House\". The song contains the lines \"Well we went up the stairs and we put out the light, Sure in less than five minutes, I had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch\". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on \"From Puck to Appleby\" (2003), and the Dubliners on \"Double Dubliners\" (1972) among others.\nRobert Burns dedicated a poem to the louse, inspired by witnessing one on a lady's bonnet in church: \"Ye ugly, creepin, blastid wonner, Detested, shunn'd, by saint and sinner, How dare ye set your fit upon her, sae fine lady! Gae somewhere else, and seek your dinner on some poor body.\" John Milton in \"Paradise Lost\" mentioned the biblical plague of lice visited upon pharaoh: \"Frogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion, and filled all the land.\" John Ray recorded a Scottish proverb, \"Gie a beggar a bed and he'll repay you with a Louse.\" In Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\", Thersites compares Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon, to a louse: \"Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus.\"\nIn science.\nThe human body louse \"Pediculus humanus humanus\" has the smallest insect genome known, and this louse can transmit certain diseases that the closely related human head louse (\"P. h. capitis\") cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.\nLice have been the subject of significant DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, \"Pediculus\" and \"Pthirus\": head lice (\"Pediculus humanus capitis\"), body lice (\"Pediculus humanus humanus\"), and pubic lice (\"Pthirus pubis\"). Human head and body lice (genus \"Pediculus\") share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus \"Pthirus\") share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that \"Pediculus\" and \"Pthirus\" are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between \"Pediculus\" and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host\u2013parasite cospeciation events are likely.\nGenetic evidence suggests that human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus \"Pediculus\", the divergence in \"Pthirus\" does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a \"Pthirus\" species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it is difficult to determine if a parasite\u2013host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).\nAdditionally, the DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and feed on the scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides an estimate of the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.\nThe mitochondrial genome of the human species of the body louse (\"Pediculus humanus humanus\"), the head louse (\"Pediculus humanus capitis\") and the pubic louse (\"Pthirus pubis\") fragmented into a number of minichromosomes at least seven million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice. Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in prehistory. The dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is the Out of Africa Hypothesis. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.\nWoodlouse.\nThe name woodlouse or wood-louse is given to crustaceans of the suborder Oniscidea within the order Isopoda, unrelated to lice. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\"'s earliest citation of this usage is from 1611.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The modern Pequot are members of the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, four other state-recognized groups in Connecticut including the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, or the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin. They historically spoke Pequot, a dialect of the Mohegan-Pequot language, which became extinct by the early 20th century. Some tribal members are undertaking revival efforts.\nThe Pequot and the Mohegan were formerly a single group, but the Mohegan split off in the 17th century as the Pequot came to control much of Connecticut. Simmering tensions with the New England Colonies led to the Pequot War of 1634\u20131638, which some historians consider to be a genocide under modern day terms, which dramatically reduced the population and influence of the Pequot; many members were killed, enslaved, or dispersed. Small numbers of Pequots remain in Connecticut, receiving reservations at Mashantucket in 1666 and at the Pawcatuck River in 1683; others lived in different areas and with other tribes. In the 18th century, some Christian Pequot joined members of several other groups to form the Brothertown Indians in western New Hampshire. They relocated to Western New York in the 19th century, where they were allowed land by the Oneida people of the Iroquois League, and later to Wisconsin, where they were granted a reservation.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot Tribe received federal recognition in 1983 through a settlement of a land claim. In 1986, they founded the Foxwoods Resort Casino on their land. Located in proximity to the New York City metropolitan area, it has become one of the country's most successful Native American casinos.\nThe Pawcatuck River Pequot formed the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is recognized by Connecticut but is not federally recognized. Additionally, Pequot descendants are enrolled in the federally recognized Mohegan Tribe, as well as the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation and Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation of Connecticut, and the Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin, which also have degrees of state recognition. The Poospatuck Reservation on Long Island is home to a few hundred self-identified Pequot descendants.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\n\"Pequot\" is an Algonquian word, the meaning of which is disputed among language specialists. Considerable scholarship on the Pequot claims that the name came from \"Pequtt\u00f4og\", meaning \u2018the destroyers\u2019 or \u2018the men of the swamp\u2019. Frank Speck was a leading specialist of the Mohegan-Pequot language in the early twentieth century, and he believed that another term was more plausible, meaning \u2018the shallowness of a body of water\u2019, given that the Pequot territory was along the coast of Long Island Sound.\nHistorians have debated whether the Pequot migrated about 1500 from the upper Hudson River Valley toward central and eastern Connecticut. The theory of Pequot migration to the Connecticut River Valley can be traced to Rev. William Hubbard, who claimed in 1677 that the Pequot had invaded the region some time before the establishment of Plymouth Colony rather than originating in the region. In the aftermath of King Philip's War, Hubbard detailed in his \"Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New-England\" the ferocity with which some of New England's tribes responded to the English. Hubbard described the Pequot as \"foreigners\" to the region; not invaders from another shore but \"from the interior of the continent\" who \"by force seized upon one of the goodliest places near the sea, and became a Terror to all their Neighbors.\"\nMuch of the archaeological, linguistic and documentary evidence now available demonstrates that the Pequot were not invaders to the Connecticut River Valley but were indigenous in that area for thousands of years. By the time of the founding of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, the Pequot had already attained a position of political, military, and economic dominance in central and eastern Connecticut. They occupied the coastal area between the Niantic tribe of the Niantic River of Connecticut and the Narragansett in western Rhode Island. The Pequot numbered some 16,000 persons in the most densely inhabited portion of southern New England.\nThe smallpox epidemic of 1616\u20131619 killed many of the Native Americans of the eastern coast of New England, but it did not reach the Pequot, Niantic nor Narragansett tribes. In 1633 the Dutch established a trading post called the House of Good Hope at Hartford. They executed the principal Pequot \"sachem\", Tatobem, because of a violation of an agreement. After the Pequot paid the Dutch a large ransom, they returned Tatobem's body to his people. His successor was Sassacus.\nIn 1633 an epidemic devastated all of the region's tribes, and historians estimate that the Pequot suffered the loss of 80 percent of their population. At the outbreak of the Pequot War, Pequot survivors may have numbered only about 3,000.\nPequot War.\nMembers of the Pequot tribe killed a resident of Connecticut Colony in 1636, John Oldham, and war erupted as a result. The Mohegan and the Narragansett tribes sided with the colonists. Around 1,500 Pequot warriors were killed in battles or hunted down, and others were captured and distributed as slaves or household servants. A few escaped to join the Mohawk, and the Niantic tribe on Long Island. Eventually, some returned to their traditional lands, where family groups of friendly Pequots had stayed. Of those enslaved, most were awarded to the allied tribes, but many were also sold as slaves in Bermuda. The Mohegans treated their Pequot captives so severely that officials of Connecticut Colony eventually removed them. Connecticut established two reservations for the Pequots in 1683: the Eastern Pequot Reservation in North Stonington, Connecticut, and the Western Pequots (or Mashantucket Pequot Reservation) in Ledyard.\n19th century.\nThe Shawnee chief Tecumseh cited the destruction of the Pequot in call to arms against the United States during the War of 1812. It was commonly thought that they had disappeared entirely due to violence against Native Americans provoked by American colonists, although this was not true.\nModern history.\nThe 1910 census numbered the Pequot population at 66, and they reached their lowest number several decades later. Pequot numbers grew significantly during the 1970s and 1980s, especially the Mashantucket Pequot tribe which opened a casino in the same timeframe, and tribal chairman Richard A. Hayward encouraged them to return to their tribal homeland. He worked for Federal recognition and economic development.\nIn 1976, the Pequots filed suit with the assistance of the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) and the Indian Rights Association against landowners and residents of North Stonington to get their land, which the Pequots claimed had been illegally sold in 1856 by the State of Connecticut, and they settled after seven years. The Connecticut Legislature passed legislation to petition the federal government to grant tribal recognition to the Mashantucket Pequots, and the \"Mashantucket Pequot Indian Land Claims Settlement Act\" was enacted by Congress and signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 18, 1983. This settlement granted federal recognition to the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, enabling them to buy the land covered in the Settlement Act and place it in trust with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for reservation use. In 1986, they opened a bingo operation, followed by the first phase of Foxwoods Resort Casino in 1992. Revenue from the casino has enabled the development and construction of a cultural museum which opened on August 11, 1998, on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation where many members of the tribe continue to live.\nThe Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation was recognized in 2002. Since the 1930s, both Pequot tribes had serious tension over racial issues, with some people claiming that darker-skinned descendants should not be considered fully Pequot. Two groups of Eastern Pequots filed petitions for recognition with the BIA, and they agreed to unite to achieve recognition. The state immediately challenged the decision, and the Department of the Interior revoked their recognition in 2005. That same year, it revoked recognition for the Schaghticoke tribe who had gained recognition in 2004. The Connecticut state government and Congressional delegation opposed the BIA's recognition because residents were worried that the newly recognized tribes would establish gaming casinos.\nGeography.\nThe 1130-member Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation has a reservation called \"Lantern Hill.\" The Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation is recognized by the state of Connecticut.\nThe 800+ Mashantucket Pequot or Western Pequot gained federal recognition in 1983 and have a reservation in Ledyard.\nThe Poospatuck Reservation on Long Island is also home to a few hundred self-identified Pequot descendants.\nNearly all individuals who are identified as Pequot live in the two above-named communities.\nLanguage.\nHistorically, the Pequots spoke a dialect of the Mohegan-Pequot language, an Eastern Algonquian language. The Treaty of Hartford concluded the Pequot War in 1637, when the colonists made speaking the language a capital offense. Within a generation or so, it became largely extinct. Pequot from both the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mashantucket Pequot now speak English as their first language.\nIn the 21st century, the Mashantucket Pequot are undertaking aggressive efforts to revive the language. They are conducting careful analysis of historical documents containing Pequot words and comparing them to extant closely related languages. So far, they have reclaimed more than 1,000 words, though that is a small fraction of what would be necessary for a functional language. The Mashantucket Pequots have begun offering language classes with the help of the Mashpee Wampanoag. The Wampanoag recently initiated the W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak Language Reclamation Project. The southern New England Indian communities participating in the W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak Language Reclamation Project are Mashpee Wampanoag, Aquinnah Wampanoag, Herring Pond Wampanoag, and Mashantucket Pequot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are descended from the Pequot people, an Algonquian-language tribe that dominated the southern New England coastal areas, and they own and operate Foxwoods Resort Casino within their reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut. As of 2018,[ [update]] Foxwoods Resort Casino is one of the largest casinos in the world in terms of square footage, casino floor size, and number of slot machines, and it was one of the most economically successful in the United States until 2007, but it became deeply in debt by 2012 due to its expansion and changing conditions.\nThe tribe was federally recognized in 1983 through the Mashantucket Pequot Land Claims Settlement Act. The federal land claims suit was brought by the tribe against the State of Connecticut and the Federal government, charging that the tribe had been illegally deprived of its land through state actions that were not ratified by the Senate. As part of the settlement of this suit, Congress gave federal recognition to the tribe, in addition to approving financial compensation so that the tribe could repurchase lost land. Tribal membership is based on proven lineal descent of 11 Pequot families whose ancestors were listed in the 1900 US Census.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot tribe is one of two federally recognized tribes in Connecticut, the other being the Mohegan Indian Tribe.\nGeography.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation is located in Mashantucket, Connecticut, in southeastern Connecticut's New London County near the Thames River. It is held in trust for the tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The tribe also owns land in the adjacent towns of Ledyard, Preston and North Stonington, as well as in New London.\nDemographics and membership.\nToday, the Mashantucket Pequot population consists of more than 1100 enrolled members. As a federally recognized tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots have the authority to determine their membership criteria. The tribe requires its members to be of proven lineal descent from 11 Mashantucket Pequot ancestors listed in the U.S. censuses of 1900 and 1910. In 1996, the tribal membership voted to close enrollment, with the exception of children born to currently enrolled tribal members.\nThe 2000 census showed a resident population of 325 persons living on reservation land, 227 of whom identified themselves as American Indian, while others identify themselves as having more than one ethnicity, including non-Pequot spouses. Since that time, the tribe expanded reservation housing, and members continue to relocate to the reservation as housing becomes available.\nGovernment.\nAs of 2020, the Mashantucket Pequot Elders Council officers are:\nThe seven members of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council are:\nThe current administration's seven-member council has stated that the tribe's priorities are protecting tribal sovereignty, focusing on the educational, emotional, and physical well-being of members, and working to leverage the tribe's financial and economic strengths through partnership initiatives, both locally and abroad. Mashantucket Pequot's local investments include the Lake of Isles golf course and the Spa at Norwich Inn, both of which have proven to be positive additions to local municipal tax bases.\nCouncil members are elected by popular vote of the tribal membership to three-year, staggered terms. There are roughly 600 eligible voting members of the tribe, which numbered 1086 in 2018. Tribal Members must be at least 18 years old and in good standing with the tribe to be eligible to vote.\nEconomy.\nThe Mashantucket Pequots have owned and operated one of the largest resort casinos in the world since 1992. The University of Connecticut analyzed the Foxwoods casino's effects on the Connecticut economy, and their report stated that it had a positive economic impact on the neighboring towns of Ledyard, Preston, and North Stonington, as well as the state of Connecticut, which has received more than $4 billion in slot revenue.\nHistory.\nThe Mashantucket Pequots are descendants of the historic Pequot tribe, an Algonquian-speaking people who dominated the coastal area from the Niantic River of Connecticut east to the Pawcatuck River which forms a border with Rhode Island, and south to Long Island Sound. A second descendant group is the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is not recognized by the Federal government.\nDuring the colonial years, colonists recorded inter-tribal warfare, shifts in boundaries, and changes in power among the tribes. Scholars believe that the Pequots migrated from the upper Hudson River Valley into central and eastern Connecticut around 1500. William Hubbard wrote \"Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians in New-England\" in 1667 to explore the ferocity with which the Pequot tribe had attacked the colonists. He described them as invaders from \"the interior of the continent\" who \"by force seized upon one of the places near the sea, and became a Terror to all their Neighbors.\" Contemporary scholars suggest that archaeological, linguistic, and documentary evidence show that the Pequots were indigenous for centuries in the Connecticut Valley before the arrival of settlers.\nBy the time that Plymouth Colony and the Massachusetts Bay colony were being established, the Pequots had established military dominance among Indian tribes in central and eastern Connecticut. They numbered some 16,000 in the most densely inhabited portion of southern New England. The smallpox epidemic of 1616\u201319 killed roughly 90-percent of the Indians on the eastern coast of New England, but it failed to reach the Pequot, Niantic and Narragansett tribes, and this assisted the Pequots in their rise to dominance. But the Massachusetts smallpox epidemic in 1633 devastated the region's Indian population, and historians estimate that the Pequots suffered the loss of 80-percent of their entire population. By the outbreak of the Pequot War in 1637, their numbers may have been reduced to about 3,000 in total.\nPequot War.\nIn 1637, Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay colonies overwhelmed the Pequots during the Pequot War. This followed the Indians' attack on Wethersfield, Connecticut that left several settlers dead. The military force of the two colonies was led by John Mason and John Underhill, and they launched an assault on the Pequot stronghold at Mystic, Connecticut, killing a significant portion of the Pequot population.\nThe colonists enslaved some of the surviving Pequots, sending some to the West Indies as labor on sugar cane plantations, putting others to indentured servitude as household servants in New England. Most of the survivors, however, were transferred to the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes. A few Pequots returned to the reservation years later, and they intermarried with the colonists. Many of the Pequot descendants, while multi-racial, retained a sense of culture and continuity.\nPresent day.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot reservation was created by the Connecticut Colony in 1666, but only 13 people lived on the reservation by the time of the 1910 United States census. Elizabeth George (1894\u20131973) was one of the last Pequot living on the reservation and, when she died in 1973, the federal government started planning to reclaim the land which they presumed would be vacated upon the deaths of the last remaining Pequot residents.\nRichard \"Skip\" Hayward, a grandson of Elizabeth George, led the tribe's efforts in filing a federal land claims suit against the state of Connecticut which challenged the state's sale of of reservation lands\u2014an event which had occurred more than 100 years earlier in 1855. The state of Connecticut agreed with the tribe, and the US Department of Justice entered the suit, as it dealt with federal issues and the legality of the state action.\nOn October 18, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed the Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement Act which included federal recognition of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. They were the eighth American Indian tribe to gain federal recognition through an act of Congress rather than through the administrative process of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Department of Interior. The Mashantucket Pequots have since added to their land holdings by purchase and placed the additional lands into trust with the BIA on behalf of the tribe. As of the 2000 census, their total land area was .\nIn 1994 it purchased, and later developed further, what is now known as The Spa at Norwich Inn in Norwich, Connecticut.\nControversies.\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs had established criteria by which tribes seeking recognition had to document cultural and community continuity, a political organization, and related factors. Among the criteria are having to prove continuous existence as a recognized community since 1900, with internal government and tribal rules for membership.\nIn 1993, Donald Trump said that the owners of Foxwoods casino \"did not look like real Indians.\" He became a key investor with the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots who were seeking federal recognition.\nIn his book \"Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods the World's Largest Casino\" (2001), Jeff Benedict argues that the Mashantuckets are not descended from the historical Pequot tribe, but rather from the Narragansett people. Spokesmen for the Pequots denounced the book and asserted that Benedict's genealogical research was inherently flawed, as it failed to reflect the correct descendant lineages for the Mashantucket Pequot people identified on the 1900 and 1910 U.S. Censuses. Laurence Hauptman argued with Benedict's assertions on the genealogy of current members, and anthropologist Katherine A. Spilde also criticized it.\nTribal citizenship rules.\nThe Mashantucket Pequot tribe receives numerous requests from individuals applying for admission as members. They base tribal membership on an individual proving descent, by recognized genealogical documentation, from one or more members of eleven families included on the 1900 U.S. census of the tribe.\nEach federally recognized tribe has the authority to set its own membership/citizenship rules. Their descent rules are similar to the Cherokee Nation's reliance on proven direct descent from those Cherokee listed in the early 20th-century Dawes Rolls. CBS News reported in May 2000 that the tribal membership had voted to drop the requirement that tribal applicants have a minimum percentage of Mashantucket Pequot blood. However, the tribe has since begun to require genetic testing of newborn children whose parents are tribal members, to establish maternity and paternity.\nFoxwoods Resort Casino.\nIn 1986, Skip Hayward and financial backers built a high-stakes bingo hall on reservation land, and later they added other facilities. In 1992, the Mashantucket Pequots opened Foxwoods casino, which is now one of the largest casinos in the world. Adjacent to Foxwoods is the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center which interprets Pequot history and culture. The museum hosts local and international indigenous artists and musicians, as well as mounting changing exhibits of artifacts throughout the year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These lice are external parasites that feed mainly on birds, although some species also feed on mammals. They infest both domestic and wild mammals and birds, and cause considerable irritation to their hosts. They have paurometabolis or incomplete metamorphosis.\nCharacteristics.\nAbout 3000 species of Mallophaga are in the world. They are easily identifiable by their heads, which are wider than their prothoraces. Species that feed on birds usually have two claws at the tip of each tarsus, while those that feed on mammals usually have only one claw.\nMallophaga have mandibulate mouthparts which are located on the ventral side of their heads. They use these mouthparts to feed on feathers, hair, and epidermal skin scales. Some species also use these mouthparts to feed on blood, which they obtain by piercing the pulp of young feathers or by gnawing through the skin.\nLifecycle.\nMallophaga develop by gradual metamorphosis. Females typically lay 150\u2013300 eggs over an interval of 2\u20133\u00a0weeks. The eggs, commonly known as nits, are oblong and around 1\u00a0mm long. The eggs are glued to the hairs or feathers of the host with a secretion from the female accessory glands. The eggs typically hatch several days or up to three weeks from the time they are laid. The nymphs that hatch from the eggs resemble the adults except for their smaller size and lighter color. These nymphs go through three nymphal instars during a 2\u20133-week period. After these three instars, they are considered adults. Most adult species are light tan to brown in color and are usually 1\u20134\u00a0mm in length, although some livestock species can grow to be 5\u20137\u00a0mm, and some wild bird species can even get to 10\u00a0mm.\nMallophaga are often adapted to live on a specific part of their host and typically spend their entire lives on a single host. They can only survive for about three days after their host has died, and they typically use phoresis, which is hitching a ride from a fly, as an attempt to reach a new host. Mallophaga may also use the phoresis to spread to a new host even if the present one is still alive.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are three subordinate taxa:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58294", "revid": "50330604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58294", "title": "Hmong people", "text": "Ethnic group in southwest China and Southeast Asia\nThe Hmong people (RPA: , CHV: \"Hm\u00f4ngz\", Nyiakeng Puachue: , Pahawh Hmong: , , ) are an ethnic group from East and Southeast Asia. In China, the Hmong people are classified as a sub-group of the Miao people. The modern Hmong reside mainly in Southwestern China and Mainland Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. There are also diaspora communities in the United States, Australia, France, and South America.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Hmong\" is the English spelling of the Hmong's native name. It is a singular and plural noun (e.g., Japanese, French, etc.). Very little is known about the native Hmong name as it is not mentioned in Chinese historical records, since the Han identified the Hmong as Miao. The meaning of it is debatable and no one is sure of its origin, although it can be traced back to several provinces in China. However, Hmong Americans and Hmong Laotians often associate it with \"Free\" and/or \"Hmoov\" (Fate); it serves as a reminder to them of their history of fighting oppression.\nBefore the 1970s, the term \"Miao\" or \"Meo\" (i.e. barbarians, wild, seedlings, and even \"Sons of the Soil\") was used in reference to the Hmong. In the 1970s, Dr. Yang Dao, a Hmong American scholar, who at the time was the head of the Human Resource Department of the Ministry of Planning in the Royal Lao Government of Laos, advocated for the term \"Hmong\" with the support of clan leaders and General Vang Pao. Yang Dao insisted that the terms \"Meo\" and \"Miao\" were both unacceptable as his people had always called themselves by the name \"Hmong,\" which he defined as \"free men\". Surrounding countries began to use the term \"Hmong\" after the U.S. Department of State used it during Immigration screening in Thailand's Ban Vinai Refugee Camp. In 1994, Pobzeb Vang registered the term \"Hmong\" with the United Nations, making it the proper term to identify the Hmong people internationally. Soon after, there was a political push from Hmong American politicians and activists to replace the term Miao with the term Hmong in China with little to no success.\nRelationship to the Miao.\nHistorical Miao.\nHistorically, the term \"Hmong\" is not featured in any Chinese text, only the term \"Miao\". However it is uncertain if all mentions of Miao people referred to the Hmong people. According to Ruey (1962), the way in which Miao was used in Chinese can roughly be divided into three periods: a legendary period from 2300 BC to 200 BC, then a period when the term generally referred to southern barbarians until 1200 AD, and then a modern period during which the Hmong were probably included. Although the term appeared before the Qin dynasty (221\u00a0BCE), throughout history Miao was used as a loose and general term by the Han to refer to southern barbarians. Only since the Tang dynasty did more evidence of its association with the Hmong become more apparent. In the 20th century, Western missionaries called the Hmong and Hmao the \"Big Flowery Miao\" (\"Da Hua Miao\") and the \"Little Flowery Miao\" (\"Xiao Hua Miao\"). Another source states that the Green and White Miao were the Hmong, the Flowery Miao were the Hmao, the Black Miao were the Hmu, and the Red Miao were the Xong. According to She Miaojun, the Miao only existed as an exonym in the imagination of outsiders all the way up to the Qing dynasty. It did not refer to any self-defined ethnic group united by either territory or language. Others believe that Miao identity emerged during the rebellions of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nMiao nationality.\nToday, the Hmong in China are categorized under the umbrella term Mi\u00e1o () along with three other indigenous cultural groups, which include non-Hmong peoples such as the Hmu and the Xong of southeast Guizhou. The Chinese Miao minority was created in 1949 as part of the ethnic identification project in which members of the ethnic groups that now comprise the Miao umbrella group campaigned for identification under the name \"Miao\u2014\"taking advantage of its familiarity and associations of historical political oppression. The push to appropriate Miao as the official name of their \"minzu\" nationality received significant contributions from three Miao intellectuals, however none of them were Hmong. The various Miao sub-groups freely identify as Miao or Chinese while reserving their specific ethnonyms for intra-ethnic communication. According to Jacques Lemoine, \"Chinese Hmong have the Miao nationality but Hmong ethnicity\" because the People's Republic of China doesn't recognize ethnicity.\nThe Miao minority group has been described as extremely heterogeneous. The four main groups classified as Miao in China are the Hmong, Hmao, Hmu, and the Xong. Despite speaking related languages belonging to the Hmongic language group, these four ethnic groups have little in common and their languages are mutually unintelligible. Even the group closest to the Hmong, the Hmao, speak a language that is as different from Hmong as Italian is to French. They diverged significantly as early as a thousand years ago, after which they may have had no relation to each other at all. Without their official classification as the Miao minority after 1949, it is unlikely that they would be able to recognize any affinity with each other. However none of the four groups have obtained official status as distinct minorities in China. Their names are generally unrecognized by the Chinese and are only used as part of the local vernacular language. As a result, only a small portion of the modern Miao people initially identified as Hmong.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Louisa Schein\nThe non-equivalence between the Miao and the Hmong was acknowledged in interactions between Hmong refugees and the Miao. The Miao people that Hmong travelers from the West met were highly varied both in their language and cultural practices. When Hmong refugees from France and the US initially made contact with the Miao from China in officially sanctioned visits, they were introduced to the Xong Miao people who were neither Hmong nor spoke the Hmong language. An eyewitness recounts several occasions when a Hmong and a Hmao tried to understand each other's languages without success. They also met an assortment of Miao people who no longer spoke their native language and only knew Chinese. Many of the Miao they met did not share the same traditional clothing, myths, and folktales. Some did not even play the lusheng, a traditional Hmong musical instrument. The visiting Hmong were themselves not from China but Southeast Asia, where their ancestors had migrated over a century ago due to conflicts in the Qing dynasty. Not understanding the differences between the Miao and Hmong, initially some Hmong-Americans did not believe that these were real Miao people, but other ethnic groups. Some thought that the different costumes were the result of lost traditions among the Southeast Asian Hmong.\nSome Hmong went further to seek out \"really Hmong\" people through unofficial channels with whom they could speak Hmong to. However even after successfully finding them, they found that there were dialect variations that differed from the Hmong that they grew up speaking. As Hmong refugees discovered the differences between themselves and the Chinese Miao, some non-Hmong Miao people such as the Hmu started referring to themselves as Hmong to express nationalistic sentiments. Contributing to this trend is the tendency of professional linguists to use the names of smaller ethnic groups to refer to the broader categories such as Hmong\u2013Mien languages rather than Miao-Yao languages. This is due to the outsized influence of groups outside of Asia such as the Hmong and Mien who are able to articulate their cause, thereby affecting some proto-nationalistic movements within the Miao to identify as Hmong despite not actually being Hmong.\nHmong/Miao identity.\nMiao or Meo carried strong pejorative connotations in both China and Southeast Asia. It was more so a stereotype such as uncivilized, uncooperative, uncultivated, harmful, and inhumane than a name of an ethnic group and was used in daily conversations as an expression for ugliness and primitiveness. Due to these negative connotations, the Hmong promote the use of Hmong as a replacement for Miao. In modern times, however, Miao has lost such negative connotations in China and has since been officially recognized as an ethnicity, which includes the Hmong. The Hmong in China are often happy or proud to be known as Miao while most Hmong outside China find it offensive. According to Louisa Schein, Miao is a neutral ethnonym within China and the only term that encompasses all its subgroups.\nAccording to Gary Yia Lee writing in the \"Hmong Studies Journal\", the choice to identify as Miao was a deliberate and strategic decision its members advocated for in recognition of its potential benefits. Rather than being split into multiple smaller groups with short and murky histories, the Miao chose to adopt one ethno-name representing 9.2 million people claiming a long history dating back to ancient China. Their larger population granted them the strength and support befitting of the fifth largest nationality in China. In addition, by claiming kinship to the San Miao referred to in ancient Chinese history, they positioned themselves as pre-existing inhabitants of China prior to the arrival of the Han, imparting a \"legendary stature to the present-day Miao\" that \"bestows the dignity of great antiquity, authoritativeness and a firm standing in the documentary record\".\nContemporary transnational interactions between Hmong in the West and Miao groups in China, following the 1975 Hmong emigration, led to the development of a global Hmong identity that includes linguistically and culturally related minorities in China with no previous ethnic affiliation. In 1994, a Miao woman from China was chosen as the winner of the Miss Hmong Beauty Pageant in Fresno, California. Costume styles were imported from China and used in festivals. Scholarly and commercial exchanges, increasingly made over the internet, have also resulted in an exchange of terminology, including some Hmong people accepting the designation \"Miao\" after visiting China and some nationalist non-Hmong Miao peoples identifying as Hmong.\nIn Southeast Asia, Hmong people are referred to by other names, including: Vietnamese , or ; Lao () or (); Thai () or (); and Burmese (). With a slight change in accent, the word \"Meo\" in Lao and Thai can be pronounced to mean\n\"cat\". The term Maew and Meo derived from the term Miao.\nOrigins.\nGenetic origins.\nA DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes. The Hmong\u2013Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand; they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs. matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs. the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation.\nAccording to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that they have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000\u00a0years. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong\u2013Mien\u2013speaking populations supports the existence of southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time, although it has been shown that Hmong-speaking populations had comparatively more contact with northern East Asians than had the Mien. A 2020 study, however, states that Hmong in Thailand cluster with other Hmong groups only due to their practice of endogamy.\nIn 2011, Hmong DNA was sampled and found to contain 7.84% D-M15 and 6%N(Tat) DNA. The research found a common ancestry between Hmong\u2013Mien peoples and Mon-Khmer groups dating to the Last Glacial Maximum, approximately 15,000 to 18,000\u00a0years ago.\nA rare haplogroup, O3d, was found at the Daxi culture in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, indicating that the Daxi people might be the ancestors of modern Hmong\u2013Mien populations, which show only small traces of O3d today. The most representative ancestral lineages of Hmong-Mien speakers come from ancient individuals from Guangxi (GaoHuaHua) and Guizhou (Songshan_o2), dating back to the Ming Dynasty. Other studies also confirm the significant role of Ancient Northern East Asians in shaping the Hmong genome. Overall, Hmong\u2013Mien cluster with Tai-Kadai and Sino-Tibetan speakers compared to other Chinese populations. A 2020 study shows that the core Hmong-Mien population derives more ancestry from Neolithic Mekong (32.3%\u201335.3%) than Late Neolithic Fujian (23.7%\u201326.4%), suggesting stronger Austroasiatic affinities although Tai-Kadai ancestry peaks in groups that live in southeastern China.\nGenetic stratification exists within the Hmong-Mien population, with northern Hmong-Mien populations exhibiting more genetic similarities with Tibeto-Burman/Sinitic populations and southern Hmong-Mien populations sharing more alleles with Austronesian/Tai-Kadai populations. Hmong-Mien populations within the Miao cluster exhibit stronger genetic influence from neighboring populations like Han Chinese. Other Miao populations are more related to Hmong populations from Vietnam. Yao populations in Guangxi, in contrast, share more genetic drift with Tai-Kadai populations. Bunu-speaking Yao populations exhibit strong genetic affinities with the GaoHuaHua population due to their geographic isolation. She populations from Guizhou cluster with their Hmong-Mien neighbors and received significant input from Tai-Kadai populations whilst She populations from Fujian received more input from Han Chinese populations. In 2021, researchers found that the 'GaoHuaHua' population in Guangxi contributed to the ancestries of modern Hmong-Mien groups in Guangxi. The 'GaoHuaHua' population was modeled as having 66% Dushan-related ancestry and 34% Boshan-related ancestry. They also received Northeast Asian-related Shandong ancestry, which emerged 9,500\u20137,700 years ago.\nHomeland.\nThe most likely homeland of the Hmong\u2013Mien languages is in southern China between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers. In particular, southwestern China was suggested to the original homeland of Hmong-Mien peoples.\nMigration of people speaking these languages from southern China to Southeast Asia took place ca. 1600\u20131700\u00a0CE. Ancient DNA evidence suggests that the ancestors of the speakers of the Hmong\u2013Mien languages were a population genetically distinct from that of the Tai\u2013Kadai and Austronesian language populations at a location on the Yangtze River. Recent Y-DNA phylogeny evidence supports the theory that people who speak the Hmong\u2013Mien languages are descended from a population that is distantly related to those who now speak the Mon-Khmer languages. Another study shows that the core Hmong-Mien population in southern China derived most of their ancestry from Neolithic Mekong (32.3%\u201335.3%) than Late Neolithic Fujian (23.7%\u201326.4%).\nThe time of Proto-Hmong\u2013Mien was estimated to be about 2500\u00a0BP (500\u00a0BCE) by Sagart, Blench, and Sanchez-Mazas using traditional methods employing many lines of evidence, and about 4243\u00a0BP by the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP), an experimental algorithm for automatic generation of phonologically based phylogenies.\nHistory.\nChina.\nHmong traditions and legends indicate that they originated near the Yellow River region of northern China, but this is not substantiated by any scientific evidence. According to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that they have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000\u00a0years.\nThe author of \"Guoyu\", written in the 4th to 5th century, considered Chi You's Jiu Li tribe to be related to the ancient ancestors of the Hmong, the San-Miao people. Chi You is the Hmong ancestral God of War. Today, a statue of Chi You has been erected in the town named Zhuolu.\nConflict between the Hmong of southern China and newly arrived Han settlers increased during the 18th century under repressive economic and cultural reforms imposed by the Qing dynasty. This led to armed conflict and large-scale migrations well into the late 19th century, the period during which many Hmong people emigrated to Southeast Asia. However, the migration process had begun as early as the late 17th century, before the time of major social unrest, when small groups went in search of better agricultural opportunities.\nThe Hmong people were subjected to persecution and genocide by the Qing dynasty government. Arthur A. Hansen wrote: \"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, while the Hmong lived in south-western China, their Manchu overlords had labeled them 'Miao' and targeted them for genocide.\"\nSince 1949, the Miao people () has been an official term for one of the 56 official minority groups recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China. The Miao live mainly in southern China, in the provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hainan, Guangdong, and Hubei. According to the 2000 census, the number of 'Miao' in China was estimated to be about 9.6\u00a0million. The Miao nationality includes Hmong people as well as other culturally and linguistically related ethnic groups who do not call themselves Hmong. These include the Hmu, Kho (Qho) Xiong, and A-Hmao. The settling region of the Hmong in China is further western than that of the other groups, mainly in Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guangxi.\nVietnam.\nThe Hmong or Miao began to migrate to Tonkin (Northern Vietnam) in the 19th century, where they struggled to establish their community on the high mountains. They recognized the Tai-speaking overlords of valleys, who were vassals of the Vietnamese court in Hue. The Hue court of Tu Duc at the time was facing crisis after crisis, unable to retake control of Tonkin and the border regions. The Taiping Rebellion and other Chinese rebels spilled over into Vietnam and had caused anarchy; the Hmong communities thrived on either sides of the Red River, harmonizing with other ethnic groups, and were largely ignored by all factions.\nDuring the colonization of 'Tonkin' (North Vietnam) between 1883 and 1954, a number of Hmong decided to join the Vietnamese Nationalists and Communists, while many Christianized Hmong sided with the French. After the Viet Minh victory, numerous pro-French Hmong had to fall back to Laos and South Vietnam.\nLaos.\nAfter decades of distant relations with the Lao kingdoms, closer relations between the French military and some Hmong on the Xieng Khouang plateau arose after World War II. There, a rivalry between members of the Lo and Ly clans developed into open enmity, also affecting those connected with them by kinship. Clan leaders took opposite sides; as a consequence, several thousand Hmong participated in the fighting against the Pathet Lao Communists, while almost as many were enrolled in the communist Lao People's Revolutionary Army. In Laos, numerous Hmong genuinely tried to avoid getting involved in the conflict in spite of the extremely difficult material conditions under which they lived during wartime.\nThe U.S. and the Laotian Civil War.\nIn the early 1960s, partially as a result of the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division began to recruit, train and lead the indigenous Hmong people in Laos to fight against North Vietnamese Army divisions that were invading Laos during the Vietnam War. This \"Secret Army\" was organized into various mobile regiments and divisions, including Special Guerrilla Units, all of whom were led by General Vang Pao. An estimated sixty-percent (60%) of Hmong men in Laos joined up.\nWhile there were Hmong soldiers who fought with the communist Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese, others were recognized for serving in combat against the NVA and the Pathet Lao, helping block Hanoi's Ho Chi Minh trail inside Laos and rescuing downed American pilots. Though their role was generally kept secret in the early stages of the conflict, they made great sacrifices to help the U.S.\nThousands of economic and political refugees have resettled in Western countries in two separate waves. The first wave resettled in the late 1970s, mostly in the United States after the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao takeovers of the pro-U.S. governments in South Vietnam and Laos respectively. The Lao Veterans of America, and Lao Veterans of America Institute, helped to assist in the resettlement of many Laotian and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in the United States, especially former Hmong veterans and their family members who served in the \"U.S. Secret Army\" in Laos during the Vietnam War.\nHmong Lao resistance.\nFor many years, the Neo Hom political movement played a key role in resistance to the Vietnam People's Army in Laos following the U.S. withdrawal in 1975; Vang Pao played a significant role in this movement. Additionally, a spiritual leader, Zong Zoua Her, as well as other Hmong leaders, including Pa Kao Her or Pa Khao Her, rallied some of their followers in a factionalized guerrilla resistance movement called ChaoFa (RPA: Cob Fab, Pahawh Hmong: \ud81a\udf12\ud81a\udf2f \ud81a\udf16\ud81a\udf1c\ud81a\udf35 ). These events led to the yellow rain controversy when the United States accused the Soviet Union of supplying and using chemical weapons in this conflict.\nSmall groups of Hmong people, many second or third generation descendants of former CIA soldiers, remain internally displaced in remote parts of Laos, in fear of government reprisals. Faced with continuing military operations against them by the government and a scarcity of food, some groups have begun coming out of hiding, while others have sought asylum in Thailand and other countries. Hmong in Laos, in particular, developed a stronger and deeper anti-Vietnamese sentiment than their Vietnamese Hmong cousins, due to historic persecution perpetrated by the Vietnamese against them.\nControversy over repatriation.\nIn June 1991, after talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to the repatriation of over 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including tens of thousands of Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily. Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, coercive measures and forced repatriation was used to send thousands of Hmong back to the places they had fled. Of the Hmong who did return to Laos, some quickly escaped back to Thailand, describing discrimination and brutal treatment at the hands of Lao authorities.\nIn the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, The Center for Public Policy Analysis, a non-governmental public policy research organization, and its executive director, Philip Smith, played a key role in raising awareness in the U.S. Congress and policy-making circles in Washington, D.C. about the plight of the Hmong and Laotian refugees in Thailand and Laos. The CPPA, backed by a bipartisan coalition of members of the U.S. Congress and human rights organizations, conducted numerous research missions to the Hmong and Laotian refugee camps along the Mekong River in Thailand, as well as the Buddhist temple of Wat Tham Krabok.\nAmnesty International, the Lao Veterans of America, Inc., the United League for Democracy in Laos, Inc., Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. (led by Dr. Pobzeb Vang Vang Pobzeb, and later Vaughn Vang) and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights organizations joined the opposition to forced repatriation.\nAlthough some accusations of forced repatriation were denied, thousands of Hmong people refused to return to Laos. In 1996, as the deadline for the closure of Thai refugee camps approached, under mounting political pressure, the U.S. agreed to resettle Hmong refugees who passed a new screening process. Around 5,000 Hmong people who were not resettled at the time of the camp closures sought asylum at Wat Tham Krabok, a Buddhist monastery in central Thailand where more than 10,000 Hmong refugees were already living. The Thai government attempted to repatriate these refugees, but the Wat Tham Krabok Hmong refused to leave and the Lao government refused to accept them, claiming they were involved in the illegal drug trade and were of non-Lao origin.\nIn 2003, following threats of forcible removal by the Thai government, the U.S., in a significant victory for the Hmong, agreed to accept 15,000 of the refugees. Several thousand Hmong people, fearing forced repatriation to Laos if they were not accepted for resettlement in the U.S., fled the camp to live elsewhere within Thailand where a sizable Hmong population has been present since the 19th century. In 2004 and 2005, thousands of Hmong fled from the jungles of Laos to a temporary refugee camp in the Thai province of Phetchabun.\nThe European Union, UNHCHR, and international groups have since spoken out about the forced repatriation.\nAlleged plot to overthrow the government of Laos.\nOn 4 June 2007, as part of an investigation labeled Operation Tarnished Eagle, U.S. federal courts ordered warrants issued for the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of federal Neutrality Acts and for multiple weapons charges. The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, in order to buy and smuggle into Thailand in June 2007, where they were intended to be used by Hmong resistance forces in Laos. Out of the 9 arrested, one was an American, Harrison Jack, a 1968 West Point graduate and retired Army infantry officer who allegedly attempted to recruit Special Operations veterans to act as mercenaries.\nTo obtain the weapons, Jack allegedly met unknowingly with undercover U.S. federal agents posing as weapons dealers, prompting the warrants, part of a long-running investigation into the activities of the U.S.-based Hmong leadership and its supporters.\nOn 15 June, the defendants were indicted by a grand jury; a warrant was also issued for the arrest of an 11th man allegedly involved in the plot. Simultaneous raids of the defendants' homes and work locations, involving over 200 federal, state and local law enforcement officials, were conducted in approximately 15 U.S. cities in Central and Southern California.\nMultiple protest rallies in support of the suspects, designed to raise awareness of the treatment of Hmong peoples in the jungles of Laos, took place in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Alaska. Several of Vang Pao's high-level supporters in the U.S. criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants, arguing that Vang was a historically important American ally and a valued leader of U.S. and foreign-based Hmong. Calls to Californian Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and President George W. Bush to pardon the defendants went unanswered pending a conclusion to the large, ongoing federal investigation.\nOn 18 September 2009, the U.S. federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing that the federal government was permitted to consider \"the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted\". On 10 January 2011, after Vang Pao's death, the federal government dropped all charges against the remaining defendants saying, \"Based on the totality of the circumstances in the case, the government believes, as a discretionary matter, that continued prosecution of defendants is no longer warranted.\"\nThailand.\nThe presence of Hmong settlements in Thailand is documented from the end of the 19th century on. Initially, the Siamese paid little attention to them. But in the early 1950s, the state suddenly took a number of initiatives aimed at establishing links. Decolonization and nationalism were gaining momentum in the peninsula and wars of independence were raging. Armed opposition to the state in northern Thailand, triggered by outside influence, started in 1967 while again many Hmong refused to take sides in the conflict. Communist guerrilla warfare stopped by 1982 as a result of an international concurrence of events that rendered it pointless. Priority has since been given by the Thai state to sedentarizing the mountain population, introducing commercially viable agricultural techniques and national education, with the aim of integrating these non-Tai animists within the national identity.\nIn the United States.\nMany Hmong refugees resettled in the United States after the Vietnam War. Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum at that time under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had emigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's secret army. It was not until the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families were scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington State and Oregon. Smaller, but still sizeable communities also formed in Massachusetts (Lowell), Michigan (Detroit), Montana (Missoula) and Alaska (Anchorage).\nCulture.\nHmong people have their own terms for their cultural divisions. \"Hmong Der\" (), and () are the terms for two of the largest groups in the United States and Southeast Asia. These subgroups are also known as the White Hmong, and Blue or Green Hmong, respectively. These names originate from the color and designs of women's dresses in each respective group, with the White Hmong distinguished by the white dresses women wear on special occasions, and the Blue/Green Hmong by the blue batiked dresses. The name and pronunciation \"Hmong\" is exclusively used by the White Hmong to refer to themselves, and many dictionaries use only the White Hmong dialect.\nIn the Romanized Popular Alphabet, developed in the 1950s in Laos, these terms are written ' (White Hmong) and ' (Green Hmong). The final consonants indicate with which of the eight lexical tones the word is pronounced.\nWhite Hmong and Green Hmong speak mutually intelligible dialects of the Hmong language, with some differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. One of the most characteristic differences is the use of the voiceless /m\u0325/ in White Hmong, indicated by a preceding \"H\" in the Romanized Popular Alphabet. Voiceless nasals are not found in the Green Hmong dialect. Hmong groups are often named after the dominant colors or patterns of their traditional clothing, style of head-dress, or the provinces from which they come.\nVietnam and Laos.\nThe Hmong groups in Vietnam and Laos, from the 18th century to the present day, are known as Black Hmong (), Striped Hmong (), White Hmong (), Hmong Leng () and Green Hmong (). In other places in Asia, groups are also known as Black Hmong ( or ), Striped Hmong ( or ), Hmong Shi, Hmong Pe, Hmong Pua, and Hmong Xau, Hmong Xanh (Green Hmong), Hmong Do (Red Hmong), Na Mieo and various other subgroups. These include the Flower Hmong or the Variegated Hmong ( or ), so named because of their bright, colorful embroidery work (called or , literally 'flower cloth').\nHmong/Mong controversy.\nWhen Western authors first came in contact with Hmong people in the 18th century, they referred to them by writing ethnonyms which were previously assigned to them by the Chinese (i.e., \"Miao\", or variants). This practice continued into the 20th century. Even ethnographers studying the Hmong people in Southeast Asia often referred to them as \"Meo\", an alteration of \"Miao\" applied by Thai and Lao people to the Hmong. Although \"Meo\" was an official term, it was often used as an insult against the Hmong people, and it is considered to be derogatory.\nThe issue came to a head during the passage of California State Assembly Bill (AB) 78, in the 2003\u20132004 season. Introduced by Doua Vu and Assembly Member Sarah Reyes, District 31 (Fresno), the bill encouraged changes in secondary education curriculum to include information about the Secret War and the role of Hmong people in the war. Furthermore, the bill called for the use of oral histories and first-hand accounts by Hmong people who had participated in the war and were caught up in its aftermath. Originally, the language of the bill mentioned only \"Hmong\" people, intending to include the entire community. Several Mong Leng activists, led by Dr. Paoze Thao (Professor of Linguistics and Education at California State University, Monterey Bay), drew attention to the problems associated with omitting \"Mong\" from the language of the bill. They noted that despite nearly equal numbers of Hmong Der and Mong Leng in the United States, resources are disproportionately allocated to the Hmong Der community. This not only includes scholarly research, but also the translation of materials, including the curriculum proposed by the bill. Despite these arguments, \"Mong\" was not added to the bill. In the version of the bill that was passed by the assembly, \"Hmong\" was replaced by \"Southeast Asians\", a broader and more inclusive term.\nDr. Paoze Thao and some others strongly feel that \"Hmong\" can only be used in reference to Hmong Der people because it does not include \"Mong\" Leng people. He feels that the use of \"Hmong\" in reference to both groups perpetuates the marginalization of the Mong Leng language and culture. Thus, he advocates the use of \"Hmong\" and \"Mong\" in reference to the entire ethnic group. Other scholars, including anthropologist Dr. Gary Yia Lee (a Hmong Der person), suggests that for the past 30\u00a0years, \"Hmong\" has been used in reference to the entire community and as a result, the inclusion of Mong Leng people is understandable. Some argue that such distinctions create unnecessary divisions within the global community, arguing that the use of these distinctions will only confuse non-Hmong and Mong people who are both trying to learn more about Hmong and Mong history and culture.\nAs a compromise alternative, multiple iterations of \"Hmong\" have been proposed. A Hmong theologian, Rev. Dr. Paul Joseph T. Khamdy Yang has proposed the use of the term HMong in reference to the \"Hmong\" and the \"Mong\" communities by capitalizing the H and the M. The ethnologist Jacques Lemoine has also begun to use the term (H)mong in reference to the entirety of the Hmong and Mong communities.\nDiaspora.\nLinguistic data shows that the Hmong of the peninsula stem from the Miao of southern China as one among a set of ethnic groups belonging to the Hmong\u2013Mien language family. Linguistically and culturally speaking, the Hmong and the other sub-groups of the Miao have little in common.\nVietnam, where their presence is attested from the late 18th century onwards and characterized with both assimilation, cooperation and hostility, is likely to be the first Southeastern Eurasian country into which the Hmong migrated. At the 2019 national census, there were 1,393,547 Hmong living in Vietnam, the vast majority of them in the north of the country. The traditional trade in coffin wood with China and cultivation of the opium poppy\"\u2014\"not prohibited in Vietnam until 1993\"\u2014\"long guaranteed a regular cash income. Today, cash cropping is the main economic activity. As in China and Laos, Hmong participate to a certain degree in local and regional administration. In the late 1990s, several thousands of Hmong started moving to the Central Highlands and some crossed the border into Cambodia, constituting the first attested presence of Hmong settlers in that country.\nIn 2015, the Hmong in Laos numbered 595,028. Hmong settlement there is nearly as ancient as in Vietnam.\nAfter the 1975 Communist victory, thousands of Hmong from Laos had to seek refuge abroad (see Laos below). Approximately 30 percent of the Hmong have left, although the only concrete figure we have is that of 116,000 Hmong from Laos and Vietnam together seeking refuge in Thailand up to 1990.\nIn 2002 the Hmong in Thailand numbered 151,080.\nMyanmar most likely includes a modest number of Hmong (perhaps around 2,500) but no reliable census has been conducted there recently.\nAs result of refugee movements in the wake of the Indochina Wars (1946\u20131975), in particular, in Laos, the largest Hmong community to settle outside Asia went to the United States where approximately 100,000 individuals had already arrived by 1990. By the same date, 10,000 Hmong had migrated to France, including 1,400 in French Guiana; Canada admitted 900 individuals, while another 360 went to Australia, 260 to China, and 250 to Argentina. Over the following years and until the definitive closure of the last refugee camps in Thailand in 1998, additional numbers of Hmong have left Asia, but the definitive figures are still to be produced.\nApproximately 5% of the Hmong population currently lives outside of Asia, with the United States home to the largest Hmong diaspora community. The 2008 census counted 171,316 people solely of Hmong ancestry, and 221,948 persons of at least partial Hmong ancestry. Other countries with significant populations include:\nThe Hmong population within the United States is centered in the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin, Minnesota) and California.\nVietnam.\nHmong people in Vietnam have been perceived differently by various modern political organizations and in different historical periods. Since the Hmong are an ethnic minority in Vietnam, their loyalty toward the Vietnamese state has been frequently questioned by the state. However, many Hmong in Vietnam are fiercely loyal, regardless of the current ideologies of the government; the Hmong in Laos and Cambodia are the most supportive of active resistance. These tend to be Hmong Christians that have been targeted by all three Vietnamese governments. The Hmong in Vietnam also receive cultural and political incentives from the government. which led to the Vietnamese Hmong further diverging from the Laotian Hmong, since the latter are strongly anti-Vietnamese due to the Secret War and Communism.\nLaos.\nThere are 595,028 Hmong people in Laos. They mainly live in northern regions.\nMyanmar.\nIn Myanmar, Hmong are known as Myaung Zee or Hmont people. They are living mainly in northern, southern and eastern Shan State, as well as in Wa State.\nThailand.\nThe Hmong presence in Thailand dates back to the turn of the 20th century when families migrated from China through Laos and Burma, according to most authors. A relatively small population, they still formed dozens of villages and hamlets throughout the northern provinces. The Hmong were registered by the state as the Meo hill tribe. Then, more Hmong migrated from Laos to Thailand following the victory of the Pathet Lao in 1975. While some ended up in refugee camps, others settled in mountainous areas among more ancient Hill Tribes.\nAmericas.\nMany Hmong refugees resettled in the United States after the Vietnam War. Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had emigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's secret army. It was not until the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, 260,073 Hmong people reside in the United States, the plurality of whom live in California (91,224), then Minnesota (66,181), and Wisconsin (49,240), an increase from 186,310 in 2000. 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity. The vast majority of part-Hmong are under 10\u00a0years old.\nIn terms of cities and towns, the largest Hmong-American community is in St. Paul (29,662), followed by Fresno (24,328), Sacramento (16,676), Milwaukee (10,245), and Minneapolis (7,512).\nThere are smaller Hmong communities scattered across the United States, including those in Minnesota (Rochester, Mankato, Duluth); Michigan (Detroit and Warren); Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Washington; North Carolina (Charlotte, Morganton); South Carolina (Spartanburg); Georgia (Auburn, Duluth, Monroe, Atlanta, and Winder); Florida (Tampa Bay); California (Merced); Wisconsin (Madison, Eau Claire, Appleton, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, La Crosse, Sheboygan, Manitowoc, and Wausau); Aurora, Illinois; Kansas City, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Missoula, Montana; Des Moines, Iowa; Springfield, Missouri; Arkansas, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island.\nSunisa \"Suni\" Lee of Saint Paul, Minnesota is a notable Hmong-American; she is a three time Olympic medalist in artistic gymnastics. In the 2020 Summer Olympics, Lee won silver in the women's artistic team all-around, followed by gold in the women's artistic individual all-around and bronze in the women's uneven bars. With these results, Sunisa made history as both the first Hmong-American to compete in the Olympics in any sport and the first Hmong-American to win an Olympic medal.\nCanada's small Hmong population is mostly concentrated within the province of Ontario. Kitchener, Ontario has 515 residents of Hmong descent, and has a Hmong church.\nThere is also a small community of several thousand Hmong who migrated to French Guiana in the late 1970s and early 1980s, that can be mainly found in the Hmong villages of Javouhey (1200 individuals) and Cacao (950 individuals).\nThe Hmong immigrant population of Detroit is a central focus of the 2008 film Gran Torino, though that city does not have a significant Hmong population.\nReligious persecution.\nHmong Catholics, Protestants, and animists have been subjected to military attacks, police arrest, imprisonment, forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and torture in Laos and Vietnam on anti-religious grounds.\nA significant example was the deportation of Zoua Yang and her 27 children from Thailand on 19 December 2005, after the group was arrested attending a church in Ban Kho Noi, Phetchabun Province, Thailand. Ms. Yang and her children were detained upon their return to Laos, after which the whereabouts of much of the family is unknown.\nIn 2011, Vietnam People's Army troops were used to crush a peaceful demonstration by Hmong Catholic, Protestant and Evangelical Christians who gathered in Dien Bien Province and the Dien Bien Phu area of northwestern Vietnam, according to Philip Smith of the Center for Public Policy Analysis, independent journalists and others. In 2013, Vam Ngaij Vaj, a Christian pastor of Hmong ancestry, was beaten to death by Vietnamese police and security forces. In Hanoi, Vietnamese government officials refused to allow medical treatment for a Hmong Christian leader, Duong Van Minh, who was suffering from a serious kidney illness, in February 2014.\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has documented official and ongoing religious persecution, religious-freedom violations against the Laotian and Hmong people in both Laos and Vietnam by the governments. In April 2011, the Center for Public Policy Analysis also researched and documented cases of Hmong Christians being attacked and summarily executed, including four Lao Hmong Christians.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58296", "revid": "30699314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58296", "title": "California gold rush", "text": "Gold rush from 1848 to 1855\nThe California gold rush (1848\u20131855) was a gold rush in California, which began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people from the rest of the United States and abroad to California, which had recently been conquered from Mexico. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy; the sudden population increase allowed California to grow rapidly into statehood in the Compromise of 1850. The gold rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide.\nThe effects of the gold rush were substantial. Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, nicknamed \"forty-niners\" (referring to 1849, the peak year for gold rush immigration). Outside of California, the first to arrive were from Oregon, Hawaii, and Latin America in late 1848. Of the approximately 300,000 people who came to California during the gold rush, about half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the California Road; forty-niners often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the gold rush attracted thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and China. Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers. San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852. Roads, churches, schools and other towns were built throughout California. In 1849, a state constitution was written. The new constitution was adopted by referendum vote; the future state's interim first governor and legislature were chosen. In September 1850, California achieved statehood.\nAt the beginning of the gold rush, there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of \"staking claims\" was developed. Prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. Although mining caused environmental harm, more sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service. By 1869, railroads were built from California to the eastern United States. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today's US dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few, though many who participated in the California gold rush earned little more than they had started with.\nHistory.\nEarlier discoveries.\nGold was discovered in California as early as March 9, 1842, at Rancho San Francisco, in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles. Californian native Francisco Lopez was searching for stray horses and stopped on the bank of a small creek (in today's Placerita Canyon), about east of present-day Newhall, and about northwest of Los Angeles. While the horses grazed, Lopez dug up some wild onions and found a small gold nugget in the roots among the bulbs. He looked further and found more gold. Lopez took the gold to authorities who confirmed its worth. Lopez and others began to search for other streambeds with gold deposits in the area. They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In November, some of the gold was sent to the U.S. Mint, although otherwise attracted little notice. In 1843, Lopez found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846. Minor finds of gold in California were also made by Mission Indians prior to 1848. The friars instructed them to keep its location secret to avoid a gold rush.\nMarshall's discovery.\nIn January 1847, nine months into the Mexican\u2013American War, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed, leading to the resolution of the military conflict in Alta California (Upper California). On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill he was building for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter\u2014known as Sutter's Mill, near Coloma on the American River. Marshall brought what he found to Sutter, and the two privately tested the metal. After the tests showed that it was gold, Sutter expressed dismay, wanting to keep the news quiet because he feared what would happen to his plans for an agricultural empire if there were a gold rush in the region. The Mexican\u2013American War ended on May 30 with the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which formally transferred California to the United States.\nHaving sworn all concerned at the mill to secrecy, in February 1848, Sutter sent Charles Bennett to Monterey to meet with Colonel Mason, the chief U.S. official in California, to secure the mineral rights of the land where the mill stood. Bennett was not to tell anyone of the discovery of gold, but when he stopped at Benicia, he heard talk about the discovery of coal near Mount Diablo, and he blurted out the discovery of gold. He continued to San Francisco, where again, he could not keep the secret. At Monterey, Mason declined to make any judgement of title to lands and mineral rights, and Bennett for the third time revealed the gold discovery.\nBy March 1848, rumors of the discovery were confirmed by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. Brannan hurriedly set up a store to sell gold prospecting supplies, and he walked through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting \"Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!\"\nOn August 19, 1848, the \"New York Herald\" was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, US President James K. Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress. As a result, individuals seeking to benefit from the gold rush\u2014later called the \"forty-niners\"\u2014began moving to the Gold Country of California or \"Mother Lode\" from other countries and from other parts of the United States. As Sutter had feared, his business plans were ruined after his workers left in search of gold, and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle.\nSan Francisco had been a tiny settlement before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco increased quickly from about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships. There were no churches or religious services in the rapidly growing city, which prompted missionaries like William Taylor to meet the need, where he held services in the street, using a barrel head as his pulpit. Crowds would gather to listen to his sermons, and before long he received enough generous donations from successful gold miners and built San Francisco's first church.\nTransportation and supplies.\nIn what has been referred to as the \"first world-class gold rush,\" there was no easy way to travel to California; forty-niners faced hardship and often death on the way. At first, most Argonauts, as they were also known, traveled by sea. From the East Coast, a sailing voyage around the tip of South America would take four to five months, and cover approximately . An alternative was to sail to the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama, take canoes and mules for a week through the jungle, and then on the Pacific side, wait for a ship sailing for San Francisco. There was also a route across Mexico starting at Veracruz. The companies providing such transportation generated vast amounts of wealth among their owners, including the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, the federally subsidized Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Accessory Transit Company. Many gold-seekers took the overland route across the continental United States, particularly along the California Trail. Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards, from shipwreck to typhoid fever and cholera. In the early years of the rush, much of the population growth in the San Francisco area was due to steamship travel from New York City through overland portages in Nicaragua and Panama and then back up by steamship to San Francisco.\nWhile traveling, many steamships from the eastern seaboard required the passengers to bring kits, which were typically full of personal belongings such as clothes, guidebooks, tools, etc. In addition to personal belongings, Argonauts were required to bring barrels full of beef, biscuits, butter, pork, rice, and salt. While on the steamships, travelers could talk to each other, smoke, fish, and engage in other activities depending on the ship they traveled. Still, the dominant activity held throughout the steamships was gambling, which was ironic, since segregation between wealth gaps was prominent throughout the ships. Everything was segregated between the rich and the poor. There were different levels of travel one could pay for to get to California. The cheaper steamships tended to have longer routes. In contrast, the more expensive ones would get passengers to California quicker. There were clear social and economic distinctions between those who traveled together, being that those who spent more money would receive accommodations that others were not allowed. They would do this with the clear intent to distinguish their higher class power over those that could not afford those accommodations.\nSupply ships arrived in San Francisco with goods to supply the needs of the growing population. When hundreds of ships were abandoned after their crews deserted to go into the goldfields, many ships were converted to warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. As the city expanded and new places were needed on which to build, many ships were destroyed and used as landfills.\nOther developments.\nWithin a few years, there was an important but lesser-known surge of prospectors into far Northern California, specifically into present-day Siskiyou, Shasta and Trinity Counties. Discovery of gold nuggets at the site of present-day Yreka in 1851 brought thousands of gold-seekers up the Siskiyou Trail and throughout California's northern counties.\nSettlements of the gold rush era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into existence and then faded. The gold rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, a legacy of Chinese miners who came. While there are not many Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.\nBy 1850, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Faced with gold increasingly difficult to retrieve, Americans began to drive out foreigners to get at the most accessible gold that remained. The new California State Legislature passed a foreign miners tax of twenty dollars per month ($ per month as of 2024), and American prospectors began organized attacks on foreign miners, particularly Latin Americans and Chinese.\nIn addition, the huge numbers of newcomers were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing, and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, \"Life Amongst the Modocs.\"\nForty-niners.\nThe first people to rush to the goldfields, beginning in the spring of 1848, were the residents of California themselves\u2014primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Californians and some \"Californios\" (Spanish-speaking Californians; at the time, commonly referred to in English as simply 'Californians'). These first miners were sometimes entire families, of all ethnicities, in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children were sometimes found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women could bring in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.\nWord of the gold rush spread slowly at first. The earliest gold-seekers were people who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and from as far away as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.\nOnly a small number (probably fewer than 500) traveled overland from the United States that year. Some of these \"forty-eighters\", as the earliest gold-seekers were sometimes called, were able to collect large amounts of easily accessible gold\u2014in some cases, thousands of dollars' worth each day. Even ordinary prospectors averaged daily gold finds worth 10 to 15 times the daily wage of a laborer on the East Coast. A person could work for six months in the goldfields and find the equivalent of six years' wages back home. Some hoped to get rich quick and return home, and others wished to settle in California.\nBy the beginning of 1849, word of the gold rush had spread around the world, and an overwhelming number of gold-seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent. The largest group of forty-niners in 1849 were Americans from the East Coast, arriving by the tens of thousands overland across the continent and along various sailing routes (the term \"forty-niner\" was derived from the year 1849). Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania, poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports, and then traveling in a wagon train along the California Trail. Many others came by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the steamships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Australians and New Zealanders picked up the news from ships carrying Hawaiian newspapers, and thousands, infected with \"gold fever\", boarded ships for California.\nForty-niners came from Latin America, particularly from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile. Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China, began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to \"Gum San\" (\"Gold Mountain\"), the name given to California in Chinese. The first immigrants from Europe, reeling from the effects of the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France, with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.\nIt is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849\u2014about half by land and half by sea. Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries. By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world. The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians, French, and Latin Americans, together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques and people from the Ottoman Empire.\nPeople from small villages in the hills near Genoa, Italy, were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters. A modest number of miners were of African ancestry (probably fewer than 4,000) had come from the Southern States, the Caribbean and Brazil.\nA number of immigrants were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.\nThere were also women in the gold rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship to the San Francisco Bay in 1849, only 700 were women (including those who were poor, wealthy, entrepreneurs, prostitutes, single, and married). They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing to be left behind to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.\nBecause of many thousands of people flooding into California at Sacramento and San Francisco and surrounding areas, the Methodist church deemed it necessary to send missionaries there to preach the gospel, as churches in that part of the state were not to be found. The first missionary to arrive was William Taylor who arrived in San Francisco in September 1849. For many months he preached in the streets to hundreds of people without salary, and ultimately after saving often generous donations from successful miners, he built and established the first Methodist church in California, and California's first professional hospital.\nLegal rights.\nWhen the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places. When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the Mexican\u2013American War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal \"territory\" and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region. Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves.\nWhile the treaty ending the Mexican\u2013American War obliged the United States to honor Mexican land grants, almost all the goldfields were outside those grants. Instead, the goldfields were primarily on \"public land\", meaning land formally owned by the United States government. However, there were no legal rules yet in place, and no practical enforcement mechanisms.\nThe benefit to the forty-niners was that the gold was simply \"free for the taking\" at first. In the goldfields at the beginning, there was no private property, no licensing fees, and no taxes. The miners informally adapted Mexican mining law that had existed in California. For example, the rules attempted to balance the rights of early arrivers at a site with later arrivers; a \"claim\" could be \"staked\" by a prospector, but that claim was valid only as long as it was being actively worked.\nMiners worked at a claim only long enough to determine its potential. If a claim was deemed as low-value\u2014as most were\u2014miners would abandon the site in search of a better one. In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would \"claim-jump\" the land. \"Claim-jumping\" meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site. Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators. This often led to heightened ethnic tensions. In some areas the influx of many prospectors could lead to a reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure.\nDevelopment of gold-recovery techniques.\nApproximately four hundred million years ago, California lay at the bottom of a large sea; underwater volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.\nBecause the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, early forty-niners were able to retrieve loose gold flakes and nuggets with their hands, or simply \"pan\" for gold in rivers and streams. Panning cannot take place on a large scale, and industrious miners and groups of miners graduated to placer mining, using \"cradles\" and \"rockers\" or \"long-toms\" to process larger volumes of gravel. Miners would also engage in \"coyoteing\", a method that involved digging a shaft deep into placer deposits along a stream. Tunnels were then dug in all directions to reach the richest veins of pay dirt.\nIn the most complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Mixed groups of Chileans and Mexicans were the first to apply this technique which required colaborative work which was something that was more common among Chileans when compared to Anglo Americans.\nModern estimates are that as much as 12 million ounces (370\u00a0t) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush.\nChilean miners, coming from an area with a long mining tradition, were influential in California. Many Euroamerican miners learned from them and from Sonorans. Chileans are credited to have introduced the \"batea\" gold pan (dish made of wood) and the \"trapiche\" to California. The \"trapiche\" became known as the Chilean mill and compared favourable to similar technology introduced by Mexicans.\nHydraulic mining and dredging.\nIn the next stage, by 1853, hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the goldfields. In a modern style of hydraulic mining first developed in California, and later used around the world, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds. The loosened gravel and gold would then pass over sluices, with the gold settling to the bottom where it was collected. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that of gold (worth approximately US$15\u00a0billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by hydraulic mining.\nA byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers. Court rulings (1882 Gold Run and 1884 \"Sawyer Act\") and 1893 federal legislation limited hydraulic mining in California. As of 1999[ [update]] many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.\nAfter the gold rush had concluded, gold recovery operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed down into the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and it is estimated that more than were recovered by dredging.\nHard-rock mining.\nBoth during the gold rush and in the decades that followed, gold-seekers also engaged in hard-rock mining, extracting the gold directly from the rock that contained it (typically quartz), usually by digging and blasting to follow and remove veins of the gold-bearing quartz. Chilean miners in particular had experience in this type of mining. Once the gold-bearing rocks were brought to the surface, the rocks were crushed and the gold separated, either using separation in water, using its density difference from quartz sand, or by washing the sand over copper plates coated with mercury (with which gold forms an amalgam). Loss of mercury in the amalgamation process was a source of environmental contamination. Eventually, hard-rock mining became the single largest source of gold produced in the Gold Country. The total production of gold in California from then until now is estimated at .\nProfits.\nRecent scholarship confirms that merchants made far more money than miners during the gold rush. The wealthiest man in California during the early years of the rush was Samuel Brannan, a tireless self-promoter, shopkeeper and newspaper publisher. Brannan opened the first supply stores in Sacramento, Coloma, and other spots in the goldfields. Just as the rush began, he purchased all the prospecting supplies available in San Francisco and resold them at a substantial profit.\nSome gold-seekers made a significant amount of money. On average, half the gold-seekers made a modest profit, after taking all expenses into account; economic historians have suggested that white miners were more successful than black, Indian, or Chinese miners. However, taxes such as the California foreign miners tax passed in 1851, targeted mainly Latino miners and kept them from making as much money as whites, who did not have any taxes imposed on them. In California most late arrivals made little or wound up losing money. Similarly, many unlucky merchants set up in settlements that disappeared, or which succumbed to one of the calamitous fires that swept the towns that sprang up. By contrast, a businessman who went on to great success was Levi Strauss, who first began selling denim overalls in San Francisco in 1853.\nOther businessmen reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, and laundry were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay well for a service done by a woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.\nBy 1855, the economic climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to large groups of workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made in a wide variety of conventional businesses.\nPath of the gold.\nOnce extracted, the gold itself took many paths. First, much of the gold was used locally to purchase food, supplies and lodging for the miners. It also went towards entertainment, which consisted of anything from a traveling theater to alcohol, gambling, and prostitutes. These transactions often took place using the recently recovered gold, carefully weighed out. These merchants and vendors, in turn, used the gold to purchase supplies from ship captains or packers bringing goods to California.\nThe gold then left California aboard ships or mules to go to the makers of the goods from around the world. A second path was the Argonauts themselves who, having personally acquired a sufficient amount, sent the gold home, or returned home taking with them their hard-earned \"diggings\". For example, one estimate is that some US$80 million worth of California gold (equivalent to US$ billion today) was sent to France by French prospectors and merchants.\nA majority of the gold went back to New York City brokerage houses.\nAs the gold rush progressed, local banks and gold dealers issued \"banknotes\" or \"drafts\"\u2014locally accepted paper currency\u2014in exchange for gold, and private mints created private gold coins. With the building of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, gold bullion was turned into official United States gold coins for circulation. The gold was also later sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the booming California economy.\nEffects.\nThe arrival of hundreds of thousands of new people in California within a few years, compared to a population of some 15,000 Europeans and \"Californios\" beforehand, had many dramatic effects.\nA 2017 study attributes the record-long economic expansion of the United States in the recession-free period of 1841\u20131856 primarily to \"a boom in transportation-goods investment following the discovery of gold in California.\"\nGovernment and commerce.\nThe gold rush propelled California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to a center of the global imagination and the destination of hundreds of thousands of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic mindedness. For example, in the midst of the gold rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C., to negotiate the admission of California as a state.\nLarge-scale agriculture (California's second \"Gold Rush\") began during this time. Roads, schools, churches, and civic organizations quickly came into existence. The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans. Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States, leading to statehood for California on September 9, 1850, in the Compromise of 1850 as the state of the United States.\nBetween 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. \"Central America\", ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.\nNative Americans.\nUrban indians had lived in California since Spanish times. The millrace where gold was first discovered had been dug by a crew of Indians hired by John Sutter.\nThe human and environmental costs of the Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.\nIn some areas, systematic attacks against tribespeople in or near mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers. Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that there were times when miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked, killing more than 150 Wintu people. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.\nHistorian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873 and estimated that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the \"intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise\"). Furthermore, California stood in opposition of ratifying the eighteen treaties signed between tribal leaders and federal agents in 1851. The state government, in support of miner activities, funded and supported private militia groups, appropriating over 1\u00a0million dollars towards the funding and operation of the paramilitary organizations. Peter Burnett, California's first governor declared that California was a battleground between the races and that there were only two options towards California Indians, extermination or removal. \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\" For Burnett, like many of his contemporaries, the genocide was part of God's plan, and it was necessary for Burnett's constituency to move forward in California. The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, passed on April 22, 1850, by the California Legislature, allowed settlers to capture and use Native people as bonded workers, prohibited Native peoples' testimony against settlers, and allowed the adoption of Native children by settlers, often for labor purposes.\nAfter the initial boom had ended, explicitly anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought to drive out foreigners\u2014in addition to Native Americans\u2014from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico, and Chile. Spanish-speaking immigrants tended to group together and among these Chileans tended to assume leadership which made outsiders call all of them \"Chilean\". This leadership was particularly visible when Spanish-speaking miners had to confront \"Anglo\" miners. Chilean miners are known to have resisted eviction by various means, both legal and by the use of revenge attacks culminating in the Chile War of 1849. \nThe toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.\nWorld-wide economic stimulation.\nThe gold rush stimulated economies around the world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British manufactured goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs around the world. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. Preceding the gold rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.\nWithin a few years after the end of the gold rush, in 1863, the groundbreaking ceremony for the western leg of the first transcontinental railroad was held in Sacramento. The line's completion, some six years later, financed in part with Gold Rush money, united California with the central and eastern United States. Travel that had taken weeks or even months could now be accomplished in days.\nGender practices.\nAs the California gold rush brought a disproportionate population of men and set an environment of experimental lawlessness separate from the bounds of standard society, conventional American gender roles came into question. In the large absence of women, these migrant young men were made to reorganize their social and sexual practices, leading to cross-gender practices that most often took place as cross-dressing. Dance events were a notable social space for cross-dressing, where a piece of cloth (such as a handkerchief or sackcloth patch) would denote a 'woman.' Beyond social events, these subverted gender expectations continued into domestic duties as well. Though cross-dressing occurred most frequently with men as women, the reverse also applied.\nThese miners and merchants of various genders and gendered appearances, encouraged by the social fluidity and population limitations of the Wild West, shaped the beginnings of San Francisco's prominent queer history.\nLonger-term.\nCalifornia's name became indelibly connected with the gold rush, and fast success in a new world became known as the \"California Dream\". California was perceived as a place of new beginnings, where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The old American Dream\u00a0... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's \"Poor Richard\"...\u00a0of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream\u00a0... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill.\nOvernight California gained the international reputation as the \"golden state\". Generations of immigrants have been attracted by the California Dream. California farmers, oil drillers, movie makers, airplane builders, computer and microchip makers, and \"dot-com\" entrepreneurs have each had their boom times in the decades after the Gold Rush.\nIn addition, the standard route shield of state highways in California is in the shape of a miner's spade to honor the California gold rush. Today, the aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills, connecting many Gold Rush-era towns such as Placerville, Auburn, Grass Valley, Nevada City, Coloma, Jackson, and Sonora. This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many gold rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.\nCultural references.\nThe literary history of the gold rush is reflected in the works of Mark Twain (\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\"), Bret Harte (\"A Millionaire of Rough-and-Ready\"), Joaquin Miller (\"Life Amongst the Modocs\"), and many others.\nThe San Francisco 49ers, a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area and competing in the National Football League, are named after miners.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The colony was located along the Delaware River with settlements in modern Delaware (e.g., Wilmington), Pennsylvania (e.g., Philadelphia) and New Jersey (e.g., New Stockholm and Swedesboro) along locations where Swedish and Dutch traders had been visiting for decades.\nAt the time (until 1809) Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden, and some of the settlers of Sweden's colonies came from present-day Finland or were Finnish-speaking. The Swedes and Finns brought their log house design to America, where it became the typical log cabin of pioneers. The Swedish settlers established a trading relationship with the Susquehannock, and supported them in their successful war against Maryland colonists.\nWhile a Baltic naval power, the international power of the Swedish Empire was rooted in land-based military power, and when another general war engulfed northern Europe, the Royal Swedish Navy was incapable of protecting the colony. Subsequently, the young colony was eventually annexed by the Dutch, who perceived the presence of Swedish colonists in North America as a threat to their interests in the New Netherland colony.\nCaribbean.\nThe Swedish colony of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy (1784\u20131878) was operated as a \"porto franco\" (free port). The capital city of Gustavia retains its Swedish name. Guadeloupe (1813\u20131814) came into Swedish possession as a consequence of the Napoleonic Wars. It gave rise to the Guadeloupe Fund.\nIn addition to these the Swedes briefly attempted to settle Tobago in 1733, but were driven away by native tribes, and Tobago was eventually claimed by the British.\nEsequibo.\nDuring the 18th century, the Swedes attempted to colonize the Essequibo region between the lower Orinoco and Barima rivers in Guyana's present-day Barima-Waini region. The Swedes, settled in the area in July 1732, were expelled in 1737 by forces led by Major Sergeant Carlos Francisco Francois Sucre y Pardo (grandfather of Venezuelan independence leader Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre).\nSwedish emigration.\nSwedish emigrants continued to go to the Americas to settle within other countries or colonies. The mid-19th and early 20th centuries saw a large Swedish emigration to the United States. In 1841, a group composed of former Upsala University students and a couple of relatives established the first Swedish colony west of the Allegheny Mountains on the east shore of Pine Lake 30 miles west of Milwaukee and named their settlement, New Upsala. Approximately 1.3\u00a0million Swedes subsequently settled in the U.S., and there are currently about four million Swedish-Americans, as of 2008.\nDom Pedro II, the second Emperor of Brazil, encouraged immigration, resulting in a sizeable number of Swedes entering Brazil, settling mainly in the cities of Joinville and Iju\u00ed. In the late 19th century, Misiones Province in Argentina was a major centre for Swedish immigration, and laid the foundations of a population of Swedish-Argentines.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58299", "revid": "41901223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58299", "title": "Opera Australia", "text": "Principal opera company in Australia\nOpera Australia is the principal opera company in Australia. Based in Sydney, New South Wales, its performance season at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Opera Australia Orchestra runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent at the Arts Centre Melbourne, where it is accompanied by Orchestra Victoria. In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, Victoria, attended by more than 294,000 people.\nIt is funded by government grants, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales. The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75 per cent. The company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with Dame Joan Sutherland, for Baz Luhrmann's production of Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\" in the early 1990s and more recently, for, apart from performances inside the opera house, large scale outdoor performances on Sydney Harbour.\nMany thousands of Australians also experience the company's work through television, radio, video, compact disc, DVD, and the annual free performance of opera in the Domain in Sydney. The company also performs in an annual outdoor event at Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, where since 2012 operas such as \"La traviata\", \"Madama Butterfly\", \"Turandot\", \"Aida\" and \"Carmen\" have played.\nHistory.\nAustralian Opera Company, 1956\u201357.\nIn 1956, the Australian Opera Company was formed in Sydney under the auspices of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. It commemorated the Mozart bicentenary by presenting four Mozart operas in all capital cities, travelling more than 10,000 kilometres, and giving 169 performances.\nElizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company, 1957\u201370.\nBy 1957, it changed its name to the Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company.\nIn 1959 the company's laid-off singers gave the first of many regional tours (presented by state Arts Councils) with Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\" using reduced scenery and conducted from the piano by Georg Tintner (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland). Subsequent Arts Council tours included \"Rigoletto\" (1960; Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales), \"Cos\u00ec fan tutte\" (1961; New South Wales, Queensland) and \"La traviata\" (1962; New South Wales, Queensland), all conducted by Tintner. However, by 1963 a permanent nucleus of singers and staff was retained throughout the year and the company had made appearances at regional festivals, including the Adelaide Festival. It was also able to establish the first Elizabethan Trust Orchestra for the company by 1967 with additional government aid. During this time, Stefan Haag played an important role in the development of the company.\nA major milestone for the company was a television recording of Puccini's \"Tosca\" filmed in 1968 at the Adelaide Festival. This starred Tito Gobbi as Scarpia alongside two Australian singers, soprano Marie Collier in the title role, and tenor Donald Smith as Cavaradossi, with the Argentinian born, Italian conductor Carlo Felice Cillario conducting. This was the commencement of a long and fruitful association between the Australian Opera and Cillario until his retirement in 2003. Some of his first rehearsals in the country involved conducting the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra and the Australian Opera Chorus, both newly formed and on permanent contracts.\nWhile not yet appearing with this company, Joan Sutherland, then an internationally known Australian soprano, and her husband, the conductor Richard Bonynge, helped the cause of opera in general in Australia during the 1960s. Sutherland's name was also linked to the progress of the Sydney Opera House, begun in 1957 and still undergoing a lengthy and controversial construction. By the time \"La Stupenda\" appeared there in 1974, one year after the opening of the theatre, the company was a leading repertory company with a large chorus and a roster of experienced Australian principals supplemented by guest singers and conductors.\nThe Australian Opera, 1970\u201396.\nIn 1970, the company became known as The Australian Opera. The 1970s saw considerable changes both in administration and location. In 1972, Edward Downes, formerly associated with London's Royal Opera House, became musical director, and his first new production was the Australian premiere of Richard Strauss's \"Der Rosenkavalier\" at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, followed closely by Prokofiev's \"War and Peace\" as the opening night performance of the Sydney Opera House, a short time before the building's official opening.\nThe Sydney Opera House, as well as quickly becoming a distinctive cultural landmark in that city, gave the company a permanent performance home and thus helped to expand its repertoire and develop local audiences. Audiences were boosted by Joan Sutherland's performances with The Australian Opera in Offenbach's \"The Tales of Hoffmann\". In the 1974 season, three Australian works were performed: \"The Affair\" by Felix Werder, \"Lenz\" by Larry Sitsky, and \"Rites of Passage\" by Peter Sculthorpe. (\"Rites of Passage\" was to have been the inaugural opera presentation at the Sydney Opera House, but was not ready in time.)\nBy 1976, Richard Bonynge had become musical director and he led the company on its first overseas tour to New Zealand with Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" and Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \"Jen\u016ffa\", the latter conducted by Georg Tintner. This was followed in 1978 by the first Australian Opera country tour with orchestra to north-eastern New South Wales (\"Don Pasquale\" with the Queensland Theatre Orchestra, conducted by Tintner). The principal tenor for this tour was Robin Donald. From 1977 to 1990, the resident director was Elke Neidhardt.\nIn 1977, the New South Wales Friends of the Australian Opera and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust established the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship to further the musical education of professional opera singers.\nDuring the 1980s, after many years of recording performances by the Australian Opera for television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and The Australian Opera presented their first live simulcast, Johann Strauss's \"Die Fledermaus\", and it was seen by more than two million people. Over the following years a series of simulcasts reached millions of Australian homes.\nLuciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland appeared at the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House in 1983, with the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge (the sister orchestra in Melbourne was known as the Elizabethan Melbourne Orchestra. Now they are known respectively as the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra, Sydney and Orchestra Victoria, Melbourne). Another successful concert with Sutherland and Marilyn Horne was held in the Concert Hall.\nSeveral innovative features characterised this period of the 1980s. The first, Esso Opera in the Park in the Sydney Domain, quickly became an annual event, and it is now called \"Opera in the Domain\". Typically, it attracts almost 100,000 people each year. A similar annual outdoor event, which attracts more than 25,000 people, is held in Melbourne. The second was the establishment of The Esso Young Artists' Development Program for the Australian Opera while the third was the Australian Compositions Program launched with a new production of Brian Howard's \"Metamorphosis\".\nAnother innovative program, The National Opera Workshop, was established to enable selected Australian composers to present works in workshop form with artists from the Australian Opera. Lastly, OperaAction, the Youth Education Program, established a program of events, including three youth performances of Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" and, in 1986, \"Winds of the Solstice\", an original youth opera created by 70 students working on libretto, music, choreography and orchestration and presented at the Sydney Opera House.\nThe company re-organised its administration gradually throughout the decade, appointing Moffatt Oxenbould as artistic director in 1984, and announcing that Bonynge would become Musical Director Emeritus and principal guest conductor from 1987, after his decade long contract as musical director expired.\nIn 1988, in association with the Australian Bicentennial Authority, the company toured Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and the National Opera Workshop in Melbourne with \"The Ra Project\", a music-theatre work composed with the direct participation from the earliest stages by the singers who performed it and marking director Baz Luhrmann's first association with the Australian Opera.\nSutherland gave her farewell performances for the Australian Opera in 1990 in a production of Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\". Two years later, the company named its major rehearsal studio after Dame Joan.\nAlso in 1990, Baz Luhrmann's \"La boh\u00e8me\" premiered in Sydney, establishing Cheryl Barker and David Hobson as important principals in the company. Such was its impact that the production went on to play at the Broadway Theatre in New York in 2002 for 228 performances.\nThe early 1990s were to see two important changes in the way that the company worked: firstly, in 1991, with the formation of the Artistic Associates of The Australian Opera, a body of people was created which comprised some of the most important figures in the Australian musical and performing arts world. Secondly, the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra was integrated with the Australian Opera to produce a permanent opera and ballet orchestra for the company.\nIn its first performances outside Australasia in 1994, the company performed Britten's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" at the Edinburgh International Festival. In addition, the Baz Luhrmann production of \"La boh\u00e8me\" was screened over more than 300 North American television stations, followed by worldwide video release and a later Broadway version.\nOpera Australia, since 1996.\nOpera Australia (OA) was formed by the merger of the Australian Opera and the Victoria State Opera (VSO) companies in 1996, following the financial collapse of the Melbourne-based VSO. Adrian Collette was appointed general manager of the new company, and developed a three-year plan to restructure the company involving twice yearly seasons in both Sydney and Melbourne, integrating the OA and VSO staff and planning a viable financial structure so as to manage the inherited debt.\nThe first few years of the present century saw the retirement of Moffatt Oxenbould, Opera Australia's artistic director for 15 years, and the appointment of Simone Young as musical director. Immediately on taking up her position in 2001, Simone Young appointed the Australian director Stuart Maunder to the position of artistic director. Young proceeded to develop the company's core repertoire, including more German operas in the repertoire and diversifying the types of productions mounted and the standards of international and local artists employed. By late 2002 however, the OA board, faced with mounting deficits, announced that Young's future visions for the company were \"unsustainable\" and decided not to renew her contract after the end of 2003.\nAt the end of 2003, Richard Hickox was named music director-designate of Opera Australia, and took up the post full-time from January 2005. During his tenure, Hickox diversified the repertoire with the addition of more 20th-century works such as \"The Love for Three Oranges\", \"Rusalka\" and \"Arabella\", recording live performances of many of these works for Chandos Records. The company's 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2006 with a gala concert in which tributes were paid to Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, the principal artists, the chorus, production staff and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra (the AOBO) for their \"artistry and talent\" and the \"ensemble nature\" of the company. In mid-2008, Hickox and Opera Australia were criticised by a singer for what she perceived as a decline in artistic standards since the start of Hickox's tenure. The board expressed complete confidence in Hickox. On returning to the UK in November 2008 following the Sydney winter season, Hickox died suddenly from a heart attack after conducting a rehearsal in Swansea. On 30 June 2009, Lyndon Terracini was announced as the new artistic director.\n\"Change for survival\".\nIn 2011, Terracini gave a controversial speech as part of the annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address, in which he announced that Opera Australia had to change in order to survive. \"Opera companies and orchestras of significance world wide are closing at an alarming rate ... We can blithely ignore the fact ... or we can change ... brave programming is having the courage to programme what critics will criticise you for, but will make a genuine connection to a real audience.\"\nTerracini pursued a program designed to bring opera to wider audiences. In 2012 through the sponsorship of Haruhisa Handa and Destination NSW, Opera Australia staged the first Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, a three-week season of a fully produced and staged opera, designed to be an opera \"event\". The production of \"La traviata\" was directed by Francesca Zambello and attracted an audience of 40,000 people. In 2013, Opera Australia staged an open-air production of \"Carmen\" on Sydney Harbour, directed by Gale Edwards. It reached similar audience numbers. The harbour has since received annual stagings, followed by \"Madama Butterfly\" (2014), \"Aida\" (2015), and \"Turandot\" (2016), a new production of \"Carmen\" in 2017, \"La boh\u00e8me\" (2018), \"West Side Story\" (2019), \"La Traviata\" (2020, 2021), \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (2022), \"Madama Butterfly\" (2023), \"West Side Story\" (2024), \"Guys &amp; Dolls\" (2025).\nIn 2012, Opera Australia replaced the regular Gilbert and Sullivan productions that had formed part of the company's repertoire for some years with a series of Broadway musicals. A Lincoln Center Theatre production of \"South Pacific\" played at the Sydney Opera House and Melbourne's Princess Theatre in 2012, kicking off a national tour which continued in 2013.\nAn extensive philanthropic drive enabled the company to program its first full-length \"Ring Cycle\", which was performed in Melbourne over four weeks at the end of 2013. After tickets to the event sold out in just one day, ABC Classic FM and Opera Australia announced the radio station would live broadcast the \"Ring Cycle\" to audiences across the country.\nIn April 2013, Opera Australia announced a 44 per cent growth in total revenue based on an increase in box office sales of more than 55 per cent. For the second year in a row, the company reported an operating profit following two successive deficits.\nIn January 2013, the board of Opera Australia announced they would extend Lyndon Terracini's contract as artistic director for five more years. Later that year, Terracini announced that singers on 12-month contracts will be \"rested\" without pay for a period of six to twelve weeks in 2014.\nTerracini resigned in October 2022 and in December Opera Australia announced Welsh-born Jo Davies as his replacement. She was the first woman to be appointed artistic director of the company, but left in August 2024, following \"differences of opinion\" with the CEO.\nEducational outreach.\nOz Opera was established after the merger of the AO with the VSO in 1996 with Lindy Hume as its director. Its aim is to present opera to audiences throughout metropolitan and regional Australia. It presents performances in primary schools across New South Wales and Victoria, adapting large-scale scores to suit young audiences.\nOz Opera, now called Opera Australia Touring and Outreach (Opera Australia's education, access and development arm), presented the \"La boh\u00e8me\" production in Victoria, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, attended by 13,350 people, while OzOpera's Schools Company performed to over 63,500 primary age children in more than 360 performances in urban and regional New South Wales and Victoria. Since then the touring and outreach arm of the company has performed to a great many more people around Australia and toured other states, including South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania.\nModern Australian opera.\nOpera Australia is committed to the long-term development and performance of modern Australian operas. Since 1974, OA has fully staged 12 new Australian operas and workshopped over 20 new works in various stages of development. The main new works staged by the company have been \"The Little Mermaid\" by Anne Boyd (1985); \"Metamorphosis\" by Brian Howard (1985); \"Voss\" by Richard Meale (1986); \"Whitsunday\" by Howard (1988); \"Mer de glace\" by Richard Meale (1992); \"The Golem\" by Larry Sitsky (1993); \"The Eighth Wonder\" by Alan John (1995); \"Summer of the Seventeenth Doll\" by Richard Mills (1999); \"Batavia\" by Richard Mills (2001); \"Love in the Age of Therapy\" by Paul Grabowsky (OzOpera 2002); \"Lindy\" by Moya Henderson (2003); \"Madeline Lee\" by John Haddock (2004); \"Bliss\" (2010) by Brett Dean; and \"The Rabbits\" by Kate Miller Heidke (2015). In 2015, OA produced the television opera \"The Divorce\" by Elena Kats-Chernin and Joanna Murray-Smith based on an original idea by Terracini for ABC Television.\nDigital strategy.\nIn 2011, Opera Australia launched a digital strategy in order to bring high-definition recordings of its operas to cinemas (in collaboration with CinemaLive), as well as launching DVD, Blu-ray and CD releases on its own label and broadcasting these recordings on ABC Television.\nAwards and nominations.\nARIA Music Awards.\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

However, throughout the 19th century, the state legislature frequently adjusted county boundaries. County creation was intended to fulfill the goal of establishing government over unorganized territory, but a more important goal was encouraging settlement by surveying the land and dividing it into saleable sections.\nThe creation of counties generally occurred in two stages. First the boundaries of a county were declared, and the county given a name. The county appeared on maps, even though this may have been the entire extent of a county's tangible existence for several years. During this period, the as-yet\u2013unorganized county was attached to another already organized county for administrative purposes. The legislature frequently changed the administrative attachment of these unorganized counties. Residents of such an attached county could petition the legislature for organization, which was the granting of full legal recognition to the county.\nThere are many cities and villages that span county boundaries in Michigan, including its capital, Lansing. For a few years during the early 1970s, split cities briefly had authority to petition to change the county boundaries to accord with the city boundaries. The only city to take advantage of this brief opportunity was New Baltimore (previously split between Macomb County and St. Clair County; now completely in Macomb). This transfer of territory from St. Clair to Macomb was the only county boundary change in Michigan since the early 20th century.\nThe state constitution of 1850 permitted an incorporated city with a population of at least 20,000 to be organized into a separate county of its own. The Constitution of 1908 retained this provision, but raised the population threshold to 100,000. No city was ever organized into an independent county in this fashion and when a new Constitution took effect in 1963, the provision was removed.\nMichigan's boundary with Illinois is formed by Lake Michigan, and three counties have water boundaries with Illinois: Berrien County, Van Buren County, and Allegan County. Michigan also has a boundary with Minnesota, which is formed by Lake Superior. The water boundary in this instance is formed by two counties: Ontonagon County and Keweenaw County. The land boundary with Wisconsin continues into Lake Superior, involving both Gogebic County (which shares a land border) and Ontonagon County (water boundary only).\nEtymologies.\nNine counties have names invented by the ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft, usually adapted from parts of Native American words; some of these have parts from Greek, Arabic or Latin roots.\nSchoolcraft's coinages include disputed sources. While he was a devotee of Native American words and culture, he may derived some of his coinages from tribes other areas of the U.S., such as New York, or the Northeast (from where many settlers to Michigan had come). Some original native words were eradicated, by his substitution of novel names, sometimes with a kernel of Indian language or sound in them.\nA second group of four counties were renamed for Irish locales (counties Antrim, Clare, Roscommon and Wexford), apparently because it was close to the heart for certain Michigan legislators or their constituents.\nTen counties, the so-called \"cabinet counties\", were named for persons who served in Andrew Jackson's presidential administration, which was tied to Michigan's anticipated ascendancy to statehood. Eight were named in 1829. Livingston County was named in 1833. Cass County was also named in 1829, but Governor Lewis Cass did not become a member of Jackson's Cabinet until 1831.\nThe FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, the number 001 is shared by Alcona County, Michigan, Adams County, Wisconsin, and Adair County, Iowa. To uniquely identify Alcona County, Michigan, one must use the state code of 26 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Alcona County, Michigan is 26001. The links in the column FIPS County Code are to the Census Bureau Info page for that county.\nDefunct counties and county precursors.\nThis listing includes only counties or county precursors created by the Territory of Michigan or the State of Michigan. It excludes counties that existed in the Territory of Michigan or the modern boundaries of the State of Michigan but were created by any other entity (another state, a territorial government, the federal government, etc.) before the creation of the Territory of Michigan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first two counties, Adams County and Pickering County (renamed Jefferson County later), were established in 1799 in the Mississippi Territory. 14 counties, all in the southwest, were created before the Mississippi Territory became a state in 1817. The last county created was Humphreys County in 1918. The Mississippi Constitution governs the creation of new counties, which requires an election of qualified electors to approve of the creation of a new county. Elections are limited to once every four years. Any new county must be at least , with no existing county reduced below that size.\nThe county governing body, known as the Board of Supervisors, is located under the judicial branch of state government as established in the 1817 Mississippi Constitution. The 1868 Constitution mandated five-member Board of Supervisors, an evolution of the five-member board of police created in the 1832 Constitution. Supervisors are elected without term limits. County government includes other elected and appointed officials who serve concurrent four-year terms. Major elected officials include the chancery clerk, who manages records and administrative tasks for the supervisors and chancery court; the circuit clerk, who handles election administration duties; and the sheriff, who functions as the chief of county law enforcement. Other elected officials include the constables, justice court judges, and the tax assessor or collector (23 counties have separate officials). Major appointed county officials include the board attorney, the county administrator, the county engineer, and the road manager. Counties have either one of two county seats, depending on the number of court districts.\nThrough evolving constitutions, counties are granted police powers, administrative duties for transportation infrastructure, and election scheduling for vacacines in county offices. The Board of Supervisors are mandated to additional duties as defined by the legislature. While placed under the judicial branch, the Mississippi Supreme Court recognize counties perform mixed duties that are executive, legislative, and judicial in nature. Prior to 1988, each supervisor independently managed roads and bridges in their assigned area, and would allocate money at their discretion, subject to restrictions in state law. County revenues were divided equally among all five supervisors. However, this came under scrutiny after Operation Pretense (1984\u20131987), an FBI sting operation targeting corruption that led to the indictment of fifty-five county supervisors. The Mississippi Legislature passed the County Government Reorganization Act of 1988 in response, which transferred responsibilities to a system of centralized road administration.\nAccording to 2024 U.S. census Data, the average population of Mississippi's 82 counties is 35,891, with Harrison County as the most populous (213,730) and Issaquena County the least (1,295). Six counties have populations over 100,000 while 15 have populations under 10,000. Yazoo County is the largest by total area at , and Alcorn County is the smallest at . The average land area is . 19 counties have names with Native American etymologies.\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is used by the United States Federal government to uniquely identify counties.

All sucking lice are blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals. They can cause localized skin irritations and are vectors of several blood-borne diseases.\nAt least three species or subspecies of Anoplura are parasites of humans; the human condition of being infested with sucking lice is called pediculosis. \"Pediculus humanus\" is divided into two subspecies, \"Pediculus humanus humanus\", or the human body louse, sometimes nicknamed \"the seam squirrel\" for its habit of laying of eggs in the seams of clothing, and \"Pediculus humanus capitis\", or the human head louse. \"Pthirus pubis\" (the human pubic louse) is the cause of the condition known as crabs.\nClassification.\nSucking lice are classified as a parvorder called Anoplura, named by Leach in 1815. Anoplura belongs to the infraorder Phthiraptera, which contains all lice, and is part of the larger order Psocodea, which also contains booklice, barklice and barkflies. A cladogram showing the position of Anoplura within Phthiraptera and Psocodea is shown below:\nCharacteristics.\nSucking lice are typically flattened and wingless, with sharp claws on their legs that are used to attach themselves to hair or human clothing. All sucking lice suck blood through a small proboscis that is usually kept inside of their head. Their color typically ranges between a mixture of yellow and white. There are around 540 different species of Anoplura, and unlike the closely related Mallophaga, sucking lice only parasitize mammals.\nSucking lice bodies are typically oblong, with a flattened body and a head that is rounded in the front and smaller than the thorax. The lice have anywhere from three to five separate thread\u2013like antennae on top of the end of the head that is used to help navigate their surroundings. The head tends to slightly widen next to the antennae. The antennae are composed of three to five equal sized joints that are used to aid in sensing their surrounding. The thorax contains two irregularly shaped triangular plates that help defend the insect's interior. Most sucking lice are no more than two millimeters in length.\nLife cycle.\nAll sucking lice undergo a process of slow metamorphosis, with three life stages of egg, nymph and adult. The entire process of Anoplura's growth occurs whilst on their host; however, they are able to survive for small periods of time in outside environments. Once a female louse matures, they will lay large amounts of small eggs (also known as nits) on the individual hairs of hosts. Nits are usually between 0.3 and 0.8 millimeters long, and are often pale in color or nearly transparent.\nFeeding method.\nSucking lice live exclusively on the outside of their hosts, making them considered ectoparasites. The louse's proboscis consists of two distinct tubes, with the upper being called a rostrum, and the lower being called a stylet. The lice will use their upper mouth piece to latch onto the skin with teeth\u2013like structures, maintaining a firm hold during their feeding. The lower mouth piece consists of two stylets, also known as stabbers. After the rostrum obtains a firm hold, the stylets will penetrate the skin with the serrated edges in a saw\u2013like fashion. The louse will then regurgitate saliva through the proboscis inside of the body, before proceeding to suck the host's blood in what has been described as a \"pumping action\". Different species of sucking louse have specialised anatomy to help parasitize on different mammals and to help survive various climates.\nEffects.\nIn humans.\nAnoplura contains three species of lice that parasitize humans. Anoplura body lice (\"Pediculus humanus humanus\") typically carry the potential of causing skin irritation, and are vectors of multiple blood-born diseases. Common symptoms of Anoplura body lice include relapsing fever, trench fever and epidemic typhus. Due to increased societal standards for hygiene, body lice in general is significantly less prevalent in developed regions. During the American Civil War, body lice were colloquially known as \"seam squirrels\" due to their tendency to lay eggs within the seams of soldier's clothes. Anoplura head lice (\"Pediculus humanus capitis)\" is significantly more common than pubic or body lice, with studies reporting an infestation rate between 3.6% and 61.4% from countries in North and South America. Cases of head lice are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 11. \"Pthirus pubis\" (also known as pubic lice or crabs) is a species of sucking lice that affects the genitals of humans, and is the cause of \"Pediculosis pubis\". Pubic lice are often mistaken as sexually transmitted infections due to frequently being contracted through sexual contact; however, they are only considered parasites as they can be spread through non-sexual methods such as sharing blankets or towels.\nIn other animals.\nDogs can be affected by three individual species of Anoplura lice: \"Linognathus setosus, Heterodoxus spiniger\" and \"Trichodectes canis\". Dogs infested by lice show symptoms of discomfort such as rubbing, scratching and biting areas affected. Coats of affected animals are often rough to the touch, and can become matted over time if left untreated. Severe infestations of sucking lice can lead to anemia from the loss of blood as well. Lice in dogs can only be contracted through either direct or indirect contact with another infested dog, and cannot be transferred across different species.\nCats are not affected by Anoplura lice, rather they can only contract the species \"Felicola subrostrata,\" a type of chewing lice.\nMost cattle species can be affected by sucking lice, with certain lice species being specially adapted to their preferred cattle and unable to be transferred across any other species. Anoplura lice can only live off of the animal for a few days. Female lice specialized to cattle tend to lay a single egg every day for around 2 to 3 weeks. Similar to sucking lice in dogs, severe infestations can cause cattle to experience anemia, with newborn calves being particularly vulnerable.\nFamilies.\nThese 15 families are generally recognized in the Anoplura:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following the Louisiana Purchase and the admittance of Louisiana into the United States in 1812, five counties were formed out of the Missouri Territory at the first general assembly: Cape Girardeau, New Madrid, Saint Charles, Saint Louis, and Ste. Genevieve. Most subsequent counties were apportioned from these five original counties. Six more counties were added through the 1836 Platte Purchase, the acquired lands of which formed the northwest tip of the state and consisted of Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Holt, Nodaway, and Platte counties.\nIn Missouri, the county level of government comes between those of the city and the state. Its primary responsibilities include maintaining roads, providing security, prosecuting criminals, and collecting taxes. Elected officials at this level include a sheriff, prosecuting attorney, and assessor.\nMost of the counties in Missouri are named after politicians. One such county, Cass, was originally named Van Buren County after President Martin Van Buren, and was changed to its present name in support of Van Buren's Democratic opponent Lewis Cass during the presidential election of 1848. Other counties are named after war heroes, natural resources, explorers, and former U.S. territories.\nThe city of St. Louis is an independent city, and is not within the limits of a county. Its residents voted to secede from St. Louis County in 1876. Throughout the United States, St. Louis is one of three independent cities outside the state of Virginia (the other two are Baltimore, Maryland, and Carson City, Nevada).\nPopulation figures are based on the 2024 Census estimate.

Fifty of them existed at the time of the Wheeling Convention in 1861, during the American Civil War, when those counties seceded from the Commonwealth of Virginia to form the new state of West Virginia. West Virginia was admitted as a separate state of the United States on June 20, 1863. Five additional counties (Grant, Mineral, Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo) were formed from the original counties in the decades following admission.\nAfter the Civil War, Berkeley County and Jefferson County, the two easternmost counties of West Virginia, refused to recognize their inclusion in the state, and the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation attempting to reclaim them. In March 1866, the United States Congress passed a joint mandate assenting to their inclusion in the new state, and the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed this outcome in the case of \"Virginia v. West Virginia\" (1871).\nThe West Virginia Constitution was ratified in 1872, replacing the state constitution created in 1863 when West Virginia became a state. Article 9, Section 8, of the West Virginia Constitution permits the creation of additional counties if a majority of citizens in the proposed new county vote for its creation and the new county has a minimum area of and a population of at least 6,000. Creation of a new county is prohibited if it would bring another county below these thresholds. Three counties (Greenbrier, Kanawha, and Randolph) have sufficient population (based on the 2020 United States Census) and land area to allow a new county to be split off. The remaining counties cannot be split, as either their land area would decrease to under 400 square miles, or their population would decrease to below 6,000.\nThe role of counties in local government had been minimized under the 1863 constitution, which vested most local government authority in a system of townships based on the New England model. The authors of the 1872 constitution chose to return to the system used in Virginia, in which each county was governed by a county court with combined authority for executive, legislative, and judicial functions of the county government. In 1880, West Virginia amended its constitution and replaced the county court system with an arrangement that divides county government powers between seven county offices, each of which is independently elected: the county commission, county clerk, circuit clerk, county sheriff, county assessor, county prosecuting attorney, and county surveyor of lands. Counties have only those powers that are expressly granted to them by the state Constitution or by state statute. These powers include, but are not limited to, maintaining the infrastructure of the state, funding libraries, maintaining jails and hospitals, and waste disposal. Reforming public education became a county function in 1933. In May 1933, a county unit plan was adopted. Under this plan, the state's 398 school districts were consolidated into the current 55 county school systems. This enabled public schools to be funded more economically and saved West Virginia millions of dollars.\nRandolph County is the largest by area at , and Hancock County is the smallest at . Kanawha County contributed land to the founding of 12 West Virginia counties and has the largest population (173,906 in 2024). Wirt County has the smallest population (4,924 in 2024). The oldest county is Hampshire, established in 1754, and the newest is Mingo, established in 1895. Spruce Knob, located in Pendleton County, is the state's highest point at . Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes, which are used by the United States government to identify counties uniquely, are five-digit numbers. For West Virginia, they start with 54 and end with the three-digit county code (for example, Barbour County has FIPS code 54001).

It was an unorganized part of the Northwest Territory until 1802 when all of the land from St. Louis north to the Canadian border was organized as St. Clair County. When Illinois was admitted to the union in 1818, Wisconsin became part of the Territory of Michigan and divided into two counties: Brown County in the northeast along Lake Michigan and Crawford County in the southwest along the Mississippi River. Iowa County was formed in 1829 from the Crawford County land south of the Wisconsin River. Brown County's southern portion was used to form Milwaukee County in 1834.

County officials include sheriffs, district attorneys, clerks, treasurers, coroners, surveyors, registers of deeds, and clerks of circuit court; these officers are elected for four-year terms. In most counties, elected coroners have been replaced by appointed medical examiners. State law permits counties to appoint a registered land surveyor in place of electing a surveyor.\nCounties in Wisconsin are governed by county boards, headed by a chairperson. Counties with a population of 500,000 or more must also have a county executive. Smaller counties may have either a county executive or a county administrator. As of 2011, 13 counties had elected county executives: Brown, Chippewa, Dane, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Milwaukee, Outagamie, Portage, Racine, Sawyer, Waukesha, and Winnebago. 23 had an appointed county administrator, 34 had an appointed administrative coordinator, and 2 had neither an executive nor an administrator.

The parvorder consists of chewing lice, which feed on the feathers and skin debris of birds. Many species of Ischnocera have evolved an elongated body shape. This allows them to conceal themselves within plumage to avoid being dislodged during preening or flight. Species in Ischnocera spend their entire lives living on a host, and attach themselves to hippoboscid flies to help move across individual birds. Ischnocera contains the large family Philopteridae, along with a few other minor families. Ischnocera are distributed globally, with around 3,800 species identified. The lice are very host-specific, and each species rarely parasitizes outside of their preferred bird species. Birds infested by ischnoceran species can experience discomfort and damage to reproductive systems.\nClassification.\nIschnocera previously included the mammalian parasitic lice Trichodectera. However, phylogenetic studies had found the grouping to be paraphyletic, specifically in regards to the two major families Philopteridae and Trichodectidae. In order to resolve this, de Moya \"et al.\" proposed retaining the majority of the species (including Philopteridae) within Ischnocera, and then moving Trichodectidae to its own grouping called Trichodectera.\nBelow is a cladogram showing the position of Ischnocera within Phthiraptera:\nCharacteristics.\nIschnocera lice are characterized by pulvinus-like mandibles thickened at the base, and two tarsal claws on each of their legs. Like all chewing lice, they are wingless with dorsoventrally flattened bodies. They are permanent ectoparasites that live all of their life on a host bird. They do not have ocelli, and their antennae is broken into 3 to 5 segments. The length of adults ranges from 0.3 to 12 millimeters depending on the species. Their head is typically broad and triangular shaped, with hook-like structures on the surface. The post-clypeus region is broad, with vertical stripes of thin cuticles. The head also contains repeating ridges, which is used to help strengthen the exoskeleton. Unlike their close taxonomic relative Amblycera, Ischnocera lack maxillary palps used to manipulate food. Their color is typically brown, but some species can be black or white, and the rostrum is elongated significantly. Their abdomens are usually divided into 8 segments, with the males characterized by having a large anterior plate, and the females having a continuous plate across their backs. Younger members of the Ischnocera's evolutionary lineage have paired structures called mycetomes. Species of Ischnocera are very host specific, with some birds receiving their classification based off the individual species of lice they are hosting.\nLife cycle.\nIschnocera lice can survive multiple weeks living off of their hosts. The life cycle consists of a simple metamorphosis, with three separate stages. Adult female lice lay eggs (also referred to as \"nits\") on the bodies of their host, where they will develop and hatch within 4 to 15 days. This is followed by the nymph stage for around 3 to 8 days, before finishing development in adults. After the lice are sufficiently fed, the males use their antennae to touch the heads of females to signal they are ready to mate. When the adult louse lays eggs, they typically do so in batches of 200 to 300 that are glued onto the feathers of their host to repeat the cycle. The glue is a cement-like material that is excreted from the louse's oviducts. Ischnocera are unable to move from the feathers to the skin of their hosts due to their specialized anatomy. In order to move across individual birds, Ischnocera \"hitchhike\" on hippoboscid flies that land on the current host. This is done to avoid competition from other lice by finding a new host to feed on.\nDistribution.\nIschnocera are distributed globally, with 3,800 different species across multiple continents. The majority of species identified reside in Europe, North America and the Neotropical realm. They are found in areas where birds suffer from malnutrition and overcrowding as well, due to the ease of moving across individuals.\nFeeding.\nIschnocera primarily feed on the feathers and skin debris of different species of birds. They are highly host specific, and usually do not deviate from their chosen species. Ischnocera do not consume the blood of its host, and are found within its feathers to avoid being dislodged. The lice have specific areas of the bird that they prefer to feed on, and typically do not move away from that area. Preferred areas of the birds are the head, neck and the croup. Birds in humid regions are more prone to being infested by Ischnocera, with the trend continuing regardless of the species. Species such as the \"Columbicola columbae\" feed mostly on the feather's barbules, as well as keratin-rich skin near the wing and tail feathers. The lice also tend to feed on oils secreted by the bird. Members of the Ischnocera contain endosymbiotic bacteria that aids in the digestion of the debris and feathers of their host.\nEffects.\nIschnocera can cause significant irritation and damage to the feathers of their hosts. Infestations can cause damage to egg production and fattening in poultry. The lice can cause preening and scratching in hosts, along with the loss of feathers, potentially resulting in bald spots. Birds with poor hygiene and weak immune systems are vulnerable to infestations due to a reduced ability to fight them. Bald patches in birds can result in decreased insulation and disease susceptibility. Self-grooming by the bird can help dislodge some of the infestation, although it is usually not enough to remove them entirely. The ability to remove the lice largely depends on the size of the bird's beak. If a bird has a damaged beak, it can become significantly more susceptible to infestations. Some birds use an oil they secrete from their uropygial gland and spread it across their bodies to make it more difficult for the lice to attach themselves. Flight performance, lifespan and sexual selection are negatively affected in infested birds. The host's metabolic rate and overall body mass are lowered during an infestation. The lice can serve as vectors carrying bacterial diseases to the birds. Infested birds show nervousness and discomfort, especially while they are nesting. Spraying the infested bird with pesticides can help kill the lice.\nFamilies.\nIschnocera conmprises the following families:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The lice are ectoparasites and spend their entire lives parasitizing their hosts. Amblycera tend to mostly feed on birds, and have specialized anatomy to assist in feeding. The lice undergo a three part process of metamorphosis and survive around thirty days after moulting into an adult. They rely on a combination of skin debris and blood for nutrients to sustain themselves. Amblycera are distributed globally, and are very host\u2013specific.\nClassification.\nAmblycera is currently classified as a parvorder, and it was named by Kellogg in 1896. Amblycera belongs to the infraorder Phthiraptera, which contains all lice, and is part of the larger order Psocodea, which also contains booklice, barklice and barkflies. Around 30% of all bird lice belong to Amblycera. A cladogram showing the position of Amblycera within Phthiraptera and Psocodea is shown below:\nCharacteristics.\nLike all chewing lice, Amblycera are permanent ectoparasites of their hosts, in that they spend their entire life living off of their individual host. Almost all Amblycera exclusively parasitize birds. In a section of their throat called the crop, Amblycera contain developed comb structures at the base. The structures are used to prevent feathers and other debris from progressing further into the digestive system. All species are wingless, and have a broad head with a pair of mandibles. The antennae are broken into three to five joints depending on the species, and they do not have any eyes. Anmblycera also have two small segmented claws at the end of their limbs. Species are small and dorsoventrally compressed, and are host specific in that a single species will parasitize on a single host. They can vary between one and five millimeters long, and range in color from white to black.\nLife cycle.\nAmblycera undergo a process of metamorphosis with three stages: Eggs (also known as \"nits\"), nymph and adult. The process usually takes around two to three weeks on average. Eggs are usually 0.8 millimeters long and oval shaped. The eggs also small holes called micropyles that allow for respiration. They range in color from yellow to white. The nymphs are also yellow to white in color, and undergo a three part process of moulting over the course of a week. After the third nymph moult the lice are considered adults, and will live up to thirty days off of their chosen host.\nDistribution.\nLike all lice, Amblycera are distributed in the same locations as their preferred host. The lice were likely spread during the original human colonization of various continents when host animals were brought along with them. The most diverse family, Menoponidae, has a high quantity of host-specific species is distributed across multiple continents. Amblycera have shown a positive correlation between the quantity and diversity of host birds in regions and the quantity and diversity of their own species.\nFeeding method.\nAmblycera feed almost entirely on birds. The lice depend on a combination of skin, hair, feathers and blood for food and nutrients. They use their mandibles in a horizontal scraping fashion to separate the skin from the bird so that it can be consumed. They also use their claws to grasp onto the feathers of the host in order to prevent the bird from shaking the lice off. They feed on both living and dead cells, as opposed to the closely related ischnoceran lice that feeds exclusively on dead material. While most ampblyceran lice use mandibles to feed, species in the genus \"Trochiloecete\" use two sharp stylets to pierce the skin and consume blood from nearby blood vessels. Amblycera lice tend to parasitize one host before quickly moving onto another one, without staying nearby one that is dead.\nEffects.\nThe lice by themselves are not particularly harmful, however depending on the quantity the presence of Amblycera on birds they can cause dermatitis and promote itchiness and scratching. In poultry, the lice can significantly reduce the rate of egg production. Birds with physically damaged bodies are vulnerable to Amblycera infestations due to the reduced ability to remove the lice by themselves. Birds infested with Amblycera also have a reduced ability to attract mating partners.\nFamilies.\nAmblycera contain six individual families of parasitic lice:\nNote: Abrocomophagidae is no longer considered valid, and has merged with Gyropidae.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Serial numbers are a deterrent against theft and counterfeit products, as they can be recorded, and stolen or otherwise irregular goods can be identified. Banknotes and other transferable documents of value bear serial numbers to assist in preventing counterfeiting and tracing stolen ones. \nThey are valuable in quality control, as once a defect is found in the production of a particular batch of product, the serial number will identify which units are affected. Some items with serial numbers are automobiles, firearms, electronics, and appliances.\nSmartphones and other smart devices.\n In smartphones, serial numbers are extended to the integrated components in addition to the electronic device as a whole, also known as serialization. This gives unique individual parts such as the screen, battery, chip and camera a separate serial number. This is queried by the software for proper release for use. This practice by manufacturers limits the \"serial number\" electronic devices.\nSerial numbers for intangible goods.\nSerial numbers may be used to identify individual physical or intangible objects; for example, computer software or the right to play an online multiplayer game. The purpose and application is different. A software serial number, otherwise called a product key, is usually not embedded in the software but is assigned to a specific user with a right to use the software. The software will function only if a potential user enters a valid product code. The vast majority of possible codes are rejected by the software. If an unauthorized user is found to be using the software, the legitimate user can be identified from the code. It is usually not impossible, however, for an unauthorized user to create a valid but unallocated code either by trying many possible codes, or reverse engineering the software; use of unallocated codes can be monitored if the software makes an Internet connection.\nOther uses of the term.\nThe term \"serial number\" is sometimes used for codes which do not identify a single instance of something. For example, the International Standard Serial Number or ISSN used on magazines, journals and other periodicals, an equivalent to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) applied to books, is assigned to each \"periodical\". It takes its name from the library science use of the word \"serial\" to mean a periodical.\nCertificates and certificate authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic, again not identifying a single instance of the content being protected.\nMilitary and government use.\nThe term \"serial number\" is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression \"service number\". In air forces, the serial number is used to uniquely identify individual aircraft and is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft fuselage, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft's fin/rudder(s). Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a \"tail number\".\nIn the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the individual serial takes the form of two letters followed by three digits, e.g., \"BT308\"\u2014the prototype Avro Lancaster, or \"XS903\"\u2014an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook. During the Second World War RAF aircraft that were secret or carrying secret equipment had \"/G\" (for \"Guard\") appended to the serial, denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., \"LZ548/G\"\u2014the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or \"ML926/G\"\u2014a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this scheme the RAF, and predecessor Royal Flying Corps (RFC), utilized a serial consisting of a letter followed by four figures, e.g., \"D8096\"\u2014a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or \"K5054\"\u2014the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The serial number follows the aircraft throughout its period of service.\nIn 2009, the U.S. FDA published draft guidance for the pharmaceutical industry to use serial numbers on prescription drug packages. This measure is intended to enhance the traceability of drugs and to help prevent counterfeiting. The FDA also required a serial number or lot number to be added to breast implants.\nSerial number arithmetic.\nSerial numbers are often used in network protocols. However, most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers, but not other recently allocated serial numbers. To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, \"Serial Number Arithmetic\", defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers.\nLollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such a description typically arises in the limit of vanishing viscosity, i.e., for an inviscid fluid and with no vorticity present in the flow.\nPotential flow describes the velocity field as the gradient of a scalar function: the velocity potential. As a result, a potential flow is characterized by an irrotational velocity field, which is a valid approximation for several applications. The irrotationality of a potential flow is due to the curl of the gradient of a scalar always being equal to zero.\nIn the case of an incompressible flow the velocity potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and potential theory is applicable. However, potential flows also have been used to describe compressible flows and Hele-Shaw flows. The potential flow approach occurs in the modeling of both stationary as well as nonstationary flows. \nApplications of potential flow include: the outer flow field for aerofoils, water waves, electroosmotic flow, and groundwater flow. For flows (or parts thereof) with strong vorticity effects, the potential flow approximation is not applicable. In flow regions where vorticity is known to be important, such as wakes and boundary layers, potential flow theory is not able to provide reasonable predictions of the flow. However, there are often large regions of a flow in which the assumption of irrotationality is valid, allowing the use of potential flow for various applications; these include flow around aircraft, groundwater flow, acoustics, water waves, and electroosmotic flow.\nDescription and characteristics.\nIn potential or irrotational flow, the vorticity vector field is zero, i.e., \nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the velocity field and formula_3 is the vorticity field. Like any vector field having zero curl, the velocity field can be expressed as the gradient of certain scalar, say formula_4 which is called the velocity potential, since the curl of the gradient is always zero. We therefore have\nformula_5\nThe velocity potential is not uniquely defined since one can add to it an arbitrary function of time, say formula_6, without affecting the relevant physical quantity which is formula_7. The non-uniqueness is usually removed by suitably selecting appropriate initial or boundary conditions satisfied by formula_8 and as such the procedure may vary from one problem to another.\nIn potential flow, the circulation formula_9 around any simply-connected contour formula_10 is zero. This can be shown using the Stokes theorem, \nformula_11\nwhere formula_12 is the line element on the contour and formula_13 is the area element of any surface bounded by the contour. In multiply-connected space (say, around a contour enclosing solid body in two dimensions or around a contour enclosing a torus in three-dimensions) or in the presence of concentrated vortices, (say, in the so-called irrotational vortices or point vortices, or in smoke rings), the circulation formula_9 need not be zero. In the former case, Stokes theorem cannot be applied and in the later case, formula_15 is non-zero within the region bounded by the contour. Around a contour encircling an infinitely long solid cylinder with which the contour loops formula_16 times, we have \nformula_17\nwhere formula_18 is a cyclic constant. This example belongs to a doubly-connected space. In an formula_19-tuply connected space, there are formula_20 such cyclic constants, namely, formula_21\nIncompressible flow.\nIn case of an incompressible flow \u2014 for instance of a liquid, or a gas at low Mach numbers; but not for sound waves \u2014 the velocity v has zero divergence:\nformula_22\nSubstituting here formula_23 shows that formula_8 satisfies the Laplace equation\nformula_25\nwhere \u22072 \n \u2207 \u22c5 \u2207 is the Laplace operator (sometimes also written \u0394). Since solutions of the Laplace equation are harmonic functions, every harmonic function represents a potential flow solution. As evident, in the incompressible case, the velocity field is determined completely from its kinematics: the assumptions of irrotationality and zero divergence of flow. Dynamics in connection with the momentum equations, only have to be applied afterwards, if one is interested in computing pressure field: for instance for flow around airfoils through the use of Bernoulli's principle.\nIn incompressible flows, contrary to common misconception, the potential flow indeed satisfies the full Navier\u2013Stokes equations, not just the Euler equations, because the viscous term \nformula_26\nis identically zero. It is the inability of the potential flow to satisfy the required boundary conditions, especially near solid boundaries, makes it invalid in representing the required flow field. If the potential flow satisfies the necessary conditions, then it is the required solution of the incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nIn two dimensions, with the help of the harmonic function formula_8 and its conjugate harmonic function formula_28 (stream function), incompressible potential flow reduces to a very simple system that is analyzed using complex analysis (see below).\nCompressible flow.\nSteady flow.\nPotential flow theory can also be used to model irrotational compressible flow. The derivation of the governing equation for formula_8 from Eulers equation is quite straightforward. The continuity and the (potential flow) momentum equations for steady flows are given by\nformula_30\nwhere the last equation follows from the fact that entropy is constant for a fluid particle and that square of the sound speed is formula_31. Eliminating formula_32 from the two governing equations results in\nformula_33\nThe incompressible version emerges in the limit formula_34. Substituting here formula_35 results in\nformula_36\nwhere formula_37 is expressed as a function of the velocity magnitude formula_38. For a polytropic gas, formula_39, where formula_40 is the specific heat ratio and formula_41 is the stagnation enthalpy. In two dimensions, the equation simplifies to \nformula_42\nValidity: As it stands, the equation is valid for any inviscid potential flows, irrespective of whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic (e.g. Prandtl\u2013Meyer flow). However in supersonic and also in transonic flows, shock waves can occur which can introduce entropy and vorticity into the flow making the flow rotational. Nevertheless, there are two cases for which potential flow prevails even in the presence of shock waves, which are explained from the (not necessarily potential) momentum equation written in the following form\nformula_43\nwhere formula_44 is the specific enthalpy, formula_15 is the vorticity field, formula_46 is the temperature and formula_47 is the specific entropy. Since in front of the leading shock wave, we have a potential flow, Bernoulli's equation shows that formula_48 is constant, which is also constant across the shock wave (Rankine\u2013Hugoniot conditions) and therefore we can write\nformula_49\n1) When the shock wave is of constant intensity, the entropy discontinuity across the shock wave is also constant i.e., formula_50 and therefore vorticity production is zero. Shock waves at the pointed leading edge of two-dimensional wedge or three-dimensional cone (Taylor\u2013Maccoll flow) has constant intensity. 2) For weak shock waves, the entropy jump across the shock wave is a third-order quantity in terms of shock wave strength and therefore formula_51 can be neglected. Shock waves in slender bodies lies nearly parallel to the body and they are weak.\nNearly parallel flows: When the flow is predominantly unidirectional with small deviations such as in flow past slender bodies, the full equation can be further simplified. Let formula_52 be the mainstream and consider small deviations from this velocity field. The corresponding velocity potential can be written as formula_53 where formula_54 characterizes the small departure from the uniform flow and satisfies the linearized version of the full equation. This is given by\nformula_55\nwhere formula_56 is the constant Mach number corresponding to the uniform flow. This equation is valid provided formula_57 is not close to unity. When formula_58 is small (transonic flow), we have the following nonlinear equation\nformula_59\nwhere formula_60 is the critical value of Landau derivative formula_61 and formula_62 is the specific volume. The transonic flow is completely characterized by the single parameter formula_60, which for polytropic gas takes the value formula_64. Under hodograph transformation, the transonic equation in two-dimensions becomes the Euler\u2013Tricomi equation.\nUnsteady flow.\nThe continuity and the (potential flow) momentum equations for unsteady flows are given by\nformula_65\nThe first integral of the (potential flow) momentum equation is given by \nformula_66\nwhere formula_6 is an arbitrary function. Without loss of generality, we can set formula_68 since formula_8 is not uniquely defined. Combining these equations, we obtain\nformula_70\nSubstituting here formula_35 results in\nformula_72\nNearly parallel flows: As in before, for nearly parallel flows, we can write (after introducing a recaled time formula_73)\nformula_74\nprovided the constant Mach number formula_57 is not close to unity. When formula_58 is small (transonic flow), we have the following nonlinear equation\nformula_77\nSound waves: In sound waves, the velocity magnitude formula_78 (or the Mach number) is very small, although the unsteady term is now comparable to the other leading terms in the equation. Thus neglecting all quadratic and higher-order terms and noting that in the same approximation, formula_79 is a constant (for example, in polytropic gas formula_80), we have\nformula_81\nwhich is a linear wave equation for the velocity potential \u03c6. Again the oscillatory part of the velocity vector v is related to the velocity potential by v \n \u2207\"\u03c6\", while as before \u0394 is the Laplace operator, and c is the average speed of sound in the homogeneous medium. Note that also the oscillatory parts of the pressure p and density \u03c1 each individually satisfy the wave equation, in this approximation.\nApplicability and limitations.\nPotential flow does not include all the characteristics of flows that are encountered in the real world. Potential flow theory cannot be applied for viscous internal flows, except for flows between closely spaced plates. Richard Feynman considered potential flow to be so unphysical that the only fluid to obey the assumptions was \"dry water\" (quoting John von Neumann). Incompressible potential flow also makes a number of invalid predictions, such as d'Alembert's paradox, which states that the drag on any object moving through an infinite fluid otherwise at rest is zero. More precisely, potential flow cannot account for the behaviour of flows that include a boundary layer. Nevertheless, understanding potential flow is important in many branches of fluid mechanics. In particular, simple potential flows (called elementary flows) such as the free vortex and the point source possess ready analytical solutions. These solutions can be superposed to create more complex flows satisfying a variety of boundary conditions. These flows correspond closely to real-life flows over the whole of fluid mechanics; in addition, many valuable insights arise when considering the deviation (often slight) between an observed flow and the corresponding potential flow. Potential flow finds many applications in fields such as aircraft design. For instance, in computational fluid dynamics, one technique is to couple a potential flow solution outside the boundary layer to a solution of the boundary layer equations inside the boundary layer. The absence of boundary layer effects means that any streamline can be replaced by a solid boundary with no change in the flow field, a technique used in many aerodynamic design approaches. Another technique would be the use of Riabouchinsky solids.\nAnalysis for two-dimensional incompressible flow.\nPotential flow in two dimensions is simple to analyze using conformal mapping, by the use of transformations of the complex plane. However, use of complex numbers is not required, as for example in the classical analysis of fluid flow past a cylinder. It is not possible to solve a potential flow using complex numbers in three dimensions.\nThe basic idea is to use a holomorphic (also called analytic) or meromorphic function f, which maps the physical domain (\"x\", \"y\") to the transformed domain (\"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\"). While x, y, \u03c6 and \u03c8 are all real valued, it is convenient to define the complex quantities\nformula_82\nNow, if we write the mapping f as\nformula_83\nThen, because f is a holomorphic or meromorphic function, it has to satisfy the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations\nformula_84\nThe velocity components (\"u\", \"v\"), in the (\"x\", \"y\") directions respectively, can be obtained directly from f by differentiating with respect to z. That is\nformula_85\nSo the velocity field v \n (\"u\", \"v\") is specified by\nformula_86\nBoth \u03c6 and \u03c8 then satisfy Laplace's equation:\nformula_87\nSo \u03c6 can be identified as the velocity potential and \u03c8 is called the stream function. Lines of constant \u03c8 are known as streamlines and lines of constant \u03c6 are known as equipotential lines (see equipotential surface).\nStreamlines and equipotential lines are orthogonal to each other, since\nformula_88\nThus the flow occurs along the lines of constant \u03c8 and at right angles to the lines of constant \u03c6.\n\u0394\"\u03c8\" \n 0 is also satisfied, this relation being equivalent to \u2207 \u00d7 v \n 0. So the flow is irrotational. The automatic condition \n then gives the incompressibility constraint \u2207 \u00b7 v \n 0.\nExamples of two-dimensional incompressible flows.\nAny differentiable function may be used for f. The examples that follow use a variety of elementary functions; special functions may also be used. Note that multi-valued functions such as the natural logarithm may be used, but attention must be confined to a single Riemann surface.\nPower laws.\nIn case the following power-law conformal map is applied, from \"z\" \n \"x\" + \"iy\" to \"w\" \n \"\u03c6\" + \"i\u03c8\":\nformula_89\nthen, writing z in polar coordinates as \"z\" \n \"x\" + \"iy\" \n \"rei\u03b8\", we have\nformula_90\nIn the figures to the right examples are given for several values of n. The black line is the boundary of the flow, while the darker blue lines are streamlines, and the lighter blue lines are equi-potential lines. Some interesting powers n are:\n : this corresponds with flow around a semi-infinite plate,\n : flow around a right corner,\n 1: a trivial case of uniform flow,\n 2: flow through a corner, or near a stagnation point, and\n \u22121: flow due to a source doublet\nThe constant A is a scaling parameter: its absolute value determines the scale, while its argument arg(\"A\") introduces a rotation (if non-zero).\n\n 1: uniform flow ==== \nIf \"w\" \n \"Az\"1, that is, a power law with \"n\" \n 1, the streamlines (i.e. lines of constant \u03c8) are a system of straight lines parallel to the x-axis. This is easiest to see by writing in terms of real and imaginary components:\nformula_91\nthus giving \"\u03c6\" \n \"Ax\" and \"\u03c8\" \n \"Ay\". This flow may be interpreted as uniform flow parallel to the x-axis.\n\n 2 ====\nIf \"n\" \n 2, then \"w\" \n \"Az\"2 and the streamline corresponding to a particular value of \u03c8 are those points satisfying\nformula_92\nwhich is a system of rectangular hyperbolae. This may be seen by again rewriting in terms of real and imaginary components. Noting that sin 2\"\u03b8\" \n[[Category:Pages which use a template in place of a magic word|TPotential flow]] 2 sin \"\u03b8\" cos \"\u03b8\" and rewriting sin \"\u03b8\" \n and cos \"\u03b8\" \n it is seen (on simplifying) that the streamlines are given by\nformula_93\nThe velocity field is given by \u2207\"\u03c6\", or\nformula_94\nIn fluid dynamics, the flowfield near the origin corresponds to a stagnation point. Note that the fluid at the origin is at rest (this follows on differentiation of \"f\"(z) \n \"z\"2 at \"z\" \n 0). The \"\u03c8\" \n 0 streamline is particularly interesting: it has two (or four) branches, following the coordinate axes, i.e. \"x\" \n 0 and \"y\" \n 0. As no fluid flows across the x-axis, it (the x-axis) may be treated as a solid boundary. It is thus possible to ignore the flow in the lower half-plane where \"y\" &lt; 0 and to focus on the flow in the upper halfplane. With this interpretation, the flow is that of a vertically directed jet impinging on a horizontal flat plate. The flow may also be interpreted as flow into a 90 degree corner if the regions specified by (say) \"x\", \"y\" &lt; 0 are ignored.\n\n 3 ====\nIf \"n\" \n 3, the resulting flow is a sort of hexagonal version of the \"n\" \n 2 case considered above. Streamlines are given by, \"\u03c8\" \n 3\"x\"2\"y\" \u2212 \"y\"3 and the flow in this case may be interpreted as flow into a 60\u00b0 corner.\n\n \u22121: doublet ==== \nIf \"n\" \n \u22121, the streamlines are given by\nformula_95\nThis is more easily interpreted in terms of real and imaginary components:\nformula_96\nThus the streamlines are circles that are tangent to the x-axis at the origin. The circles in the upper half-plane thus flow clockwise, those in the lower half-plane flow anticlockwise. Note that the velocity components are proportional to \"r\"\u22122; and their values at the origin is infinite. This flow pattern is usually referred to as a doublet, or dipole, and can be interpreted as the combination of a source-sink pair of infinite strength kept an infinitesimally small distance apart. The velocity field is given by\nformula_97\nor in polar coordinates:\nformula_98\n\n \u22122: quadrupole ====\nIf \"n\" \n \u22122, the streamlines are given by\nformula_99\nThis is the flow field associated with a quadrupole.\nLine source and sink.\nA line source or sink of strength formula_100 (formula_101 for source and formula_102 for sink) is given by the potential\nformula_103\nwhere formula_100 in fact is the volume flux per unit length across a surface enclosing the source or sink. The velocity field in polar coordinates are\nformula_105\ni.e., a purely radial flow.\nLine vortex.\nA line vortex of strength formula_9 is given by\nformula_107\nwhere formula_9 is the circulation around any simple closed contour enclosing the vortex. The velocity field in polar coordinates are\nformula_109\ni.e., a purely azimuthal flow.\nAnalysis for three-dimensional incompressible flows.\nFor three-dimensional flows, complex potential cannot be obtained.\nPoint source and sink.\nThe velocity potential of a point source or sink of strength formula_100 (formula_101 for source and formula_102 for sink) in spherical polar coordinates is given by\nformula_113\nwhere formula_100 in fact is the volume flux across a closed surface enclosing the source or sink. The velocity field in spherical polar coordinates are\nformula_115\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although many people believe in psychic abilities, the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers, and describes the practice as pseudoscience.\nPsychics encompass people in a variety of roles. Some are theatrical performers, such as stage magicians, who use various techniques, e.g. prestidigitation, cold reading, and hot reading, to produce the appearance of such abilities for entertainment purposes. A large industry and network exist whereby people advertised as psychics provide advice and counsel to clients. Some famous psychics include Edgar Cayce, Ingo Swann, Peter Hurkos, Janet Lee, Miss Cleo, John Edward, Sylvia Browne, and Tyler Henry. Psychic powers are asserted by psychic detectives and in practices such as psychic archaeology and even psychic surgery.\nCritics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion. In 1988, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a report on the subject, which concluded that there is \"no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena\". In 2012, a study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition. However, efforts to replicate the results, which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it, \"failed to produce significant effects\", and thus did \"not support the existence of psychic ability\" of this kind.\nPsychics are sometimes featured in science fiction and fantasy fiction. Examples of fiction featuring characters with psychic powers include the \"Star Wars\" franchise, which features \"Force-sensitive\" beings who can see into the future and move objects telekinetically, along with \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and some of the works of Stephen King, amongst many others.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"psychic\" is derived from the Greek word \"psychikos\" (\"of the mind\" or \"mental\"), and refers in part to the human mind or psyche (ex. \"psychic turmoil\"). The Greek word also means \"soul\". In Greek mythology, the maiden Psyche was the deification of the human soul. The word derivation of the Latin \"ps\u0233ch\u0113\" is from the Greek \"ps\u0233ch\u1e17\", literally \"breath\", derivative of \"ps\u0233\u0301chein\", to breathe or to blow (hence, to live).\nFrench astronomer and spiritualist Camille Flammarion is credited as having first used the word psychic, while it was later introduced to the English language by Edward William Cox in the 1870s.\nEarly seers and prophets.\nElaborate systems of divination and fortune-telling date back to ancient times. Perhaps the most widely known system of early civilization fortune-telling was astrology, where practitioners believed the relative positions of celestial bodies could lend insight into people's lives and even predict their future circumstances. Some fortune-tellers were said to be able to make predictions without the use of these elaborate systems (or in conjunction with them), through some sort of direct apprehension or vision of the future. These people were known as seers or prophets, and in later times as clairvoyants (French word meaning \"clear sight\" or \"clear seeing\") and psychics.\nSeers formed a functionary role in early civilization, often serving as advisors, priests, and judges. A number of examples are included in biblical accounts. The book of 1 Samuel (Chapter 9) illustrates one such functionary task when Samuel is asked to find the donkeys of the future king Saul. The role of prophet appeared perennially in ancient cultures. In Egypt, the priests of the sun deity Ra at Memphis acted as seers. In ancient Assyria seers were referred to as \"nabu\", meaning \"to call\" or \"announce\".\nThe Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC. It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice. The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration.\nOne of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503\u20131566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book \"Les Proph\u00e9ties\", the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies, as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles \u2013 all undated.\nNostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.\nEnglishwoman Mother Shipton demonstrated psychic abilities from her youth and foresaw historical events in the 16th century. In addition to the belief that some historical figures were endowed with a predisposition to psychic experiences, some psychic abilities were thought to be available to everyone on occasion. For example, the belief in prophetic dreams was common and persistent in many ancient cultures.\nNineteenth-century progression.\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Modern Spiritualism became prominent in the United States and the United Kingdom. The movement's distinguishing feature was the belief that the spirits of the dead could be contacted by mediums to lend insight to the living. The movement was fueled in part by anecdotes of psychic powers. One such person believed to have extraordinary abilities was Daniel Dunglas Home, who gained fame during the Victorian period for his reported ability to levitate to various heights and speak to the dead.\nAs the Spiritualist movement grew, other comparable groups arose, including the Theosophical Society, which was co-founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky (1831\u20131891). Theosophy coupled spiritualist elements with Eastern mysticism and was influential in the early 20th century, later influencing the New Age movement during the 1970s. Blavatsky herself claimed numerous psychic powers.\nLate twentieth century.\nBy the late twentieth century, psychics were commonly associated with New Age culture. Psychic readings and advertising for psychics were common from the 1960s on, as readings were offered for a fee and given in settings such as over the phone, in a home, or at psychic fairs.\nPopular culture.\nBelief in psychic abilities.\nIn a 1990 survey of members of the National Academy of Sciences, only 2% of the respondents thought that extrasensory perception had been scientifically demonstrated, with another 2% thinking that the phenomena happened sometimes. Asked about research in the field, 22% thought that it should be discouraged, 63% that it should be allowed but not encouraged, and 10% that it should be encouraged; neuroscientists were the most hostile to parapsychology of all the specialties.\nA survey of the beliefs of the general United States population about paranormal topics was conducted by The Gallup Organization in 2005. The survey found that 41 percent of those polled believed in extrasensory perception and 26 percent believed in clairvoyance. 31 percent of those surveyed indicated that they believe in telepathy or psychic communication.\nA poll of 439 college students conducted in 2006 by researchers Bryan Farha of Oklahoma City University and Gary Steward of University of Central Oklahoma, suggested that college seniors and graduate students were more likely to believe in psychic phenomena than college freshmen. Twenty-three percent of college freshmen expressed a belief in paranormal ideas. The percentage was greater among college seniors (31%) and graduate students (34%). The poll showed lower belief in psychic phenomena among science students than social science and education students.\nSome people also believe that anyone can have psychic abilities which can be activated or enhanced through the study and practice of various disciplines and techniques such as meditation and divination, with a number of books and websites being dedicated to instruction in these methods. Another popular belief is that psychic ability is hereditary, with a psychic parent passing their abilities on to their children.\nScience fiction.\nPsychic abilities are common in science fiction, often under the term \"psionics\". They may be depicted as innate and heritable, as in Alfred Bester's \"The Demolished Man\", A. E. van Vogt's \"Slan\", Anne McCaffrey's Talents universe series or setting, and the television series \"Babylon 5\". Another recurring trope is the conveyance of psychic power through psychoactive drugs, as in the \"Dune\" novels and indirectly in the \"Scanners\" films, as well as the ghosts in the \"StarCraft\" franchise. Somewhat differently, in Madeleine L'Engle's \"A Wind in the Door\" and Robert A. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", psychic abilities may be achieved by any human who learns the proper mental discipline, known as \"kything\" in the former work. Popular movies include \"The Initiation of Sarah\". Psychic characters are also common in superhero comics, for instance Jean Grey, Professor X and Emma Frost as well as many others from the Marvel Comics' X-Men. More characters include the characters Raven Baxter and Booker Baxter from the Disney Channel Original Series \"That's So Raven\" and its spin-off \"Raven's Home\". The Disney Channel Original Series \"\" features recurring characters Cara and Sara, who are twin psychics claimed to be the descendants of the Oracle of Delphi, their visions also contrast their personalities (Cara is a Goth that sees only positive visions, while Sara is always in a good mood despite only seeing negative visions).\nCriticism and research.\n Parapsychological research has attempted to use random number generators to test for psychokinesis, mild sensory deprivation in the Ganzfeld experiment to test for extrasensory perception, and research trials conducted under contract by the U.S. government to investigate remote viewing. Critics such as Ed J. Gracely say that this evidence is not sufficient for acceptance, partly because the intrinsic probability of psychic phenomena is very small.\nCritics such as Ray Hyman and the National Science Foundation suggest that parapsychology has methodological flaws that can explain the experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience. This has largely been due to a lack of replication of results by independent experimenters.\nThe evidence presented for psychic phenomena is not sufficiently verified for scientific acceptance, and there exist many non-paranormal alternative explanations for claimed instances of psychic events. Parapsychologists, who generally believe that there is some evidence for psychic ability, disagree with critics who believe that no psychic ability exists and that many of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena such as mediumism, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading, hot reading, or even self-delusion. Cold reading techniques would include psychics using flattery, intentionally making descriptions, statements or predictions about a person vague and ambiguous, and surreptitiously moving on to another prediction when the psychic deems the audience to be non-responsive. Magicians such as James Randi, Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, but they present physical and psychological explanations as opposed to paranormal ones.\nIn January 2008 the results of a study using neuroimaging were published. To provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions, the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had participants who are biologically or emotionally related, such as twins. The experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition occurred, but despite this, no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic stimuli and non-psychic stimuli, while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on patterns of brain activation. The researchers concluded that \"These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena.\" James Alcock had cautioned the researchers against the wording of said statement.\nA detailed study of Sylvia Browne predictions about missing persons and murder cases found that despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, \"Browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case\". Concerning the television psychics, James Underdown states that testing psychics in a studio setting is difficult as there are too many areas to control: the psychic could be getting help from anyone on the set. The editor controls everything; they can make a psychic look superior or ridiculous depending on direction from the producer. In an Independent Investigations Group \"expos\u00e9\" of John Edward and James Van Praagh they discovered that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were \"substantially different in the accuracy. They're getting rid of the wrong guesses... Once you pull back the curtain and see how it's done, it's not impressive at all.\"\nRichard Saunders, Chief Investigator for the Australian Skeptics, and producer and presenter of \"The Skeptic Zone\" podcast sought to answer the question \"Can self-proclaimed psychics predict unlikely future events with any greater accuracy than chance?\" To answer that question he launched \"The Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project\". Over the course of 12 years, Saunders and then Saunders and his international team of skeptics - Michelle Bijkersma, Kelly Burke, Susan Gerbic, Adrienne Hill, Louis Hillman, Wendy Hughes, Paula Lauterbach, Dr. Angie Mattke, Rob Palmer, and Leonard Tramiel - searched through Australian published media for individuals making psychic or otherwise paranormal predictions.\nThe goal of the Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project was to collect and then vet the accuracy of every published psychic prediction in Australia since the year 2000. The team analyzed over 3800 predictions made by 207 psychics over the years 2000 to 2020. While a few of the psychic predictions were about events outside of Australia, the predictions primarily focused on celebrities, scandals, natural disasters, weather patterns, sports, and real estate trends.\nThe results of the analysis of the predictions found that psychics were correct 11% of the time, wrong 35% of the time, and that some predictions were too vague to characterize (19%) or the predicted outcome was so obvious it was to be expected (15%). Two percent of the predictions were unable to be categorized.\nThe main conclusions of the Great Australian Psychic Prediction Project were: \"Psychics are appallingly bad at predicting future events.\" \"Most predictions were too vague, expected, or simply wrong.\" \"Most of what happens is not predicted, and most of what is predicted does not happen.\"\nThe Project confirmed that even when considering the margin of error, it is difficult to come to any other conclusion except that people who claim to see into the future cannot do so with a rate of success better than that of educated guesswork, chance, or luck.\nPsychic fraud.\nIn an article reported by Pat Foran in CTV News-Toronto, an Ontario woman, known as Marie Jean, depressed after having to sell her home, began seeing a psychic who went by the name of Maha Dev. Marie Jean reported that Dev claimed she was surrounded by \"evil spirits\" and that \"(her) life could be in danger and (her) sons could lose their lives.\" The initial payment requested was $10,000 to remove the spirits, but in subsequent visits Dev indicated that the spirits were \"too strong\" and more money was needed. In total, the woman paid $46,000 before deciding she had been \"duped.\" After Marie Jean reported the incident to CTV News, CTV News contacted the psychic. While Dev did not admit to knowing the woman, the money was refunded in full the next day.\nFalling for a psychic scam can result in a loss of one's entire life savings. In an example given in an article by Rob Palmer a woman gave a psychic $41,642 over a period of 10 weeks. The woman had contacted Palmer for help, who put her in contact with Bob Nygaard, a private investigator who specializes in psychic fraud cases. Palmer had previously written articles about Nygaard and the work he was doing.\nIt is apparently difficult to get cases of psychic fraud prosecuted as a crime. Palmer states \"when someone reports to law enforcement that they are a victim of this type of fraud, they are often turned away and told it is a civil matter.\" Palmer goes on to discuss Thomas John and other famous \"psychics\" who were proven to be frauds. Investigator Ben Radford states that \"scammers use various psychological principles to ensnare their prey\". Their state of mind, belief in psychic abilities, unhappiness with something happening in their lives and looking for answers. The psychic will instruct the client not to tell their friends or family as they know they may be warned away from the psychic.\nWith curse removal, the psychic may say that the magic will not work or get worse if they do tell anyone about their involvement with the psychic. The con games from psychics, according to Radford, can \"play out over the course of weeks, months, or even years.\" The psychic is playing the long game and looking to extract as much money as possible. Radford claims that when a victim realizes they have been scammed, often they are too embarrassed to come forward.\nSkeptical activist Susan Gerbic has summarized a number of techniques, which she says are used by psychics to create their effects.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "58324", "revid": "397431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58324", "title": "Mao (card game)", "text": "Card game\nMao (or Mau) is a card game of the shedding family. The aim is to get rid of all of the cards in hand without breaking certain unspoken rules which tend to vary by venue. The game is from a subset of the Stops family and is similar in structure to the card game Uno or Crazy Eights.\nThe game forbids its players from explaining the rules, and new players are often informed that \"the only rule you may be told is this one\". The ultimate goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in their hand. Specifics are discovered through trial and error. A player who breaks a rule is penalized by being given an additional card from the deck. The person giving the penalty must state what the incorrect action was, without explaining the rule that was broken.\nThere are many variants of Mao in existence. While beginners sometimes assume that the dealer (sometimes called the \"Chairman\", the \"Mao\" or the \"Grand Master\") and other experienced players are simply making up possibly inconsistent rules (as in the games Mornington Crescent or Fizbin), the rules of Mao are consistent within each game and can be followed correctly.\nHistory.\nMao is most likely descended from the German game Mau Mau. It may have influenced the game Eleusis, which was published in Martin Gardner's column in \"Scientific American\" in June 1959. Both of these games share similar principles of inductive reasoning.\nOther inductive games in which not all players know the rules include Penultima and Zendo; however, the secret rules in those games are made up at the start of play and disclosed at the end of each round, and the scope and subject matter of Eleusis, Penultima or Zendo rules may be more explicit and closely circumscribed.\nMao's name and rules are a reference to Chairman Mao Zedong's rule over China. The rules not being explained are an allusion to the laws in China at the time being in constant flux, leading to many people being arrested for laws they did not know existed.\nRules.\nPart of the traditional experience of Mao is a new player being forced to learn some or all of the rules of the game through observation and trial and error. Thus new players are not presented with a list of rules, as part of the game is to discover the rules through gameplay.\nThe exact set of rules divulged to new players varies between groups of players: some groups will say \"the only rule I can tell you is this one\", others will reveal the goal of eliminating cards, and some might outline the basic rules and, in most cases, no rules are revealed at all. However much information is revealed, the players will explain that they are not allowed to reveal any more, and that the new player must deduce the full rules during play.\nMao rules can vary widely between different groups with no individual set of rules being canonical.\nRules of play.\nEach player is dealt an initial hand of the same number of cards; the exact number of cards dealt varies, but is generally either three or seven. The size of the deck also varies; it is good to have approximately one 52-card deck for every two or three players, but missing or extra cards are not important to gameplay. Two or more combined decks is common; matching card backs is not important. Once the cards are dealt, the remaining cards are placed face down in a stack in the middle of the table, and the top card from the stack is turned over and placed next to it. The dealer may then say \"this game of Mao has officially begun\", \"the game of Mao begins now\", \"Mao is a game of rules\" or a variant thereof. Play commences with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise. Many variants penalize players for touching or looking at their cards before the game begins, or before the dealer looks at their own cards.\nA player may play any card from their hand matching the value or the suit of the top card currently face-up on the table. The card played must be placed on top of this card, and the next player will have to play a card that matches the new one. If the player has no cards they can play, they must instead draw a new card from the top of the stack and, in some variants, say something such as \"pass\", \"penalty card\" or knock on the table to indicate inability to play a card.\nRules vary widely between variants. Some common rules include:\nVariant rules.\nAs might be expected in a game where the rules are unknown to many of the players, a wide variety of rulesets have developed.\nThe rules are typically changed between games, either at the beginning or with each successive game. Many times, this is simply that the winner of the last game is allowed to construct their own rule. This new rule is made known to the dealer or not, depending on the game, though in many varieties it is required for the dealer to know the rule in order to confirm its use and to enforce it. Often the winner of the last game is also made the new dealer.\nIn another variant, players abandon all normal rules and have each player make up a rule of their own at the very beginning of the game. This variant is known as \"Dutch Mao\", or \"The People's Democratic Dictatorship\", and probably several other names. It has no restrictions on what cards to play (other than those made by the players) and can get very confusing when rules conflict.\nSpeaking.\nMany of the rules of Mao involve speech. Mostly this means that the right thing must be said at the right time. Saying the wrong thing, or speaking at the wrong time, will usually incur a penalty.\nIn most variants of Mao, no unnecessary speech is allowed, and one may only speak when required to do so by the rules. For example, if one plays a 6 of spades (with the declaring spades rule active), one is required to say \"six of spades\" and will be penalized for not doing so. But if one says, \"six of spades, I didn't forget this time\" one will be penalized for the additional unnecessary speech. A different but common way to say this is \"excessive verbosity\".\nAny player (or, in some variations, only the dealer) may at any time announce \"point of order\", which is a signal for all players to put down their cards while discussion takes place.\nIt may be required to thank the dealer for each penalty card. Usually a player is given a reasonable amount of time to say \"thank you\" before being penalized. Failure to say \"thank you\" after a penalty card will usually result in another penalty card. One \"thank you\" will usually cover for all occurrences where it was required.\nSome variants require the player to announce when they have only one card left in their hand. This can be with the statement of \"last card\", \"zin\", \"one card left\" or \"Mao\" itself (similar to Uno). If a player fails to announce their last card, they receive a penalty card. In some versions, they continue to receive penalty cards until they announce their last card. At this point, because it is not their last card anymore, they are given three additional penalty cards in quick succession for \"lying, cheating, theft\".\nUpon playing their last card, a player must call out \"Mao\", \"game over\" or some other similar phrase to win. Should a player forget to say \"Mao\", or call it incorrectly, they are penalized. Stacking penalties at this point can cause much grief to a player who has gleefully placed their last card down and proclaimed \"Mao\", only to discover that they have broken some rule.\nMany variants prohibit swearing, whereas other variants consider swearing to be an exception to the prohibition on excessive verbosity. \nIn some variants, playing a king requires the player to say \"hail to the chairman\" (alluding to Chairman Mao) or \"all hail the chief\", and playing a queen requires the player to say \"hail to the chairwoman\", \"hail the chairman's wife\", \"all hail the chair lady\", or \"all hail her Mighty Majesty the Queen of Spades\". Then the other players are sometimes required to say \"all hail\". In other variants, playing a king requires the player to say \"The king has entered the building.\" When the next player plays a card, they must say \"The king has left the building.\"\nSome versions of the game will require a player to tell the next player \"have a nice day\" upon playing a seven. For instance, if the next person was John, the player would say \"have a nice day John\". Not doing so would result in a penalty card.\nIn some variants, specific cards are given a name that is to be said instead of the real name of the card. For example, upon playing the nine of diamonds or a joker, a player might say \"that's the badger!\" Failure to say this would result in a penalty card.\nPoints of order.\nAny player (or, in some variations, only the dealer) may at any time announce \"point of order\" (could also be \"court of law\", \"point of information\", \"point of interest\", \"pevis\", or \"coffee break\"), which is a signal for all players to put down their cards, while discussion takes place. A common abbreviation is \"P of O\". This time period basically is an intermission to game play and often comes with its own set of rules. Some versions penalize for abbreviating \"point of order\" to \"P of O\", which often confuses new players into thinking only the dealer or chairman is permitted to call a point of order. Most versions penalize players for touching their cards (including failing to put them down in a timely manner) during a point of order.\nThe objective of a point of order is to clarify uncertain aspects of gameplay: particularly to allow disputes over penalties to be resolved. A point of order may also be used to accommodate out-of-game necessities such as eating, shuffling the discard pile to form a new draw pile, etc. Some variants may impose restrictions or penalties on a player's activities during a point of order:\nThe point of order ends when any player (or, depending on local rules, only the dealer, or only the player that called point of order) announces \"end point of order\", \"point taken\", \"point of disorder\", or \"pick your cards up\", at which point the cards are picked back up and play resumes.\nPenalties.\nThe normal penalty for any offence in Mao is one card per offence, though as previously stated, offences are consecutively applied, making some offences harsher than others.\nThere is usually a time limit of approximately 5 to 10 seconds for each turn. If exceeded, the player gets a penalty card for delay of game or late play and either loses their turn or gets another penalty every five seconds thereafter to either comply with any violated rules, or play a card. Ruthless players who are familiar with the rules sometimes exploit this rule to confuse new players who are unfamiliar with game mechanics that change the order of play: for example, players might look expectantly at a particular player other than the one whose turn it is as if waiting for them to play, then penalizing that player for playing out of turn if they actually played, then immediately penalizing the player whose turn it actually is for delay of game.\nFor each penalty, unless the rules have been changed appropriately, the penalty card is given with the declaration of the rule violated.\nIn most cases, when a penalty is called, one card is given to the offender. If the call was incorrect, the caller of a penalty can be given the card back with a reason of \"bad call\" or \"frivolous card-giving\".\nAdding rules.\nIn many variants an additional rule is silently and secretly added to the game with each round. It is customary for a player (often the winner of the previous round, sometimes the next person to deal) to add one new rule to the game. In a game with only one round, players who have gotten rid of all their cards may make a rule for those still in the game. Sometimes a new rule is explained to one other player (sometimes the dealer, sometimes a runner-up winner of the round), both to ensure consistency of the rule and consistency of its enforcement. Any new rules are allowed, but it must not be biased towards a player. \nThere may also be additional rules that are already in effect at the beginning of the game, just to get things moving, and these rules may be known to all players, or perhaps only to the dealer. After many rounds, many new rules will accumulate. Naturally, only the person who created the rule will initially know what it is. The rules will vary from group to group, and from game to game, but most rules fall under one of the following four categories.\nThe triggering events in the example above can be anything. They might include playing a specific card (the ace of spades) or a specific type of card (any red three), but triggering conditions can become as complicated as their creator wishes, such as when someone plays the fourth card of the same suit or playing an odd-numbered card on top of an even-numbered card.\nTo create a rule, one could pick a triggering condition, and then an action and/or game effect. The spirit of the rule is generally something in good fun; while rules that unfairly sway the game in favor of one player or to the detriment of one specific player are quite easy to concoct (\"Every time James plays a ten, he gets a penalty of ten cards\"), they are also generally frowned upon as unsportsmanlike. Rarely do rules have a penalty of more than one card, but certain rules have a large penalty attached to them, usually the result of a cumulative rule.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are many different attempts to define what constitutes as vigilantism and how can it be distinguished from acceptable forms of helping law enforcement without any legal authority, such as citizen's arrest and private investigation.\nAccording to political scientist Regina Bateson, vigilantism is \"the extralegal prevention, investigation, or punishment of offenses.\" The definition has three components:\nOther scholars have defined \"collective vigilantism\" as \"group violence to punish perceived offenses to a community.\"\nLes Johnston argues that vigilantism has six necessary components: \nHistory.\nVigilantism and the vigilante ethos existed long before the word \"vigilante\" was introduced into the English language. There are conceptual parallels between the medieval aristocratic custom of private war or vendetta and the modern vigilante philosophy.\nElements of the concept of vigilantism can be found in the biblical account in Genesis 34 of the abduction and rape (or, by some interpretations, seduction) of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, in the Canaanite city of Shechem by the eponymous son of the ruler, and the violent reaction of her brothers Simeon and Levi, who slew all of the males of the city in revenge, rescued their sister and plundered Shechem. When Jacob protested that their actions might bring trouble upon him and his family, the brothers replied \"Should he [i.e., Shechem] treat our sister as a harlot?\"\nIn the Western literary and cultural tradition, characteristics of vigilantism have often been vested in folkloric heroes and outlaws (e.g., Robin Hood).\nDuring medieval times, punishment of felons was sometimes exercised by such secret societies as the courts of the Vehm (cf. the medieval Sardinian \"Gamurra\" later become \"Barracelli\", the Sicilian Vendicatori and the Beati Paoli), a type of early vigilante organization, which became extremely powerful in Westphalian Germany during the 15th century.\nVigilantism in Mexico.\nIn some regions of Mexico, mainly in the state of Michoacan, people affected by criminal groups like Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, created vigilante groups called Grupos de autodefensa comunitaria in 2013. Their most notorious leader Hip\u00f3lito Mora, was assassinated in 2023.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its steep, symmetrical cone rises roughly inland from the Bering Sea. The volcano is part of the Volcanoes of Kamchatka UNESCO World Heritage Site. Klyuchevskaya Sopka is ranked 15th in the world by topographic isolation.\nKlyuchevskaya appeared 7,000 years ago. Its first recorded eruption occurred in 1697, and it has been almost continuously active ever since, as have many of its neighboring volcanoes. It was first climbed in 1788 by Daniel Gauss and two other members of the Billings Expedition. No other ascents were recorded until 1931, when several climbers were killed by flying lava on the descent. As similar dangers still exist today, few ascents are made.\nEruptions.\nKlyuchevskaya Sopka has erupted 110 times during the Holocene Epoch.\nEruptions in the 2000s.\n2007: Beginning in early January, Klyuchevskaya Sopka began another eruption cycle. Students from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and scientists of the Alaska Volcano Observatory traveled to Kamchatka in the spring to monitor the eruption. On 28 June, the volcano began to experience the largest explosions so far recorded in this eruption cycle. An ash plume from the eruption reached a height of before drifting eastward, disrupting air traffic between the United States and Asia and causing ashfalls on Alaska's Unimak Island.\nEruptions in the 2010s.\n2010: As early as 27 February, gas plumes had erupted from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, reaching elevations of . During the first week of March, both explosive ash eruptions and effusive lava eruptions occurred until 9 March; the ash cloud was reported to have reached an elevation of . As well, significant thermal anomalies have been reported, and gas-steam plumes extended roughly to the north-east from the volcano beginning on 3 March.\n2012: On 15 October, the volcano had a weak eruption that stopped the following day. A weak thermal eruption occurred on 29 November, then stopped again which can be attributable to the larger eruption occurring at neighbouring volcano Tolbachik due to their shared magma chamber.\n All of its neighboring volcanoes Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Shiveluch, and in particular Tolbachik erupted more actively and continuously, taking a major magma supply load off of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.\nJanuary 2013: On 25 January, the volcano had a weak Strombolian eruption that stopped the following day. During January, all volcanoes in the eastern part of Kamchatka\u2014Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Klyuchevskaya Sopka, Shiveluch, and Tolbachik\u2014erupted, with the exception of Kamen.\nAugust 2013: On 15 August, the volcano had another weak Strombolian eruption with some slight lava flow that put on an excellent fireworks display before stopping on 21 August 2013, when Gorely Volcano woke up and started erupting again in relief of Klyuchevskaya Sopka.\nOctober 2013: On 12 October, Klyuchevskaya Sopka had another three days of on-and-off eruptions with anomalies and a short ash plume, possibly indicating Strombolian and weak Vulcanian activity. An explosion from a new cinder cone low on Kliuchevskoi's southwest flank occurred on 12 October. An ash plume rose to altitudes of , and drifted eastward. The eruptions weakened and paused by 16 October 2013.\nNovember/December 2013: On 19 November, a strong explosion occurred, and observers reported that ash plumes rose to altitudes of and drifted southeast. The Aviation Color Code was raised to Red. Later that day, the altitudes of the ash plumes were lower and the eruptions weakened and stopped again. On 7 December, activity at Kliuchevskoi significantly increased, having continued during 29 November \u2013 7 December, prompting KVERT to raise the Alert Level to Red. Ash plumes rose to altitudes of above sea level and drifted more than northeast and over east. According to a news article, a warning to aircraft was issued for the area around the volcanoes. Video showed gas-and-steam activity, and satellite images detected a daily weak thermal anomaly. On 9 December, the Alert Level was lowered to Green when the eruptions abruptly stopped.\n2015: On 2 January, after a one-year period of inactivity, the volcano had a Strombolian eruption which stopped on 16 January. Minor eruptions resumed on 10 March and stopped on 24 March. On 27 August, the volcano had another Strombolian eruption which ended 16 hours later.\n2019: Kluchevskaya Sopka saw renewed eruptive activity beginning in 2019. On 25 October, the volcano had another weak Strombolian eruption which ended some 30 hours later.\nEruptions in the 2020s.\n2020: The volcano erupted on 9 December.\n2022: An eruption started on 20 November.\n2023: An eruption started on 22 June. The June eruption follows nearby eruptions on 11 April in other volcanoes in the area. A significant eruptive event occurred as part of ongoing activity on 1 November, sending ash as high as above sea level and causing flight delays as far away as Vancouver, Canada, on 4\u20135 November.\n2025: An eruption occurred on 30 July, shortly after a large earthquake in Kamchatka. The eruption was not directly caused by the earthquake; activity at the volcano had been observed over the preceding days.\n2022 climbing accidents.\nIn September 2022, nine people died while climbing Kluchevskaya Sopka. They were part of a 12-strong group of Russian nationals, which included two guides. Five climbers were killed after a fall at about 4,000 meters. Another four, including a guide, died on the mountainside afterwards. A rescue helicopter managed to land at 1,663 meters at the fourth attempt, bringing rescuers who faced a two-day climb to reach a volcanologists' hut at 3,300 meters where the three survivors were sheltering.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1790 to 1794 he commanded a marine expedition that searched for a Northeast Passage and explored the coasts of Alaska and Siberia. Between 1797 and 1798 he conducted a hydrographic survey of the Black Sea.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nSources provide conflicting details regarding the early life of Joseph Billings. British records show he was born in 1758 at Turnham Green, Middlesex. Parish church registers confirm his birth on 6 September 1758, the son of Thomas and Mary Billing. However, according to Russian sources, Billings told associates he was born in Yarmouth, the son of a fisherman of the same name. He worked on coal ships from an early age and later was apprenticed to a watchmaker. His Russian service record, signed by him, indicates he was born in 1761. \nRoyal Navy Service.\nIn 1776, Billings enlisted in the Royal Navy as an able seaman and joined the third and final voyage of James Cook. Billings became an astronomer's assistant, initially aboard , and then transferring to in September 1779. The expedition explored the North Pacific, visiting Nootka Sound, Alaska, the Bering Sea, and the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east coast of Russia. When they returned to England in October 1780, Billings was promoted to warrant officer.\nFollowing his return, Billings served aboard the \"Conquestador\" and the \"Crocodile\". In July 1782 he became master's mate on the \"Resistance\", serving Captain James King, who had also served on Cook's last voyage. Billings frequently accompanied King on visits to Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society. He was imprisoned in 1782 for a debt and the \"Resistance\" sailed to the West Indies without him. With Banks\u2019 help, he was released from prison on 14 January 1783.\nIn 1783 he applied through the Russian ambassador Ivan Matveevich Simolin to enter the Russian navy.\nThe Billings Expedition.\nIn 1785, the Russian government of Catherine the Great commissioned a new expedition in search for the Northeast Passage, led by Joseph Billings, the Russian officer Gavril Sarychev as his deputy and Carl Heinrich Merck as the expedition's naturalist. Martin Sauer served as secretary and translator. Captains Robert Hall, Gavril Sarychev, and Christian Bering had leading roles. The expedition operated until 1794.\nThough considered a failure by some scholars because the expenditures outweighed the results, it nevertheless had a substantial record of achievement. Accurate maps were made of the Chukchi Peninsula in Eastern Siberia, the west coast of Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands. Members of the expedition landed on Kodiak Island and made an examination of the islands and mainlands of Prince William Sound. Additionally, the expedition compiled a census of the native population of the Aleutian Islands and reported to the crown stories of abuse by the Russian fur traders (\"promyshlenniki\").\nLater years.\nAfter the expedition, Joseph Billings remained with the Imperial Russian Navy. He was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet at his request. From 1797 to 1798, he conducted a hydrographical survey of the Black Sea. He subsequently published an atlas of this work. In November 1799, he retired and settled in Moscow.\nBillings died in Moscow on 18 June 1806, possibly at the age of 48 years.\nLegacy.\nCape Billings in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug was named after him.\nBillings Glacier on Passage Peak in Alaska was named after him in 1908.\nReferences.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a product of Bally Technologies, under its Shuffle Master brand.\nHistory.\nThe game was invented by Shuffle Master founder John Breeding, with the goal of fueling demand for the company's shuffling machine.\nInitially popular in many casinos, the popularity of the game has waned since then because of its relatively high house edge. Like blackjack and video poker, player decisions in Let It Ride affect the house edge. With the standard pay table and optimal strategy, the house edge is 3.51%, several times that of blackjack and craps.\nBasic rules.\nLet It Ride is a variation of five-card stud, based on three player cards and two community cards. The two community cards are initially dealt face down. The most distinguishing feature of Let It Ride is that the player is given two opportunities to withdraw exactly one-third of their initial wager. One chance occurs after the player looks at their hand but before the first community card is revealed, and the second occurs after the first community card is revealed, but before the second is revealed. The player may reduce their wager on either of these occasions, or on both, or neither. If the player decides not to withdraw part of their wager, they are said to \"let it ride.\" In order to ensure that the player's initial wager is divisible by three, each player must distribute their wager over three betting spots which must all contain the same chip value. On some table layouts these spots are given the symbols \"1\", \"2\" and \"$\", with \"1\" and \"2\" indicating the thirds of the wager which the player can withdraw before the first and second community cards respectively are turned up, and \"$\" representing the third of the wager which there is never a chance to withdraw.\nAfter players have placed their bets, the dealer starts from their left, and deals each player one card, followed by the first face-down community card, followed by a further card to each player, followed by the second community card, followed by a final card to each player. Players are not permitted to show their cards or to see the cards of other players at any point before the end of the deal.\nIn the event of a winning hand after the second community card is revealed, what remains of the player's wager is paid out according to a payout table such as the one given below. There are small variations in payoffs between casinos, but the lowest paying hand in Let It Ride is typically a pair of 10s; a pair of nines or less is a losing hand, which results in the player forfeiting their remaining wager to the house.\nThree Card Bonus.\nThe Three Card Bonus is an optional side bet offered at some tables. The bet is placed on the player's three cards only. Winnings from a fixed payout table are awarded based on the three-card hand, following the hand rankings of three-card brag. This is comparable to the \"Pair Plus\" side bet in the casino game of Three Card Poker.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the Chukchi Peninsula in the very sparsely populated Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. This cape is located between the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Strait, across from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska; the Bering Strait is delimited by the two capes. The Diomede Islands and Fairway Rock are located in the midst of the strait.\nGeography.\nIn 1898, the cape was officially renamed as Cape Dezhnev, replacing Captain James Cook's name, the \"East Cape\". It was named in honor of Semyon Dezhnev, the first recorded European to round its tip (in 1648). There is a large monument to Dezhnev on the seacoast.\nThe cape is the eastern tip of a high, rocky headland, about from Uelen in the north to Cape Pe'ek in the south, connected to the mainland by a neck of lower-lying land peppered with swamps and shallow lakes. That low-lying land is so low in elevation that the cape appears as an island from a distance far to the south of it. The US Hydrographic Office publication \"Asiatic Pilot\" from 1909 gives the height of the headland as , and the US Office of Coast Survey chart of 2000 shows the highest peak at . The headland and the neck of low-lying land together form a peninsula. A well-established trail crossed the neck of land behind the headland in pre-historic and historic times, traversed by sleds in the winter and used as a portage in the summer to avoid traversing the strait. This route was important enough that, according to an analysis by linguist Michael Krauss, the Central Siberian Yupik language continued up the coast, un-interrupted by the Naukansky dialect spoken in the village of Naukan on the headland.\nThe Great Circle distance from Cape Dezhnev to the shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait in Yemen is about , which is the longest land distance of Asia.\nHistory.\nThe Cape Dezhnev peninsula, (or East Cape, as it was then generally called) was a center for trade between American (and other) whalers and the fur traders and the native Yupik and Chukchi people of the coast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the early years, ships would call at Uelen to trade for furs produced along the arctic coast. Subsequently, there were established trading stations at Uelen and Deshnevo (Chukchi name Keniskun; Yupik Kaniskak). When a source of that period speaks of stopping or trading at East Cape, either of these locations may be meant, or occasionally the Yupik village Naukan on the southeast shore of the cape, which had less trade because it lacked a good anchorage. Sources from that period sometimes speak of a village Emma-Town. Although this name may be derived from the nearby Yupik village Enmitahin (Chukchi for \"end of the cliff\") the name appears to refer to Keniskun (where the traders were) or perhaps to both villages together. Of the four historical villages on the cape itself, only Uelen is still inhabited. Naukan was evacuated in 1958 with most of the occupants relocated to Nunyamo near Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka, and Keniskun was merged with Uelen a little earlier.\nIn Josef Bauer's \"As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me\" (1955), Cape Deshnev is given as the site of a Gulag lead-mine camp from which a German POW Clemens Forell (actual name: Cornelius Rost) escaped in 1949. Later research cast serious doubt on the book's accuracy. For example, at the time of the escape described, no Cape Dezhnev Gulag camp lead mine existed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This was the term that became current in the southern and western parts of the Holy Roman Empire for the Fiorino d'oro (introduced in 1252 in the Republic of Florence). Hence, the name has often been interchangeable with \"florin\" (currency sign \u0192 or fl.).\nThe guilder is also the name of several currencies used in Europe and the former colonies of the Dutch Empire.\nGold guilder.\nThe guilder or gulden was the name of several gold coins used during the Holy Roman Empire. It first referred to the Italian gold florin, introduced in the 13th century. It then referred to the Rhenish gulden (\"florenus Rheni\") issued by several states of the Holy Roman Empire from the 14th century. The Rhenish gulden was issued by Trier, Cologne and Mainz in the 14th and 15th centuries. Basel minted its own \"Apfelgulden\" between 1429 and 1509. Bern and Solothurn followed in the 1480s, Fribourg in 1509 and Z\u00fcrich in 1510, and other towns in the 17th century.\nThe \"Reichsm\u00fcnzordnung\" or imperial minting ordinance of the Holy Roman Empire first defined standards for the Rhenish gulden (\"Rheinischer Gulden\") in 1524. It also defined a silver \"Guldengroschen\" of equal value to the \"gulden\".363-367364-365\nThe standards of the Rhenish gulden has changed over the centuries, as follows:19364-365\nCurrency guilder.\nWith increasingly standardized currencies in the early modern period, \"gulden\" or \"guilder\" became a term for various early modern and modern currencies, detached from actual gold coins. The Dutch guilder first emerged as the currency of the Burgundian Netherlands after the monetary reforms of 1435, under Philip the Good.20 It remained the national currency of the Netherlands until it was replaced by the euro, on 1 January 2002.\nThe Reichsm\u00fcnzordnung of 1524 defined fixed standards for the gold Rhenish gulden and the Guldengroschen of equal value. By 1551, however, both coins were valued at 72 kreuzer, and a new guilder currency unit of 60 kreuzer was defined.364-365 The latter gulden was then defined over the succeeding centuries as a currency unit worth a fraction of the silver Reichsthaler.\nIn 1753, Austria-Hungary and Bavaria agreed to the Conventions monetary standard which resulted into two differently valued gulden: the Austro-Hungarian florin of the Austrian Empire from 1754 to 1892, and the South German gulden of the Southern German states from 1754, until German unification in 1871. Currencies identical to the South German gulden include the Bavarian gulden, Baden gulden &amp; the W\u00fcrttemberg gulden.\nA Danzig gulden was in use from 1923 to 1939.\nSee also.\nOther coin names that are derived from the gold of which they were once made:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58349", "revid": "14010475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58349", "title": "Sergei Kirov", "text": "Soviet politician and revolutionary (1886\u20131934)\nSergei Mironovich Kirov (born Kostrikov; 27 March 1886 \u2013 1 December 1934) was a Russian and Soviet politician and Bolshevik revolutionary. Kirov was an early revolutionary in the Russian Empire and a member of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Kirov became an Old Bolshevik and personal friend to Joseph Stalin, rising through the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ranks to become head of the party in Leningrad and a member of the Politburo.\nOn 1 December 1934, Kirov was shot and killed by Leonid Nikolaev at his offices in the Smolny Institute. Nikolaev and several alleged accomplices were convicted in a show trial and executed less than 30 days later. Kirov's assassination was used by Stalin as a reason for starting the Moscow trials and the Great Purge. \nEarly life.\nSergei Mironovich Kostrikov was born on 27 March\u00a0[O.S. 15 March]\u00a01886 in Urzhum in Vyatka Governorate, Russian Empire, as one of seven children born to Miron Ivanovich Kostrikov and Yekaterina Kuzminichna Kostrikova (\"n\u00e9e\" Kazantseva). Their first four children had died young. Anna (born 1883), Sergei (1886), and Yelizaveta (1889) survived. \nMiron, an alcoholic, abandoned the family around 1890. Yekaterina died of tuberculosis in 1893. Sergei and his sisters were raised for a brief time by their paternal grandmother, Melania Avdeyevna Kostrikova, but she could not afford to take care of them all on her small pension of 3 rubles per month. Through her connections, Melania succeeded in having Sergey placed in an orphanage at the age of seven, but he saw his sisters and grandmother regularly.\nIn 1901, a group of wealthy benefactors provided a scholarship for Kirov to attend an industrial school at Kazan. After gaining a degree in engineering, Kirov moved to Tomsk, a city in Siberia, where he became a Marxist and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1904.\nRevolutionary.\nKirov was a participant in the 1905 Russian Revolution and was arrested, joining the Bolsheviks soon after being released from prison. In 1906, he was arrested and jailed for over three years, charged with printing illegal literature. Soon after his release Kirov was arrested again for printing illegal literature. After a year in custody, Kirov moved to the Caucasus, where he stayed until the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II after the February Revolution in March 1917.\nBy this time, Kirov had shortened his last name from Kostrikov to Kirov, a practice common among Russian revolutionaries of the time. Kirov began using the pen name Kir, first publishing under the pseudonym Kirov on 26 April 1912. One account states that he chose the name Kir, the Russian version of Cyrus (from the Greek K\u016bros), after a Christian martyr in third-century Egypt from an Orthodox calendar of saints' days, and Russifying it by adding an \"-ov\" suffix. A second story is that Kirov based it on the name of the Persian king Cyrus the Great.\nKirov became commander of the Bolshevik military administration in Astrakhan and fought for the Red Army in the Russian Civil War until 1920. Simon Sebag Montefiore writes: \"During the Civil War, he was one of the swashbuckling commissars in the North Caucasus beside Ordzhonikidze and Mikoyan. In Astrakhan he enforced Bolshevik power in March 1919 with liberal bloodletting; more than 4,000 were killed. When a bourgeois was caught hiding his own furniture, Kirov ordered him shot.\"\nCareer.\nIn 1921, Kirov became First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, the Bolshevik party organization in the Azerbaijan SSR. Kirov was a loyal supporter of Joseph Stalin, the successor of Vladimir Lenin, and in 1926 was rewarded with command of the Leningrad party organization. Kirov was a close personal friend of Stalin, and a strong supporter of industrialisation and forced collectivisation.\nAt the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930, Kirov stated: \"The General Party line is to conduct the course of our country industrialization. Based on the industrialisation, we conduct transformation of our agriculture. Namely, we centralise and collectivise.\" \nIn 1934, at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Kirov delivered the speech called \"The Speech of Comrade Stalin Is the Program of Our Party\", which refers to Stalin's speech delivered at the Congress earlier. Kirov praised Stalin for everything he had done since the death of Lenin. Kirov personally named and ridiculed Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky\u2014former party allies of Stalin. Bukharin and Rykov were later tried in the show trial called The Trial of the Twenty-One accused of Kirov's death. Tomsky committed suicide, while expecting his arrest by the NKVD.\nReputation.\nAfter his assassination, Kirov acquired a reputation for having repeatedly stood up to Stalin in private and for becoming so popular that he was a threat to Stalin's supremacy, as he displayed some independence from Stalin. In an alleged example from 1932, Stalin wanted to have Martemyan Ryutin executed for writing an attack on his leadership, but Kirov and Sergo Ordzhonikidze talked him out of it. \nAlexander Orlov, who defected to the West, listed a series of incidents in which Kirov allegedly clashed with Stalin, based on rumours he must have heard from fellow NKVD officers. Kirov's reputed rivalry is a major theme of the historical novel \"Children of the Arbat\", by Anatoli Rybakov, who wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In his hunger for popularity, Kirov opted for the simple style. He lived on Kamennoostrovsky Prospekt in a large house, inhabited by all sorts of people, he walked to work, wandered on his own around the streets of the city, took his children for rides in his car and played hide-and-seek with them in the yard ... as if to emphasize that Stalin lived in the Kremlin, with guards, didn't wander the streets or play hide-and-seek with his children, thus underlining the idea that Stalin was afraid of the people, whereas Kirov was not.\nAt the end of the Communist Party's Seventeenth Congress in February 1934, there is reputed to have been a scandal, when Kirov topped the poll in elections to the Central Committee, and Stalin's acolyte, Lazar Kaganovich ordered a number of ballots be destroyed so that Stalin and Kirov could share top billing. Amy Knight, a historian of the Soviet Union, suggests that whereas Kirov \"might have toed the line as others did, on the other hand, he might have acted as a rallying point for those who wanted to oppose his [Stalin's] dictatorship.\" Knight suggests that Kirov would not have been a willing accomplice when the full force of Stalin's terror was unleashed in Leningrad. \nKnight's contention is supported by the fact that whereas most of the elite tried to anticipate what Stalin desired and to act accordingly, Kirov did not always do what Stalin wanted. In 1934, Stalin wanted Kirov to come to Moscow permanently. Whereas all the other members of the Politburo would have complied, Stalin accepted that, as Kirov had no desire to leave Leningrad, he would not come to Moscow until 1938. When Stalin wanted Filipp Medved moved from the Leningrad NKVD to Minsk, Kirov refused to agree; in a rare move for Stalin, he had to accept defeat.\nAssassination.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the first days when Leningrad was orphaned, Stalin rushed there. He went to the place where the crime against our country was committed. The enemy did not fire at Kirov personally. No! He fired at the proletarian revolution.\n\u2014 Pravda, 5 December 1934\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, 1 December 1934, Kirov's assassin, Leonid Nikolayev, arrived at the Smolny Institute offices and made his way to the third floor unopposed, waiting in a hallway until Kirov and his bodyguard Borisov stepped into the corridor. Borisov appeared to have stayed some 20 to 40 paces behind Kirov, with some sources alleging Borisov parted company with Kirov in order to prepare his lunch. Kirov turned a corner and passed Nikolayev, who then drew his revolver and shot Kirov in the back of the neck.\nNikolayev was well known to the NKVD, which had arrested him for various petty offences in recent years. Accounts of his life agree that he was an expelled party member and a failed junior functionary, with a murderous grudge and an indifference to his own survival. Nikolayev was unemployed, with a wife and child, and in financial difficulties. According to Orlov, Nikolayev had allegedly told a friend he wanted to kill the head of the party control commission that had expelled him. Nikolayev's friend reported this to the NKVD. Ivan Zaporozhets then allegedly enlisted Nikolayev's friend to contact him, giving him money and a loaded 7.62 mm Nagant M1895 revolver. \nNikolayev's first attempt at killing Kirov failed. On 15 October 1934, Nikolayev packed his Nagant revolver in a briefcase and entered the Smolny Institute where Kirov now worked. Although Nikolayev was initially passed by the main security desk at Smolny, he was arrested after an alert guard asked to examine his briefcase, which was found to contain the revolver. A few hours later, Nikolayev's briefcase and loaded revolver were returned to him, and he was told to leave the building. \nWith Stalin's approval, the NKVD withdrew all but four police bodyguards assigned to Kirov. These four guards accompanied Kirov each day to his offices at the Smolny Institute and then left. On 1 December 1934, the usual guard post at the entrance to Kirov's offices was supposedly left unmanned, even though the building housed the chief offices of the Leningrad party apparatus and was the seat of the local government. \nAccording to some reports, only a single friend, Commissar Borisov, an unarmed bodyguard of Kirov's, remained. Given the circumstances of Kirov's death, Alexander Barmine stated that \"the negligence of the NKVD in protecting such a high party official was without precedent in the Soviet Union.\"\nAftermath.\nKirov was cremated and his ashes interred in the Kremlin Wall necropolis in a state funeral, with Stalin and other prominent members of the CPSU personally carrying his coffin. After Kirov's death, Stalin called for swift punishment of the traitors and those found negligent in Kirov's death. Nikolayev was tried alone and secretly by Vasili Ulrikh, Chairman of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR. He was sentenced to death by shooting on 29 December 1934. The sentence was carried out that night. The Soviet government, led by Stalin, stated that their investigation proved that the assassin was acting on behalf of a secret Zinovievist group. \nCommissar Borisov died the day after Kirov's assassination, allegedly falling from a moving truck while riding with a group of NKVD agents. According to Orlov, Borisov's wife was committed to an insane asylum. Nikolayev's mysterious friend and alleged provocateur, who had supplied him with the revolver and money, was later shot on Stalin's personal orders.\nSeveral NKVD officers from the Leningrad branch were convicted of negligence for not adequately protecting Kirov and sentenced to prison terms of up to ten years. According to Barmine, none of the NKVD officers were executed in the aftermath, and none served time in prison. Instead, they were transferred to executive posts in Stalin's Gulag labour camps for a period of time\u2014in effect, a demotion. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the same NKVD officers were shot in 1937. Lajos Magyar, a Hungarian communist and refugee from the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, was falsely accused of complicity in Kirov's assassination. Magyar was convicted as a \"Zinovievite-Terrorist\" and sent to a Gulag, where he died in 1940.\nA Communist Party communiqu\u00e9 initially reported that Nikolayev had confessed his guilt as an assassin in the pay of a \"fascist power,\" having received money from an unidentified \"foreign consul\" in Leningrad. The same author claims 104 defendants who were already in prison at the time of Kirov's assassination, and who had no demonstrable connection to Nikolayev, were found guilty of complicity in the \"fascist plot\" against Kirov, and summarily executed. \nA few days later, during a subsequent Communist Party meeting of the Moscow District, the party secretary announced in a speech that Nikolayev had been personally interrogated by Stalin the day after the assassination, something unheard-of for a party leader such as Stalin to have done. He said: \"Comrade Stalin personally directed the investigation of Kirov's assassination. He questioned Nikolayev at length. The leaders of the Opposition placed the gun in Nikolayev's hand!\"\nOther speakers duly rose to purge the Communist Party of any opposition: \"The Central Committee must be pitiless\u2014the Party must be purged... the record of every member must be scrutinized...\" No one at the meeting mentioned the initial theory that fascist agents had been responsible for the assassination. Barmine asserts Stalin even used the Kirov assassination to eliminate the remainder of the Opposition leadership, accusing Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Abram Prigozhin, and others who had stood with Kirov in opposing Stalin, or who had simply failed to acquiesce to Stalin's views, of being \"morally responsible\" for Kirov's murder, and therefore guilty of complicity. Barmine claimed that Stalin arranged the murder with the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, who armed Nikolayev and sent him to assassinate Kirov.\nInvestigations by Soviet authorities.\nIn his Secret Speech in 1956, Khrushchev said that the murder of Kirov was organized by NKVD agents who were tasked with protecting Kirov and were shot in 1937. Khrushchev entrusted Pyotr Pospelov, Secretary of the Central Committee, to form a commission to investigate the repression of the 1930s. This was the same Pospelov who had drafted the famous Secret Speech for Khrushchev at the 20th Congress. Khrushchev stated:\nThere are reasons for the suspicion that the killer of Kirov, Nikolayev, was assisted by someone from among the people whose duty it was to protect the person of Kirov. A month and a half before the killing, Nikolayev was arrested on the grounds of suspicious behavior, but he was released and not even searched. It is an unusually suspicious circumstance that when the Chekist [Borisov] assigned to protect Kirov was being brought for an interrogation, on 2 December 1934, he was killed in a car \"accident\" in which no other occupants of the car were harmed. After the murder of Kirov, top functionaries of the Leningrad NKVD were relieved of their duties and were given very light sentences, but in 1937 they were shot. We can assume that they were shot in order to cover the traces of the organizers of Kirov's killing.\nPospelov's committee came to the conclusion that Kirov\u2019s murder was facilitated by NKVD officers who were responsible for his security, and that NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda was declared a hero, instead of holding him responsible. Pospelov spoke to Dr. Kirchakov and former nurse Trunina, former members of the party, who had been mentioned in a letter by another member of the commission, Olga Shatunovskaya, as having knowledge of the Kirov murder. Kirchakov confirmed that he talked to Shatunovskaya and Trunina about some of the unexplained aspects of the Kirov murder case and agreed to provide the commission with a written deposition. He stressed that his statement was based on the testimony of one Comrade Yan Olsky, a former NKVD officer who was demoted after Kirov's murder and transferred to the People's Supply System.\nIn his deposition, Kirchakov wrote that he had discussed Kirov's murder and the role of Fyodor Medved with Olsky. Olsky was of the firm opinion that Medved, Kirov's friend and NKVD security chief of the Leningrad branch, was innocent of the murder. Olsky also told Kirchakov that Medved had been barred from the NKVD Kirov assassination investigation. Instead, the investigation was carried out by a senior NKVD chief, Yakov Agranov, and later by another NKVD bureau officer whose name he did not remember. \nThe other NKVD official may have been Yefim Georgievich Yevdokimov (1891\u20131939), a Stalin crony, mass-killing specialist, and architect of the Shakhty purge trials, who continued to lead a secret police team within the NKVD even after technically retiring from the OGPU in 1931. During one of the committee sessions, Olsky said he was present when Stalin asked Leonid Nikolayev why Comrade Kirov had been killed. To this Nikolayev replied that he carried out the instruction of the \"Chekists\" (meaning the NKVD) and pointed towards the group of \"Chekists\" (NKVD officers) standing in the room. Medved was not among them. \nKhrushchev's 1956 report, \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", was later read at closed-door Party meetings. Afterwards, new material was received by the Pospelov Committee, including the assertion by Kirov's chauffeur, Kuzin, that Commissar Borisov, Kirov's friend and bodyguard, who was responsible for Kirov's round-the-clock security at the Smolny Institute, was intentionally killed, and that his death in a road accident was not an accident at all. \nIn 1989, the last attempt in the Soviet Union to review the Kirov murder case was made by the Politburo Commission headed by Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev. After two years of investigations, the working team of the Commission concluded that no materials were found to support Stalin's or NKVD's participation in Kirov's murder. Yakovlev dissented, noticing that a number of circumstances indicated the murder was organized by the NKVD. According to Amy Knight, the Politburo Commission tried to whitewash Stalin.\nSignificance and responsibility.\nKirov's assassination became a major event in the history of the Soviet Union because it was used by Stalin to justify the Moscow trials and his campaign of terror known as the Great Purge. At the time of Kirov's murder, Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, was out of the country. His daughter Tanya implied that Litvinov realised this event might be an excuse for Stalin to unleash a reign of terror. \nThis view was shared by Anastas Mikoyan's son, who stated that the murder of Kirov had certain similarities to the burning of the Reichstag in Nazi Germany in 1933. The fire at the Reichstag was often said to have been organized by the Nazis as a pretext for the mass persecution of the Communists and Social Democrats in Germany. The physical removal of Kirov meant the elimination of a future potential rival for Stalin. The principal objective, as with the fire at the Reichstag, was to manufacture an excuse for repression and control. Based on circumstantial evidence, a number of historians concluded that the assassination was ordered by Stalin.\nAccording to Orlov, Stalin ordered Yagoda to arrange the assassination of Kirov. Orlov said that Yagoda ordered Medved's deputy, Vania Zaporozhets, to undertake the job. Zaporozhets returned to Leningrad in search of an assassin. In reviewing the files he found the name of Leonid Nikolayev. According to another Soviet defector, Grigori Tokaev, a real oppositionist underground group assassinated Kirov. Author and Menshevik scholar Boris Nikolaevsky argued: \"One thing is certain: the only man who profited by the Kirov assassination was Stalin.\" \nThe idea of Stalin's complicity in Kirov's assassination has been backed by Robert Conquest and Amy Knight but challenged by revisionist historians who argued that this theory relies primarily on circumstantial evidence and Khrushchev-era investigations. Robert W. Thurston argued that Kirov was in agreement with Stalin on all major issues and that on the Seventeenth Party Congress, at least 86.5% of voting delegates were in favour of Stalin's membership of the Central Committee. Hence, Stalin had little to fear from Kirov. Nothing in Nikolaev's personal diary indicates that he did not carry out the assassination on his own. \nAlla Kirilina and Oleg Khlevniuk went as far as to claim that \"the conventional narratives are almost entirely myth\" because they did not find any orders of assassination in the former Soviet archives. Edvard Radzinsky argued in his biography of Stalin that written documents about Stalin ordering the assassination of Kirov were never found, simply because they never existed and could not exist. Radzinsky believes that Stalin was behind the assassination, but given the prominent status of Kirov as a Politburo member, it would have been ordered verbally by Stalin to NKVD director Genrikh Yagoda.\nLegacy.\nMany cities, streets, and factories were named or renamed after Kirov in Russia, including the cities of Kirov (formerly Vyatka) and Kirov Oblast, Kirovsk (Murmansk Oblast), Kirov (Kaluga Oblast), Kirovohrad (formerly Zinovyevsk, now Kropyvnytskyi) and Kirovohrad Oblast (Ukrainian SSR; now Ukraine), Kirovabad (Azerbaijani SSR; now Ganja, Azerbaijan), Kirovakan (Armenian SSR; now Vanadzor, Armenia), the Kirovskaya station of the Moscow Metro (now Chistye Prudy station), the Kirov Ballet (now the Mariinsky Ballet), the massive Kirov Plant in Saint Petersburg, Kirov Square in Yekaterinburg, the Kirov Islands in the Kara Sea, and various small settlements. \nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the locations and buildings named after Kirov have been renamed, especially outside of Russia. In order to comply with Ukrainian decommunization laws, Kirovohrad was renamed Kropyvnytskyi by the Ukrainian Parliament in July 2016. In 2019, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine approved the change of the oblast's name to Kropyvnytskyi Oblast, or Kropyvnychchyna. \nThe S. M. Kirov Forestry Academy in Leningrad was named after him, and renamed the Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University. For many years, a huge granite and bronze statue of Kirov dominated the city of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, erected on a hill in 1939. The statue was dismantled in January 1992, shortly after Azerbaijan gained its independence.\nThe Kirov Prize, a speedskating match in the city of Kirov, was named for him. The Kirov Prize is the oldest annual organised race in speedskating, apart from the World Speed Skating Championships and the European Speed Skating Championships. The English communist poet John Cornford wrote an eponymous poem in his honour. \nThe Soviet Navy cruiser \"Kirov\" was named after him, and by extension the \"Kirov\"-class cruiser. The \"Kirov\" name was used for the battlecruiser \"Kirov\" and the \"Kirov\"-class battlecruiser. The \"Khai-3\" tailless airplane was named after him.\nPersonal life.\nKirov was married to Maria Lvovna Markus (1885\u20131945) from 1911, although they never formally registered their relationship. (1921\u20131975), who claimed to be Kirov's daughter, was a famous tank company commander and World War II veteran.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was an international co-production between Italy and Spain, and follows a group of American tourists in Barcelona who are stalked by a killer who removes their victims' eyes.\nPlot.\nAlma Burton, whose marriage to Mark, the owner of a marketing company in Vermont, is on the verge of divorce, is supposed to go to a mental institution in New York for treatment. However, at the airport she changes her plans at short notice and travels to Barcelona.\nWhile in the Spanish city, a tour group of American tourists, which includes the secretary Paulette Stone, the lesbian photographer Lisa Sanders and her model girlfriend Naiba, as well as several wealthy entrepreneurs, are exploring Barcelona's sights by bus. However, the traveling party is soon shaken by a gruesome incident: the mysterious murder of a local woman. The victim, a young girl, is brutally killed by a murderer wearing a red raincoat who also gouges out her left eye. Soon after, the attractive American Peggy becomes the unknown serial killer's next victim, causing consternation among the travelers.\nThe aging Inspector Tudela, who is in his last week of work before retirement, takes over the investigation together with his young successor. The police are initially in the dark, but soon suspect that the perpetrator is in the group's environment, so that each of the travelers is formally classified as a potential murderer.\nMark Burton also soon joins the group, which includes his secret mistress, Paulette Stone. However, the series of murders does not stop, and Mark briefly fears that his unstable wife could be the murderer, as he once found her lying on the ground next to him with a bloody knife and one eye in her hand. He kept this incident quiet at the time and even covered up the traces so as not to endanger his marriage. He secretly thinks his wife Alma, who he currently suspects is somewhere in Barcelona, is a suspect. He initially kept this fact secret from the authorities.\nShortly after, Lisa Sanders is murdered, but before her death she manages to take an incriminating photo of the serial killer: Paulette, while Naiba interrupts the attack so that Paulette, contrary to previous crimes, does not mutilate her victim. Nevertheless, the series of murders does not stop and the number of tourists continues to decline until the serial perpetrator is caught red-handed at the end of the film. In the presence of Naiba and Mark, the inspector fatally injures Paulette, armed with a knife. It is revealed that her left eye is missing due to an accident when she was a child, hence her mutilation of the murder victims.\nIn the last scene of the film, the young inspector congratulates his experienced predecessor, who managed to solve the delicate series of murders within a week. Mark also makes a conciliatory phone call to his wife Alma, whom he gives another chance to save his marriage.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD by Sinister Film on January 1, 2014.\nIt was announced that 88 Films would release a Mega edition of the film on Blu-ray on August 27, 2018. 88 Films announced a very special limited edition of the film to be released late November 2024 with brand new 4K Remaster from the Original Techniscope Negative presented in 4K Ultra High Definition Blu-ray (2160p), Italian and English audio and newly translated English subtitles.\nReception.\nIn his analysis of the film, author Louis Paul described the film as \"entertaining\" and \"enjoyable\".\n\"The Terror Trap\" gave the film 3/4 stars, calling it \"[a] Completely enjoyable giallo from Umberto Lenzi\". The reviewer also commended the film's score, \"bizarro plot\", cast, and death sequences. Justin Kerswell from \"Hysteria Lives!\" awarded the film 3/5 stars, stating that the film was director Lenzi's least accomplished giallo, but a'so stated that it was \"a thoroughly entertaining 90 minutes of slasher trash\". Dan Budnik from \"The Bleeding Skull!\" called the film \"a mighty entertaining giallo\", and commended the film's atmosphere, pacing, and odd characters.\nTV Guide hated the film, calling it \"worthless\", and criticized the film's gimmicky villain.\nReferences.\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58352", "revid": "40529576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58352", "title": "Sport in the Netherlands", "text": " \nApproximately 5 million of the 17 million people in the Netherlands are registered to one of the 35,000 sports clubs in the country. About two thirds of the population older than 15 years participates in sports weekly.\nFootball is the most popular sport in the Netherlands, with field hockey and volleyball as the second and third most popular team sports. Speed skating, cycling, tennis and golf are the four most widely played individual sports. A number of native Dutch sports are also practiced, such as fierljeppen (polsstokverspringen), beugelen, kaatsen, klootschieten, kolven and korfball.\nOrganization of sports began at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A Dutch National Olympic Committee was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 356 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 147 medals at the Winter Olympic Games.\nAn influential figure in Dutch sport was Pim Mulier. In 1879, he founded the first rugby and football club in the Netherlands, and he was involved in forming the first tennis club in 1884. He also established the predecessor of the Royal Dutch Football Association five years later, and introduced field hockey in 1896, as well as bandy. His hometown Haarlem and the English Bury Fen Bandy Club played the first international match.\nTeam sports.\nWomen\u2019s Netball.\nThe Netherlands Women\u2019s netball team will compete against Claverdon, Bubbenhall, and an invitational side organised by Steve Campton, during the summer of 2025 in preparation for next year\u2019s World Championships. Currently 167th in the world, they will look to build on recent positive displays against 166th placed Antarctica. \nFootball.\nThe Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) is the largest sports federation in the country with 1,076,759 players (in 2005). According to the KNVB's website, it has over 1.2 million members as of 2016. The organization came into being on 19 December 1899, and was one of the founding members of FIFA (the world Football Association) in 1904.\nDutch football teams won three Olympic bronze medals in 1908, 1912 and 1920. Other successes came in the 1970s, when the national team played in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cup finals, losing to the tournament's host on both occasions. In the same period, Dutch league sides Ajax and Feyenoord won European Cups from 1970 to 1973. In 1988, the national team won the only international title so far at the European Championships. PSV won the European Cup that year too. Ajax won the European Cup again in 1995.\nDespite their wealth of individual talent, the Dutch national men team have only been able to claim one trophy in their entire history. This came at the UEFA Euro 1988 in which they defeated the Soviet Union to claim the coveted Henri Delaunay Trophy. In 2017 the Dutch national woman team equalized this result when they beat Denmark, claiming their European title on home ground.\nMany Dutch football players have gained international fame, such as Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Kluivert, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Clarence Seedorf, Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Frenkie de Jong. Rinus Michels was named Coach of the Century by FIFA in 1999. Additional football notoriety came with the Dutch team's participation in the 2010 World Cup finals, in which they lost to Spain, giving Spain its first World Cup title. In June 2019 the Netherlands reached their 6th major final, where they lost to Portugal in the UEFA Nations League final. A month later the national woman team reached their first World Cup Final against USA.\nFootball stadiums Johan Cruyff Arena and De Kuip have UEFA's 5-star rating, enabling them to host finals of the UEFA Champions League and the European Championship.\nBaseball.\nThe Royal Dutch Baseball Federation was established on 12 March 1912. They merged with the softball federation to form the Royal Dutch Baseball and Softball Federation in 1971 In 2008 there were over 24,000 players active at one of the 184 clubs in the country.\nThe Netherlands boasts the most successful national baseball team in Europe, winning the European Baseball Championship 20 times and frequently representing the continent in international competitions such as the World Baseball Classic and Baseball World Cup. There is a domestic professional baseball league whose best team, Neptunus of Rotterdam, regularly contends for the European club championship, including five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004.\nBaseball is especially popular on the island of Cura\u00e7ao. In 2005, the Pabao Little League Champions of Willemstad advanced all the way to the championship game in the Little League World Series. Former New York Yankees outfielder Andruw Jones, now of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in Japan's Pacific League, is arguably the most successful and popular baseball player to emerge from Cura\u00e7ao, and in 2006 was a member of the Netherlands national team that participated in the inaugural World Baseball Classic. Jair Jurrjens, pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, became the first pitcher from Cura\u00e7ao to pitch in the major leagues. John Houseman became the first Dutch-born player in the Major Leagues when he made his debut for the Chicago Colts in 1894. Bert Blyleven was an All-Star, a two-time World Series champion and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011.\nIn 2009, the Netherlands twice upset the Dominican Republic in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. The Dominican Republic's entire roster played in Major League Baseball (MLB), while the Netherlands only had one player on an MLB roster. The Dominican teams' combined salary total in the MLB was about $84 million, while the Netherlands totals for $400,000. The Dominican Republic were highly favoured but in its first game against the Dominican, the Dutch won 3\u20132. The Dominican Republic won its next game against Panama to set up a rematch against the Netherlands. The Dutch stunned the Dominicans again and won 2\u20131 in extra innings. At the 2013 World Baseball Classic the Netherlands performed even better. With a mix of experienced veterans and talented youngsters they progressed through the preliminary rounds to the semi-final, where the team lost to the Dominican Republic. The team again reached the semifinals at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but again fell one game shy of the championship, losing this time to Puerto Rico.\nField hockey.\nThe Royal Dutch Hockey Federation was formed on 8 October 1898 and is, with 185,923 members (in 2005), the fifth largest sports federation. \"Men's Hoofdklasse Hockey\" and \"Women's Hoofdklasse Hockey\" are the country's primary hockey competitions, which are contested by 12 clubs in both the male and female league.\nAs of 2024, the Netherlands women's national field hockey team is the most successful team in World Cup and Olympic history, having won the title nine and five times respectively. The Dutch male hockey team has won both the World Cup and Olympic gold on three occasions. Several Dutch hockey league clubs have won the European Cup. At the Paris 2024 Olympics both the men's and women's teams won the gold medal.\nKorfball.\nKorfball is a mixed gender or only female ball sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. It is played by two teams of eight players with four females and four males in each team or with eight female players in each team. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a high pole. Mixed gender korfball is more generally played in the north of the Netherlands, while all female korfball is generally played in the south of the Netherlands.\nThe sport was invented by Dutch schoolteacher Nico Broekhuysen in 1902. In the Netherlands, there are around 580 clubs and over 100,000 people playing korfball. The sport is also very popular in Belgium and Taiwan, and is played in 54 other countries.\nThe Dutch korfball union is called Koninklijk Nederlands Korfbalverbond (KNKV).\nBasketball.\nBasketball is also a popular sport in the Netherlands. The national team had its most successful time during the 1980s. At the 1983 European Basketball Championship the team finished in the final four and qualified to the 1986 FIBA World Championship where the Dutch left behind strong competition such as Team Australia and Team Germany. During that time, the Dutch had its strong players in Jelle Esveldt and a young Rik Smits. Smits later became an NBA All-Star and emerged as the Dutch basketball-icon for years to come.\nSince 2000, basketball in the Netherlands went through some revival and has been home to several National Basketball Association (NBA) players, including Francisco Elson and Dan Gadzuric.\nHandball.\nWhile the men's national handball team has only qualified for the World Championship once and also once for the European Championship and never for the Olympic Games, the women's team have been more successful, with a gold medal at the 2019 World Women's Handball Championship as the best result.\nVolleyball.\nVolleyball is the third most participated team sport in the country. Founded on 6 September 1947, the Dutch Volleyball Federation is with 128,693 players (in 2005) the ninth largest sports association. The A-League is the highest division in which eight men's and women's teams compete for the national championships.\nThe national men's team is the most successful exponent, winning the silver medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and the gold medal four years later in Atlanta. The biggest success of the women's national team was winning the European Championship in 1995 and the World Grand Prix in 2007\nThe Netherlands featured national teams in beach volleyball that competed at the women's and men's section at the 2018\u20132020 CEV Beach Volleyball Continental Cup.\nCricket.\nThe Royal Dutch Cricket Federation was formed in 1883. In 2021 the federation had 5000 members, which indicates that cricket is a minority sport in the Netherland yet still growing. The premier division is called the \"Topklasse\", in which ten teams compete for the national championships.\nThe Netherlands national cricket team qualified for the cricket World Cup on five occasions; 1996, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2023. The country has been considered one of the stronger associate in the world and in Europe alongside Scotland. Netherlands is ranked within the top 15 teams in the world and has co-hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1999.\nMost recently at the 2009 World Twenty20 in England, the Dutch team made a name for themselves by their victory over hosts, England, in the opening match of the tournament. Though they failed to qualify for the Super Eight stage afterward, their win against England, considered one of the biggest wins in Dutch cricket history. Recently the Dutch have managed to beat two time world champions West Indies in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Qualifiers Zimbabwe 2023 considered ones of the biggest upsets in Cricket history due to it eventually leading to the West Indies not being able to qualify for the World Cup in India 2023.\nIn ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 Dutch team led by captain Scott Edwards has surprised the cricket world by beating South Africa and Bangladesh by big margins.\nBandy.\nIn terms of licensed athletes, bandy is the second biggest winter sport in the world.\nBandy was introduced to the Netherlands in the 1890s and enjoyed some following for a couple of decades before ice hockey took over as the most popular winter team sport in the 1920s. However, bandy lived on in the Netherlands, and in the 1970s, it got a more organised form again. Bandy Bond Nederland became the first non-founding member of Federation of International Bandy in 1973. The national team normally plays in Division B of the World Championships. After winning the division in 2018, the team played in Division A in 2019. In 2025 a new Division B gold medal came.\nLacrosse.\nFor the first time, the Netherlands will feature a national team at the 2022 Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships.\nIndividual sports.\nIce skating.\nThe Royal Dutch Speed Skating Association (KNSB) was formed on 17 September 1882. With 161,673 members they are the seventh largest sports federation (in 2005).\nSpeed skating.\nThe first official known speed skating competition ever for women was held in Leeuwarden from 1 to 2 February 1805 and was won by Trijntje Pieters Westra.\nAfter a successful period around 1900, with Jaap Eden and Coen de Koning as World Champions, Dutch speed skating successes became numerous in the 1960s. Champions Kees Verkerk and Ard Schenk were immensely popular, causing a real speed skating hype in the country. Successes continue up to today, with the likes of Yvonne van Gennip (3 Olympic gold medals in 1988), Rintje Ritsma (4-time World\nAllround Champion), Jochem Uytdehaage (2 Olympic gold medals in 2002), Marianne Timmer (3 Olympic gold medals in 1998 and 2006), Ireen W\u00fcst (5 Olympic golds in 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 6 World Allround Speed Skating Championships) and Sven Kramer (4 Olympic gold medals in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 9 World Allround Championships). The Dutch speed skaters' performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Thialf Stadium in Heerenveen was the second indoor 400m speed skating oval in the world, the first to host an international championship and remains a world-class facility today.\nDutch speed skaters have won 77 world single distance championships (since 1996).\nFigure skating.\nSjoukje Dijkstra is the most successful Dutch figure skater, winning the World Championships three times, the European Championships five times and two Olympic medals. Her Olympic gold in 1964 in Innsbruck was the first time an athlete from the Netherlands won gold at an Olympic Winter Games. Dianne de Leeuw won the silver medal in figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics.\nCycling.\nThe Royal Dutch Cycling Union was instituted on 26 January 1928. Two Dutch road racing cyclists have won the Tour de France: Jan Janssen and Joop Zoetemelk.

It started in 1965 under the Social Security Administration and is now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\nMedicare is divided into four parts: A, B, C, and D. Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing, and hospice services. Part B covers outpatient services. Part C is an alternative that allows patients to choose private plans with different benefit structures that provide the same services as Parts A and B, usually with additional benefits. Part D is for self-administered prescription drugs.\nIn 2022, Medicare provided health insurance for 65.0 million individuals\u2014more than 57 million people aged 65 and older and about 8 million younger people. According to annual Medicare Trustees reports and research by Congress' MedPAC group, Medicare covers about half of healthcare expenses of those enrolled. Enrollees cover most of the remaining costs by taking additional private insurance (medi-gap insurance), by enrolling in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, or by joining a private Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) plan. In 2022, spending by the Medicare Trustees topped $900 billion per the Trustees report Table II.B.1, of which $423 billion came from the U.S. Treasury and the rest primarily from the Part A Trust Fund (which is funded by payroll taxes) and premiums paid by beneficiaries. Households that retired in 2013 paid only 13 to 41 percent of the benefit dollars they are expected to receive.\nBeneficiaries typically have other healthcare-related costs, including Medicare Part A, B, and D deductibles and Part B and C co-pays; the costs of long-term custodial care (which are not covered by Medicare); and the costs resulting from Medicare's lifetime and per-incident limits.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the name \"Medicare\" in the United States referred to a program providing medical care for families of people serving in the military as part of the Dependents' Medical Care Act, which was passed in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower held the first White House Conference on Aging in January 1961, in which creating a health care program for social security beneficiaries was proposed.\nVarious attempts were made in Congress to pass a bill providing for healthcare for the elderly, all without success. In 1963, however, a bill providing for both Medicare and an increase in Social Security benefits passed the Senate by 68\u201320 votes. As noted by one study, this was the first time that either chamber \"had passed a bill embodying the principle of federal financial responsibility for health coverage, however limited it may have been.\" There was uncertainty over whether this bill would pass the House, however, as White House aide Henry Wilson's tally of House members\u2019 votes on a conference bill that included Medicare \u201cdisclosed 180 \u201creasonably certain votes for Medicare, 29 \u201cprobable/possible,\u201d 222 \u201cagainst,\u201d and 4 seats vacant.\u201d Following the 1964 elections however, pro-Medicare forces obtained 44 votes in the House and 4 in the Senate. In July 1965, under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, Congress enacted Medicare under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to people age 65 and older, regardless of income or medical history. Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law on July 30, 1965, at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri. Former president Harry S. Truman and his wife, former first lady Bess Truman, became the first recipients of the program.\nBefore Medicare was created, approximately 60% of people over the age of 65 had health insurance (as opposed to about 70% of the population younger than that), with coverage often unavailable or unaffordable to many others, because older adults paid more than three times as much for health insurance as younger people. Many of this group (about 20% of the total in 2022, 75% of whom were eligible for all Medicaid benefits) became \"dual eligible\" for both Medicare and Medicaid (which was created by the same 1965 law). In 1966, Medicare spurred the racial integration of thousands of waiting rooms, hospital floors, and physician practices by making payments to health care providers conditional on desegregation.\nMedicare has undergone several major changes since 1965; provisions have expanded to include benefits for speech, physical, and chiropractic therapy in 1972. In the 1970s the option of payments to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) was added and in 1982, hospice benefits to aid elderly people on a temporary basis, which was made permanent in 1984.\nCongress further expanded Medicare in 2001 to cover younger people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease). As the years progressed, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to younger people with permanent disabilities who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments and to those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nThe association with HMOs that began in the 1970s was formalized and expanded under President Bill Clinton in 1997 as Medicare Part C (although not all Part C health plans sponsors have to be HMOs, about 75% are). In 2003, under President George W. Bush, a Medicare program for covering almost all self-administered prescription drugs was passed (and went into effect in 2006) as Medicare Part D.\nAdministration.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), and parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (\"Obamacare\"). Along with the U.S. Departments of Labor and Treasury, the CMS also implements the insurance reform provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and most aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended. The Social Security Administration is responsible for determining Medicare eligibility, eligibility for and payment of Extra Help/Low Income Subsidy payments related to Parts C and D of Medicare, and collecting most premium payments for the Medicare program.\nThe Chief Actuary of the CMS must provide accounting information and cost-projections to the Medicare Board of Trustees to assist them in assessing the program's financial health. The Trustees are required by law to issue annual reports on the financial status of the Medicare Trust Funds, and those reports are required to contain a statement of actuarial opinion by the Chief Actuary.\nThe Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee (or Relative Value Update Committee; RUC), composed of physicians associated with the American Medical Association, advises the government about pay standards for Medicare patient procedures performed by doctors and other professionals under Medicare Part B. A similar but different CMS process determines the rates paid for acute care and other hospitals\u2014including skilled nursing facilities\u2014under Medicare Part A. The rates paid for both Part A and Part B type services under Part C are whatever is agreed upon between the sponsor and the provider. The amounts paid for mostly self-administered drugs under Part D are whatever is agreed upon between the sponsor (almost always through a pharmacy benefit manager also used in commercial insurance) and pharmaceutical distributors and/or manufacturers.\nFinancing.\nMedicare has several sources of financing.\nPart A's inpatient admitted hospital and skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% payroll tax levied on employers and workers (each pays 1.45%). Until December 31, 1993, the law provided a maximum amount of compensation on which the Medicare tax could be imposed annually, in the same way that the Social Security payroll tax operates. Beginning on January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must calculate the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but they may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax. Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding $200,000 for individuals ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay part of the cost of the subsidies to people not on Medicare mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\nIn 2022, Medicare spending was over $900 billion, near 4% of U.S. gross domestic product according to the Trustees Figure 1.1 and over 15% of total US federal spending. Because of the two Trust funds and their differing revenue sources (one dedicated and one not), the Trustees analyze Medicare spending as a percent of GDP rather than versus the Federal budget.\nThe aging of the Baby Boom generation into Medicare is projected by 2030 (when the last of the baby boom turns 65) to increase enrollment to more than 80 million. In addition, the fact that the number of payroll tax payors per enrollee will decline over time and that overall health care costs in the nation are rising pose substantial financial challenges to the program. Medicare spending is projected to increase from near 4% of GDP in 2022 to almost 6% in 2046. Baby-boomers are projected to have longer life spans, which will add to the future Medicare spending. In response to these financial challenges, Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers (primarily acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities) as part of PPACA in 2010 and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and individual Congresspeople have offered many additional competing proposals to stabilize Medicare spending further. Many other factors have complicated the forecasting of Medicare Trust Fund health and spending trends including but not limited to the Covid pandemic, the overwhelming preference of people joining Medicare this century for Part C, and the increasing number of dual eligible (Medicaid and Medicare eligibility) beneficiaries.\nIn 2013 the Urban Institute published a report which analyzed the amounts that various households (single male, single female, married single-earner, married dual-earner, low income, average income, high income) contributed to the Medicare program over their lifetimes, and how much someone living to the statistically expected age would expect to receive in benefits. They found differing amounts for the different scenarios, but even the group with the \"worst\" return on their Medicare taxes would have concluded their working years with $158,000 in Medicare contributions and growth (assuming annual growth equal to inflation plus 2%) but would receive $385,000 in Medicare benefits (both numbers are in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars). Overall, the groups paid into the system 13 to 41 percent of what they were expected to receive.\nCost reduction is influenced by factors including reduction in inappropriate and unnecessary care by evaluating evidence-based practices as well as reducing the amount of unnecessary, duplicative, and inappropriate care. Cost reduction may also be effected by reducing medical errors, investment in healthcare information technology, improving transparency of cost and quality data, increasing administrative efficiency, and by developing both clinical/non-clinical guidelines and quality standards. Of course all of these factors relate to the entire United States health care delivery system and not just to Medicare.\nEligibility.\nU.S. citizens or permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least five continuous years are eligible. Those who are 65 and older who choose to enroll in Part A Medicare must pay a monthly premium to remain enrolled in Medicare Part A if they or their spouse have not paid the qualifying Medicare payroll taxes. There are some instances where U.S. citizens might be able to enroll in Medicare earlier than age 65. For example, people with long term disabilities that prevent them from working (such as end-stage renal disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) may be eligible at an earlier age. Individuals receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for 24 months are automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the 25th month. Individuals with permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant may qualify for Medicare, regardless of age. Individuals diagnosed with ALS are automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B the month their disability benefits begin.\nBenefits and parts.\nMedicare has four parts: Part A, B, C, &amp; D. Coverage under the first two (Parts A and B), as opposed to Part C plans, is referred to as Original Medicare.\nIn April 2018, CMS began mailing out new Medicare cards with new ID numbers to all beneficiaries. Previous cards had ID numbers containing beneficiaries' Social Security numbers; the new ID numbers are randomly generated and not tied to any other personally identifying information.\nPart A: Hospital/hospice insurance.\nPart A covers inpatient hospital stays. The maximum length of stay that Medicare Part A covers in a hospital admitted inpatient stay or series of stays is typically 90 days. The first 60 days would be paid by Medicare in full, except one copay (also and more commonly referred to as a \"deductible\") at the beginning of the 60 days of $1632 as of 2024. Days 61\u201390 require a co-payment of $408 per day as of 2024. The beneficiary is also allocated \"lifetime reserve days\" that can be used after 90 days. These lifetime reserve days require a copayment of $816 per day as of 2024, and the beneficiary can use a total of only 60 of these days throughout their lifetime. A new pool of 90 hospital days, with new copays of $1632 in 2024 and $408 per day for days 61\u201390, starts only after the beneficiary has 60 days continuously with no payment from Medicare for hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement.\nSome \"hospital services\" are provided as inpatient services, which would be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The \"Two-Midnight Rule\" decides which is which. In August 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a final rule concerning eligibility for hospital inpatient services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that \"crosses two midnights\", Medicare Part A payment is \"generally appropriate\". However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B. The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can take into consideration the pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient's care will reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A. In addition to deciding which trust fund is used to pay for these various outpatient versus inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.\nMedicare penalizes hospitals for readmissions. After making initial payments for hospital stays, Medicare will take back from the hospital these payments, plus a penalty of 4 to 18 times the initial payment, if an above-average number of patients from the hospital are readmitted within 30 days. These readmission penalties apply after some of the most common treatments: pneumonia, heart failure, heart attack, COPD, knee replacement, and hip replacement. A study of 18 states conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that 1.8 million Medicare patients aged 65 and older were readmitted within 30 days of an initial hospital stay in 2011; the conditions with the highest readmission rates were congestive heart failure, sepsis, pneumonia, and COPD and bronchiectasis.\nThe highest penalties on hospitals are charged after knee or hip replacements, $265,000 per excess readmission. The goals are to encourage better post-hospital care and more referrals to hospice and end-of-life care in lieu of treatment, while the effect is also to reduce coverage in hospitals that treat poor and frail patients. The total penalties for above-average readmissions in 2013 are $280 million, for 7,000 excess readmissions, or $40,000 for each readmission above the US average rate.\nPart A fully covers brief stays for rehabilitation or convalescence in a skilled nursing facility and up to 100 days per medical necessity with a co-pay if certain criteria are met:\nThe first 20 days would be paid for in full by Medicare with the remaining 80 days requiring a co-payment of $204 per day as of 2024. Many insurance group retiree, Medigap and Part C insurance plans have a provision for additional coverage of skilled nursing care in the indemnity insurance policies they sell or health plans they sponsor. If a beneficiary uses some portion of their Part A benefit and then goes at least 60 days without receiving facility-based skilled services, the 90-day hospital clock and 100-day nursing home clock are reset and the person qualifies for new benefit periods.\nHospice benefits are also provided under Part A of Medicare for terminally ill persons with less than six months to live, as determined by the patient's physician. The terminally ill person must sign a statement that hospice care has been chosen over other Medicare-covered benefits, (e.g. assisted living or hospital care). Treatment provided includes pharmaceutical products for symptom control and pain relief as well as other services not otherwise covered by Medicare such as grief counseling. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed.\nPart B: Medical insurance.\nThe Monthly Premium for Part B for 2025 is $185.00 per month (for 2024 it was $174.70 per month).\nPart B coverage begins once a patient meets his or her deductible ($257 for 2025), then typically Medicare covers 80% of the RUC-set rate for approved services, while the remaining 20% is the responsibility of the patient, either directly or indirectly by private group retiree or Medigap insurance. Part B coverage covers 100% for preventive services such as yearly mammogram screenings, osteoporosis screening, and many other preventive screenings.\nPart B also helps with durable medical equipment (DME), including but not limited to canes, walkers, lift chairs, wheelchairs, and mobility scooters for those with mobility impairments. Prosthetic devices such as artificial limbs and breast prosthesis following mastectomy, as well as one pair of eyeglasses following cataract surgery, and oxygen for home use are also covered.\nMedically necessary emergency ambulance transport is covered by Part B if transport by any other method is dangerous to health. Non-emergency ambulance transport, or transport when not suffering from a medical emergency, may be covered if a physician orders that ambulance transport is medically necessary. Transport by an air ambulance, either fixed-wing or helicopter, may also be covered if specialized services are required that are unable to be provided by ground services.\nAnyone on Social Security (SS) in 2019 is \"held harmless\" from the 2019 amount if the increase in their SS monthly benefit does not cover the increase in their Part B premium from 2019 to 2020. This hold harmless provision is significant in years when SS does not increase but that is not the case for 2020. There are additional income-weighted surtaxes for those with incomes more than $85,000 per annum.\nPart C: Medicare Advantage plans.\nPublic Part C Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are required to offer coverage that meets or exceeds the standards set by Original Medicare but they do not have to cover every benefit in the same way (the plan must be actuarially equivalent to Original Medicare benefits). After approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, if a Part C plan chooses to cover less than Original Medicare for some benefits, such as Skilled Nursing Facility care, the savings may be passed along to consumers by offering even lower co-payments for doctor visits (or any other plus or minus aggregation approved by CMS).\nPublic Part C Medicare Advantage health plan members typically also pay a monthly premium in addition to the Medicare Part B premium to cover items not covered by Original Medicare (Parts A &amp; B), such as the out-of-pocket (OOP) limit, self-administered prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, annual physicals, coverage outside the United States, and even gym or health club memberships as well as\u2014and probably most importantly\u2014reduce the 20% co-pays and high deductibles associated with Original Medicare. But in some situations the benefits are more limited (but they can never be more limited than Original Medicare and must always include an OOP limit) and there is no premium. The OOP limit can be as low as $1500 and as high as but no higher than $9350 (as with all insurance, the lower the limit, the higher the premium). In some cases, the sponsor even rebates part or all of the Part B premium, though these types of Part C plans are becoming rare.\nPart D: Prescription drug plans.\nMedicare Part D went into effect on January 1, 2006. Anyone with Part A or B is eligible for Part D, which covers mostly self-administered drugs. It was made possible by the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. To receive this benefit, a person with Medicare must enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or public Part C health plan with integrated prescription drug coverage (MA-PD). These plans are approved and regulated by the Medicare program, but are actually designed and administered by various sponsors including charities, integrated health delivery systems, unions and health insurance companies; almost all these sponsors in turn use pharmacy benefit managers in the same way as they are used by sponsors of health insurance for those not on Medicare. Unlike Original Medicare (Part A and B), Part D coverage is not standardized (though it is highly regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Plans choose which drugs they wish to cover (but must cover at least two drugs in 148 different categories and cover all or \"substantially all\" drugs in the following protected classes of drugs: anti-cancer; anti-psychotic; anti-convulsant, anti-depressants, immuno-suppressant, and HIV and AIDS drugs). The plans can also specify, with CMS approval, at what level (or tier) they wish to cover it, and are encouraged to use step therapy. Some drugs are excluded from coverage altogether and Part D plans that cover excluded drugs are not allowed to pass those costs on to Medicare, and plans are required to repay CMS if they are found to have billed Medicare in these cases.\nOut-of-pocket costs.\nNo part of Medicare pays for all of a beneficiary's covered medical costs and many costs and services are not covered at all. The program contains premiums, deductibles and coinsurance, which the covered individual must pay out-of-pocket. A study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found the Fee-for-Service Medicare benefit package was less generous than either the typical large employer preferred provider organization plan or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. Some people may qualify to have other governmental programs (such as Medicaid) pay premiums and some or all of the costs associated with Medicare.\nPremiums.\nPart A.\nMost Medicare enrollees do not pay a monthly Part A premium, because they (or a spouse) have had 40 or more 3-month quarters in which they paid Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes. The benefit is the same no matter how much or how little the beneficiary paid as long as the minimum number of quarters is reached. Medicare-eligible persons who do not have 40 or more quarters of Medicare-covered employment may buy into Part A for an annual adjusted monthly premium of:\nPart B.\nMost Medicare Part B enrollees pay an insurance premium for this coverage; the standard Part B premium for 2019 is $135.50 a month. A new income-based premium surtax schema has been in effect since 2007, wherein Part B premiums are higher for beneficiaries with incomes exceeding $85,000 for individuals or $170,000 for married couples. Depending on the extent to which beneficiary earnings exceed the base income, these higher Part B premiums are from 30% to 70% higher with the highest premium paid by individuals earning more than $214,000, or married couples earning more than $428,000. This extra amount is called the Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). The IRMAA surcharge changes for individuals annually and fluctuates along with changes in an individual\u2019s income. The IRMAA calculation has a lag time of two years.\nDeductible and coinsurance.\nPart A\u2014For each benefit period, a beneficiary pays an annually adjusted:\nPart B\u2014After beneficiaries meet the yearly deductible of $240 for 2024, they will be required to pay a co-insurance of 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for all services covered by Part B with the exception of most lab services, which are covered at 100%. Previously, outpatient mental health services was covered at 50%, but under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, it gradually decreased over several years and now matches the 20% required for other services. They are also required to pay an excess charge of 15% for services rendered by physicians who do not accept assignment.\nThe deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance charges for Part C and D plans vary from plan to plan. All Part C plans include an annual out-of-pocket (OOP) upper spend limit. Original Medicare does not include an OOP limit.\nMedicare supplement (Medigap) policies.\nAll insurance companies that sell Medigap policies are required to make Plan A available, and if they offer any other policies, they must also make either Plan C available as well. Plan F is no longer offered as of 2020, but anyone who has a Plan F may keep it. Many of the insurance companies that offer Medigap insurance policies also sponsor Part C health plans, but most Part C health plans are sponsored by integrated health delivery systems and their spin-offs, charities, and unions as opposed to insurance companies.\nPayment for services.\nMedicare contracts with regional insurance companies to process over one billion fee-for-service claims per year. In 2008, Medicare accounted for 13% ($386 billion) of the federal budget. In 2016 it was projected to account for close to 15% ($683 billion) of the total expenditures. For the decade 2010\u20132019 Medicare was projected to cost 6.4 trillion dollars.\nReimbursement for Part A services.\nFor institutional care, such as hospital and nursing home care, Medicare uses prospective payment systems. In a prospective payment system, the health care institution receives a set amount of money for each episode of care provided to a patient, regardless of the actual amount of care. The actual allotment of funds is based on a list of diagnosis-related groups (DRG). The actual amount depends on the primary diagnosis that is actually made at the hospital. There are some issues surrounding Medicare's use of DRGs because if the patient uses less care, the hospital gets to keep the remainder. This, in theory, should balance the costs for the hospital. However, if the patient uses more care, then the hospital has to cover its own losses. This results in the issue of \"upcoding\", when a physician makes a more severe diagnosis to hedge against accidental costs.\nReimbursement for Part B services.\nPayment for physician services under Medicare has evolved since the program was created in 1965. Initially, Medicare compensated physicians based on the physician's charges, and allowed physicians to bill Medicare beneficiaries the amount in excess of Medicare's reimbursement. In 1975, annual increases in physician fees were limited by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). The MEI was designed to measure changes in costs of physician's time and operating expenses, adjusted for changes in physician productivity. From 1984 to 1991, the yearly change in fees was determined by legislation. This was done because physician fees were rising faster than projected.\nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 made several changes to physician payments under Medicare. Firstly, it introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule, which took effect in 1992. Secondly, it limited the amount Medicare non-providers could balance bill Medicare beneficiaries. Thirdly, it introduced the Medicare Volume Performance Standards (MVPS) as a way to control costs.\nOn January 1, 1992, Medicare introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS), a list of about 7,000 services that can be billed for. Each service is priced within the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) with three Relative Value Units (RVUs) values largely determining the price. The three RVUs for a procedure are each geographically weighted and the weighted RVU value is multiplied by a global Conversion Factor (CF), yielding a price in dollars. The RVUs themselves are largely decided by a private group of 29 (mostly specialist) physicians\u2014the American Medical Association's Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC).\nFrom 1992 to 1997, adjustments to physician payments were adjusted using the MEI and the MVPS, which essentially tried to compensate for the increasing volume of services provided by physicians by decreasing their reimbursement per service.\nIn 1998, Congress replaced the VPS with the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR). This was done because of highly variable payment rates under the MVPS. The SGR attempts to control spending by setting yearly and cumulative spending targets. If actual spending for a given year exceeds the spending target for that year, reimbursement rates are adjusted downward by decreasing the Conversion Factor (CF) for RBRVS RVUs.\nIn 2002, payment rates were cut by 4.8%. In 2003, payment rates were scheduled to be reduced by 4.4%. However, Congress boosted the cumulative SGR target in the Consolidated Appropriation Resolution of 2003 (P.L. 108\u20137), allowing payments for physician services to rise 1.6%. In 2004 and 2005, payment rates were again scheduled to be reduced. The Medicare Modernization Act (P.L. 108\u2013173) increased payments by 1.5% for those two years.\nIn 2006, the SGR mechanism was scheduled to decrease physician payments by 4.4%. (This number results from a 7% decrease in physician payments times a 2.8% inflation adjustment increase.) Congress overrode this decrease in the Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109\u2013362), and held physician payments in 2006 at their 2005 levels. Similarly, another congressional act held 2007 payments at their 2006 levels, and HR 6331 held 2008 physician payments to their 2007 levels, and provided for a 1.1% increase in physician payments in 2009. Without further continuing congressional intervention, the SGR is expected to decrease physician payments from 25% to 35% over the next several years.\nMFS has been criticized for not paying doctors enough because of the low conversion factor. By adjustments to the MFS conversion factor, it is possible to make global adjustments in payments to all doctors.\nThe SGR was the subject of possible reform legislation again in 2014. On March 14, 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4015; 113th Congress), a bill that would have replaced the (SGR) formula with new systems for establishing those payment rates. However, the bill would pay for these changes by delaying the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate requirement, a proposal that was very unpopular with Democrats. The SGR was expected to cause Medicare reimbursement cuts of 24 percent on April 1, 2014, if a solution to reform or delay the SGR was not found. This led to another bill, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress), which would delay those cuts until March 2015. This bill was also controversial. The American Medical Association and other medical groups opposed it, asking Congress to provide a permanent solution instead of just another delay.\nThe SGR process was replaced by new rules as of the passage of MACRA in 2015.\nProvider participation.\nThere are two ways for providers to be reimbursed in Medicare. \"Participating\" providers accept \"assignment\", which means that they accept Medicare's approved rate for their services as payment (typically 80% from Medicare and 20% from the beneficiary). Some non-participating doctors do not take assignment, but they also treat Medicare enrollees and are authorized to balance bills no more than a small fixed amount above Medicare's approved rate. A minority of doctors are \"private contractors\" from a Medicare perspective, which means they opt out of Medicare and refuse to accept Medicare payments altogether. These doctors are required to inform patients that they will be liable for the full cost of their services out-of-pocket, often in advance of treatment.\nWhile the majority of providers accept Medicare assignments, (97 percent for some specialties), and most physicians still accept at least some new Medicare patients, that number is in decline. While 80% of physicians in the Texas Medical Association accepted new Medicare patients in 2000, only 60% were doing so by 2012. A study published in 2012 concluded that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on the recommendations of an American Medical Association advisory panel. The study led by Miriam J. Laugesen, of Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, and colleagues at UCLA and the University of Illinois, shows that for services provided between 1994 and 2010, CMS agreed with 87.4% of the recommendations of the committee, known as RUC or the Relative Value Update Committee.\nOffice medication reimbursement.\nChemotherapy and other medications dispensed in a physician's office are reimbursed according to the Average Sales Price (ASP), a number computed by taking the total dollar sales of a drug as the numerator and the number of units sold nationwide as the denominator. The current reimbursement formula is known as \"ASP+6\" since it reimburses physicians at 106% of the ASP of drugs. Pharmaceutical company discounts and rebates are included in the calculation of ASP, and tend to reduce it. In addition, Medicare pays 80% of ASP+6, which is the equivalent of 84.8% of the actual average cost of the drug. Some patients have supplemental insurance or can afford the co-pay. Large numbers do not. This leaves the payment to physicians for most of the drugs in an \"underwater\" state. ASP+6 superseded Average Wholesale Price in 2005, after a 2003 front-page \"New York Times\" article drew attention to the inaccuracies of Average Wholesale Price calculations.\nThis procedure is scheduled to change dramatically in 2017 under a CMS proposal that will likely be finalized in October 2016.\nMedicare 10 percent incentive payments.\n\"Physicians in geographic Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and Physician Scarcity Areas (PSAs) can receive incentive payments from Medicare. Payments are made on a quarterly basis, rather than claim-by-claim, and are handled by each area's Medicare carrier.\"\nEnrollment.\nGenerally, if an individual already receives Social Security payments, at age 65 the individual becomes automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (medical insurance). If the individual chooses not to enroll in Part B (typically because the individual is still working and receiving employer insurance), then the individual must proactively opt out of it when receiving the automatic enrollment package. Delay in enrollment in Part B carries no penalty if the individual has other insurance (e.g., the employment situation noted above), but may be penalized under other circumstances. An individual who does not receive Social Security benefits upon turning 65 must sign up for Medicare if they want it. Penalties may apply if the individual chooses not to enroll at age 65 and does not have other insurance.\nThe 2025 Health Insurance Open Enrollment (October 15 to December 7), which is taking place as the entire medical insurance market is facing financial pressure, features wholesale changes in Medicare Advantage coverage. \nParts A &amp; B.\nPart A Late Enrollment Penalty.\nIf an individual is not eligible for premium-free Part A, and they do not buy a premium-based Part A when they are first eligible, the monthly premium may go up 10%. The individual must pay the higher premium for twice the number of years that they could have had Part A, but did not sign up. For example, if they were eligible for Part A for two years but did not sign up, they must pay the higher premium for four years. Usually, individuals do not have to pay a penalty if they meet certain conditions that allow them to sign up for Part A during a Special Enrollment Period, such as taking up residency in another state or otherwise moving outside of one's former coverage area.\nPart B Late Enrollment Penalty.\nIf an individual does not sign up for Part B when they are first eligible, they may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as they have Medicare. Their monthly premium for Part B may go up 10% for each full 12-month period that they could have had Part B, but did not sign up for it. Usually, they do not pay a late enrollment penalty if they meet certain conditions that allow them to sign up for Part B during a special enrollment period.\nComparison with private insurance.\nMedicare differs from private insurance available to working Americans in that it is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to provide health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the cost of health care. In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and ensure that their costs do not exceed premiums.\nBecause the federal government is legally obligated to provide Medicare benefits to older and some disabled Americans, it cannot cut costs by restricting eligibility or benefits, except by going through a difficult legislative process, or by revising its interpretation of medical necessity. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are \"reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member\", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment. Cutting costs by cutting benefits is difficult, but the program can also achieve substantial economies of scale in the prices it pays for health care and administrative expenses\u2014and, as a result, private insurers' costs have grown almost 60% more than Medicare's since 1970. Medicare's cost growth is now the same as GDP growth and expected to stay well below private insurance's for the next decade.\nBecause Medicare offers statutorily determined benefits, its coverage policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees are entitled to the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers in the private sector can find it difficult to know what their policy covers, and at what cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees\u2014data that private insurers treat as trade secrets\u2014it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.\nMedicare also has an important role in driving changes in the entire health care system. Because Medicare pays for a huge share of health care in every region of the country, it has a great deal of power to set delivery and payment policies. For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRGs, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable care organizations or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.\nCosts and funding challenges.\nOver the long-term, Medicare faces significant financial challenges because of rising overall health care costs, increasing enrollment as the population ages, and a decreasing ratio of workers to enrollees. Total Medicare spending was projected to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to around $900 billion by 2020. From 2010 to 2030, Medicare enrollment is projected to increase, from 47 million to 79 million, and the ratio of workers to enrollees is expected to decrease from 3.7 to 2.4. However, the ratio of workers to retirees has declined steadily for decades, and social insurance systems have remained sustainable due to rising worker productivity. There is some evidence that productivity gains will continue to offset demographic trends in the near future.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) wrote in 2008 that \"future growth in spending per beneficiary for Medicare and Medicaid\u2014the federal government's major health care programs\u2014will be the most important determinant of long-term trends in federal spending. Changing those programs in ways that reduce the growth of costs\u2014which will be difficult, in part because of the complexity of health policy choices\u2014is ultimately the nation's central long-term challenge in setting federal fiscal policy.\"\nOverall health care costs were projected in 2011 to increase by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, in part because of increased use of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. Health care costs are rising faster than inflation across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. Since 1970, the per-capita cost of private insurance coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers. Over the next decade, Medicare's per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance's 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing health care costs is essential to the nation's fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.\nIndicators.\nSeveral measures serve as indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue with these indicators is comparing future projections against current law vs. what actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. Actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.\nTotal Medicare spending as a share of GDP.\nThis measure, which examines Medicare spending in the context of the US economy as a whole, is projected to increase from 3.7 percent in 2017 to 6.2 percent by 2092 under current law and over 9 percent under what actuaries really expect will happen (called an \"illustrative example\" in recent-year Trustees Reports).\nThe solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund.\nThis measure involves only Medicare Part A. The trust fund is considered insolvent when available revenue plus any existing balances will not cover 100 percent of annual projected costs. According to the 2018 estimate by the Medicare trustees, the trust fund was expected to become insolvent in 8 years (2026), at which time available revenue will cover around 85 percent of annual projected costs for Part A services. Since Medicare began, this solvency projection has ranged from two to 28 years, with an average of 11.3 years. This and other projections in Medicare Trustees reports are based on what its actuaries call the intermediate scenario but the reports also include worst-case and best-case projections that are quite different (other scenarios presume Congress will change present law).\nMedicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth.\nPer capita spending relative to inflation per-capita GDP growth was to be an important factor used by the PPACA-specified Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), as a measure to determine whether it must recommend to Congress proposals to reduce Medicare costs. However, the IPAB never formed and was formally repealed by the Balanced Budget Act of 2018.\nGeneral fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending.\nThis measure, established under the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), examines Medicare spending in the context of the federal budget. Each year, MMA requires the Medicare trustees to make a determination about whether general fund revenue is projected to exceed 45 percent of total program spending within a seven-year period. If the Medicare trustees make this determination in two consecutive years, a \"funding warning\" is issued. In response, the president must submit cost-saving legislation to Congress, which must consider this legislation on an expedited basis. This threshold was reached and a warning issued every year between 2006 and 2013 but it has not been reached since that time and was not expected to be reached in the 2016\u20132022 \"window\". This is a reflection of the reduced spending growth mandated by the ACA according to the Trustees.\nUnfunded obligation.\nMedicare's unfunded obligation is the total amount of money that would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the gap between projected revenues (mostly Part B premiums and Part A payroll taxes to be paid over the timeframe under current law) and spending over a given timeframe. By law the timeframe used is 75 years though the Medicare actuaries also give an infinite-horizon estimate because life expectancy consistently increases and other economic factors underlying the estimates change.\nAs of January 1, 2016, Medicare's unfunded obligation over the 75-year time frame is $3.8 trillion for the Part A Trust Fund and $28.6 trillion for Part B. Over an infinite timeframe, the combined unfunded liability for both programs combined is over $50 trillion, with the difference primarily in the Part B estimate. These estimates assume that CMS will pay full benefits as currently specified over those periods though that would be contrary to current United States law. In addition, as discussed throughout each annual Trustees' report, \"the Medicare projections shown could be substantially understated as a result of other potentially unsustainable elements of current law.\" For example, current law effectively provides no raises for doctors after 2025; that is unlikely to happen. It is impossible for actuaries to estimate unfunded liability other than assuming current law is followed (except relative to benefits as noted), the Trustees state \"that actual long-range present values for (Part A) expenditures and (Part B/D) expenditures and revenues could exceed the amounts estimated by a substantial margin.\"\nPublic opinion.\nPopular opinion surveys show that the public views Medicare's problems as serious, but not as urgent as other concerns. In January 2006, the Pew Research Center found 62 percent of the public said addressing Medicare's financial problems should be a high priority for the government, but that still put it behind other priorities. Surveys suggest that there is no public consensus behind any specific strategy to keep the program solvent.\nFraud and waste.\nThe Government Accountability Office lists Medicare as a \"high-risk\" government program in need of reform, in part because of its vulnerability to fraud and partly because of its long-term financial problems. Fewer than 5% of Medicare claims are audited.\nCriticism.\nRobert M. Ball, a former commissioner of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 and later under Johnson and Nixon, defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly: the high cost of care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment. In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as Blue Cross, which had originally applied the principle of community rating, faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not community rate, and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.\nMedicare is not generally an unearned entitlement. Entitlement is most commonly based on a record of contributions to the Medicare fund. As such it is a form of social insurance making it feasible for people to pay for insurance for sickness in old age when they are young and able to work and be assured of getting back benefits when they are older and no longer working. Some people will pay in more than they receive back and others will receive more benefits than they paid in. Unlike private insurance where some amount must be paid to attain coverage, all eligible persons can receive coverage regardless of how much or if they had ever paid in.\nPoliticized payment.\nBruce Vladeck, director of the Health Care Financing Administration in the Clinton administration, has argued that lobbyists have changed the Medicare program \"from one that provides a legal entitlement to beneficiaries to one that provides a de facto political entitlement to providers.\"\nQuality of beneficiary services.\nA 2001 study by the Government Accountability Office evaluated the quality of responses given by Medicare contractor customer service representatives to provider (physician) questions. The evaluators assembled a list of questions, which they asked during a random sampling of calls to Medicare contractors. The rate of complete, accurate information provided by Medicare customer service representatives was 15%. Since then, steps have been taken to improve the quality of customer service given by Medicare contractors, specifically the https:// contractor. As a result, https:// customer service representatives (CSR) have seen an increase in training, quality assurance monitoring has significantly increased, and a customer satisfaction survey is offered to random callers.\nHospital accreditation.\nIn most states the Joint Commission, a private, non-profit organization for accrediting hospitals, decides whether or not a hospital is able to participate in Medicare, as currently there are no competitor organizations recognized by CMS.\nOther organizations can also accredit hospitals for Medicare. These include the Community Health Accreditation Program, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, the Compliance Team and the Healthcare Quality Association on Accreditation.\nAccreditation is voluntary and an organization may choose to be evaluated by their State Survey Agency or by CMS directly.\nGraduate medical education.\nMedicare funds the vast majority of residency training in the US. This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education payments. Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals in exchange for training resident physicians. For the 2008 fiscal year these payments were $2.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Overall funding levels have remained at the same level since 1996, so that the same number or fewer residents have been trained under this program. Meanwhile, the US population continues to grow both older and larger, which has led to greater demand for physicians, in part due to higher rates of illness and disease among the elderly compared to younger individuals. At the same time, the cost of medical services continues rising rapidly, and many geographic areas face physician shortages, both trends suggesting the supply of physicians remains too low.\nMedicare thus finds itself in the odd position of having assumed control of the single largest funding source for graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, as well as for physician reimbursement rates. This has forced hospitals to look for alternative sources of funding for residency slots. This halt in funding, in turn, exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physician assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.\nLegislation and reform.\nIn 1977, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was established as a federal agency responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid. This would be renamed to Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2001. By 1983, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) replaced pay for service reimbursements to hospitals for Medicare patients.\nPresident Bill Clinton attempted an overhaul of Medicare through his health care reform plan in 1993\u20131994 but was unable to get the legislation passed by Congress.\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law on December 8, 2003. Part of this legislation included filling gaps in prescription-drug coverage left by the Medicare Secondary Payer Act that was enacted in 1980. The 2003 bill strengthened the Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-Aside Program (WCMSA) that is monitored and administered by CMS.\nOn August 1, 2007, the US House of Representatives voted to reduce payments to Medicare Advantage providers in order to pay for expanded coverage of children's health under the SCHIP program. As of 2008, Medicare Advantage plans cost, on average, 13 percent more per person insured for like beneficiaries than direct payment plans. Many health economists have concluded that payments to Medicare Advantage providers have been excessive. The Senate, after heavy lobbying from the insurance industry, declined to agree to the cuts in Medicare Advantage proposed by the House. President Bush subsequently vetoed the SCHIP extension.\nEffects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 made a number of changes to the Medicare program. Several provisions of the law were designed to reduce the cost of Medicare. The most substantial provisions slowed the growth rate of payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities under Part A of Medicare, through a variety of methods (e.g., percentage cuts, penalties for readmissions).\nCongress also attempted to reduce payments to public Part C Medicare health plans by aligning the rules that establish Part C plans' capitated fees more closely with the FFS paid for comparable care to \"similar beneficiaries\" under Parts A and B of Medicare. Primarily these reductions involved much discretion on the part of CMS. Examples of what CMS did, included effectively ending a Part C program Congress had previously initiated to increase the use of Part C in rural areas (the so-called Part C PFFS plan) and reducing over time a program that encouraged employers and unions to create their own Part C plans not available to the general Medicare beneficiary base (so-called Part C EGWP plans) by providing higher reimbursement. These two types of Part C plans had been identified by MedPAC as the programs that most negatively affected parity between the cost of Medicare beneficiaries on Parts A/B/C and the costs of beneficiaries not on Parts A/B/C. These efforts to reach parity have been more than successful. As of 2015, all beneficiaries on A/B/C cost 4% less per person than all beneficiaries not on A/B/C. But whether that is because the cost of the former decreased or the cost of the latter increased is not known.\nPPACA also slightly reduced annual increases in payments to physicians and to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Along with other minor adjustments, these changes reduced Medicare's projected cost over the next decade by $455 billion.\nAdditionally, the PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which was empowered to submit legislative proposals to reduce the cost of Medicare if the program's per-capita spending grows faster than per-capita GDP plus one percent. The IPAB was never formed and was formally repealed by the Balanced Budget Act of 2018.\nThe PPACA also made some changes to Medicare enrollees' benefits. By 2020, it \"closed\" the so-called \"donut hole\" between Part D plans' initial spend phase coverage limits and the catastrophic cap on out-of-pocket spending, reducing a Part D enrollee's' exposure to the cost of prescription drugs by an average of $2,000 a year. That is, the template co-pay in the gap (which legally still exists) will be the same as the template co-pay in the initial spend phase, 25%. This lowered costs for about 5% of the people on Medicare. Limits were also placed on out-of-pocket costs for in-network care for public Part C health plan enrollees. Most of these plans had such a limit but ACA formalized the annual out of pocket spend limit. Beneficiaries on traditional Medicare do not get such a limit but can effectively arrange for one through private insurance.\nMeanwhile, Medicare Part B and D premiums were restructured in ways that reduced costs for most people while raising contributions from the wealthiest people with Medicare. The law also expanded coverage of or eliminated co-pays for some preventive services.\nThe PPACA instituted a number of measures to control Medicare fraud and abuse, such as longer oversight periods, provider screenings, stronger standards for certain providers, the creation of databases to share data between federal and state agencies, and stiffer penalties for violators. The law also created mechanisms, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to fund experiments to identify new payment and delivery models that could conceivably be expanded to reduce the cost of health care while improving quality.\nProposals for reforming Medicare.\nAs legislators continue to seek new ways to control the cost of Medicare, a number of new proposals to reform Medicare have been introduced in recent years.\nPremium support.\nSince the mid-1990s, there have been a number of proposals to change Medicare from a publicly run social insurance program with a defined benefit, for which there is no limit to the government's expenses, into a publicly run health plan program that offers \"premium support\" for enrollees. The basic concept behind the proposals is that the government would make a defined contribution, that is a premium support, to the health plan of a Medicare enrollee's choice. Sponsors would compete to provide Medicare benefits and this competition would set the level of fixed contribution. Additionally, enrollees would be able to purchase greater coverage by paying more in addition to the fixed government contribution. Conversely, enrollees could choose lower cost coverage and keep the difference between their coverage costs and the fixed government contribution. The goal of premium Medicare plans is for greater cost-effectiveness; if such a proposal worked as planned, the financial incentive would be greatest for Medicare plans that offer the best care at the lowest cost.\nThis concept is basically how public Medicare Part C already works (but with a much more complicated competitive bidding process that drives up costs for the Trustees, but is advantageous to the beneficiaries). Given that only about 1% of people on Medicare got premium support when Aaron and Reischauer first wrote their proposal in 1995 and the percentage is now 35%, on the way to 50% by 2040 according to the Trustees, perhaps no further reform is needed.\nThere have been a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where insurers find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Senator Ron Wyden and Rep. Paul Ryan (R\u2013Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has since argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.\nCurrently, public Part C Medicare health plans avoid this issue with an indexed risk formula that provides lower per capita payments to sponsors for relatively (remember all these people are over 65 years old) healthy plan members and higher per capita payments for less healthy members.\nChanging the age of eligibility.\nA number of different plans have been introduced that would raise the age of Medicare eligibility. Some have argued that, as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees increases, programs for the elderly need to be reduced. Since the age at which Americans can retire with full Social Security benefits has risen from 65 to 67, it is argued that the age of eligibility for Medicare should rise with it (though people can begin receiving reduced Social Security benefits as early as age 62).\nThe CBO projected that raising the age of Medicare eligibility would save $113 billion over 10 years after accounting for the necessary expansion of Medicaid and state health insurance exchange subsidies under health care reform, which are needed to help those who could not afford insurance purchase it. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that raising the age of eligibility would save the federal government $5.7 billion a year, while raising costs for other payers. According to Kaiser, raising the age would cost $3.7 billion to 65- and 66-year-olds, $2.8 billion to other consumers whose premiums would rise as insurance pools absorbed more risk, $4.5 billion to employers offering insurance, and $0.7 billion to states expanding their Medicaid rolls. Ultimately Kaiser found that the plan would raise total social costs by more than twice the savings to the federal government.\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden proposed lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years old. A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that lowering the age to 60 could reduce costs for employer health plans by up to 15% if all eligible employees shifted to Medicare.\nNegotiating the prices of prescription drugs.\nCurrently, people with Medicare can get prescription drug coverage through a public Medicare Part C plan or through the standalone Part D prescription drug plans (PDPs) program. Each plan sponsor establishes its own coverage policies and could, if desired, independently negotiate the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government's bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage. Conversely, negotiating for the sponsors is almost always done by one of three or four companies typically tied to pharmacy retailers each of whom alone has much more buying power than the entire Medicare program. That pharmacy-centric versus government-centric approach appears to have worked given that Part D has cost 50% or more under original projected spending and has held average annual drug spending by seniors in absolute dollars fairly constant for over 10 years.\nMany look to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as a model of lower cost prescription drug coverage. Since the VHA provides healthcare directly, it maintains its own formulary and negotiates prices with manufacturers. Studies show that the VHA pays substantially less for drugs than the PDP plans Medicare Part D subsidizes. One analysis found that adopting a formulary similar to the VHA's would save Medicare $14 billion a year.\nThere are other proposals for savings on prescription drugs that do not require such fundamental changes to Medicare Part D's payment and coverage policies. Manufacturers who supply drugs to Medicaid are required to offer a 15 percent rebate on the average manufacturer's price. Low-income elderly individuals who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid receive drug coverage through Medicare Part D, and no reimbursement is paid for the drugs the government purchases for them. Reinstating that rebate would yield savings of $112 billion, according to a recent CBO estimate. Some have questioned the ability of the federal government to achieve greater savings than the largest PDPs, since some of the larger plans have coverage pools comparable to Medicare's, though the evidence from the VHA is promising. Some also worry that controlling the prices of prescription drugs would reduce incentives for manufacturers to invest in research and development, though the same could be said of anything that would reduce costs. However, the comparisons with the VHA point out that the VHA covers about half the drugs as Part D.\nReforming care for the \"dual-eligibles\".\nRoughly nine million Americans\u2014mostly older adults with low incomes\u2014are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These men and women tend to have particularly poor health\u2014more than half are being treated for five or more chronic conditions\u2014and high costs. Average annual per-capita spending for \"dual-eligibles\" is $20,000, compared to $10,900 for the Medicare population as a whole.\nThe dual-eligible population comprises roughly 20 percent of Medicare's enrollees but accounts for 36 percent of its costs. There is substantial evidence that these individuals receive highly inefficient care because responsibility for their care is split between the Medicare and Medicaid programs\u2014most see a number of different providers without any kind of mechanism to coordinate their care, and they face high rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations. Because Medicaid and Medicare cover different aspects of health care, both have a financial incentive to shunt patients into care the other program pays for.\nMany experts have suggested that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in the Medicare program, mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such programs would connect patients with primary care, create an individualized health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health. The general ethos of these proposals is to \"treat the patient, not the condition,\" and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.\nThere is some controversy over who exactly should take responsibility for coordinating the care of the dual-eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual-eligibles into existing Medicaid managed care plans, which are controlled by individual states. But many states facing severe budget shortfalls might have some incentive to stint on necessary care or otherwise shift costs to enrollees and their families to capture some Medicaid savings. Medicare has more experience managing the care of older adults, and is already expanding coordinated care programs under the ACA, though there are some questions about private Medicare plans' capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.\nEstimated savings from more effective coordinated care for the dual eligibles range from $125 billion to over $200 billion, mostly by eliminating unnecessary, expensive hospital admissions.\nIncome-relating Medicare premiums.\nBoth House Republicans and President Obama proposed increasing the additional premiums paid by the wealthiest people with Medicare, compounding several reforms in the ACA that would increase the number of wealthier individuals paying higher, income-related Part B and Part D premiums. Such proposals were projected to save $20 billion over the course of a decade, and would ultimately result in more than a quarter of Medicare enrollees paying between 35 and 90 percent of their Part B costs by 2035, rather than the typical 25 percent. If the brackets mandated for 2035 were implemented today, it would mean that anyone earning more than $47,000 (as an individual) or $94,000 (as a couple) would be affected. Under the Republican proposals, affected individuals would pay 40 percent of the total Part B and Part D premiums, which would be equivalent of $2,500.\nMore limited income-relation of premiums only raises limited revenue. Currently, 5 percent of Medicare enrollees pay an income-related premium, and most pay 35 percent of their total costs (on average), compared to the 25 percent most people pay. Only a negligible number of enrollees fall into the higher income brackets required to bear a more substantial share of their costs\u2014roughly half a percent of individuals and less than three percent of married couples currently pay more than 35 percent of their total Part B costs.\nThere is some concern that tying premiums to income would weaken Medicare politically over the long run, since people tend to be more supportive of universal social programs than of means-tested ones.\nMedigap restrictions.\nSome Medicare supplemental insurance (or \"Medigap\") plans cover all of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers believe that such plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are a major cause of rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in some deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond that, could save $50 billion over 10 years. But it would also increase health care costs substantially for people with costly health care needs.\nThere is some evidence that claims of Medigap's tendency to cause over-treatment may be exaggerated and that potential savings from restricting it might be smaller than expected. Meanwhile, there are some concerns about the potential effects on enrollees. Individuals who face high charges with every episode of care have been shown to delay or forgo needed care, jeopardizing their health and possibly increasing their health care costs over time. Given their lack of medical training, most patients tend to have difficulty distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary treatments. The problem could be exaggerated among the Medicare population, which has low levels of health literacy.\nVision Coverage.\nThe Build Back Better legislation was passed in Congress in November 2021, and adds hearing services subject to Medicare Part B deductible and 20% coinsurance beginning in 2023. The initial proposal of this bill also aimed to address gaps in Medicare such as dental and vision coverage, however both services were removed following objections in the Senate. A study performed by Urban Institute showed that Medicare enrollees spend more on routine vision services ($8.4 billion) than routine hearing services ($5.7 billion), of which $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion were spent out of pocket respectively. In addition, nearly 1 in 3 Medicare beneficiaries used vision services annually, and averages a spending of $411 per person; as such, the impact of expanding Medicare to include vision services would benefit many people. There is an income gradient seen in those who use vision services and a severe unmet needs for these services in those with lower incomes. Enrollees below the federal poverty level spent $190, whereas those 400% above the level spent $465; and a likely trend that far fewer non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic beneficiaries use and spend on vision services\u2014which is in keeping with the trend seen with hearing aids.\nMedicare for All.\nThe Medicare for All Act would dramatically expand the Medicare program to cover all US residents with automatic enrollment upon birth or residency providing coverage for items and services that are medically necessary to maintain health or to diagnose, treat, or rehabilitate a health condition, including hospital services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, dental and vision services, home- and community-based long-term care, gender affirming care, and reproductive care, including contraception and abortions. The bill was first introduced in the US House of Representatives by Representative John Conyers in 2003. The act was most recently introduced in the US Senate by Senator Bernie Sanders on May 17th, 2023.\nLegislative oversight.\nThe following congressional committees provide oversight for Medicare programs:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58354", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58354", "title": "Medicare (Canada)", "text": "Canada's publicly funded, single-payer health care system\nMedicare () is an unofficial designation used to refer to the publicly funded single-payer healthcare system of Canada. The system consists of ten provincial and three territorial health insurance plans, which provide universal healthcare coverage to Canadian citizens, permanent residents and, depending on the province or territory, certain temporary residents. The systems are individually administered on a provincial or territorial basis, within guidelines set by the federal government. The formal terminology for the insurance system is provided by the 1984 \"Canada Health Act\" (\"\") and the health insurance legislation of the individual provinces and territories.\nThe name is a contraction of \"medical\" and \"care\" and has been used in the United States for health care programs since at least 1953, with Medicare becoming that nation\u2019s official national health insurance program.\nUnder the terms of the \"Canada Health Act\", all \"insured persons\" are entitled to receive \"insured services\" without copayment. Such services are defined as medically necessary services if provided in hospital or by practitioners (usually physicians). Approximately 70 percent of expenditures for healthcare in Canada come from public sources, with the rest paid privately (through both private insurance and out-of-pocket payments). The extent of public financing varies considerably across services. For example, approximately 99 percent of physician services and 90 percent of hospital care are paid by publicly funded sources, but almost all dental care is paid for privately. Most physicians are self-employed private entities that enjoy coverage under each province's respective healthcare plans.\nServices of non-physicians working within hospitals are covered; conversely, provinces have the option to cover services by non-physicians if they are provided outside hospitals. Changing the site of treatment may thus change coverage. For example, pharmaceuticals, nursing care, and physical therapy must be covered for inpatients, but there is considerable variation from province to province in the extent to which they are covered for patients discharged to the community such as after day surgery. The need to modernize coverage was pointed out in 2002 by both the Romanow Commission and the Kirby committee of the Canadian Senate (see External links below). Similarly, the extent to which non-physician providers of primary care are funded varies. For example, Quebec offers primary health care teams through its CLSC system.\nHistory.\nPrior to World War II, health care in Canada was privately funded and delivered, with the exception of services provided to the sick poor that were financed by local governments. The traumatic experience of the 1930s left many Canadians in challenging financial situations. As personal financial situations deteriorated, the municipal governments were overwhelmed. Though the provinces provided relief payments for food, clothing, and shelter, additional medical costs were beyond the capacity of most of the provincial budgets. Many Canadians were not receiving adequate medical care, and those that did were overwhelmed with the associated costs. As such, preventable diseases and deaths were still common occurrences.\nTen years of economic depression, followed by six years of worldwide war, formed the social context of ambitious federal Green Book proposals. In a bid for unprecedented cooperation between the federal and provincial governments, these initiatives formed the foundations of a national program for social security, including provisions for health insurance. However, the failure to come to a consensus on the required allocation of tax resources at the Dominion-Provincial Conference in August 1945 precluded adoption and delayed subsequent action. Although the Green Book proposals were not adopted, they effectively created an appetite for government-funded health services.\nFollowing the Green Book proposals, Saskatchewan in 1947 and Alberta in 1950, under provincial governments led by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the Social Credit party respectively, led initiatives to implement publicly funded health care at the provincial level. The first implementation of public health care at the federal level came about with the \"Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act\" (HIDS), which was passed by the Liberal majority government of Louis St. Laurent in 1957, and was adopted by all provinces by 1961. The HIDS implemented a high degree of federal regulation of the provincial health systems.\nThe fight for a broad publicly funded system began at the provincial level, and was originally led by Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas and the CCF, who won the 1960 Saskatchewan general election on a campaign promise of publicly funded health care, over the opposition of the medical profession. When Douglas resigned to become the leader of the new federal New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961, the task of implementing Medicare fell to Woodrow Stanley Lloyd, who succeeded Douglas as premier. Lloyd overcame considerable public opposition to the plan, including a strike by the province's doctors, who withdrew their services from the public in opposition to the proposed medicare plan. The resolution of the dispute was assisted by mediation by a British Labour peer, Lord Taylor, who had been involved in the development of the National Health Service in Britain.\nThe next stage in the development of Medicare was the Royal Commission on Health Services, 1961 to 1964, often cited as the Hall Commission, after its chair, Supreme Court Justice Emmett Hall. The commission was created by another Saskatchewanian, Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker, who appointed Hall, also from Saskatchewan, to chair the commission. Both Diefenbaker and Hall were Progressive Conservatives, unlike the CCF government of Saskatchewan. In 1964, after intensive study and public consultations, the Hall Commission released the first volume of its report, calling for federal funding for a national medicare plan.\nBy the time the Hall Commission made its report, the Diefenbaker government had been defeated in the 1963 federal election. The new prime minister, Lester Pearson, had campaigned on establishing a national health care system. He began to work towards implementing a plan. His first Minister of Health, Judy LaMarsh, continued internal reviews and consultations with her provincial counterparts to implement the proposals. Pearson also consulted with the provincial premiers, and encountered provincial opposition. Alberta, Quebec, and Ontario all opposed the initial federal proposals, suggesting that each province should develop its own plan. Following his initial consultations, Pearson and his government developed a new, more decentralised plan. Relying on the advice of Al Johnson, the federal Deputy Minister of Finance and former Deputy Provincial Treasurer in Saskatchewan during the development of Medicare, the new plan set out four requirements. To be eligible for federal funding, a province would have to have (1) a publicly administered funding system, (2) providing universal coverage to residents, (3) for medically necessary services, (4) with portability when people moved. Although the provincial premiers were surprised that the proposal lacked central regulation of health care, continuing to leave the operation of the health systems to the provinces, some premiers such as Premier Manning of Alberta continued to oppose the federal proposal.\nIn the 1965 federal election, the Liberals campaigned on implementing their proposal. Although they were re-elected, it was with a minority, meaning that they would need at least some opposition support to have their proposed plan passed by Parliament. A split now developed in the Liberal Cabinet and caucus. The new Minister of Health and Welfare, Allan MacEachen, pushed for the enactment of the proposals, introducing the \"Medical Care Act, 1966\" into Parliament. Although opposed by the MPs for Progressive Conservative Party and Social Credit, the bill received support from the New Democratic Party, led by Tommy Douglas. It passed first reading in the House of Commons.\nHowever, when Prime Minister Pearson left the country to attend a Commonwealth conference, the Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Mitchell Sharp, stated that the government might not be able to afford the new program, in light of the financial state of the country, and called to defer passage. The proposed policy shift almost triggered MacEachen's resignation, and generated internal debates in the Liberal party. As word of the split within the Liberals became public, the PC and Social Credit MPs began to put greater pressure on the government to stop the bill in the Commons. The bill eventually passed second and third readings with NDP support, after contentious debates. The government agreed to defer implementation of the Act for one year, coming in force on July 1, 1968.\nIn 1984, the \"Canada Health Act\" was passed, amalgamating the 1966 \"Medical Care Act\" and the 1957 \"Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act\". The \"Canada Health Act\" affirmed and clarified five founding principles: (a) \"public administration\" on a non-profit basis by a public authority; (b) \"comprehensiveness\" \u2013 provincial health plans must insure all services that are medically necessary; (c) \"universality\" \u2013 a guarantee that all residents in Canada must have access to public healthcare and insured services on uniform terms and conditions; (d) \"portability\" \u2013 residents must be covered while temporarily absent from their province of residence or from Canada; and (e) \"accessibility\" \u2013 insured persons must have reasonable and uniform access to insured health services, free of financial or other barriers. These five conditions prevent provinces from radical innovation, but many small differences do exist between the provinces.\nEligibility.\nEach province and territory can establish residency requirements for eligibility for coverage. For example, to qualify for enrollment in Ontario, one must, among other requirements, \"be physically present in Ontario for 153 days in any 12-month period; and be physically present in Ontario for at least 153 days of the first 183 days immediately after establishing residency in the province.\"\nFunding.\nAccording to the Canadian Constitution, the provinces have responsibility for health care, education and welfare. However, the federal \"Canada Health Act\" sets standards for all the provinces. The \"Canada Health Act\" requires coverage for all medically necessary care provided in hospitals or by physicians, which explicitly includes diagnostic, treatment and preventive services. Coverage is universal for qualifying Canadian residents, regardless of income level.\nFunding for the health care is transferred from the general revenues of the Canadian federal government to the ten provinces and the three territories through the Canada Health Transfer. Some provinces also charge annual health care premiums. These are, in effect, taxes (since they are not tied to service use, nor to provincial health expenditures). The system is accordingly classified by the OECD as a tax-supported system, as opposed to the social insurance approaches used in many European countries. Boards in each province or territory regulate the cost, which is then reimbursed by the provincial or territorial government. Patients do not pay out of pocket costs to visit their doctor.\nDelivery.\nCanada uses a mix of public and private organizations to deliver health care in what is termed a publicly funded, privately delivered system. Hospitals and acute care facilities, including long term complex care, are typically directly funded. Health care organizations bill the provincial health authorities, with few exceptions. Hospitals are largely non-profit organizations, historically often linked to religious or charitable organizations. In some provinces, individual hospital boards have been eliminated and combined into quasi-private regional health authorities, subject to varying degrees of provincial control.\nPrivate services are provided by diagnostic laboratories, occupational and physical therapy centres, and other allied professionals. Non-medically necessary services, such as optional plastic surgery, are also often delivered by for-profit investor-owned corporations. In some cases patients pay directly and are reimbursed by the health care system, and in other cases a hospital or physician may order services and seek reimbursement from the provincial government.\nWith rare exceptions, medical doctors are small for-profit independent businesses. Historically, they have practised in small solo or group practices and billed the government Canadian Health Care system on a fee for service basis. Unlike the practice in fully socialized countries, hospital-based physicians are not all hospital employees, and some directly bill the provincial insurance plans on a fee-for-service basis. Since 2000, physicians have been allowed to incorporate for tax reasons (dates of authorization vary province to province).\nEfforts to achieve \"primary health care reform\" have increasingly encouraged physicians to work in multidisciplinary teams, and be paid through blended funding models, including elements of capitation and other 'alternative funding formulas'. Similarly, some hospitals (particularly teaching hospitals and rural/remote hospitals) have also experimented with alternatives to fee-for-service.\nIn summary, the system is known as a \"public system\" due to its public financing, but is not a nationalized system such as the UK's NHS: most health care services are provided privately.\nAn additional complexity is that, because health care is under provincial jurisdiction, there is not a \"Canadian health care system\". Most providers are private, and may or may not coordinate their care. Publicly funded insurance is organized at the level of the province/territory; each manages its own insurance system, including issuing its own healthcare identification cards (a list of the provincial medical care insurance programs is given at the end of this entry). Once care moves beyond the services required by the \"Canada Health Act\"\u2014for which universal comprehensive coverage applies\u2014there is inconsistency from province to province in the extent of publicly funded coverage, particularly for such items as outpatient drug coverage and rehabilitation, as well as vision care, mental health, and long-term care, with a substantial portion of such services being paid for privately, either through private insurance, or out-of-pocket. Eligibility for these additional programs may be based on various combinations of such factors as age (e.g., children, seniors), income, enrollment in a home care program, or diagnosis (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, cystic fibrosis).\nAccording to a 1958 study, provincial governments have been responsible for providing necessary medical and hospital care \"to indigent residents of municipally unorganized territory\". By 1980, the individual provinces had (as noted by one study) \u201cvarious schemes to provide out-of-hospital drug coverage,\u201d although the majority of provinces limited such coverage to those in receipt of welfare and to the elderly.\nDrug coverage.\nUnlike every other country with universal health insurance systems, Canada lacks a universal pharmaceutical subsidy scheme, with co-payment, cost ceilings, and special subsidy groups varying by private insurer and by province. Each province may provide its own prescription drug benefit plan, although the \"Canada Health Act\" requires only coverage for pharmaceuticals delivered to hospital inpatients. Provincial prescription drug benefit plans differ across provinces. Some provinces cover only those in particular age groups (usually, seniors) and/or those on social assistance. Others are more universal. Quebec achieves universal coverage through a combination of private and public plans. Co-payments also vary. Provinces maintain their own provincial formularies, although the Common Drug Review provides evidence-based formulary listing recommendations to the provincial ministries. Note that there is ongoing controversy in Canada, as in other countries, about inclusion of expensive drugs and discrepancies in their availability, as well as in what if any provisions are made for allowing medications not yet approved to be administered under \"exceptional drug\" provisions. Drug costs are contentious. Their prices are controlled by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB). The PMPRB's pricing formula ensures that Canada pays prices based on the average of those charged to selected countries; they are neither the highest, nor the lowest.\nSince Medicare has been adopted, there have been regular pushes to add universal pharmacare to it. This came to a head in 2022, when the New Democratic Party and the governing Liberal Party negotiated a supply and confidence agreement, with pharmacare being one of the core concessions the Liberals made in exchange for the NDP's confidence. As a result of this coalition, Canada's pharmacare act received royal assent on October 10, 2024, with the first phase creating a single payer system for contraceptives and diabetic medications, as well as the creation of a government agency to identify which drugs will be added next. Since becoming law, the federal government has begun negotiating with the provinces on how it will be implemented, with British Columbia becoming the first province to sign on to the program.\nDental care, eye care, and other services.\nDental care is not required to be covered by the government insurance plans. In Quebec, children under the age of 10 receive almost full coverage, and many oral surgeries are covered for everyone. Canadians rely on their employers or individual private insurance, pay cash themselves for dental treatments, or receive no care. In some jurisdictions, public health units have been involved in providing targeted programs to address the need of the young, the elderly or those who are on welfare. The Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry tracks programs, and has been advocating for extending coverage to those currently unable to receive dental care.\nThe range of services for vision care coverage also varies widely among the provinces. Generally, \"medically required\" vision care is covered if provided by physicians (cataract surgery, diabetic vision care, some laser eye surgeries required as a result of disease, but not if the purpose is to replace the need for eyeglasses). Similarly, the standard vision test may or may not be covered. Some provinces allow a limited number of tests (e.g., no more than once within a two-year period). Others, including Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, do not, although different provisions may apply to particular sub-groups (e.g., diabetics, children).\nNaturopathic services are covered in some cases, but homeopathic services are generally not covered. Chiropractic is partially covered in some provinces. Cosmetic procedures are not typically covered. Psychiatric services (provided by physicians) are covered, fee-for-service psychology services outside of hospitals or community based mental health clinics are usually not. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nursing, and chiropractic services are often not covered unless within hospitals. Some provinces, including Ontario include some rehabilitation services for those in the home care program, those recently discharged from hospitals (e.g., after a hip replacement), or those in particular age categories. Again, considerable variation exists, and provinces can (and do) alter their coverage decisions.\nInter-provincial imbalances.\nThe fact that health insurance plans are administered by the provinces and territories in a country where large numbers of residents of certain provinces work in other provinces may lead to inequitable inter-provincial outcomes with respect to revenues and expenditures. For example, many residents of the Atlantic provinces work in the oil and gas industry in the western province of Alberta. For most of the year these workers may be contributing significant tax revenue to Alberta (e.g. through fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes) while their health insurance costs are borne by their home province in Atlantic Canada.\nAnother considerable inter-provincial imbalance is a person who is insured by Quebec and obtains healthcare in another province or territory. Quebec does not have any physician payment agreements with any other provinces or territories of Canada. As a result, someone that sees a physician outside Quebec, even in another part of Canada, must either pay the cost themselves and submit a request to the R\u00e9gie de l'Assurance Maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ Medicare) for reimbursement (even then, expenses are often denied), or take out a third party insurance plan. The same situation also applies to a resident of any other part of Canada visiting Quebec, only they submit any claims to their respective provincial healthplan. All provinces and territories of Canada, however, do have reciprocal hospital agreements, so hospital admissions, for example, are covered throughout Canada.\nOpinions and activism on Canadian health care.\nPolling data in the last few years have consistently cited Canadian Health Care as among the most important political issues in the minds of Canadian voters. Along with peacekeeping, Canadian Health Care was found, based on a CBC poll, to be among the foremost defining characteristics of Canada.\nIt has increasingly become a source of controversy in Canadian politics. As a recent report from the Health Council of Canada has noted\n\"Herein lies one of the puzzles of Canadian health care: Canadians increasingly view the health care system as unsustainable and under threat, even as their own experiences with the system are mostly positive.\"\nAs analysts have noted, the root of the concern may be traced to successful cost control efforts in the mid-1990s, where public health expenditure per capita, in inflation-adjusted dollars, actually fell. These efforts arose from efforts by the federal government to deal with its deficit through various austerity measures, which led to cuts in their transfers to the provinces, and in turn to squeezing hospital budgets and physician reimbursements. The number of physicians being trained was reduced. The result was seen in increased wait times, particularly for elective procedures. More recently, government has been reinvesting in health care, but public confidence has been slow to recover.\nA number of studies have compared Canada with other countries, and concluded that each system has its own strengths and weaknesses. The World Health Organization, ranked Canada in 2000 as 30th worldwide in performance. However, the basis for these rankings has been highly contentious. As Deber noted, \"The measure of \"overall health system performance\" derives from adjusting \"goal attainment\" for educational attainment. Although goal attainment is in theory based on five measures (level and distribution of health, level and distribution of \"responsiveness\" and \"fairness of financial contribution\"), the actual values assigned to most countries, including Canada, were never directly measured. The scores do not incorporate any information about the actual workings of the system, other than as reflected in life expectancy. The primary reason for Canada's relatively low standing rests on the relatively high educational level of its population, particularly as compared to France, rather than on any features of its health system.\" Other countries had similar complaints, and the WHO has not repeated this ranking.\nThere has been considerable opposition to ongoing changes to the Canadian health system. This opposition has been largely spearheaded by the New Democratic Party. There is also activism by a volunteer community, particularly the Canadian Health Coalition (*[www.healthcoalition.ca]) and its provincial affiliates, as well as other organizations such as the Council for Canadians (https://).\n2003 Accord.\nIn 2003, the prime minister and the provincial premiers agreed upon priority areas for reinvestment. The 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the \"Canada Health Act\". They indicated the following principles:\n\"Drawing from this foundation, First Ministers view this Accord as a covenant which will help to ensure that:\nThe accord set the following priority areas: primary health care, home care, catastrophic drug coverage, access to diagnostic/medical equipment and information technology and an electronic health record. The extent of progress in meeting reform goals has varied across these areas.\nEvaluating claims about the system.\nEvaluating the accuracy of claims about the system is hampered by several factors. The highly decentralized nature of health care delivery means that good data is not always available. It is often difficult to distinguish compelling but atypical anecdotes from systemic problems. Considerable effort is being made to develop and implement comparable indicators to allow better assessment of progress. However, the Health Council of Canada\u2014with a mandate to monitor and report on health reform\u2014complained in 2007 that progress has stalled.\nThe debate about health care has also become heavily ideological. The Fraser Institute, a right leaning think tank supporting \"competitive market solutions for public policy problems\" is a frequent critic of publicly funded Canadian Health Care. It publishes yearly reports about wait times which are then used to argue that the system is both failing and unsustainable. Others criticize their methodology, which is based on physician perceptions rather than actual waits. Other complaints come from the political left, who object to 'privatization' (by which they usually mean a heavier involvement of for-profit providers). (See, for example, the Canadian Health Coalition web page.)\nWait times and access.\nCommon complaints relate to access, usually to accessing family physicians (with wait times beyond 365 days in Montreal), to elective surgery (especially hip and knee replacement and cataract surgery) and diagnostic imaging. These have been the primary targets of health care reinvestment, and it appears that considerable progress has been made for certain services, although the implications for procedures not on the target list are unclear. Canadian physicians have been heavily involved, particularly in developing appropriateness criteria to ensure timely access for necessary care. It is estimated to have cost Canada's economy $14.8 billion in 2007 to have patients waiting longer than needed for medical procedures, assuming all patients normally work, and cannot work while waiting.\nThe Fraser Institute completed a study in October 2013, \"Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada\". The authors surveyed both private and publicly funded outpatient health care offices and estimated the amount of wait time between general practitioner and specialists for elective treatments such as getting breast implants. The Fraser Institute estimates that the wait times for elective treatments have increased 95 percent from 1993 to 2013.\nHealth human resources.\nA related issue is the volume, and distribution, of health human resources. There are ongoing issues about the distribution of physicians, with the pendulum swinging from arguing that there were too many, to arguing that there were too few. As Ben Chan found, the major factor driving the drop in physician numbers was changes in training programs. Combined with such factors as changes in the hours worked by each physician, and a decrease in the proportion of doctors choosing to go into family practice, there were shortages in some areas, particularly for general practitioners (GP) / family doctors. One response has been to encourage 'primary care reform', including greater use of multidisciplinary health care teams. There are also ongoing issues regarding nurses. (See Nursing Health Services Research Unit, which links to some reports. CIHI also gives data about nursing.)\nDelisting.\nDelisting is the term used in Canada when a province decides that a medical procedure will no longer be covered by the health care system in that province.\nWhile health care coverage is country wide, and is required to be portable and to have equal access, there are a few differences between what provinces will cover. In some cases, this has resulted in lost grants to the provinces; in other cases it has not.\nAn example of a delisted service is circumcision in Ontario. It is still possible to have a boy circumcised in Ontario by a doctor but the parents must pay the cost.\nThe issue of delisting services is becoming increasingly a political battleground in Canadian health care. In an effort to cut their health care budgets, some provincial governments will opt to delist specific services under the guise that they lack essential medical necessity; however, the question of what qualifies as medical necessity is in these instances typically debated. For example, except for seniors, children, and diabetics eye exams to check vision are no longer covered in Ontario.\nParallel private debate.\nSome politicians and think tanks have proposed removing barriers to the existence of a parallel private healthcare system. Others note that such systems act to erode cost control and impede equity.\nThough polling suggests support for such reforms has been increasing, it has yet to be adopted as official policy by any of the main federal political parties.\nUnder federal law, private clinics are not legally allowed to charge patients directly for services covered by the \"Canada Health Act\", if they qualify for public insurance. Regardless of this legal issue, many do offer such services. There are disputes as to whether surgical procedures can be performed. Two related issues have obstructed the growth of such clinics. One is regulatory\u00a0\u2013 hospital-based quality assurance often failed to encompass them. This gap has been filled in most provinces, but sometimes only after celebrated incidents in which patients died in unregulated clinics, including one physician who performed cosmetic surgery in an Ontario hotel room. The second is economic\u00a0\u2014 there may be no way for physicians to recoup the additional costs of running a surgical facility from their fees. Here, provinces can choose to offer 'facility fees' to these clinics, but doing so has often been contentious, particularly if hospitals felt that these costs would be better devoted to allowing them to increase their operating room time.\nNote that uninsured persons can pay for care (including medical tourism), and that insured persons can still pay for uninsured services. These are both niche markets.\nOpponents of Canadian health care often raise issues such as long wait times, a 'brain-drain' drawing qualified professionals away from Canada to other jurisdictions where working in the health care field is more profitable, and impairment of the Canadian health care system due to budget cuts. Fox News ran a story in 2007 reporting that during a period of above average numbers of births, at least 40 Canadian mothers of premature babies had to travel to the U.S. for treatment due to insufficient capacity for premature babies in British Columbia neonatal units. Nonetheless, Canada's health care system covered the health care costs of those mothers affected.\nIn 2003, the Government in Canada spent US$2,998 per capita on healthcare as compared to US$5,711 per capita in the United States, while almost every Canadian citizen is fully covered. In the United States, 11.9 percent of adults lack public or private health coverage, despite higher proportional spending along with large private investment.\nThe lack of competition has given healthcare unions a monopoly on essential services, thus ensuring a very strong bargaining position. Nova Scotia is currently debating healthcare legislation aimed at removing the threat of striking healthcare workers and replacing it with binding arbitration.\nProposed reforms.\nOne proposed solution for improving the Canadian healthcare system is to increase funding. Proponents of this approach point to the rise of neo-conservative economic policies in Canada and the associated reduction in welfare state expenditure (particularly in the provinces) from the 1980s onwards as the cause of degradation in the system. While some say evidence clearly indicate an overall percentage increase on healthcare spending, the net spending has been drastically decreasing on top of inflation.\nOther critics of healthcare state that increased funding will not solve systemic problems in the healthcare system including a rising cost of medical technology, infrastructure, and wages. These critics say that Canada's proximity to the United States causes a \"brain drain\" or migration of Canadian-trained doctors and nurses (as well as other professionals) to the United States, where private hospitals can pay much higher wages and income tax rates are lower (partially because health care is not covered through taxation). Some of these critics argue that increased privatization of healthcare would improve Canada's health infrastructure. Others argue vehemently against it. For example, large resources are required to train and educate doctors. Since the number of available doctors is therefore limited, doctors working for a private system would not be working under the public system creating little to no net increase in available services.\nCritics of greater privatization state that funding for healthcare should be kept public (most services are provided by the private sector including doctors, who, in most cases, are private), in part because it separates Canadians from Americans by mandating equality and fairness in health care. That is in contrast to other countries, whose doctors are on a salary per capita. In that sense, Canadian healthcare is publicly funded, and services are provided by a mixture of public and private entities, which most Canadians support. Changing the system to eliminate the balance between public and private service providers to a completely public system is one such alternative.\nOntario's reform experiments.\nSince the early 1990s, Ontario has implemented several systematic reforms to reduce health care costs. Similar reforms have been implemented in other provinces.\nUser premiums.\nCurrently in Ontario, people with an annual taxable income above $20,000 must pay an annual health care premium ranging from $60\u2013$900. Funding for health care in Ontario also comes in part from a dedicated Employer Health Tax (EHT) that ranges from 0.98 percent to 1.95 percent of employer payroll. Eligible employers are exempted from EHT on the first $400,000 of payroll. British Columbia and Quebec charge similar premiums.\nMedical clinics.\nOntario has increased the number of 24-hour drop-in medical clinic networks to reduce costs associated with treating off-hours emergencies in hospital emergency rooms.\nMany family doctor practices have created their own clinics, offering 24-hour service for their patients if needed. Each doctor in the practice takes a turn at being \"on call\" on a rotating basis. Patients who have family doctors belonging to these practices are able to have a doctor come to their home in extreme situations. There is no additional charge for these services as they are billed to the Province, the same as an office visit.\nHospitals in some major Canadian cities, such as London, Ontario, have restructured their emergency services to share emergency treatment among several hospitals. One hospital may provide full emergency room care, while another sees patients who have broken limbs, minor injuries and yet another sees patients suffering cold, flu, etc.\nIn 2007, the first nurse practitioner-led office to relieve waiting times caused by a shortage of primary practitioners was opened in Sudbury, Ontario.\nAlternatives to fee-for-visit or service.\nOntario has also attempted to move the system away from bill for service or visit and toward preventive and community-based approaches to healthcare. The Ontario government in the early 1990s helped develop many community health care centres, often in low-income areas, which provide both medical and social support which combines health care with programs such as collective kitchens, Internet access, anti-poverty groups and groups to help people quit smoking.\nWhile funding has decreased for these centres, and they have had to cut back, they have had a lower cost than the traditional fee-for-service approach. Many of these centres are filled to capacity in terms of general doctors, and there are often fairly long waiting lists and the centres also utilize nurse practitioners, who reduce the workload on the doctors and increase efficiency.\nMidwives and hospital birthing reforms.\nOntario and Quebec have recently licensed midwives, providing another option for childbirth which can reduce costs for uncomplicated births. Midwives remain close to hospital facilities in case the need for emergency care emerges. These births often cost much less than the traditional hospital delivery. Hospitals have also reformed their approach to birthing by adding private birthing areas, often with a hot tub (which is good for relieving pain without medication).\nPrivatization.\nCurrently, privately owned and operated hospitals that allow patients to pay out-of-pocket for services cannot obtain public funding in Canada, as they contravene the \"equal accessibility\" tenets of the \"Canada Health Act\" and \"Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act\". Some politicians and medical professionals have proposed allowing public funding for these hospitals. Workers' Compensation Boards, the Canadian Forces, the RCMP, federally incarcerated prisoners, and medical care for which an insurance company has liability (e.g., motor vehicle accidents) all pay for health care outside of the public systems in all provinces.\nIn Quebec, a recent legal change has allowed this reform to occur. In June 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned a Quebec law preventing people from buying private health insurance to pay for medical services available through the publicly funded system and this ruling does not apply outside the province. See: Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General).\nIn November 2005, the Quebec government announced that it would allow residents to purchase private medical insurance to comply with this ruling.\nPrivate insurance from companies such as Blue Cross, Green Shield and Manulife have been available for many years to cover services not covered by the Canadian health care system, such as dental care and some eye care. Private insurance is provided by many employers as a benefit.\nThe Canadian Medical Association (CMA) released a report in July 2007 endorsing private healthcare as a means to improve an ailing healthcare system. Dr. Brian Day, who acted as President of the CMA in 2007/2008, is the owner of the largest private healthcare hospital in Canada and a proponent of mixed public and private healthcare in Canada.\nCanadian Health Practitioner standards.\nIt is generally accepted that physicians arriving in Canada from other countries must meet Canadian Health Practitioner standards. So there is concern that doctors from other countries are not trained or educated to meet Canadian standards. Consequently, doctors who want to practise in Canada must meet the same educational and medical qualifications as Canadian-trained practitioners. Others suggest that the Canadian Medical Association, the Ontario Medical Association, and the regulatory bodies (the provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons) have created too much red tape to allow qualified doctors to practise in Canada. Canada's health system is ranked 30th in the world, suggesting the logic of the doctor shortage defies the statistics. In fact according to a report by Keith Leslie of the Canadian Press in the Chronicle Journal, November 21, 2005, over 10,000 trained doctors are working in the United States, a country ranked 37th in the world. It would suggest money or the perception of better working conditions, or both, are resulting in an exodus of Canadian doctors (and nurses) to the USA.\nIt is important to recognize that many consider the doctor shortage in Canada to be a very severe problem affecting all sectors of health care. It may relate in part to the details of how doctors are paid; a detail often misunderstood. In Canada, almost all doctors receive a fee per-visit, not per-service. It has been suggested that this type of \"fee-for-visit\" payment system can encourage complexity, volume visits, repeat visits, referrals, and testing.\nOne consequence of the shortage in Canada is that a great many patients are left without family doctors, and trained specialists, making early intervention very difficult. As the article in the Toronto Star specially isolates, it is not so much a problem of a doctor shortage but of a shortage of 'licensed doctors'. Michael Urbanski states that Canada already has a hidden reserve of foreign-trained MDs eager to begin medical practice. \"However, what's crucial to understanding the issue of doctor shortage in Ontario is that while the Liberal government is planning to go \"poaching\" for other countries' doctors, there are an estimated 4,000 internationally trained doctors right here in Ontario working at low-wage jobs.\"\nA CBC report [6](August 21, 2006) on the health care system reports the following:\nDr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association estimates that 75 percent of health-care services are delivered privately, but funded publicly. \"Frontline practitioners whether they're GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They're small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics \u2026The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization.\nIn a report by Keith Leslie of the Canadian Press in the Chronicle Journal, November 21, 2005, commenting on an Ontario Medical Association Report, prepared by the human resources committee states \"The year 2005 finds the province in the midst of a deepening physician resources crisis\". The report continues to report, \"the government should make it easier for doctors from other provinces to work in Ontario and ... \". Here we have signs of inter-provincial competition affecting the doctor shortage in one province over another. Essentially, privatized healthcare is not a choice of interest for lower income Canadians, it is most likely to be unaffordable and unfair to those who suffer on a social standard.\nProvincial insurance plans.\nAlthough the \"Canada Health Act\" provides national guidelines for healthcare, the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over health under the constitution and are free to ignore these guidelines, although if they ignore the guidelines, the federal government may deny federal funding for healthcare. All provinces currently abide by the \"Canada Health Act\" in order to receive this funding; however the Alberta legislature has considered proposals to ignore the Act to allow them to implement reforms not allowed under the Act.\nThe federal government has no direct role in the delivery of medicine in the provinces and territories so each province and territory has its own independent public health insurance program. Under the \"Canada Health Act\", each province and territory must provide services to members of plans in other provinces and territories.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Russia, the Evenki are recognised as one of the indigenous peoples of the Russian North, with a population of 38,396 (2010 census). In China, the Evenki form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognised by the People's Republic of China, with a population of 34,617 (2020 census). There are 537 Evenki in Mongolia (2015 census), called \"Khamnigan\" in the Mongolian language.\nOrigin.\nThe Evenki are sometimes conjectured to be connected to the Shiwei people who inhabited the Greater Khingan Range in the 5th to 9th centuries, although the native land of the majority of Evenki people is in the vast regions of Siberia between Lake Baikal and the Amur River. The Evenki language forms the northern branch of the Manchu-Tungusic language group and is closely related to Even and Negidal in Siberia. By 1600 the Evenki or Ewenki of the Lena and Yenisey river valleys were successful reindeer herders. By contrast the Solons (ancestors of the Evenkis in China) and the Khamnigans (Ewenkis of Transbaikalia) had picked up horse breeding and the Mongolian deel from the Mongols. The Solons nomadized along the Amur River. They were closely related to the Daur people. To the west the Khamnigan were another group of horse-breeding Evenki in the Transbaikalia area. Also in the Amur valley a body of Siberian Evenki-speaking people were called Orochen by the Manchus.\nHistorical distribution.\nThe ancestors of the south-eastern Evenki most likely lived in the Baikal region of Southern Siberia (near the modern-day Mongolian border) since the Neolithic era.\nConsidering the north-western Evenki, Vasilevich claims: \"The origin of the Evenki is the result of complex processes, different in time, involving the mixing of different ancient aboriginal tribes from the north of Siberia with tribes related in language to the Turks and Mongols. The language of these tribes took precedence over the languages of the aboriginal population\". Elements of more modern Evenki culture, including conical tent dwellings, bone fish-lures, and birch-bark boats, were all present in sites that are believed to be Neolithic. From Lake Baikal, \"they spread to the Amur and Okhotsk Sea... the Lena Basin... and the Yenisey Basin\".\nContact with Russians.\nIn the 17th century, the Russian Empire made contact with the Evenki. Cossacks, who served as a kind of \"border-guard\" for the tsarist government, imposed a fur tax on the Siberian tribes. The Cossacks exploited the Evenki clan hierarchy, taking hostages from the highest members to ensure payment of the tax. Although there was some rebellion against local officials, the Evenki generally recognized the need for peaceful cultural relations with the Russians. The Russians and their constant demands for fur taxes pushed the Evenki east all the way to Sakhalin island, where some still live today. In the 19th century some groups migrated south and east into Mongolia and Manchuria. Today there are still Evenki populations in Sakhalin, Mongolia, and Manchuria, and to a lesser extent, their traditional Baikal region. \nRussian invasion of the Evenki caused them (and other indigenous peoples) language erosion, a decline in traditions, and identity loss, among others. This was especially true during the Soviet regime. Soviet policies of collectivization, forced sedentarization (sometimes referred to as sedentism), \"unpromising villages\", and Russification of the education system compromised social, cultural, and mental well-being of the Evenki.\nEvenki of Russia.\nThe Evenki were formerly known as \"tungus\". This designation was spread by the Russians, who acquired it from the Yakuts (in the Yakut language \"tongus\") in the 17th century. The Evenki have several self-designations, of which the best known is \"evenk\". This became the official designation for the people in 1931. Some groups call themselves \"orochen\" ('an inhabitant of the River Oro'), \"orochon\" ('a rearer of reindeer'), \"ile\" ('a human being'), etc. At one time or another tribal designations and place names have also been used as self-designations, for instance \"manjagir\", \"birachen\", \"solon\", etc. Several of these have even been taken for separate ethnic entities.\nThere is also a similarly named Siberian group called the Evens (formerly known as \"Lamuts\"). Although related to the Evenki, the Evens are now considered to be a separate ethnic group.\nThe Evenki are spread over a huge territory of the Siberian taiga from the River Ob in the west to the Okhotsk Sea in the east, and from the Arctic Ocean in the north to Manchuria and Sakhalin in the south. The total area of their habitat is about 2,500,000\u00a0km2. In all of Russia only the Russians inhabit a larger territory. According to the administrative structure, the Evenki live, from west to east, in:\nHowever, the territory where they are a titular nation is confined solely to the Evenk Autonomous Okrug, where 3,802 of the 35,527 Evenki live (according to the 2002 census). More than 18,200 Evenki live in the Sakha Republic.\nEvenki is the largest of the northern group of the Manchu-Tungus languages, a group which also includes Even and Negidal.\nMany Evenki in Russia still engage in a traditional lifestyle of raising reindeer, fishing, and hunting.\nCensus results.\nAccording to the 2021 census 39,226 Evenki lived in Russia.\nEvenki of China.\nAt the 2000 census, there were 30,505 Evenki in China, mainly made up of the Solons and the Khamnigans. 88.8% of China's Evenki live in the Hulunbuir region in the north of the Inner Mongolia Province, near the city of Hailar. The Ewenki Autonomous Banner is also located near Hulunbuir. There are also around 3,000 Evenki in neighbouring Heilongjiang Province.\nThe Manchu Emperor Hong Taiji conquered the Evenki in 1640, and executed their leader Bombogor. After the Manchu conquest, the Evenki were incorporated into the Eight Banners.\nIn 1763, the Qing government moved 500 Solon Evenki and 500 Daur families to the Tacheng and Ghulja areas of Xinjiang, in order to strengthen the empire's western border. Another 1020 Xibe families (some 4000 persons) also came the following year. Since then, however, the Solons of Xinjiang have assimilated into other ethnic groups, and are not identified as such anymore.\nThe Japanese occupation led to many murders of Evenkis, and Evenki men were conscripted as scouts and rangers by the Japanese secret service in 1942.\nSome Evenkis fled to Soviet Siberia across the Amur river after murdering a Japanese officer to avoid punishment from the Japanese.\nThe Evenki of China today tend to be settled pastoralists and farmers.\nEvenki of Ukraine.\nAccording to the 2001 census, there were 48 Evenki living in Ukraine. The majority (35) stated that their native language was Russian; four indicated Evenki as their native language, and three that it was Ukrainian.\nTraditional life.\nTraditionally they were a mixture of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers\u2014they relied on their domesticated reindeer for milk and transport and hunted other large game for meat. Today \"[t]he Evenki are divided into two large groups... engaging in different types of economy. These are the hunting and reindeer-breeding Evenki... and the horse and cattle pastoral Evenki as well as some farming Evenki\".\nThe Evenki lived mostly in taiga, or boreal forest. They lived in conical tents made from birch bark or reindeer skin tied to birch poles. When they moved camp, the Evenki would leave these frameworks and carry only the more portable coverings. During winter, the hunting season, most camps consisted of one or two tents while spring encampments had up to 10 households \nTheir skill at riding their domesticated reindeer allowed the Evenki to \"colonize vast areas of the eastern taiga which had previously been impenetrable\" The Evenki used a saddle unique to their culture, placed on the shoulders of the reindeer to lessen the strain on the animal, and used a stick rather than stirrups to balance. Evenki did not develop reindeer sledges until comparatively recent times They instead used their reindeer as pack animals and often traversed great distances on foot, using snowshoes or skis. The Evenki people did hunt and eat wild reindeer, but not their domesticated reindeer, which they kept for milk.\nLarge herds of reindeer were very uncommon. Most Evenki had around 25 head of reindeer, because they were generally bred for transportation. Unlike in several other neighboring tribes Evenki reindeer-breeding did not include \"herding of reindeer by dogs nor any other specific features\". Very early in the spring season, winter camps broke up and moved to places suitable for calving. Several households pastured their animals together throughout the summer, being careful to keep \"[s]pecial areas... fenced off... to guard the newborn calves against being trampled on in a large herd\" \nClothing.\nThe Evenki wore a characteristic garb \"adapted to the cold but rather dry climate of the Central Siberia and to a life of mobility... they wore brief garments of soft reindeer or elk skin around their hips, along with leggings and moccasins, or else long supple boots reaching to the thigh\" (49). They also wore a deerskin coat that did not close in front but was instead covered with an apron-like cloth. Some Evenkis decorated their clothing with fringes or embroidery (50). The Evenki traditional costume always consisted of these elements: a loincloth made of animal hide, leggings, and boots of varying lengths Facial tattooing was also very common.\nHunting.\nThe traditional Evenki economy was a mix of pastoralism (horses or reindeer), fishing, and hunting. The Evenki who lived near the Okhotsk Sea hunted seal, but for most of the taiga-dwellers, elk, wild reindeer, and fowl were the most important game animals. Other animals included \"roe deer, bear, wolverine, lynx, wolf, Siberian marmot, fox, and sable\" Trapping did not become important until the imposition of the fur tax by the tsarist government. Before they acquired guns in the 18th century, Evenki used steel bows and arrows. Along with their main hunting implements, hunters always carried a \"pike\"\u2014\"which was a large knife on a long handle used instead of an axe when passing through thick taiga, or as a spear when hunting bear\". The Evenki have deep respect for animals and all elements of nature: \"It is forbidden to torment an animal, bird, or insect, and a wounded animal must be finished off immediately. It is forbidden to spill the blood of a killed animal or defile it. It is forbidden to kill animals or birds that were saved from pursuit by predators or came to a person for help in a natural disaster.\"\nReligion.\nPrior to contact with the Russians, the belief system of the Evenki was animistic. Many have adopted Tibetan Buddhism.\nThe Evenki, like most nomadic, pastoral, and subsistence agrarian peoples, spend most of their lives in very close contact with nature. Because of this, they develop what A.\u00a0A. Sirina calls an \"ecological ethic\". By this she means \"a system of responsibility of people to nature and her spirit masters, and of nature to people\"(9). Sirina interviewed many Evenki who until very recently spent much of their time as reindeer herders in the taiga, just like their ancestors. The Evenki people also spoke along the same lines: their respect for nature and their belief that nature is a living being.\nThis idea, \"[t]he embodiment, animation, and personification of nature\u2014what is still called the animistic worldview\u2014is the key component of the traditional worldview of hunter-gatherers\" Although most of the Evenkis have been \"sedentarized\"\u2014that is, made to live in settled communities instead of following their traditional nomadic way of life \u2014\"[m]any scholars think that the worldview characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies is preserved, even if they make the transition to new economic models.\nAlthough nominally Christianized in the 18th century, the Evenki people maintain many of their historical beliefs\u2014especially shamanism The Christian traditions were \"confined to the formal performance of Orthodox rites which were usually timed for the arrival of the priest in the taiga\" \nThe religious beliefs and practices of the Evenki are of great historical interest since they retain some archaic forms of belief. Among the most ancient ideas are spiritualization and personification of all natural phenomena, belief in an upper, middle, and lower world, belief in the soul (\"omi\") and certain totemistic concepts. There were also various magical rituals associated with hunting and guarding herds. Later on, these rituals were conducted by shamans. Shamanism brought about the development of the views of spirit-masters \nThere are few sources on the shamanism of the Evenki peoples below the Amur/Helongkiang river in Northern China. There is a brief report of fieldwork conducted by Richard Noll and Kun Shi in 1994 of the life of the shamaness Dula'r (Evenki name), also known as Ao Yun Hua (her Han Chinese name). She was born in 1920 and was living in the village of Yiming Gatsa in the Evenki Banner (county) of the Hulunbuir Prefecture, in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. While not a particularly good informant, she described her initiatory illness, her multiyear apprenticeship with a Mongol shaman before being allowed to heal at the age of 25 or 26, and the torments she experienced during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s when most of her shamanic paraphernalia was destroyed. Mongol and Buddhist Lamaist influences on her indigenous practice of shamansim were evident. She hid her prize possession\u2014an Abagaldi (bear spirit) shaman mask, which has also been documented among the Mongols and Dauer peoples in the region. The field report and color photographs of this shaman are available online.\nOlga Kudrina (c.\u00a01890\u20131944) was a shaman among the Reindeer Evenki of northern Inner Mongolia along the Amur River's Great Bend (today under the jurisdiction of Genhe, Hulunbuir).\nGenetics.\n40 percent of Evenki men carry haplogroup C-M217. Their second most common Y-DNA haplogroup is N (34 %). 18 percent belong to its subgroup N1b-P43 and 16 percent belong to subgroup N1c. Other paternal haplogroups found among them are R1a (14 %), R1b (6 %), F (4 %) and I (2 %).\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn literature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58358", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58358", "title": "Tryptophan", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nTryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an \u03b1-amino group, an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG.\nLike other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (\u2013NH3+; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( \u2013COO\u2212; pKa = 2.38).\nHumans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid.\nTryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter.\nFunction.\nAmino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in \"anchoring\" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds:\nThe disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression.\nIn bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels.\nRecommended dietary allowance.\nIn 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over.\nDietary sources.\nTryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry.\nMedical use.\nDepression.\nBecause tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet,&lt;ref name=\"DOI10.1111/j.1601-5215.2010.00508.x\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not.\nIn 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that \"the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive\" and note that \"because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present\". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence.\nInsomnia.\nThe American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness.\nSide effects.\nPotential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).\nInteractions.\nTryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known.\nIsolation.\nThe isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4\u20138 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein.\nBiosynthesis and industrial production.\nAs an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine.\nThe industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as \"B. amyloliquefaciens\", \"B. subtilis\", \"C. glutamicum\" or \"E. coli\". These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase.\nSociety and culture.\nShowa Denko contamination scandal.\nThere was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit.\nSubsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of -tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's -tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer.\nThe FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005.\nThe fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of -tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for \"close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products\". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech.\nTurkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis.\nA common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat\u2014as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas\u2014results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood\u2013brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin\u2014which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm\u2014by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that \"feast-induced drowsiness\"\u2014or postprandial somnolence\u2014may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep.\nResearch.\nYeast amino acid metabolism.\nIn 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol.\nSerotonin precursor.\nTryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness.\nPsychedelic effects.\nTryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is \"N\"-methylated by indolethylamine \"N\"-methyltransferase (INMT) into \"N\"-methyltryptamine (NMT) and \"N\",\"N\"-dimethyltryptamine (\"N\",\"N\"-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics.\nFluorescence.\nTryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58359", "revid": "1320213983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58359", "title": "Kett's Rebellion", "text": "1549 revolt in Norfolk, England\nKett's Rebellion was a revolt in the English county of Norfolk during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. \nThe rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. On 1 August the rebels defeated a Royal Army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549.\nBackground.\nThe 1540s saw a crisis in agriculture in England. With the majority of the population depending on the land, this led to outbreaks of unrest across the country. Kett's rebellion in Norfolk was the most serious of these. The main grievance of the rioters was enclosure, the fencing of common land by landlords for their own use. Enclosure left peasants with nowhere to graze their animals. Some landowners were forcing tenants off their farms so that they could engross their holdings and convert arable land into pasture for sheep, which had become more profitable as demand for wool increased. Inflation, unemployment, rising rents, and declining wages added to the hardships faced by the common people. As the historian Julian Cornwall put it, they \"could scarcely doubt that the state had been taken over by a breed of men whose policy was to rob the poor for the benefit of the rich\".\nUprising at Wymondham.\nKett's rebellion, or \"the commotion time\" as it was also called in Norfolk, began in July 1549 in the small market town of Wymondham, some ten miles south-west of Norwich. The previous month there had been a minor disturbance at the nearby town of Attleborough where fences, built by the lord of the manor to enclose common lands, were torn down. The rioters thought they were acting legally, since Edward Seymour (1st Duke of Somerset, and Lord Protector during part of Edward VI's minority) had issued a proclamation against illegal enclosures. Wymondham held its annual feast on the weekend of 6 July 1549 and a play in honour of St Thomas Becket, the co-patron of Wymondham Abbey, was performed. This celebration was illegal, as Henry VIII had decreed in 1538 that the name of Thomas Becket should be removed from the church calendar. On the Monday, when the feast was over, a group of people set off to the villages of Morley St. Botolph and Hethersett to tear down hedges and fences. One of their first targets was Sir John Flowerdew, a lawyer and landowner at Hethersett who was unpopular for his role as overseer of the demolition of Wymondham Abbey (part of which was the parish church) during the dissolution of the monasteries and for enclosing land. Flowerdew bribed the rioters to leave his enclosures alone and instead attack those of Robert Kett at Wymondham.\nKett was about 57 years old and was one of the wealthier farmers in Wymondham. The Ketts (also spelt Ket, Cat, Chat, or Knight) had been farming in Norfolk since the twelfth century. Kett was the son of Thomas and Margery Kett and had several brothers; clergyman Francis Kett was his nephew. Two or possibly three of Kett's brothers were dead by 1549, but his eldest brother William joined him in the rebellion. Kett's wife, Alice, and several sons are not recorded as having been involved in the rebellion. Kett had been prominent among the parishioners in saving their parish church when Wymondham Abbey was demolished and this had led to conflict with Flowerdew. Having listened to the rioters' grievances, Kett decided to join their cause and helped them tear down his own fences before taking them back to Hethersett where they destroyed Flowerdew's enclosures. The following day, Tuesday 9 July, the protesters set off for Norwich. By now Kett was their leader and they were being joined by people from nearby towns and villages. A local tradition holds that a meeting point for the rebels was an oak tree on the road between Wymondham and Hethersett, where nine of the rebels were later hanged. Known as Kett's Oak, it has been preserved by Norfolk County Council. The oak became a symbol of the rebellion when an oak tree on Mousehold Heath was made the centre of the rebel camp, but this \"Oak of Reformation\" no longer stands. According to one source the Oak of Reformation was cut down by Norwich City Council in the 1960s to make way for a car park, although Reg Groves wrote in the 1940s that it had already been destroyed.\nBowthorpe, Eaton, and Drayton.\nKett and his followers camped for the night of 9 July at Bowthorpe, just west of Norwich. Here they were approached by a local official, either Nicholas L'Estrange, Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, or former sheriff Sir Edmund Wyndham, who ordered them to disperse. The response was negative, and the official retreated to Norwich. Next the rebels were visited by the Mayor of Norwich, Thomas Codd, who met a similar response. The following night the rebels camped at nearby Eaton Wood and then, having been refused permission to march through Norwich to reach Mousehold Heath north-east of the city, crossed the River Wensum at Hellesdon and spent the night at Drayton.\nRebel base on Mousehold Heath.\nOn Friday 12 July, the rebels reached Mousehold, where they had a vantage point overlooking Norwich, and set up the camp that was their base for the next six and a half weeks. The camp was the largest of several rebel camps that had appeared in East Anglia that summer. The rebels were known at the time as the \"camp men\" and the rebellion as the \"camping tyme\" or \"commotion tyme\".\nKett set up his headquarters in St Michael's Chapel, the ruins of which have since been known as Kett's Castle. Mount Surrey, a house built by the Earl of Surrey on the site of the despoiled St Leonard's Priory, had lain empty since the Earl's execution in 1547 and was used to hold Kett's prisoners. Kett's council, which consisted of representatives from the Hundreds of Norfolk and one representative from Suffolk met under the Oak of Reformation to administer the camp, issuing warrants to obtain provisions and arms and arrest members of the gentry. The camp was joined by workers and artisans from Norwich, and by people from the surrounding towns and villages, until it was larger than Norwich, at that time the second-largest city in England with a population of about 12,000. The city authorities, having sent messengers to London, remained in negotiation with the rebels and Mayor Thomas Codd, former Mayor Thomas Aldrich, and preacher Robert Watson accepted the rebels' invitation to take part in their council.\nOnce the camp was established at Mousehold the rebels drew up a list of 29 grievances, signed by Kett, Codd, Aldrich, and the representatives of the Hundreds, and sent it to Protector Somerset. The grievances have been described by one historian as a shopping-list of demands but which nevertheless have a strong logic underlying them, articulating \"a desire to limit the power of the gentry, exclude them from the world of the village, constrain rapid economic change, prevent the overexploitation of communal resources, and remodel the values of the clergy\". \nAlthough the rebels were all the while tearing down hedges and filling in ditches, only one of the 29 articles mentioned enclosure: 'We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing, that it be not hurtful to such as have enclosed saffren grounds, for they be greatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall enclose any more.' The exemption for 'saffren grounds' has puzzled historians; one has suggested that it may have been a scribal error for 'sovereign grounds', grounds that were the exclusive freehold property of their owners, while others have commented on the importance of saffron to local industry. \nThe rebels also asked 'that all bondmen may be made free, for God made all free, with his precious blood shedding.' The rebels may have been articulating a grievance against the 1547 \"Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds\", which made it legal to enslave a discharged servant who did not find a new master within three days, though they may also have been calling for the manumission of the thousands of Englishmen and women who were serfs. (In 1549, an \"Act Touching on the Punishment of Vagabonds and Other Idle Persons\" avoided the word \"slave\" but retained many of the harshest provisions of the 1547 \"Act\".)\nThe list of demands also included calls for a reduction in rents, the punishment of corrupt officials and the replacement of counsellors to the king (both clerical and lay) who enriched themselves at the expense of the state\u2014a direct reference to Protector Somerset\u2019s regency council. The rebels used the new prayer book for their open air services, and urged that parish priests who failed to \"set forth the word of God\" to their parishioners should be replaced.\nEvents from 12 July 1549.\nThe truce between the city and the camp was ended on 21 July by a messenger from the King's Council, York Herald Bartholomew Butler, who arrived at Norwich from London, went with city officials to Mousehold, proclaimed the gathering a rebellion, and offered pardon. Kett rejected the offer, saying he had no need of a pardon because he had committed no treason. York Herald lacked the forces to arrest the rebels and retreated into Norwich with the Mayor. Kett and his followers were now officially rebels; the authorities therefore shut the city gates and set about preparing the city defences.\nFall of Norwich.\nOn 22 July 1549, Kett proposed a truce but the offer was rejected by the city authorities and the rebels commenced an attack on Bishopsgate Bridge. They charged down from Mousehold and began swimming the Wensum between the Cow Tower and Bishopsgate. The city defenders fired volleys of arrows into the rebels as they crossed, but could not stop the attack and Norwich quickly fell to the rebels. The rebels captured guns and other military supplies and set up guards at strategic points. The York Herald offered a second pardon to the rebels. It was again rejected and the Herald left for London, leaving England's second largest city in the hands of a rebel army. There was no random violence. Civic leaders were taken to Mousehold and imprisoned in Surrey House. Mayor Codd was released and stayed in the rebel camp, while his deputy Augustine Steward remained in the city.\nAttacks on the rebels.\nThe King sent the Marquess of Northampton with about 1,400 men, including Italian mercenaries, to quell the rebellion. As he drew near to the city he sent forward his herald to demand the surrender of the city. Deputy Mayor Augustine Steward consulted Mayor Codd, who was still on Mousehold and then opened the city gates to Northampton's army, the rebels having withdrawn back to the safety of the high ground overlooking the city. Kett had already seen how difficult it was to defend miles of walls and gates and thought it more prudent to allow Northampton's small army to defend the city while he again laid siege to it.\nOn the night of 31 July, the Royal army made its defensive preparations and started patrolling the city's narrow streets. Around midnight alarms rang out, waking Northampton. It appeared hundreds of rebels were using the cover of darkness and their knowledge of the maze of small streets and alleys around Tombland to launch hit-and-run attacks on Royal troops. After three hours Northampton's men had driven off the rebels, who suffered heavy casualties. \nBy 8 am the following morning, 1 August, the ramparts were strengthened between the Cow Tower and Bishopsgate, so Lord Sheffield retired to The Maid's Head inn for breakfast. A little after this, Northampton received information that the rebels wished to discuss surrender and were gathering around the Pockthorpe gate. Sheffield went with the Herald to discuss this apparent good turn of events with the rebels. On arrival, Sheffield found no rebels at all. It appears to have been either a false rumour or a diversion, as at that point thousands of rebels again began crossing the River Wensum around Bishopsgate.\nNorthampton's main force was in the market place. As the attack developed, he fed men through the streets into a growing and vicious street battle across the whole eastern area of the city. Seeing things going the rebels' way, Sheffield took command of a body of cavalry and charged the rebels across the cathedral precinct, past St Martin at Place Church and into Bishopsgate Street. Outside the Great Hospital in Bishopsgate Street, Sheffield fell from his horse into a ditch. Expecting then to be captured and ransomed, as was the custom, he removed his helmet, only to be killed by a blow from a rebel, reputedly a butcher named Fulke. With the loss of a senior commander and his army being broken up in street fighting, Northampton ordered a retreat.\nThe Earl of Warwick was then sent with a stronger army of around 14,000 men including mercenaries from Wales, Germany, and Spain. Warwick had previously fought in France, was a former member of the House of Commons and subsequently the Privy Council, making him a strong leader. Despite the increased threat, the rebels were loyal to Kett throughout and continued to fight Warwick's men.\nNorthampton served as Warwick's second-in-command in the second attempt to deal with the rebel host, this time with a much larger force. Warwick managed to enter the city on 24 August by attacking the St Stephen's and Brazen gates. The rebels retreated through the city, setting fire to houses as they went in an attempt to slow the Royal army's advance. About 3 pm Warwick's baggage train entered the city. It managed to get lost and rather than halting in the market place it continued through Tombland and straight down Bishopsgate Street towards the rebel army. A group of rebels saw the train from Mousehold and ran down into the city to capture it. Captain Drury led his men in an attempt to recapture the train, which included all the artillery. He managed to salvage some of the guns in yet another fierce fight around Bishopsgate.\nOn 25 August the rebels commenced an artillery attack on the walls around the northern area of the city near the Magdalen and Pockthorpe gates. With the north of the city again in rebel hands, Warwick launched an attack. Bitter street fighting eventually cleared the city once again.\nRebels' defeat at Dussindale.\nOn 26 August, 1,400 foreign mercenaries arrived in the city. These were German \"landsknechts\", a mix of musketeers and zweihander-swordsmen. With these reinforcements, Warwick now had a formidable army with which to face the rebels. Kett and his people were aware of this, and that night they left their camp at Mousehold for lower ground in preparation for battle. During the morning of 27 August, the armies faced each other outside the city. The final battle took place at \"Dussindale\", and was a disaster for the rebels. In the open, against well-armed and trained troops, they were routed and thousands were killed.\nThe location of Dussindale has not been established with certainty, but battlefield debris (musket balls and other lead shot\u2014iron artefacts such as arrowheads having not readily survived) have suggested Long Valley, Norwich, now a partly built-up area to the north-east of the city centre. An alternative location, further to the east, is suggested by Anne Carter of Norfolk Archaeology, who found in parish records references to \"Dussings Dale\" adjoining the common of the village of Great Plumstead (). A map regression analysis published by the Council for British Archaeology supports Carter's proposition, but its conclusion placed the exact spot some 200 metres to the west.\nAftermath.\nAbout 3,000 rebels are thought to have been killed at Dussindale, with Warwick's army losing some 250 men. The morning after the battle, 28 August, rebels were hanged at the Oak of Reformation and outside the Magdalen Gate. Estimates of the number vary from 30 to 300. Warwick had already executed 49 rebels when he had entered Norwich a few days before. There is only one attested incident in which the rebels had killed in cold blood: one of Northampton's Italian mercenaries had been hanged following his capture.\nKett was captured at the village of Swannington the night after the battle and taken, together with his brother William, to the Tower of London to await trial for treason. Found guilty, the brothers were returned to Norwich at the beginning of December. Kett was hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549; on the same day William was hanged from the west tower of Wymondham Abbey.\nLegacy and commemoration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"In 1549 AD Robert Kett yeoman farmer of Wymondham was executed by hanging in this Castle after the defeat of the Norfolk Rebellion of which he was leader. In 1949 AD \u2013 four hundred years later \u2013 this Memorial was placed here by the citizens of Norwich in reparation and honour to a notable and courageous leader in the long struggle of the common people of England to escape from a servile life into the freedom of just conditions\"\nPlaque on the wall of Norwich Castle\nIn 1550, the Norwich authorities decreed that in future 27 August should be a holiday to commemorate \"the deliverance of the city\" from Kett's Rebellion, and paid for lectures in the cathedral and parish churches on the sins of rebellion. This tradition continued for over a century.\nThe rising was discussed by Sir John Cheke in \"The hurt of sedicion howe greueous it is to a commune welth,\" (1549). The only known surviving eye-witness account of the rebellion, a manuscript by a Nicholas Sotherton, son of a Norwich mayor, is hostile towards the rebels. So too is Alexander Neville's 1575 Latin history of the rebellion, \"De furoribus Norfolciensium\". Neville was secretary to Matthew Parker, who had preached to Kett's followers under the Oak of Reformation on Mousehold, unsuccessfully appealing to them to disperse. In 1615 Neville's work was translated into English by Norfolk clergyman Richard Woods under the title \"Norfolke Furies\" and was reprinted throughout the following century. Francis Blomefield's detailed account in his \"History of Norwich\" (published in parts during 1741 and 1742) was based on Neville but supplemented with material from other sources such as the works of Raphael Holinshed, Peter Heylin and Thomas Fuller, together with various local records. 'Blomefield allowed himself sufficient impartiality to be able to set out, without comment, the grievances of those taking part, but heaped abuse on them for going further than their original intentions'.\nIt was only in the 19th century that more sympathetic portrayals of the rebellion appeared in print and started the process that saw Kett transformed from traitor to folk hero. An anonymous work of 1843 was critical of Neville's account of the rebellion, and in 1859 clergyman Frederic Russell, who had unearthed new material in archives for his account of the rebellion, concluded that \"though Kett is commonly considered a rebel, yet the cause he advocated is so just, that one cannot but feel he deserved a better name and a better fate\".\nIn 1948, Alderman Fred Henderson, a former mayor of Norwich who had been imprisoned in the castle for his part in the food riots of 1885, proposed a memorial to Kett. Originally hoping for a statue, he settled for a plaque on the walls of Norwich Castle engraved with his words and unveiled in 1949, 400 years after the rebellion. In the 21st century the death of Kett is still remembered by the people of Norwich. On 7 December 2011, the anniversary of his death, a memorial march by members of Norwich \"Occupy\" and Norwich Green Party took place and a wreath was laid by the gates of Norwich Castle.\nAfter the rebellion the lands of Kett and his brother William were forfeited, although some of them were later restored to one of his sons. In the longer term the Kett family do not seem to have suffered from their association with the rebellion, but to have prospered in various parts of Norfolk. \nThe rebellion is remembered in the names of schools, streets, pubs and a walking route in the Norwich and Wymondham area, including the Robert Kett Junior School in Wymondham, Dussindale Primary School in Norwich, the Robert Kett pub in Wymondham, Kett House residence at the University of East Anglia, and Kett's Tavern in Norwich, and in a folk band, Lewis Garland and Kett's Rebellion, and a beer, Kett's Rebellion, by Woodforde's Brewery in Norwich.\nKett's rebellion has featured in novels, including Frederick H. Moore's \"Mistress Haselwode: A tale of the Reformation Oak\" (1876), F. C. Tansley's \"For Kett and Countryside\" (1910), Jack Lindsay's \"The Great Oak\" (1949), Sylvia Haymon's children's story \"The Loyal Traitor\" (1965), Margaret Callow's \"A Rebellious Oak\" (2012), and C. J. Sansom's \"Tombland\" (2018); plays, including George Colman Green's \"Kett the Tanner\" (1909); and poetry, including Keith Chandler's collection \"Kett's Rebellion and Other Poems\" (1982). In 1988 British composer Malcolm Arnold produced the \"Robert Kett Overture (Opus 141)\", inspired by the rebellion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58375", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58375", "title": "M. John Harrison", "text": "English author and critic\nMichael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M.\u00a0John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971\u20131984), \"Climbers\" (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of \"Light\" (2002), \"Nova Swing\" (2006) and \"Empty Space\" (2012). \nHe is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \"genre contrarian\". Robert Macfarlane has said: \"Harrison is best known as one of the restless fathers of modern SF, but to my mind he is among the most brilliant novelists writing today, with regard to whom the question of genre is an irrelevance.\" The \"Times Literary Supplement\" described him as \"a singular stylist\" and the \"Literary Review\" called him \"a witty and truly imaginative writer\".\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nHarrison was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, in 1945 to an engineering family. His father died when he was a teenager and he found himself \"bored, alienated, resentful and entrapped\", playing truant from Dunsmore School (now Ashlawn School). An English teacher introduced him to George Bernard Shaw which resulted in an interest in polemic. He ended school in 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the Atherstone Hunt), a student teacher (1963\u201365), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included electric guitars and writing pastiches of H. H. Munro.\nHis first short story was published in 1966 by Kyril Bonfiglioli at \"Science Fantasy\" magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met Michael Moorcock, who was editing \"New Worlds\" magazine. He began writing reviews and short fiction for \"New Worlds\", and by 1968 he was appointed books editor. Harrison was critical of what he perceived as the complacency of much genre fiction of the time. During 1970, Harrison scripted comic stories illustrated by R.G. Jones for such forums as \"Cyclops\" and \"Finger\". An illustration by Jones appears in the first edition of Harrison's \"The Committed Men\" (1971).\nIn an interview with \"Zone\" magazine, Harrison said: \"I liked anything bizarre, from being about four years old. I started on Dan Dare and worked up to the Absurdists. At 15 you could catch me with a pile of books that contained an Alfred Bester, a Samuel Beckett, a Charles Williams, the two or three available J. G. Ballards, \"On the Road\" by Jack Kerouac, some Keats, some Allen Ginsberg, maybe a Thorne Smith. I've always been pick 'n' mix: now it's a philosophy.\"\n1968\u20131975: \"New Worlds\" and \"The Centauri Device\".\nFrom 1968 to 1975 he was literary editor of the New Wave science fiction magazine \"New Worlds\", regularly contributing criticism. He was important to the New Wave style which also included writers such as Norman Spinrad, Barrington Bayley, Langdon Jones and Thomas M. Disch. As a reviewer for \"New Worlds\" he often used the pseudonym \"Joyce Churchill\" and was critical of many works and writers published using the rubric of science fiction. One of his critical pieces, \"By Tennyson Out of Disney\" was initially written for \"Sword and Sorcery Magazine\", a publication planned by Kenneth Bulmer but which was never published; the piece was printed in \"New Worlds\" 2.\nAmongst his works of that period are three stories utilising the Jerry Cornelius character invented by Michael Moorcock. These stories do not appear in any of Harrison's own collections but do appear in the \"Nature of the Catastrophe\" and \"New Nature of the Catastrophe.\" Other early stories published from 1966 were featured in anthologies such as \"New Writings in SF\", edited by John Carnell, and in magazines such as \"Transatlantic Review\", \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\", \"New Worlds\", and \"Quark\".\nA number of Harrison's short stories of this early period remain uncollected, gathered neither in his first collection \"The Machine in Shaft Ten\", nor in his later collections.\nThe novel \"The Committed Men\" (1971) (dedicated to Michael Moorcock and his wife Hilary Bailey) is an archetypal British New-Wave vision of a crumbling future with obvious debts to the work of Michael Moorcock and J. G. Ballard. It is set in England after the apocalypse. Social organisation has collapsed, and the survivors, riddled with skin cancers, eke out a precarious scavenging existence in the ruins of the Great Society. A few bizarre communities try to maintain their structure in a chromium wilderness linked by crumbling motorways. But their rituals are meaningless clich\u00e9s mouthed against the devastation. Only the roaming bands of hippie-style \"situationalists\" (presumably a reference to the then contemporaneous situationist group) have grasped that the old order, with its logic, its pseudo-liberalism and its immutable laws of cause and effect, has now been superseded. Among the mutants are a group of reptilian humans \u2013 alien, cancer-free but persecuted by the 'smoothskins'. When one of them is born of a human mother in Tinhouse, a group of humans sets off to deliver it to its own kind \u2013 a search of the committed men for the tribes of mutants. David Pringle called the novel \"brief, bleak, derivative \u2013 but stylishly written.\"\nHarrison's first novel of the Viriconium sequence, \"The Pastel City\" was also published in 1971. Harrison would continue adding to this series until 1984. During 1972, the story \"Lamia Mutable\" appeared in Harlan Ellison's anthology \"Again, Dangerous Visions\"; while this tale forms part of the Viriconium sequence, it has been omitted from omnibus editions of the Viriconium tales to date.\nDuring 1974 Harrison's third novel was published, the space opera \"The Centauri Device\" (described prior to its publication, by \"New Worlds\" magazine, as \"a sort of hippie space opera in the baroque tradition of Alfred Bester and Charles Harness). An extract was published in \"New Worlds\" in advance of the novel's publication, with the title \"The Wolf That Follows\". The novel's protagonist, space tramp John Truck, is the last of the Centaurans, victims of a genocide. Rival groups need him to arm the most powerful weapon in the galaxy: the Centauri Device, which will respond only to the genetic code of a true Centauran.\nHarrison himself has said of this book:\nI never liked that book much but at least it took the piss out of sf\u2019s three main tenets: (1) The reader-identification character always drives the action; (2) The universe is knowable; (3) the universe is anthropocentrically structured &amp; its riches are an appropriate prize for the colonialist people like us. TCD tried to out space opera as a kind of counterfeit pulp which had carefully cleaned itself of Saturday night appetite, vacuuming out all the concerns of real pulp fiction to keep it under the radar of the Mothers of America or whatever they called themselves. Pulp\u2019s lust for life was replaced, if you were lucky, by a jaunty shanty &amp; a comedy brawl. Otherwise, it was lebensraum &amp; a cadetship in the Space Police (these days it\u2019s primarily low-bourgeois freedom motifs &amp; nice friendly sexual release).\nHarrison's first short story collection \"The Machine in Shaft Ten\" (1975) collects many (but not all) of his early short tales, from such sources as \"New Worlds Quarterly\", \"New Worlds Monthly\", \"New Writings in SF\", \"Transatlantic Review\" and others. \"The Lamia and Lord Cromis\" is an early Viriconium tale. The moody \"London Melancholy\" features a ruined future London haunted by winged people. None of the stories, with the exception of \"Running Down\", (a psychological horror tale about a man who is literally a walking disaster area), have been reprinted in his subsequent short story collections. \"The Bringer with the Window\" features Dr Grishkin, a character also appearing in \"The Centauri Device\", seemingly in Harrison's recurring fictional city of Viriconium. \nHarrison's early novels \"The Committed Men\", \"The Pastel City\" and \"The Centauri Device\" have been reprinted several times. The latter was included in the SF Masterworks series.\n1978\u20131985: \"Manchester Review\", \"The Ice Monkey\", more Viriconium.\nHarrison later relocated to Manchester and was a regular contributor to \"New Manchester Review\" (1978\u201379). David Britton and Michael Butterworth of Savoy Books employed him to write in their basement (where he did so \"amidst stacks of antique \"Eagles\", \"Freindz\", \"New Worlds\" and \"Styng\". A basement that reverberates with indecent exposures of stolen sound, bootlegs sucked from hidden mikes, stacked in neat piles.\"). The commissioned work, originally announced in Savoy publications as \"By Gas Mask and Fire Hydrant\", eventually became the novel \"In Viriconium\".\nDuring the decade of 1976\u20131986, Harrison lived in the Peak District. In 1983, he published his second short story collection, \"The Ice Monkey and Other Stories\", containing seven tales which capture the pathos, humour, awe, despair, pain and black humour of the human condition. \"The Ice Monkey\" was praised by Ramsey Campbell, who stated \"M. John Harrison is the finest British writer now writing horror fiction and by far the most original\". In \"The Incalling\", a story of seedy suburban magic which in some ways foreshadows his later novel \"The Course of the Heart\", an editor is haunted by an author's attempts to cure himself of cancer by faith healing. \nIn 1980 Harrison contributed an introduction to Michael Moorcock's early allegorical fantasy, written by Moorcock at age 18, entitled \"The Golden Barge\" and published by Savoy Books. That same year he released his second novel in the Viriconium sequence, \"A Storm of Wings\". Set eighty years later than \"The Pastel City,\" stylistically it is denser and more elaborate. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. A third novel, entitled \"In Viriconium\" (1982) (US title: \"The Floating Gods\"), was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. It is a moody portrait of artistic subcultures in a city beset by a mysterious plague.\nThe short story \"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\" (1985, later retitled \"A Young Man's Journey to London\") is set in our world and concerns the idea of escape from it.\n1985\u20131989: \"Climbers\".\nHarrison's interest in rock climbing resulted in his semi-autobiographical novel \"Climbers\" (1989), the first novel to receive the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature. Harrison also ghost-wrote the autobiography of one of Britain's best rock climbers, Ron Fawcett (\"Fawcett on Rock\", 1987, as by Mike Harrison). Harrison has repeatedly affirmed in print the importance of rock climbing for his writing as an attempt to grapple with reality and its implications, which he had largely neglected while writing fantasy. The difference in his approach pre- and post-\"Climbers\", can be observed in the extreme stylistic differences between the first novel of the Viriconium sequence \"The Pastel City\" and the second, \"A Storm of Wings\". Around the time of writing \"Climbers\", he declared that he had abandoned science fiction forever.\nRobert Macfarlane wrote an introduction to the 2013 reissue of \"Climbers\". Writing about the book in \"The Guardian\", he said: \"...it is surely the best novel about rock-climbing ever written \u2013 though such a description drastically limits its achievement\".\n1990s: \"The Course of the Heart\", \"Signs of Life\", and Gabriel King novels.\nSubsequent novels and short stories, such as \"The Course of the Heart\" (1991) and \"Empty\" (1993), were set between London and the Peak District. They have a lyrical style and a strong sense of place, and take their tension from characteristically conflicting veins of mysticism and realism.\n\"The Course of the Heart\" deals in part with an experiment in ritual magic gone wrong, and with an imaginary country which may exist at the heart of Europe, as well as Gnostic themes such as the Pleroma. It weaves together mythology, sexuality, and the troubled past and present of Eastern Europe. The origin of the narrative lies in the occasion when three Cambridge students perform a ritualistic act (never shown or fully described) that changes their lives. Years later, none of the participants can remember what exactly occurred; but their vague memories can't rid them of an overwhelming sense of dread. Pam Stuyvesant is an epileptic haunted by strange sensual visions. Her husband Lucas believes that a dwarfish creature is stalking him. Self-styled sorcerer Yaxley becomes obsessed with a terrifyingly transcendent reality. The narrator, the seemingly least affected participant in the ritual (who is haunted by the smell of roses) attempts to help his friends escape the torment that has engulfed their lives. Joel Lane has described \"The Course of the Heart\" as \"a brilliant use of supernatural themes to explore humanity mortality and loss.\" The novel incorporates versions of several other Harrison stories including \"The Great God Pan\", \"The Quarry\" and \"The Incalling\".\nThe novel \"Signs of Life\" (1996) is a romantic thriller which explores concerns about genetics and biotechnology amidst the turmoil of what might be termed a three-way love affair between its central characters.\nBeginning with \"The Wild Road\" in 1996 and concluding with \"Nonesuch\" (2001), Harrison coauthored four associated fantasies about cats with Jane Johnson, under the joint pseudonym of \"Gabriel King\".\nHarrison has collaborated on several short stories with Simon Ings, and with Simon Pummel on the short film \"Ray Gun Fun\" (1998). His work has been classified by some as forming part of the style dubbed the New Weird, along with writers such as China Mi\u00e9ville, though Harrison himself resists being labelled as part of any literary style.\nHarrison won the Richard Evans Award in 1999 (named after the near-legendary figure of UK publishing) given to the author who has contributed significantly to the SF genre without concomitant commercial success.\n2002\u20132012: The Kefahuchi Tract trilogy and other works.\nHarrison continued to publish short fiction in a wide variety of magazines through the late 1990s and early 21st century. Such tales were published in magazines as diverse as Conjunctions (\"Entertaining Angels Unawares\", Fall issue 2002), \"The Independent on Sunday\" (\"Cicisbeo\", 2003), \"The Times Literary Supplement\" (\"Science and the Arts\", 1999) and \"Woman's Journal\" (\"Old Women\", 1982). They were collected in his major short story collections \"Travel Arrangements\" (2000) and \"Things That Never Happen\" (2002).\nDuring 2007 Harrison provided material for performance by Barbara Campbell (\"1001 Nights Cast\", 2007, 2008) and Kate McIntosh (\"Loose Promise\", 2007).\nIn 2002, \"Light\" marked a return to science fiction for Harrison and marked the beginning of the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy. \"Light\" was co-winner of the James Tiptree, Jr. Award in 2003. Its sequel, \"Nova Swing\" (2006), which contained elements of noir, won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2007 and the Philip K. Dick Award in 2008. The third novel, \"Empty Space: A Haunting\", was published in August 2012.\n2012\u2013present: Modern works.\nHarrison published two short stories on Kindle: \"Cave and Julia\" (2013) and \"The 4th Domain\" (2014).\nIn 2014, Rhys Williams and Mark Bould organised a conference on Harrison's work at the University of Warwick, UK, called \"Irradiating the Object: M. John Harrison\". The keynote speakers were Fred Botting (Kingston University) and Sara Wasson (Edinburgh-Napier University). The conference papers, including the keynote address by Tim Etchells, was published as \"M. John Harrison: Critical Essays\" edited by Rhys Williams and Mark Bould.\nIn 2016, he received an honorary D. Litt. from the University of Warwick, UK.\nA collection of short stories, \"You Should Come With Me Now\", was published in November 2017.\n2020 saw two new books: a novel, \"The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again\" and \"Settling the World: Selected Stories 1970-2020\". \"The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again\" won the 2020 Goldsmiths Prize, and was longlisted for the 2020 BSFA Award.\nIn 2023, Harrison released \"Wish I Was Here\", an \"anti-memoir\".\nReviewing, judging and teaching.\nFor Harrison's work in \"New Worlds\" magazine, see above. The bulk of his reviews were collected in the volume \"Parietal Games\" (2005; see below).\nSince 1991, Harrison has reviewed fiction and nonfiction for \"The Guardian\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", the \"Times Literary Supplement\" and \"The New York Times\".\nDuring 2003 Harrison was on the jury of the Michael Powell Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.\nHe has taught creative writing courses in Devon and Wales, focusing on landscape and autobiography, with Adam Lively and the travel writer Jim Perrin.\nIn 2009, Harrison shared (with Sarah Hall and Nicholas Royle) the judging of the Manchester Fiction Prize.\nStyle.\nHis work has been acclaimed by writers including Angela Carter, Neil Gaiman, Iain Banks (who called him \"a Zen master of prose\"), China Mi\u00e9ville, William Gibson, Robert Macfarlane and Clive Barker, who has referred to him as \"a blazing original\". Olivia Laing has said of him: \"No one alive can write sentences as he can. He\u2019s the missing evolutionary link between William Burroughs and Virginia Woolf\". In a \"Locus\" magazine interview, Harrison describes his work as \"a deliberate intention to illustrate human values by describing their absence.\"\nMany of Harrison's novels include expansions or reworkings of previously published short stories. For instance, \"The Ice Monkey\" (title story of the collection) provides the basis for the novel \"Climbers\" (1989); the novel \"The Course of the Heart\" (1992) is based on his short story \"The Great God Pan\". The story \"Isobel Avens Returns to Stepney in the Spring\" is expanded as the novel \"Signs of Life\" (1996); the short story \"Anima\", first published in \"Interzone\" magazine, also forms one of the central thematic threads of \"Signs of Life\".\nIn interviews, Harrison has described himself as an anarchist, and Michael Moorcock wrote in an essay entitled \"Starship Stormtroopers\" that, \"His books are full of anarchists \u2013 some of them very bizarre like the anarchist aesthetes of \"The Centauri Device\".\"\nCritical response.\nChina Mi\u00e9ville has written: \"That M. John Harrison is not a Nobel laureate proves the bankruptcy of the literary establishment. Austere, unflinching and desperately moving, he is one of the very great writers alive today. And yes, he writes fantasy and sf, though of a form, scale and brilliance that it shames not only the rest of the field, but most modern fiction.\"\nDavid Wingrove has written of Harrison: \"Making use of forms from sword-and-sorcery, space opera and horror fiction, Harrison pursues an idiosyncratic vision: often grim, but with a strong vein of sardonic humour and sensual detail. Typically, his characters make ill-assorted alliances to engage in manic and often ritualistic quests for obscure objectives. Out of the struggle, unacknowledged motives emerge, often to bring about a frightful conclusion, which, it is suggested, was secretly desired all along. Harrison's vivid, highly finished prose convinces the reader of everything.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fourteen women were murdered in the anti-feminist attack; another ten women and four men were injured. Among the injured was eventual gun control advocate and politician Nathalie Provost.\nThe perpetrator was 25-year-old Marc L\u00e9pine, armed with a legally obtained Ruger Mini-14, and a hunting knife. He began his rampage at a mechanical engineering class at the , where he separated the male and female students, ordering the men to leave. He shot all nine women in the room, killing six. For nearly 20 minutes the shooter moved through corridors on multiple floors of the building, the cafeteria, and another classroom, targeting women. He wounded more students and killed eight more women before fatally shooting himself.\nThe massacre is now widely regarded as an act of misogynist terrorism and representative of wider societal violence against women. The anniversary of the massacre is commemorated annually in Canada as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. The gunman had said he was against feminism; after the attack, Canadians debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and the shooter's motives. Some interpretations noted that the shooter had been abused as a child, or suggested that the massacre was the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues.\nPoliticians in the House of Commons responded by passing more stringent gun control laws, and officials took other actions to end violence against women. The massacre also led to policy changes in emergency services protocols to shootings; for instance, that police would intervene immediately to try to reduce casualties. These changes were credited with later minimizing casualties during incidents of shooting in Montreal and elsewhere. This was the deadliest mass shooting in Canada until attacks in Nova Scotia more than 30 years later, which resulted in twenty-two deaths.\nTimeline.\nSometime after 4\u00a0p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc L\u00e9pine arrived at the building housing the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, armed with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle and a hunting knife. He had legally purchased the gun less than a month earlier on November 21 in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, saying that he was going to hunt small game. Investigators learned that he had been in and around the \u00c9cole Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6.\nThe gunman sat for a while in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He did not speak to anyone, although a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was seen in other parts of the building before he entered a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10\u00a0p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke, but he fired a shot into the ceiling.\nAfter separating the students, L\u00e9pine ordered the estimated fifty men to leave the room. He asked the women whether they knew why they were there; a student asked who he was. He said that he was fighting feminism. One of the students, Nathalie Provost, protested that they were women studying engineering, not feminists fighting against men or marching to prove that they were better. He opened fire on the students, from left to right, killing six\u2014H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, and Annie St-Arneault\u2014and wounding three others, including Provost. \nThe gunman continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. When his weapon failed to fire, he entered the emergency staircase and reloaded his gun. He tried to return to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door. He failed to open it although he fired three shots into the door. \nHe shot at other students in the corridor, wounding one, and approached the financial services office. There he shot and killed Maryse Lagani\u00e8re through the window of the door she had just locked.\nThe gunman went down to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about 100 people were gathered. As he shot nursing student Barbara Maria Klucznick near the kitchens and wounded another student, the crowd scattered. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, the gunman shot and killed Anne-Marie Edward and Genevi\u00e8ve Bergeron, who were hiding. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and he let them live.\nThe shooter walked up an escalator to the third floor, where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the hallway. He entered another classroom and told the men to \"get out\", shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was giving a presentation at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row, killing Maud Haviernick and Mich\u00e8le Richard, who were trying to escape the room. Other students dove under their desks. The killer wounded another three female students and killed Annie Turcotte. He changed the 30-round high-capacity magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. The wounded Maryse Leclair asked for help; the gunman stabbed her three times with his hunting knife, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, said, \"Oh shit\", and killed himself with a shot to the head. It was 20 minutes since he had begun the attack. About 60 unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had fired about 100 rounds during the shooting.\nEmergency services response.\nEmergency response to the shootings was harshly criticized for failures to protect the students and staff. Security guards at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique were poorly trained, organized and equipped. Communication issues at the 911 call centre delayed the dispatch of police and ambulances, who were initially routed to incorrect addresses.\nThe police officers were disorganized and poorly coordinated. They established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building. During this period, the gunman killed several women. Three official investigations severely condemned the emergency response. \nFollowing subsequent changes to emergency response protocols, police handling of the 1992 shootings at Concordia University, the Dawson College shooting in 2006, and the 2014 attack on Parliament hill in Ottawa were generally praised. In these incidents, the police conducted rapid and immediate intervention, and improved coordination amongst emergency response agencies was credited with minimizing the loss of life.\nAftermath.\nOn December 6, 1989, the Montreal Police director of public relations Pierre Leclair briefed reporters outside the Polytechnique building; when he entered, he found the body of his own daughter Maryse among the dead.\nThe Quebec and Montreal governments declared three days of mourning. A joint funeral for nine of the women was held at Notre-Dame Basilica on December 11, 1989, and was attended by Governor General Jeanne Sauv\u00e9, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa, and Montreal mayor Jean Dor\u00e9, along with thousands of other mourners.\nVictims.\nL\u00e9pine killed fourteen women (twelve engineering students, one nursing student, and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen others, eleven women and three men.\nPerpetrator.\nMarc L\u00e9pine (born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi) was the son of Monique L\u00e9pine, a French Canadian former Catholic nun, and an Algerian father, who was a non-practising Muslim. He and his sister Nadia were baptized Catholic but received little instruction. According to the mother in a 2006 article, the father, a mutual funds salesman, did not consider women to be the equal of men. He was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son, and discouraged tenderness between the two. When Gamil was seven, his parents separated; his father ceased contact with his children soon after. His mother returned to nursing to support the family; because of her schedule, the children lived with other families during the week. \nAt age 14, Gamil changed his name to \"Marc L\u00e9pine\", citing his hatred of his father and taking his mother's surname to further separate from the man. He had difficulty as he advanced in school and toward adulthood.\nL\u00e9pine had attempted to join the Canadian Army during the winter of 1980\u20131981. According to his 1989 suicide letter found on his body at the attacks, he was rejected because he was \"anti-social\". \nThe brief biography of the shooter that police released the day after the killings described him as intelligent but troubled. He disliked feminists, career women, and women in traditionally-male occupations, such as the police force. He began a pre-university CEGEP (college) program in Pure Sciences in 1982, but switched to a three-year vocational program in electronics technology after his first year. He abandoned this program in his final semester without explanation. L\u00e9pine applied to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1986 and in 1989 but lacked two CEGEP courses required for admission. He completed one of them in the winter of 1989.\nSuicide letter.\nOn the day of the massacre, L\u00e9pine wrote three letters: two were sent to friends, and one was found in an inside pocket of his jacket. The police revealed some details from the suicide letter in the days after the attack, but did not disclose the full text. \nThe media filed an access to information case to compel the police to release the suicide letter but were unsuccessful. A year after the attacks, the three-page statement was leaked to journalist and feminist Francine Pelletier. It contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom L\u00e9pine labelled as \"radical feminists\" and apparently intended to kill. The list included Pelletier, plus a union leader, a politician, a TV figure, and six police officers who the gunman knew from their playing together on an amateur volleyball team. The letter (without the list of women) was subsequently published in the newspaper \"La Presse\", where Pelletier was a columnist. \nIn the leaked letter, L\u00e9pine wrote that he was rational and blamed 'feminists' for ruining his life. He said he was angry at feminists for seeking social changes that \"retain the advantages of being women [...] while trying to grab those of the men\". He referred to Denis Lortie, a Canadian Armed Forces corporal who had killed three government employees and wounded thirteen others in an armed attack on the National Assembly of Quebec on May 8, 1984. The text of the original letter in French is available, as well as an English translation.\nSearch for a rationale.\nThe massacre profoundly shocked Canadians. Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to more antifeminist violence. As a result, they did not conduct a public inquiry, and did not release L\u00e9pine's suicide letter. In addition, although an extensive police investigation into the perpetrator and the killings took place, the resulting report was not made public. The coroner was authorized to have a copy as a source in her investigation. The media, academics, women's organizations, and family members of the victims protested the lack of a public inquiry and paucity of information released.\nThe gender of the victims, as well as L\u00e9pine's oral statements during the massacre and in the suicide note, have resulted in the attack being interpreted as antifeminist and as an example of the wider issue of violence against women in Canadian society. Initially, politicians and the media downplayed the antifeminism angle of the attack. Political leaders such as Robert Bourassa, Claude Ryan, and Jacques Parizeau spoke about \"victims\" and \"youth\" rather than \"women\" or \"girls\". The television journalist Barbara Frum pleaded against interpreting the massacre as an antifeminist attack or solely violence against women. She asked why people were \"diminishing\" the tragedy by \"suggesting that it was an act against just one group?\"\nAs predicted by the shooter in his suicide letter, some observers believed the event was the isolated act of a madman. A psychiatrist interviewed the gunman's family and friends, and examined his writings as part of the police investigation. He noted that the perpetrator defined suicide as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method, namely killing oneself after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy), which is considered a sign of a serious personality disorder. Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage, or that he was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent masculinity that dominated women. A different theory was that the shooter's childhood experiences of abuse led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life. His mother wondered whether her son might have suffered from attachment disorder, due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood.\nOthers framed the killer's actions as the result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting the gunman's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following the shootings at Dawson College in September 2006, \"Globe and Mail\" columnist Jan Wong suggested that L\u00e9pine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant; this provoked controversy as Canada has received numerous immigrants.\nIn the years since, however, the attack has been widely acknowledged by the public, governments, and the media as a misogynistic attack on women and on feminism. \nScholars believe that the gunman's actions sprang from widespread societal misogyny, including tolerance of violence against women. Criminologists regard the massacre as an example of a hate or bias crime against women, as the victims were selected solely because of their membership in the category of women. The women targeted were interchangeable with other women. They categorize it as a \"pseudo-community\" type of \"pseudo-commando\" murder-suicide, in which the perpetrator targets a specific group, often in a public place, and intends to die in \"a blaze of glory\". \nIndividuals close to the massacre also commented: L\u00e9pine's mother wondered if the attack was symbolically directed at her, as some would have classified her as a feminist since she was a single, working mother. Survivor Nathalie Provost who, during and after the attack, denied being a feminist, later claimed what she said was this \"beautiful title\" for herself. She also said that she believed the massacre was clearly an antifeminist act.\nLegacy.\nThe injured and witnesses among university staff and students suffered a variety of physical, social, existential, financial, and psychological consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At least two students died by suicide afterward, and left notes confirming that their deaths were due to distress caused by the massacre. Nine years after the event, survivors reported still being affected by their experiences, though some of the effects had lessened.\nActions against violence against women.\nThe massacre galvanized the Canadian women's movement, who immediately saw it as a symbol of violence against women. \"The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised\", Canadian feminist Judy Rebick recalled. \"We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women.\"\nIn response to the killings, a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report \"The War against Women\" in June 1991, which was not endorsed by the full standing committee. But, following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, \"Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence \u2013 Achieving Equality\", in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged \"National Action Plan\" consisting of an \"Equality Action Plan\" and a \"Zero Tolerance Policy\" designed to increase women's equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with more than four hundred recommendations, the final report was too diffuse to make an impact.\nIn Qu\u00e9bec, family members of the victims formed a foundation to support organizations combatting violence, particularly violence against women. It has continued throughout all levels of society. Survivors and their relatives have continued to speak about the issue. Researchers increased their study of family violence and violence against women. On December 6, 1995, the Quebec government adopted the \"Policy on Intervention in Conjugal Violence\" with the goal of detecting, preventing and ending domestic violence.\nGun control.\nThe massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement. Less than a week after the event, two \u00c9cole Polytechnique professors created a petition addressed to the Canadian government demanding tighter gun control; and more than half a million signatures were collected. Heidi Rathjen, a student who was in one of the classrooms that L\u00e9pine skipped, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier to pressure for a gun registry and increased firearm regulation. Suzanne Laplante-Edward and Jim Edward, parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved. \nTheir activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-17 in 1992, and C-68, commonly known as the \"Firearms Act\", in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations. These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, a 28-day waiting period on new applicants, rules concerning safe firearm and ammunition storage, the registration of all firearms, magazine capacity limits to 5 rounds for semi automatic rifles and 10 rounds for semi-automatic pistols, and reclassifying some additional firearms as restricted or prohibited. In 2009, survivors of the massacre, their families, and Polytechnique students past and present came together to create PolySeSouvient in opposition to legislative actions by Stephen Harper's Conservative government aimed at ending the registration of ordinary long guns. The long-gun registry was abolished by the Harper government in April 2012, but the Quebec government won a temporary injunction, preventing the destruction of the province's gun registry data, and ordering the continued registration of long guns in Quebec. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec, allowing the destruction of all the federal registry data, although Quebec created its own provincial gun registry to replace it. Since its creation, PolySeSouvient, with survivors Nathalie Provost and Heidi Rathjen as spokespersons, has continued to be active in lobbying for stricter gun control and safety in Quebec and Canada. In 2018 Justin Trudeau's Liberal government introduced Bill C-71, which restored the requirement for sales of firearms to be registered, but PolySeSouvient denounced the proposed regulations as ineffective and incomplete. In 2020, in the wake of the mass killing in Nova Scotia, and while also citing the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, Trudeau announced a ban on around 1,500 models of \"military-grade assault-style weapons\", including the Ruger Mini-14 used for the killings in Montreal. PolySeSouvient welcomed the news, but critiqued the possibility of a grandfathering clause for the weapons as a danger to public safety. On December 5th, 2024, one day before the anniversary of the massacre, the Government of Canada announced that they will be extending the previous 2020 \"military-grade assault-style weapons ban\" order in council with another OIC. This ban consists of 104 families of firearms, encompassing 324 unique makes and models, some of them semi-automatic. There will also be a voluntary buyback program with an amnesty deadline expiring on October 30, 2025.\nControversy.\nThe feminist movement has been criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. In 1990 journalist Roch C\u00f4t\u00e9 responded to the publication of \"Polytechnique, 6 d\u00e9cembre\", a feminist memorial anthology, with an essay entitled \"Manifeste d'un salaud\" where he suggested that feminists used the massacre as a chance to unleash \"insanities\". Men's rights and antifeminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women and, without explicitly condoning the shootings, view the massacre as an extreme expression of men's frustrations. Some antifeminists see the killer as a hero, glorifying his actions, and threatening violence.\nMale survivors of the massacre have been criticised for not intervening to stop the shooter. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they \"abandoned\" the women when it was clear that his targets were women. Ren\u00e9 Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Lortie to surrender, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract L\u00e9pine, but acknowledged that \"ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror\". Conservative newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a \"culture of passivity\" prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled the shooting spree. Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings. This issue has been strongly rejected by the Polytechnique student community. Nathalie Provost, one of the female survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy and that her fellow students should not feel guilty. Asmaa Mansour, another survivor, emphasized the actions of the men in saving her life and in helping the injured.\nCommemoration.\nSince 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women. A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \"the idea of men giving up their arms\".\nThe Place du 6-D\u00e9cembre-1989 in the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation \"Nef pour quatorze reines\" (\"Nave for Fourteen Queens\") by Rose-Marie Goulet. Originally described as a memorial for a \"tragic event\", in 2019, the plaque was changed to reflect indicate that the attack was antifeminist and that 14 women were killed.\nEvents are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The memorial in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \"all women murdered by men\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers. Women involved in the project received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board banned future memorials that might antagonize other groups.\nSince the commemorative ceremony on the 25th anniversary of the massacre in 2014, fourteen searchlights representing the women killed have been installed annually on the summit of Mount Royal. At 5:10\u00a0p.m., the time when the attack began, the name of each victim is read, and a light beam is projected upward into the sky. The event is attended by local and national leaders.\nThe Anne-Marie Edward Science Building at John Abbott College, constructed in 2013, was named in honour of one of the victims who had attended the CEGEP before going on to university. The Order of the White Rose was established in 2014 to provide a $30,000 national scholarship for female engineering graduate students. The selection committee is chaired by Mich\u00e8le Thibodeau-DeGuire, the first female graduate of \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\nDepiction in media.\nThe event has also been commemorated in the arts. The critically acclaimed movie \"Polytechnique\", directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released in 2009 and caused discussion over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a mainstream film. In a play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called \"The Anorak\", the audience are separated by gender: it was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal \"Gazette\". Colleen Murphy's play \"The December Man (L'homme de d\u00e9cembre)\" was first staged in Calgary in 2007. Wajdi Mouawad's 2007 play \"For\u00eats\" was inspired by and contains echoes of the tragedy. In 2009 Quebec playwright Gilbert Turp wrote \"Pur chaos du d\u00e9sir\", which examined a marriage breakdown in the aftermath of the Polytechnique killings. Several songs have been written about the events, including \"This Memory\" by the folk duo the Wyrd Sisters, \"Montreal\"' by The Tragically Hip and \"6 December 1989\" by the Australian singer Judy Small.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been praised by many critics as the finest play from \"one of the most significant contemporary playwrights\" in the English language. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Great Britain named it one of the best science-related works ever written.\nSynopsis.\nIn 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature, and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her tutor Septimus Hodge, a friend of Lord Byron (an unseen guest in the house). In the present, writer Hannah Jarvis and literature professor Bernard Nightingale converge on the house: she is investigating a hermit who once lived on the grounds; he is researching a mysterious chapter in the life of Byron. As their studies unfold \u2013 with the help of Valentine Coverly, a post-graduate student in mathematical biology \u2013 the truth about what happened in Thomasina's time is gradually revealed.\nScene 1 (Act 1).\nThe play opens on 10 April 1809, in a garden-front room of the house. Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about \"carnal embrace\" by challenging her to prove Fermat's Last Theorem; he also wants to focus on reading the poem \"The Couch of Eros\" by Ezra Chater, who with his wife is a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in rice pudding can never be unstirred, which leads her to the topic of determinism and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned \"carnal embrace\" with Septimus; he has come to demand a duel. Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on Chater's \"The Couch of Eros\". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who had savaged an earlier work of his, \"The Maid of Turkey\". Landscape architect Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the Arcadian style gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.\nScene 2.\nThe present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the Romantic imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals the professor's identity from Hannah, as Nightingale had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the population biology of the grouse in the surrounding grounds, using the house's \"game books\". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material. This enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed by Lord Byron in a duel. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a botanist.\nScene 3.\nThe 19th century. Septimus is tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating Latin. Again their focus diverts, this time to the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, which upsets Thomasina. She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to a duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review of his work.\nScene 4.\nThe present. Hannah rediscovers Thomasina's primer containing her ideas on iteration and chaos theory; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.\nScene 5 (Act 2).\nBernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park \u2013 who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the heat death of the universe, the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram \u2013 could have been Septimus.\nScene 6.\nReturning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chater couple left for the West Indies with Captain Brice. Chater served as the expedition's botanist and his wife Charity was the captain's secret paramour. Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone rabbit hunting for Thomasina, who favours rabbit pie; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters, a love letter addressed to her, and another to Thomasina about rice pudding, both written by Septimus in case he died in a duel. She invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.\nScene 7.\nBoth 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in fancy dress for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. After reading a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory, Chloe talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force that disrupts the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the later developed concept of entropy. He wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.\nMeanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, to prepare for her forthcoming 17th birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his steam engine; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been formalized), which describe the universe as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death \u2013 this discovery totally discredits Bernard's theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the irreversibility of heat; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.\nEventually a waltz starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, revealing that their relationship is increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit. Accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by Newton, he worked for the rest of his life to apply \"honest English algebra\" to the question of the universe's future.\nGenre.\n\"Arcadia\" is, on the surface, somewhere between a tragedy and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy \u2013 \"noble\" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death \u2013 but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, epigrammatic dialogue.\nThemes.\n\"Arcadia\" explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics, and physics. It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading James Gleick's 1987 bestseller, \"\", \"which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor.\" Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including thermodynamics, computer algorithms, fractals, population dynamics, determinism (especially in the context of love and death), classics, landscape design, Romanticism vs. Classicism, English literature (particularly poetry), Byron, 18th century periodicals, modern academia, and even South Pacific botany. These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into epistemology, nihilism, and the origins of lust and madness.\n\"Arcadia\"'s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order \u2013 and even the separation of the two eras \u2013 dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: \"In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing.\" Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic \u2013 with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions \u2013 connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.\nThe center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at Bath Spa University, suggests: \nAt the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' \u2013 which therefore cannot really be disorder at all.\nA closely related theme in \"Arcadia\" is the opposition of Classicism and Romanticism. This appears most clearly in the running arguments between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. Their disagreements are about changing from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it. Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. \"The whole Romantic sham!\" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. \"It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling.\"\nAnother major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while Newtonian equations work both backwards and forwards, things in reality \u2013 like her rice pudding \u2013 cannot be \"unstirred.\" Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters \u2013 and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.\nThomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem \"Darkness\" by her \"real life\" contemporary, Lord Byron. Written in 1816 \u2013 the \"Year Without a Summer\", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano Mount Tambora erupting in the Dutch East Indies \u2013 \"Darkness\" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.\nThe play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict \u2013 Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling \u2013 they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.\nStyle.\nJim Hunter writes that \"Arcadia\" is a relatively realistic play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is \"much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras\". The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is comprehensible: the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion. \"Arcadia\"'s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature; we later see Val, with his computer, plotting them to produce the image of a leaf.\nLanguage.\nThe language of \"Arcadia\" switches between the colloquialisms of early 19th-century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.\nBut his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the \"look and feel\" of the past as perceived by the modern audience. Still, it has sufficient latitude in register to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of \"carnal embrace\" \u2013 but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he dismisses Chater's self-deceiving defence of his wife's reputation (which, Septimus says, \"could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry\"). With Lady Croom, in responding to his employer's description of Mrs. Chater as a \"harlot\", Septimus delicately admits that \"her passion is not as fixed\" as one might wish.\nIn the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic. But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric; and he unleashes a polemic against Valentine's scientific thought (describing the concept as no more than \"performance art\"), not from spite but for \"recreation\".\nThe play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to entropy, the deterministic universe and iterated equations in improvised, colloquial terms. In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials.\nConsciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if \"the future is all programmed like a computer\", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited \"because of sex\". Thomasina has been there before: \"If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future,\" she tells Septimus, then adds, \"Am I the first person to have thought of this?\" The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of chaos, illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking.\nTitle.\nThe play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: \"Et in Arcadia ego\". \"Arcadia\" refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, \"and in Arcadia I am\". The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's \"Eclogues\", while the phrase first appears in Guercino's painting dated in 1618-1622. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a \"memento mori\", with the phrase being spoken by Death: \"I, too, am in Arcadia\". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion.\nLady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as \"Here I am in Arcadia!\" Thomasina drily comments, \"Yes Mama, if you would have it so\". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation \"Even in Arcadia, there am I\". He is right \u2013 \"Oh, phooey to Death!\" she exclaims. Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life. Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using \"Et in Arcadia Ego\" for the title, but \"box office sense prevailed\".\nIn a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which \"true nature\" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and entropic decline using mathematics.\nContextual information.\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.\nOne of the play's main thematic concepts is chaos theory. Paul Edwards, in his essay \"Science in \"Hapgood\" and \"Arcadia\"\", notes that \"chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of classical physics), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy\".\nJohn Fleming, in his book \"Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos\", makes a similar observation. \"Deterministic chaos\", he writes, \"deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected dynamic systems to settle into stable, predictable behavior.\" But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. \"Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos \u2013 an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior.\"\nClosely related scientific and mathematical concepts in \"Arcadia\" are the second law of thermodynamics and entropy. Fleming describes these two principles. \"Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike Newton's laws of motion, do not go backward and forward, there is an 'arrow of time' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe.\"\nIn \"Arcadia\", Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that \"there is an underlying order to seemingly random events.\" The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them. Often these discussions themselves create order and connections beneath the appearance of disunity. For example, both Thomasina's theories on heat and Valentine's search for a \"signal\" in the \"noise\" of the local grouse population refer to the physicist Joseph Fourier and his development of the Fourier transform, which he first used to analyze the physics of heat transfer but has since found wide application. Though the characters would seem to have little in common, their work in fact relates to the same topic.\nSome ideas in the play recall Goethe's novella \"Elective Affinities\": Stoppard's characters \"Thomasina\" and \"Septimus\" have parallels in Goethe's \"Ottilie\" and \"Eduard\", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella. Among other parallels, the older work takes the theory of affinity between chemical elements as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable \"human chemistry\" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters. A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character \"Ottilie\" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this.\nProductions.\n \"Arcadia\" first opened at the Royal National Theatre in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by Trevor Nunn with Rufus Sewell as Septimus Hodge, Felicity Kendal as Hannah Jarvis, Bill Nighy as Bernard Nightingale, Emma Fielding as Thomasina Coverly, Allan Mitchell as Jellaby, Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingstone as Richard Noakes, Harriet Walter as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, Timothy Matthews as Augustus and Gus Coverly and Samuel West as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play.\nThe first New York production opened in March 1995, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. It was again directed by Trevor Nunn, but with an entirely new cast. It starred Billy Crudup as Septimus, Blair Brown as Hannah, Victor Garber as Bernard, Robert Sean Leonard as Valentine and Jennifer Dundas as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of Paul Giamatti, who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were Lisa Banes (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and Haviland Morris (Chloe). This production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and was nominated for the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, losing to Terrence McNally's \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\".\nIn December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.\nOn 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by David Leveaux, opened at the Duke of York's Theatre starring Dan Stevens (Septimus Hodge), Samantha Bond (Hannah Jarvis), Jessie Cave (Thomasina Coverly), Nancy Carroll (Lady Croom), Trevor Cooper (Richard Noakes), Sam Cox (Jellaby), Lucy Griffiths (Chlo\u00eb Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), Hugh Mitchell (Augustus/Gus Coverly), Neil Pearson (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and Ed Stoppard (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009.\n\"Arcadia\" returned to Broadway, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included Margaret Colin (Lady Croom), Billy Crudup (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), Ra\u00fal Esparza (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), Grace Gummer (Chlo\u00eb Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), Bel Powley (Thomasina Coverly), Tom Riley (Septimus Hodge), Noah Robbins (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and Lia Williams (Hannah Jarvis). The production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play.\nReception.\n\"The Times\", reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a \"perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy\". But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: \"[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters,\" noted critic Jack Tinker. \"One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know.\" After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. \"Daily Telegraph\" critic Charles Spencer commented: \"I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece\".\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the play as \"Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion\". But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism. The production left John Simon of \"New York Magazine\" with the view that \"Stoppard overdoes it\u2026\"Arcadia\" makes better reading than seeing\". The book review website The Pequod rated the play a 10.0 (out of 10.0), saying \"\"Arcadia\" combines an astonishing range of disparate elements \u2014 romance, humor, tragedy, sorrow, scientific history, and even gardening \u2014 into an entirely unique work of art.\"\nThe 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as \"Stoppard's finest work\". Michael Billington wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the play \"gets richer with each viewing. ... [T]here is poetry and passion behind the mathematics and metaphysics.\" Johann Hari of \"The Independent\" speculated that \"Arcadia\" would be recognised \"as the greatest play of its time\".\nThe 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" called the production \"a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific \"Arcadia\"\", noting that \"several central roles are slightly miscast\", and \"some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence.\" Similar concerns were raised by critics from the \"New York\" magazine, \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"New York Daily News\", \"Time Out New York\" and Bloomberg News.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also part of the defunct United Linux.\nYaST features tools that can configure many aspects of the system.\nYaST was released first in April 1995. The first SuSE distribution that included YaST was released in May 1996. YaST was re-written in 1999 and included first in SuSE Linux 6.3 as only an installer. YaST2 was added to the desktop in SuSE Linux 6.4 and co-existed with YaST1 until YaST1's removal in SuSE Linux 8.0.\nDetails.\nYaST is free software that SUSE has made available under the GPL in 2004. \nIt is a tool for administering and maintaining a SUSE Linux installation. It allows administrators to install software, configure hardware, set up networks and servers, and more.\nA feature of YaST is that it contains both Graphical user interface (GUI) and Text-based user interface (TUI) (with ncurses) front ends. This is especially useful for non-GUI installations such as servers, for system administration over slow Internet connections, and for when one is unable to boot into a graphical X server but still requires an advanced user interface to the package manager (for example, a novice user trying to downgrade an Xorg package to fix a graphical installation).\nYaST offers package management functionality through the ZYpp project. The first ZYpp enabled package management YaST applications had performance problems and long start up times, but was improved in the 10.2 and 10.3 releases. Starting with openSUSE 11.0 alpha 3, ZYpp was integrated with the SAT solver project, making YaST and Zypper faster than other rpm based package managers.\nYaST used to include SaX and SaX2, the Suse Advanced X configuration. SaX was re-written as SaX2 in SuSE Linux 6.4. SaX1 was removed in SuSE Linux 8.1 and SaX2 was removed from the YaST Control Center in openSUSE 11.2. SaX2 was removed completely in openSUSE 11.3. The GTK interface was removed in openSUSE Leap 42.1.\nYaST often receives updates and improvements in Tumbleweed and between versions of Leap. openSUSE Leap 15.1, for example, saw improvements to the YaST interface for managing firewalls including the addition of an interface in the command line version of YaST. In this same release of openSUSE Leap, YaST now has an updated logo and improved partition management module.\nYaST formerly utilized a bespoke scripting language known as YCP; in OpenSUSE 13.1, YaST was rewritten in Ruby.\nOn OpenSUSE Leap 16.0, YaST will be deprecated. The web-based Cockpit project is being adopted to supplant the YaST Control Center, a web-based installer known as Agama will replace the YaST installer, and Myrlyn will be introduced as a new Qt-based ZYpp front end with no dependency on YaST.\nAutoYaST.\nAutoYaST is a system for installing one or more openSUSE systems automatically without user intervention. AutoYaST installations are performed using a control file with installation and configuration data.\nThe profile of each current system is stored in codice_1.\nWebYaST.\nWebYaST is a web interface for YaST that can be used to check the status of the current machine. It can check on the installation of packages, shutdown or reboot the system, change some system settings (such as the time), and change the status of system services or daemons.\nYaST4Debian.\nThe change of license of YaST from a previous rather restrictive license to the GPL in 2004 made it possible to port YaST to other Linux distributions.\nAs a consequence of this, the project \"YaST4Debian\" was launched, which worked on a port of YaST to Debian.\nThe project, which was in contact with the YaST team of Novell/SuSE, reached some important milestones, such as the port of the modules \"yast2-ncurses\" and \"yast2-qt\". Currently, the project is dormant, searching for a new voluntary project maintainer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58388", "revid": "49982590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58388", "title": "Fis phenomenon", "text": "Phenomenon in linguistics\nThe fis phenomenon is a phenomenon during a child's language acquisition that demonstrates that perception of phonemes occurs earlier than a child's ability to produce the appropriate allophone. It is also illustrative of a larger theme in child language acquisition: that skills in linguistic comprehension generally precede corresponding skills in linguistic production. The name comes from an incident reported in 1960 by J. Berko and R. Brown, in which a child referred to his inflatable plastic fish as a \"fis\". However, when adults asked him, \"Is this your \"fis\"?\" he rejected the statement. When he was asked, \"Is this your fish?\" he responded, \"Yes, my fis.\" This shows that although the child could not produce the phoneme /\u0283/, he could perceive it as being different from the phoneme /s/. In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish since the language in question does not make such contrasts.\nOccurrences in ASL.\nResearchers saw the Fis Phenomenon occur while doing research on Juli, a toddler who speaks ASL. The observers had seen it occur with her use of the word for 'water' when Juli was outside holding rocks in her hand and speaking to the observer through a window. Juli produced the sign [ix-rock water ix-loc(hose)] with the \"20\" handshape error for \"water\". The observer saw what Juli had signed, thinking that Juli wanted to eat the rocks in her hand and commented to Juli that she could not eat the rocks. As soon as Juli saw that the observer had interpreted her signing attempt of 'water' being the sign for 'food/eat' she corrected herself and repeated her sign with the 'W' handshape which signaled 'water'. The adult then realized what Juli meant and asked if what she meant was that she wanted to use the water hose and Juli nodded.\nLanguage acquisition.\nAll languages can be deconstructed into smaller elements, they are considered levels of languages that are divided into: The Phonological System, the Reference System, the Morphological System, and the Syntactic System. The Phonological System correlates to the different stages that a child acquires language. The acquisition process begins at birth, the brain begins to specialize in the sounds heard around them and begin to produce vowel-like sounds. This is the cooing stage. The babbling stage, six to 11 months, is when consonants like /m/ and /b/ are combined with vowels, m\"a-ma-ma ba-ba-ba\". The next two stages are the one word stage, 12 to 18 months, and two word stage, 18 months to two years of age. At around two years, the child enters the telegraphic stage, where they learn to put multiple words together. Note that researchers can only estimate the ages in which a child transitions through the stages. This is due to many varying factors when the child is acquiring language, like mental capability, the right language environment, exposure to language, and more.\nThe Phonological System is broken up into two different categories, perception and production. As the child goes through the stage of acquiring the language, perception and production is being developed in the brain. The Fis Phenomenon occurs due to lack of production ability by the kid, though the child perceives the sound to be correct. The relation between perception, production and the Fis Phenomenon is discussed below.\nPerception.\nThe phonological performance of children is predominantly consistent and predictable, leading to the generally accepted notion that their performance is governed by a set of rules, and it is not a result of random deviations. These rules are used to navigate from the surface form (adult pronunciation) to child pronunciation. This idea might help explain the occurrence of things such as the Fis Phenomenon.\nThere is evidence to support the idea that a child manipulates isomorphic adult representations of language. This evidence stems from three areas: 1) that a child has the ability to recognize disparities in the adult form that the child is unable to produce 2) that the child understands their own speech and 3) their grammatical and morphological tendencies.\nThe role of perception in the phonological performance of children is that their lexical representation of the adult form is first passed through the child's perceptual filter. Meaning that the adult pronunciation, or surface form, is not necessarily the form that is being affected by the child's phonological rules. There is a clear difference between the adult form and the child's mental representation. Barton (1976) tested this hypothesis and the results largely supported it, though there were later requests for a \u201cperceptual explanation\u201d.\nThe most notable example, shown below, illustrates the perception of consonant clusters compared to the child's output. Clusters consisting of [+nasal] followed by a [+voice] or [-voice] consonant are perceived differently by children.\nmend \u2192 m\u025bn meant \u2192 m\u025bt\nThe nasal before a voiced consonant is long and notable (mend).\nThe nasal before an unvoiced consonant is indistinct, leaving the following consonant as the most notable of the cluster.\nThe child's mental representation is then converted by a small set of rules called Realization Rules, which are used to reach the final form, the child's pronunciation. An example of the implementation of Realization Rules is informally illustrated in the sample derivation below, where a child consistently produced \"squat\" as \"[g\u0254p]\":\n/skw\u0252t/ \u2192 [skw\u0254p] (harmonizing a coronal to a preceding labialized sequence /kw/)\n[skw\u0254p] \u2192 [kw\u0254p] (deleting pre-consonantal /s/)\n[kw\u0254p] \u2192 [k\u0254p] (deleting post-consonantal sonorants)\n[k\u0254p] \u2192 [g\u0254p] (neutralizing the voicing distinction)\nProduction.\nAlthough children seem to be able to recognize the correct pronunciation of \u201cfish\u201d, they can only produce an /s/, meaning that they are left saying \u201cfis\u201d instead. Since the problem doesn't seem to be speech perception, experts believe that the problem is associated with mostly the coordination of speech muscles, leaving them to think that these children's speech muscles need practice. One way that experts encourage the practice of speech production in children are by word/phrase repetition. In this case, it'll be helpful to practice words that contain the /\u0283/ sound in \u201cfish\u201d.\nExperiments and studies.\nCovert contrast as a stage in the acquisition of phonetics and phonology.\nScoobie et al. in 1996 looked into the notion of child perception and how they acquire their speech as well as how children contrast minimal pairs. Used Children with phonological disorders and focused on /s/ initial-stop clusters for their acquisition of them.\nInvariant order of phonological development.\nA 1941 study by Roman Jakobson hypothesized that children who speak English follow a basic phonological order when acquiring their language's feature distinctions and, more strongly, that some elements of this order are sequential with respect to others, \"i.e.\", that for some distinctions, a child cannot fully acquire that distinction unless the child has already learned one or more some specific other distinctions. In a 1948 study, Schvachkin hypothesized that Russian-speaking children develop phonetic distinctions in an invariant order. A table is then shown where the \u201chushing\u201d vs \u201chissing\u201d sibilants were second to last on the order of acquisition. Given that children are still refining and working on their phonetic production skills, it might be the case that these features are not produced accurately because previous ones still need work.\nJuliette Blevins and claims.\nJuliette Blevins claimed that children can perceive both their own use of the language minimal pairs along with the adult usages. Though the child may believe that the subtle differences in their use of the minimal pair can be perceived by the adult, because the child themselves can recognize the differences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ron Hubbard regarding substance abuse treatment and addiction. Its parent company is the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), which is owned and controlled by the Church of Scientology. Headquartered in Hollywood, California, United States, Narconon operates several dozen residential centers worldwide, chiefly in the U.S. and western Europe. The organization was formed in 1966 by Scientologist William Benitez with Hubbard's help, and was incorporated in 1970.257\nThe Scientology organization and Narconon state that Narconon is a secular program independent of Hubbard's writings about Scientology, and that it provides legitimate drug education and rehabilitation. The organization has been described by many government reports and former patients as a Scientology front group.\nHubbard's writings, which underlie the program, assert that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissue, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later on, and can be flushed out through a regimen known as Purification Rundown, which involves exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins. This hypothesis is contradicted by experimental evidence, and is not medically accepted. There are no independently recognized studies that confirm the efficacy of the Narconon program.\nThe program has garnered considerable controversy as a result of its origins in Scientology and its methods. Its drug rehabilitation treatment has been described as \"medically unsafe\", \"quackery\" and \"medical fraud\", while academic and medical experts have dismissed its educational program as containing \"factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling\". Narconon's facilities have been the location of several deaths, some of which have been linked to a lack of trained medical personnel on site.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nNarconon was established 19 February 1966 as a drug rehabilitation program based on the book \"\" by L. Ron Hubbard, the creator of Scientology, and was first delivered to drug abusers in the Arizona prison system. The name \"Narconon\" originally referred not to an organization but to the program.\nNarconon's creator was William C. Benitez, a former Arizona prison inmate who had served time for narcotics offenses. His work was supported by Hubbard, and in 1970 Hubbard sponsored the incorporation of Narconon as an organization. The organization was co-founded by Benitez and two Scientologists, Henning Heldt and Arthur Maren.\nEven before Narconon became established, Scientology and Dianetics were promoted as providing a cure for drug addiction. In 1970, the Rev. John W. Elliot, senior minister of the Church of Scientology and chairman of its Drug Abuse Prevention team, announced that \"Dianetic Counseling\" had \"completely cured 30 out of 30 people\" who came to Scientology for help. Rev. Elliott also reported that Dianetics could cure hay fever, asthma and arthritis.\nIn the early days of Narconon, no distinction was made between Scientology's \"religious\" and \"secular\" branches; Narconon was considered by Scientologists to be an example of Scientology in action. \"Narconon, with the Scientology program, is another example of the workability of Dianetics and Scientology\", said an adherent in 1970. \"The program has been expanded and is used in all Scientology churches and missions\".\nThe Narconon website reports that the keynote of Narconon is that the \"...individual is responsible for his own condition and that anyone can improve his condition if he is given a workable way to do so... man is basically good and it is pain, suffering, and loss that lead him astray\". It positions the program as an approach to rehabilitation without recourse to alternative drugs. This early program did not, however, deal directly with withdrawal symptoms. In 1973, the Narconon program adopted procedures to include drug-free withdrawal.\n21st century.\nA number of Scientologist celebrities have publicly attested that Narconon was helpful in their own lives. Musician Nicky Hopkins and actress Kirstie Alley have credited Narconon for their recovery from addiction to drugs and alcohol. Alley subsequently became a public spokesperson for Narconon. Elsewhere, the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project has used Hubbard's sauna detoxification regimen in an effort to improve the health of rescue workers exposed to toxic substances from 9/11, although the results are disputed. Toxicologist Dr Ronald E. Gots described the Narconon / Purification Rundown program in a 1987 report on its use by California firefighters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The treatment in California preyed upon the fears of concerned workers, but served no rational medical function. ... Moreover, the program itself, developed not by physicians or scientists, but by the founder of the Church of Scientology, has no recognized value in the established medical and scientific community. It is quackery.\nIn 2004 and 2005, \"WISE at Work\" magazine and \"International Scientology News\" each published articles clarifying the relationship between Narconon and Scientology; each placed Narconon in Scientology's \"Division 6B\", with responsibility for introducing the public to Scientology services.\nBy the end of 2005, according to the International Association of Scientologists (IAS), Narconon was operating 183 rehabilitation centers around the world. New centers opened that year included in Hastings, East Sussex, England (now closed), and in Battle Creek, Michigan. Narconon President Clark Carr asserted that drug prevention lectures \"have been given to over 2 million children and adults over several decades... and are currently being delivered across the United States, all New England States, Washington D.C., Georgia, Florida, Oklahoma and surrounding states, Michigan and Illinois, Texas, New Mexico, Idaho, California, Nevada, Hawaii and possibly others\" in response to an inquiry from \"The Humanist.\"\nOn 17 July 2006, the Narconon center in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, Canada, started a website at Narcodex.ca. Narcodex was a wiki purported to contain drug information. The domain name of Narcodex.ca was owned by ABLE Canada, a Scientology subsidiary. The funding for the website came entirely from Narconon Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, which also controlled the content on the site. The center was closed by the local health authorities in 2012.\nIn July 2013, Narconon proposed to acquire the 150 acre Hockley, Ontario, estate of Donald Blenkarn, who had died the previous year. Narconon planned to convert the estate into a rehabilitation center for alcohol and other drug use, but drew widespread opposition from residents who were opposed to the presence of a rehab center, and to the presence of Narconon and Scientology specifically. The Blenkarn family ultimately chose to sell to an unidentified person within the community for below the asking price, and rejected a counter-offer from Narconon.\nIn January 2014, Narconon instituted a Hubbard-based detoxification program in Annapolis, Maryland, to treat veterans suffering from war-related conditions. The treatments were funded by the Department of Defense through a September 2010 grant for $633,677 given to University of Albany, where David O. Carpenter serves as the director of the school's Institute for Health and the Environment and is the program's chief investigator. As of December 2014, seven Gulf War veterans completed the program. It was administered on a seven-day-per-week schedule, with the regimen being completed in 33 days. The program's purpose was to discover whether Hubbard's program has a scientific basis for therapy and whether it was effective in reducing symptoms and improving the functional status of veterans whose physical pain and anxiety improved upon completion of the program. Carpenter affirmed that the program was effective in his own treatment.\nNarconon and Scientology.\nNarconon's affiliation with the Church of Scientology has made the program a focus of controversy. The organization has never denied that many of its administrators are committed Scientologists or that its methods are based on the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard.\nIn its early days, Narconon used unaltered Scientology materials in its courses, and Scientology executives ran the organization; founders Heldt and Maren were high-ranking members of the Church's public-relations department known as the Guardian's Office (GO). In April 1970, Scientology spokesman Max Prudente described Narconon as \"based solely on the philosophy and tenets of Scientology\", claiming an 85% success rate.\nHowever, as Narconon promoted its drug treatment services to a variety of governmental jurisdictions within the U.S., the organization repeatedly found itself at the center of controversy when its ties to Scientology were raised by journalists or politicians. Such ties raised questions about the constitutional appropriateness of governmental bodies sponsoring a religiously affiliated organization (see \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\"). These problems were further intensified by claims that the program was medically unsound and served as a fundraising and recruitment program for Scientology.\nBy the late 1970s, Scientology was keen to disavow its connection with Narconon. When the FBI raided Scientology offices on 8 July 1977, papers seized revealed that Scientologists were instructed to refer to Narconon and other \"front groups\" using code names:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Codes should be used for the names of front groups that we do not want connected with the C of S and for anything that gives specific and actual evidence that the C of S is in legal control of B6 groups [of which Narconon was one].\nIn 1994, John Wood, the head of Narconon UK, denied any connection between Narconon and Scientology, saying, \"I know beyond doubt that Narconon does not recruit for nor promote the Church of Scientology\", despite the final stage in Narconon's process for patients at that time being \"Route to nearest Org (Scientology organisation) for further services\", but by 2001 Scientology spokesman Graeme Wilson was describing Narconon as Scientology's \"affiliate charity\".\nA March 1998 \"Boston Herald\" series exposed how two Scientology-linked groups, Narconon and the World Literacy Crusade, used anti-drug and learn-to-read programs to gain access to public schools without disclosing their Scientology ties. Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology International, who said in an interview that the Purification Rundown saved his life, confirmed after the \"Herald\" report was published that Scientology's Los Angeles law firm had hired private investigators to look into the personal life of \"Herald\" reporter Joseph Mallia, who wrote the series. The \"Herald\" noted numerous other instances over the years where reporters were harassed with \"noisy investigations\" after writing stories exposing Scientology.\nIn Montreal, Narconon employees describe themselves as \"FSM's\", a Scientology abbreviation for Field Staff Member, while in Georgia a memo released under court order showed Narconon executive director Mary Rieser reporting directly to Scientology's Office of Special Affairs (OSA) as well as to parent organization ABLE.\nDrug rehabilitation program.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nSince its establishment, Narconon has faced considerable controversy over the safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the organization's links to Scientology. Medical professionals have been sharply critical of Narconon's methods, which rely on theories of drug metabolism that are not supported by mainstream toxicology. Narconon teaches that drugs reside in body fat, and remain there indefinitely; and that to recover from drug abuse, addicts can remove the drugs from their fat through saunas and use of vitamins. Experts disagree with this basic understanding of physiology, saying that no significant amount of drugs are stored in fat, and that drugs can't be \"sweated out\" as Narconon claims. In one 2005 report, experts stated that Narconon's treatment methods \"does not reflect accurate, widely accepted medical and scientific evidence.\" Particular criticism has been directed at the therapy's use of vitamins (including massive doses of niacin) and extended sauna sessions.\nDavid Root, an occupational medicine practitioner and a member of the Narconon Scientific Advisory Board, defended the program's validity. He told the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" in 1991 that drugs and other poisons \"come out through the skin in the form of sebaceous, or fatty, sweat. The material is frequently visible and drips, or is rubbed off on towels\". This apparently explains the need for \"daily doses of vitamins, minerals, and oils, including niacin\".\nNarconon's \"New Life Program\" consists of two principal stages: detoxification and rehabilitation. The program, adapted from Hubbard's Purification Rundown, consists of six elements: exercise, sauna, supplements, sufficient liquids, regular diet with fresh vegetables, and adequate sleep.\nAccording to Narconon spokesman John Bitinas, there are more than 200 beds at Narconon Arrowhead, the program's flagship center in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma. Asked whether medications are used to help patients going through withdrawal, he said that, \"Narconon is drug-free, meaning we do not use substitute drugs as part of our rehabilitation process.\" All patients are assessed at enrollment to determine whether they are \"psychiatrically or medically qualified for the level of care we offer here. If they are found to need a higher level of care then Narconon is qualified to offer at that time, they are referred to a more appropriate facility.\" If patients require medications to treat physical conditions like diabetes or infections, those medications are prescribed by the Narconon physician, who is part-time but available on-call on a 24-hour basis, according to Bitinas. Each U.S. patient spends an average of three to four months at Narconon, for a fee that ranges from $10,000 to around $30,000.\nOverview.\nThe Narconon detoxification program is based on Hubbard's theory that \"small amounts of drugs [and their metabolites] stored in fat cells are released at a later time causing the person to re-experience the drug effect and desire to use again.\" According to Narconon, exercise helps to release toxins from body fat as fat deposits are burned for energy, while concurrently releasing chemicals via sweating, sebum (produced by the skin's sebaceous glands), and regular bowel movements.\nNarconon is not a medical model. The program rejects the disease model of addiction, and its literature has described the terminology used by that model as being disempowering to patients.\nThe Narconon program follows the \"social education\" model of drug rehabilitation. The program is four to six months long and includes a regimen of detoxification that includes \"aerobic exercise, dry-sauna sweating, hydration and nutrition supplements; life skills trainings; and personalized plans for after-graduation living.\" The main premise of the detoxification regimen is that \"the activation of drug residuals stored in the body can elicit drug cravings in the former drug user thus tempting relapse. The Narconon detoxification regimen is designed to eliminate drug residues from drug users' bodies and thus reduce the cravings that may be caused by these residues.\"\nExperts from mainstream medicine and toxicology have repeatedly argued that Hubbard's method has no validity: \"one may from a pharmacological point of view strongly question the idea of using enforced sweating to expel drugs from the body\", said Professor Folke Sjoqvist in a 1996 report for the Swedish government, while an Oklahoma Board of Mental Health report from 1990 states that, \"Although minute quantities of some drugs may be found in sweat the amount represents a small fraction of drug elimination\". In a deposition concerning the death of Patrick Desmond at Narconon Georgia, expert witness Louis A. Casal was questioned by plaintiff's attorney Jeff Harris:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNarconon asserts that methadone, amphetamines, methamphetamines, morphine, copper, mercury, and other toxins, some consumed years earlier, leave the body by means of sweating. This contrasts with the view of the body's drug retention taken by mainstream science, which has found that most recreational drugs leave the body within a few days (with the exception of cannabis, which in the case of frequent use can remain in the body for up to a month).\nNiacin.\nAccording to Narconon, vitamin and mineral supplements are needed to address nutritional deficiencies and offset nutrient loss due to sweating. Other key elements in the program are the use of niacin, which Hubbard believed to increase free fatty acid mobilization, and the inclusion of polyunsaturated fats that he thought to increase the excretion rate of some toxin compounds. Together with a proper amount of sleep, this regime is thought by Narconon to mobilize and eliminate long-term stored toxins.\nNarconon's \"drug bomb\" includes a niacin dose of 4000\u00a0mg/day. The risk to patients of taking high-dose niacin is one reason why medical experts assessing the Narconon program have found that it is a danger to patients; the program has been banned in a number of jurisdictions including Quebec and France as a result.\nBecause Narconon doctrines dictate that patients undergoing its program exhibit physical symptoms relating to the drugs that are (supposedly) being \"sweated out,\" and because Narconon's staff are not medically qualified or typically qualified in orthodox drug rehabilitation, there is a risk that serious medical symptoms\u2014from niacin overdose or from other causes\u2014may be misinterpreted by Narconon staff as the desirable effects of detoxification:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Narconon Program exposes its patients to the risk of delayed withdrawal phenomena such as seizures, delirium and/or hallucinations. ... The Narconon program presents a potential risk to the patients of the Narconon program that delayed withdrawal phenomena such as seizures, delirium or hallucination that are occasionally seen several days after cessation of drugs such as benzodiazepines, may be misinterpreted by Narconon's non-medical staff as the effect of mobilizing the drug from fat during the sauna sweat-out procedure period. There is also a potential risk that the reported re-experience of the abused drugs' effect during the sauna sweat-out program may be the result of misinterpreted symptoms of hyperthermia or electrolyte imbalance ...\nTraining routines.\nThe remainder of the Narconon course uses Scientology's \"Training Routines\" or \"TRs\".29258 They were originally devised by Hubbard to teach communications skills to Scientologists. In the Narconon variant, these courses claim to be designed to rehabilitate drug abusers. These routines sometimes include TR 8, which involves the individual commanding an ashtray to \"stand up\" and \"sit down\", and thanking it for doing so, as loudly as they can. Former Scientologists say that the purpose of the drill is for the individual to \"beam\" their \"intention\" into the ashtray to make it move.\nEfficacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nNarconon typically claims success rates as high as 75% of the graduates of its program remaining drug-free for the rest of their lives, and has in the past claimed \"very close to a 100% success rate\". However, these numbers are highly controversial, and there exist no independent studies that support these claims.\nIndependent researchers have found considerably lower rates of success. At least one website critical of Narconon cites a Swedish research study that gives a rate of 6.6%. Narconon has reported the same study's findings as being much more favorable, although its representation of the study is greatly simplified.\nThe Church of Scientology claims that \"the Narconon success rate is not merely the world's highest, it is four times better than international averages\", while a systematic review of evidence regarding Narconon's efficacy conducted by the Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services on behalf of the Norwegian Directorate of Health concluded that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Collectively, one quasi-experimental and five non-experimental studies document lack of evidence of the preventive effects of these programs. Thus, there is currently no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of Narconon as a primary or secondary drug prevention program. This is partly due to the insufficient research evidence about Narconon and partly due to the non-experimental nature of the few studies that exist.\nIn April 2014, the town council of Wyong, New South Wales, Australia refused permission for Narconon to open a new centre at nearby Yarramalong, saying that the program's method of treatment was a factor in the decision. Wyong Mayor Doug Eaton said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To be allowed in the area it'd have to be defined as a hospital and there wasn't enough material to demonstrate it could be so defined because my understanding of the rehab process it that it is more of a religious process than it is a medical process.\u2014\u200a\nEducation program.\nFlorida.\nIn 1999, Scientologists from Clearwater, Florida, tried to get a Narconon drug education program instituted into the Pinellas County school district curriculum. After a hearing on the matter, a school district committee refused to allow students to participate in an anti-drug program based on Hubbard's teachings, citing that teaching students about the \"tone scale\" and other trappings of Scientology was inappropriate for a drug education program for their schools.\nCalifornia.\nIn 2004, Narconon offered an anti-drug program to public schools in California, free of charge. However, a series of articles in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" in June 2004, resulted in California school officials investigating Narconon's claims. The study found that Narconon's program did not reflect medically and scientifically based practices and that it offered students misleading information about drug use and abuse. As a result of the investigation, on 23 February 2005, the state's superintendent of public instruction, Jack O'Connell, officially recommended that all schools in the state reject the Narconon program. O'Connell's secretary announced that the school systems in Los Angeles and San Francisco had dropped the program. The president of Narconon, Clark Carr, responded that the study presented only limited information about his organization's work, and that those efforts were \"accurate and relevant to the current challenges children face with drugs.\"\nA May 2014 investigation by the \"Chronicle\" discovered that some California schools were still using the Narconon program, in spite of the 2004 decision. Steve Heilig, one of the experts who evaluated the Narconon education program on behalf of the school district and found it to be scientifically unsound, urged schools to check the accreditation of drug education programs before allowing them access to students, saying, \"One imperative of drug education is that we not deceive students, as once they discover that you are not telling them factual information, they are likely to disbelieve everything you say\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe UK prisons ombudsman recommended to prison governors that Narconon rehabilitation programs not be used in prisons although some schools in the UK are using these programs; \"The Sunday Times\" said this was because schools are less aware of Narconon's links to Scientology. In September 2012, the 149 Church of England schools in the Diocese of London were warned not to accept offers from Narconon to give lectures to their pupils, following complaints from parents.\nIn November 2016, Narconon was reported to have given talks on the dangers of drug addiction in two schools in Camden, London. Elizabeth Kitcatt, Camden School for Girls headteacher, said in a statement that the students found the talk \"very useful\", while Harry Shapiro, Director of DrugWise, called out the schools for being unaware to the group's ties to Scientology. A Brecknock Primary spokeswoman said: \"The school's deputy head was in the room for the whole drug awareness talk and at no point was there any mention of Scientology or any religious connotations. It was marketed as an anti-drug talk and that's exactly what it was\". President of Narconon UK Noel Nile claimed that the group was \"in the business of saving lives\".\nCecchini/Lennox study.\nIn 2008, Narconon executive Marie Cecchini published, with Richard Lennox, a paper that claimed to show that the Narconon educational program reduced drug use among youths. However, the study was funded by Narconon's parent organisation, ABLE, and subsequent correspondence in the same journal asserted that the study's conclusions were contradicted by its own data: that the control group \"were more likely to resist pressures to take drugs\" than the Narconon group.\nDeaths.\nJocelyne Dorfmann, Grancey-sur-Ource, France (1984).\nIn 1984, a 34-year-old French woman named Jocelyne Dorfmann died from an untreated epilepsy seizure while undergoing treatment at a Narconon center in Grancey-sur-Ource (near Dijon). The assistant-director of that center was convicted of lack of assistance to a person in danger. The Narconon center was closed. Medical experts reported that her death was caused by \"an epileptic seizure due to the absence of sufficient treatment at its beginning and of emergency treatment during the seizure\". Narconon staff failed to call for medical assistance, as a result of which Dorfmann died.\nX del Pozo, Cercedilla, Spain (1985).\nIn 1985, a young man surnamed Del Pozo, a native of Ceuta, injected himself with an overdose of heroin while he was in Narconon Cercedilla, in the Community of Madrid. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he died. The El Escorial Court opened an investigation, but ended up closing the case for lack of evidence and testimonies to clarify the incident.\nParide Ella and Giuseppe Tomba, Valsassina, Italy (1995).\nIn 1995, two young men, Paride Ella (22) and Giuseppe Tomba (26), died suddenly at the Narconon centre in Taceno, Province of Lecco, Italy. Ella died of acute kidney failure (symptoms consistent with a niacin overdose), while the recorded cause of death for Giuseppe Tomba was heart attack. Both patients suffered similar symptoms, namely vomiting and diarrhea, for days before their deaths. The young men died within a few days of one another, in the so-called \"detoxification\" stage of the Narconon program.\nThe Narconon centre had no medical staff and was unable in either case to diagnose the seriousness of their condition. Before the deaths, Taceno's mayor had asked for the Narconon centre to be closed.\nFederica X, Torre dell'Orso, Italy (2002).\nIn 2002, a 33-year-old Italian patient identified as \"Federica X\", from Torre dell'Orso, died from peritonitis, according to her autopsy. She first began to suffer from stomach pains on Monday 7 October, and was driven to a first aid station where she was given painkillers. Federica was driven to hospital the following evening, where she died soon after being admitted in a coma.\nNarconon patient Giovanni Costa later stabbed staff member Rodolfo Savino, whom Costa claimed had ignored Federica's symptoms and had given her insufficient medical aid. Costa was arrested and charged with attempted murder.\nPatrick Desmond, Norcross, Georgia, United States (2008).\nPatrick W. \"Ricko\" Desmond, a former member of the United States Marine Corps, died at Narconon Georgia on 11 June 2008, aged 28, from a heroin overdose. Desmond's family alleged wrongful death and filed a lawsuit against Narconon, claiming that their actions led to his death and that Narconon falsely claimed to be a licensed inpatient program.\nWSB-TV in Atlanta reported that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The evidence includes documents with Narconon's letterhead with the word \"outpatient\" when reporting Patrick's death to state investigators, but letterhead on letters sent to Florida courts omitted the word \"outpatient\".\nDesmond's family paid Narconon $30,000 for his treatment. Narconon Georgia director Mary Rieser commented to a reporter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There's things that people do to themselves. Of course it's sad.\nThe lawsuit between Narconon Georgia and the Desmond family was settled out of court in February 2013, three days before jury selection was scheduled to begin. The settlement followed harsh sanctions against Narconon by the trial judge Stacey K. Hydrick, who said in a court order that Narconon Georgia had:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Intentionally, willfully and repeatedly provided false and misleading responses to plaintiff's discovery requests regarding issues relevant to the resolution of this case and that it had: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Repeatedly failed to produce, and on multiple occasions falsely denied the existence of clearly relevant, responsive documents and information.\nJudge Hydrick withdrew Narconon's response to the Desmond family's allegations, meaning that if the case had not been settled then the family's claims would essentially have gone unopposed by Narconon.\nNarconon International denied that it had any connection with Narconon Georgia, although documents disclosed in the Patrick case showed that Narconon Georgia's executive director, Mary Rieser, reported to Narconon International, Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, and to ABLE, describing in her reports the evening of Patrick's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On June 10th 2008 a student was watching a basketball game late in the evening with Brad in his apartment. They consumed tequila and the student gained access to his cash which was supposed to be locked in that apartment. A sad thing happened later in the evening. Two days later we tested Brad and he was dirty for methadone, PCP, cocaine and methamphetamine.\u2014\u200a\nJohn Cunningham, Watsonville, California, United States (2015).\nIn July 2015, John Cunningham, a 58-year-old Boeing employee addicted to benzodiazepines, was sent by his sister to Redwood Cliffs, a Narconon facility in Watsonville, California. The staff at Redwood Cliffs sent Cunningham to be detoxed to Bright Futures Recovery, which removed Cunningham from medications he was taking for depression. Cunningham was sent to the \"local ER three times in just five days for withdrawal symptoms\". On 22 August 2015, he was left alone in his room long enough for him to \"hang himself by a belt in his bedroom closet\". Cunningham's sister did not know that Narconon was a Scientology outfit until after her brother's death.\nRepresented by attorney H. Gavin Long, Cunningham's family sued Redwood Cliffs and Bright Futures Recovery for $1 million each. The rehabilitation centers countered with an offer of \"$100,000 and $350,000, respectively\". The family refused and took the case to a jury in Santa Cruz. After a twelve-day trial where Narconon tried to argue that they had not referred Cunningham to Bright Futures Recovery, the jury awarded the family $11 million. According to journalist Tony Ortega, it was very rare for the case to go to a jury, and since this court case, \"Scientology cut ties with its Northern California Narconon network, and the Redwood Cliffs facility has closed. But Narconon is still on the hook for its share of the verdict\".\nDeaths at Narconon Arrowhead, Oklahoma, United States (2009\u20132012).\nIn August 2012, Pittsburg County sheriffs and the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health (ODMHSAS), along with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), began an investigation of deaths at Narconon Arrowhead following the deaths of three patients in a period of nine months.\nThe investigation included the recent deaths of four patients: Stacy Dawn Murphy, aged 20, who died at Narconon Arrowhead on 19 July 2012; Hillary Holten, 21, who was found dead at the facility on 11 April 2012; and 32-year-old Gabriel Graves, who died at the facility on 26 October 2011. The investigation later expanded to cover the death of 28-year-old Kaysie Dianne Werninck, who died at Narconon Arrowhead on 3 March 2009.\nFollowing media attention surrounding the deaths, the National Association of Forensic Counselors (NAFC) permanently revoked the Certified Chemical Dependency Counseling certification of several Narconon Arrowhead employees, including director Gary Smith. In August 2013, the ODMHSAS permanently revoked the facility's permit for medical detoxification after Narconon had exhausted all avenues for protesting the decision.\nIn August 2013, Inspector General Kim Poff and investigator Michael DeLong, both of the ODMHSAS, who had been investigating the deaths at Narconon Arrowhead, had their employment terminated. No reason was given for the termination, but the investigators' attorney later claimed that the two were wrongfully fired, saying: \"Their termination, in part, relates to the Narconon investigation\".\nKaysie Dianne Werninck (2009).\nKaysie Dianne Werninck died at Narconon Arrowhead on 3 March 2009. Her parents filed a lawsuit against the center claiming her death was \"a result of the defendant's gross negligence\". The case was settled.\nGabriel Graves (2011).\nGabriel Graves, who died at the facility in October 2011, was the subject of an open records request made to the ODMHSAS by the \"Tulsa World\" newspaper, which revealed reports of use and distribution of drugs at the facility. Graves' autopsy recorded his cause of death as \"unknown\".\nHillary Holten (2012).\nHillary Holten died on April 11, 2012. Her parents filed a lawsuit against Narconon Arrowhead, and alleged Hillary had died due to lack of medical care. Their lawsuit states that she \"had a history of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, a condition that required the daily administration of Dexamethasone and in extreme circumstances, an injection of liquid cortisone\", and that Narconon Arrowhead did not properly manage her condition. Gary Smith of Narconon refrained from comment, adding that \"there are federal rights to privacy laws which prohibit us from discussing anything about former clients.\"\nStacy Dawn Murphy (2012).\nStacy Dawn Murphy died on July 20, 2012 at Narconon Arrowhead. Stacy's father said Narconon officials told him that, when his daughter was found dead alone in the \"detox\" room, she had not been checked on for two and a half hours. \"That's too long, if they thought she was overdosed, why didn't they have someone with her the whole time?\" he said, adding, \"We sent her there to get better, not to die\". Gary Smith responded in an email statement that, \"It is always deeply saddening when drug addiction takes a life or destroys a family. ... For the family the pain of losing a loved one to addiction is unimaginable.\"\nA patient who was resident at Narconon Arrowhead at the time of Stacy's death said, \"There was no doctor there, no nurse on staff. There's nothing like that there ... The staff, they're all former patients. ... My understanding is that everyone there is pretty much a former patient. ... The drugs that would have saved Stacy's life were either not available or no one there knew how to administer it.\" Now told reporters that he feared retaliation by Narconon for talking to the police and media: \"I'm afraid for my life.\" Stacy's roommate, Destanie Ramsey, called police on the night of her death in order to leave Narconon Arrowhead, where she claimed she was being held against her will.\nPublic and media response.\nProtests over the deaths took place outside Narconon Arrowhead; one protest in late June 2012, planned to include bereaved family members, was disrupted by road resurfacing works outside the facility, paid for by Narconon. Pittsburg County Commission Chairman Gene Rogers explained that, \"[Gary Smith] called me and said they might be having a problem with the public that weekend and he wanted help policing the area and he asked about doing overlaying [of the road]\".\nOklahoma State Senator Tom Ivester commented that, \"Clearly something isn't right and we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end this predatory business being run by the Church of Scientology disguised as drug treatment\", adding, \"This is a disgusting business that preys on desperate family members and their sick loved ones, scamming them out of thousands of dollars with the promise of providing hope and new life. It's a disgrace to have these people operating in the state of Oklahoma.\" In direct response to the Arrowhead deaths, Ivestor introduced legislation to expand Oklahoma's ability to regulate rehab facilities.\nIn response to an NBC \"Rock Center\" segment on the facility, Narconon President Clark Carr called its criticism of Narconon \"bigoted\" and described the program as addicts' \"last chance for a decent, honest, drug-free life\".\nControversies.\nState code violations.\nNarconon facilities in California have been cited repeatedly for violations by state inspectors. Violations included administering medication without authorization, having alcohol on the premises, and not having proper bedding for patients. Narconon has also attempted to silence opposition, including sending letters to neighbors of a proposed facility in Leona Valley threatening legal action for criticism. Residents had been concerned that Narconon would increase crime. The local town council recommended an eight-foot security fence and independent security, which was objected to by Narconon officials.\nNarconon Chilocco licensing problems.\nNarconon began operations in Oklahoma in 1990, as an unlicensed facility on the site of the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School near the town of Newkirk, claiming that it did not require a state license as it was operating on an Indian reservation. In 1992 Narconon applied for a state licence, and was twice refused by the ODMHSAS, which found \"no evidence that drug and alcohol abuse education was part of the program\" and declared the program \"not medically safe\", a decision to which Narconon spokesperson Kirstie Alley responded, \"The arrogance and irresponsibility of the mental health board will not survive the outrage of the many thousands of parents, graduates and supporters from the scientific community\".\nBetween 1989 and 1992, Narconon, through Scientology attorney Tim Bowles, filed lawsuits against the ODMHSAS; its members; and local newspaper editor Robert Lobsinger, who had written about Narconon's Scientology connection. Narconon contacted the Mayor of Newkirk's 12-year-old son at a library, and hired private detectives to research Narconon's opponents, leading residents to fear retribution if they spoke out against the organization. A Narconon spokesman quoted by \"The New York Times\" described Narconon's critics in Newkirk as \"in favor of drug abuse... They're either connected to selling drugs or they're using drugs.\"\nNarconon achieved exemption from the requirement for state licensing in 1992, as a result of approval from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. Scientology leader David Miscavige commented on the case in an interview with ABC News \"Nightline\", saying, \"There are a group of people on this planet who find us to be a threat to their existence, and they will do everything in their power to stop us. And that is the mental health field. I didn't pick a war with them.\"\nIn 2012, a paid advert in the \"Oklahoma Gazette\" contained allegations from a previously unknown group named \"Oklahomans for the preservation of homeland security and american values, (ohsav)\" [\"sic\"]. The advert referred to recent TV news stories about Narconon and Scientology, named some of Narconon's critics in Oklahoma, and alleged those critics had \"subjugated [their] individuality for [their] own thirst for hatred\", had an \"agenda of religious intolerance, racial discrimination or disdain for corporate America\", and blamed them for \"public disinformation hate campaigns against Blacks, Jews, Muslims and Scientologists\". The advertisement showed the characteristics of a dead agenting campaign.\nInvestigation in Russia.\nIn April 2007, it was revealed that the public procurator in Moscow's South District had begun an investigation into Narconon's activities in Russia. The \"Moskovskij Komsomolets\" newspaper reported that legal proceedings were begun against the head of the clinic \"Narconon-Standard\" for violating bans in Russian medical practices. Russian law enforcement became interested after receiving many complaints from citizens about the high fees charged by Narconon. The Narconon office in Bolshaya Tulskaya St. was searched, and documents and unidentified medications were seized. One year later, as part of an investigation in Ulyanovsk into the Church of Scientology, police searched a Narconon office in the town of Dimitrovgrad.\nNarconon Trois-Rivi\u00e8res closed by Quebec health authorities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nOn 17 April 2012, Quebec health officials ordered the Narconon facility in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to close, and to relocate its 32 residents. After an investigation into Narconon Trois-Rivi\u00e8res' activities by the Centre Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d'Agr\u00e9ment (CQA), an independent body that monitors the quality of healthcare, the Mauricie Region's Health and Social Services Agency decided not to re-certify Narconon due to concerns that its methods \"may represent a risk to health\" of patients.\nThe Agency's director, Marc Latour, said that Narconon Trois-Rivi\u00e8res was dangerous for patients, that it violated many of the criteria governing rehabilitation centres in Quebec, and that there was no medical supervision and no scientific basis to its treatment. He added that at least four clients had been hospitalized in recent months because of methods used at the centre. Narconon Trois-Rivi\u00e8res issued a response, saying, \"People with drug problems and their families should have a right to choose the program that works for them as these days there are many good alternative programs\".\nThe closure followed a two-year campaign by ex-Narconon patient and staff member David Love, whose negative experiences with the program prompted him to become one of its fiercest critics in Canada. While he was at Narconon Trois-Rivieres, Love reports that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;staff members withheld insulin from a diabetic patient undergoing the sauna treatment. That young man ended up in hospital for three days, Love said. In another [incident], [Narconon] took away a patient's antidepressants. He jumped from a second-floor window in a suicide attempt.\nLove is one of five former Narconon patients who have filed a complaint with Quebec's Human Rights Commission, alleging that their drug addiction was exploited by Narconon, which recruited them into the program and made them perform manual labour while taking part in it. Love also alleges that Narconon Trois-Rivieres earned around $16\u00a0million for Scientology between its opening in 2005 and its forced closure in 2012.\nNarconon President Clark Carr stated that the facility closed because the province changed its stance on \"what kind of drug rehabilitation it would tolerate\" to \"strictly medical, drug substitution, and so forth\". Narconon was informed that it had to reacquire a license, but would only be approved if its method of treatment was changed.\nPur Detox suicide attempt.\nIn September 2012, Pur Detox, a Narconon offshoot, was sued in Orange County, California, for negligence, medical malpractice, and negligent supervision. William Sweeney, the plaintiff, \"suffered severe personal injuries\" after a suicide attempt, jumping from a third floor balcony at the clinic, in Dana Point. Sweeney's complaint alleges that he was taken off his prescribed psychiatric medication at the facility, and that it was this which led to his suicide attempt.\nArrest of Heber Jentzsch.\nIn December 1988, the president of the Church of Scientology International, Heber Jentzsch, was arrested in Spain after an investigation into Narconon that resulted in (later dropped) allegations that he and Scientology were defrauding Spanish citizens and running its centers with unqualified staff. The judge in the case said at a news conference after the arrests that the only god of Scientology was money, and compared the church to a pyramid scheme in which members pay increasing sums of money. The judge said that Narconon swindled its clients and lured them into Scientology. By the end of 1991, the Spanish court found there was no evidence to support prosecutors' allegations that drug rehabilitation and other programs sponsored by Scientology in Spain amounted to illicit gatherings aimed at activities such as fraud. In April 2002, the charge was formally dropped. The court also ordered that the bail bond deposited for Jentzsch's release in 1988 be returned to Scientology along with interest, which nearly doubled the original amount.\nSlatkin fraud.\nOn 8 November 2006, the Associated Press reported that Narconon was one of the Scientology groups that would pay back a total of $3.5 million of illegal funds from EarthLink co-founder Reed Slatkin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Slatkin, who was once an ordained Scientology minister, paid $1.7 million from his scheme directly to Scientology groups, while millions of dollars more were funneled through other investors to groups affiliated with the church, bankruptcy trustee R. Todd Neilson said in court filings. Among the church groups to receive ill-gotten gains from Slatkin's scheme were Narconon International, the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International and the Church of Scientology Western United States, the filings said. The $3.5 million being returned by the church groups was the result of a negotiated compromise, Scientology attorney David Schindler and Alexander Pilmer, an attorney for Neilson, said.\nHead of Narconon deported from Kazakhstan.\nIn July 2008, the head of Narconon in Kazakhstan was deported: Kazakh Justice Minister Zagipa Baliyeva announced that \"foreigners from the USA, Georgia, South Korea and Japan have been deported from the country by law-enforcement agencies and in line with court rulings for violating the rules regarding the stay of foreigners and carrying out missionary activities without registration. In particular, with a further ban on entering Kazakhstan for five years, the head of the Narconon public foundation affiliated with the Church of Scientology has been deported,\" adding, \"27 cases were uncovered where heads of non-traditional religious organizations violated the law on the freedom of conscience and religious organizations; in particular, materials propagating radical ideas and teachings of non-traditional religions were seized from them\".\nAccusation of website graphics design/layout plagiarism.\nIn January 2001, Narconon came under fire when they appeared to plagiarize the entire layout and site design of the webzine Urban75.com for their websites heroinaddiction.com and cocaineaddiction.com, among others. The editor of Urban75 posted up comparisons of the copying, showing that Narconon had not even removed Urban75's hidden JavaScript code, unique to Urban75. \"The Register\" noted the irony of this scandal, quoting a critic who wrote, \"Scientology has sued countless individuals and organizations putatively [sic] for 'copyright violation' and the organization claims loudly that they're at the 'forefront of protecting proprietary information on the Internet'.\"\nNarconon Georgia closed amid investigation for insurance fraud.\nIn April 2013, agents of the insurance commissioner of the U.S. state of Georgia and the Gwinnett County district attorney's office searched the group's offices in Norcross, Georgia, questioning employees as they arrived at work and impounding more than a dozen computers and boxes full of documents. The insurance commissioner said during the investigation that, \"We have credible information that indicates that insurance fraud is taking place with Narconon\". The family of one patient said that the group was billing insurance companies for treatments that had never been given, and the doctors for whom the costs were being billed claimed never to have met the patient.\nState investigators discovered nearly $3\u00a0million of insurance fraud at Narconon Georgia; in September 2013, the facility surrendered its state license in order to avoid criminal charges.\nLawsuits.\nCalifornia.\nIn March 2014, attorney Ryan Hamilton filed two civil lawsuits against Narconon with the state of California.\nThe first civil suit was filed on behalf of Angelo Amato of Illinois, who purchased Narconon's Purification Rundown at Narconon Fresh Start (a.k.a. Sunshine Summit Lodge) in Warner Springs, after Amato searched the Internet for drug treatment facilities and believed claims by Scientology that purported to be from an \"independent consultant\" web site. Amato claims to have been defrauded of $31,000 and began the Narconon program only to discover that it was actually Scientology being practiced, alleging that no actual drug treatment was offered at the facility.\nThe second civil suit was filed on behalf of plaintiffs Christie Estrada and Branden Chavez of New Mexico, who also researched \"drug treatment facilities\" on the Internet and were allegedly deceived by Narconon Fresh Start in to paying $33,000 before the Purification Rundown process could be applied, with Narconon Fresh Start allegedly asking for $23,000 of that fee up front in cash. The defendants in this case are also Narconon Fresh Start.\nThe core plaintiff complaints cover a spectrum of allegations of criminal misconduct by Scientology that include insurance fraud, denial that Narconon is tied to Scientology, fraudulent claims that Narconon staff were medically trained in drug treatment, and a number of other deceptive claims.\nNevada.\nIn February 2014, Hamilton filed an additional civil suit against Narconon with the state of Nevada. His clients, Michael Tarr and his mother Cathy, sued Narconon Fresh Start (doing business as Rainbow Canyon Retreat) for fraud, breach of contract and negligence. The Tarrs claimed that, while residing at Narconon to treat his former heroin addiction, Michael did not receive detoxification treatment but rather indoctrination into Scientology, and asked the court to award them punitive damages as well as a refund of Narconon's $33,000 fees and their legal expenses.\nThe Tarrs' civil suit followed closely behind a previous lawsuit filed by Hamilton on behalf of David, Stacy, and Jack Welch of Texas, who also allege that Narconon Fresh Start committed breach of contract, fraud, and negligence.\nIn April 2014, Hamilton filed another lawsuit against Narconon Nevada, this time on behalf of Harry and Lauren Geanacopulos and their son Peter. The Geanacopulos family's complaint argues that Narconon's programme content and success rate were misrepresented to them and that it has no genuine medical or scientific basis.

He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University. A distinguished lifetime fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a life member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, he was best known as a social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, as what he saw as the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as scientism.\nSzasz maintained throughout his career that he was not anti-psychiatry but rather that he opposed coercive psychiatry. He was a staunch opponent of civil commitment and involuntary psychiatric treatment, but he believed in and practiced psychiatry and psychotherapy that involved consenting adults.\nLife and death.\nSzasz was born on April 15, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary, the second son of Jewish parents Gyula and Lily Sz\u00e1sz. In 1938, the family moved to the United States, where he attended the University of Cincinnati for his Bachelor of Science in physics, followed by an MD.\nSzasz completed his residency requirement at the Cincinnati General Hospital, then trained as a psychoanalyst at Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1951 to 1956. He took a position as a professor at State University of New York in 1956 and received tenure in 1962, taking 24 months out for duty as a practicing psychiatrist with the U.S. Naval Reserve.\nSzasz had two daughters. His wife, Rosine, died in 1971. Szasz's colleague Jeff Schaler described her death as a suicide.\nThomas Szasz ended his own life on September 8, 2012, after suffering a painful spinal-compression fracture from a recent fall. Szasz had previously argued for the right to die in his writings.\nCareer.\nThomas Szasz was a strong critic of institutional psychiatry and was a prolific writer. According to psychiatrist Tony B. Benning, there were \"three major themes in Szasz's writings: his contention that there is no such thing as mental illness, his contention that individual responsibility is never compromised in those suffering from what is generally considered as mental illness, and his perennial interest in calling attention to the political nature of psychiatric diagnosis\". According to Williams and Caplan, Szasz is \"best known for his view that without a diagnosis of neurological disease or damage, a psychiatric diagnosis was meaningless\". Though his ideas had little influence on mainstream psychiatry, many were supported by some behavioral and social scientists.\nSzasz first presented his attack on \"mental illness\" as a legal term in 1958 in the \"Columbia Law Review\". In his article he argued that mental illness was no more a fact bearing on a suspect's guilt than is possession by the devil.\nHis books \"The Myth of Mental Illness\" (1961) and \"The Manufacture of Madness\" (1970) set out some of the arguments most associated with him.\nIn 1961, Szasz testified before a United States Senate committee, arguing that using mental hospitals to incarcerate people defined as insane violated the general assumptions of the patient\u2013doctor relationship, and turned the doctor into a warden and keeper of a prison.\nSzasz was convinced there was a metaphorical character to mental disorders, and its uses in psychiatry were frequently injurious. He set himself a task to delegitimize legitimating agencies and authorities, and what he saw as their vast powers, enforced by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, mental health laws, mental health courts, and mental health sentences.\nSzasz was a critic of the influence of modern medicine on society, which he considered to be the secularization of religion's hold on humankind. Criticizing scientism, he targeted psychiatry in particular, underscoring its campaigns against masturbation at the end of the 19th century, its use of medical imagery and language to describe misbehavior, its reliance on involuntary mental hospitalization to protect society, and the use of lobotomy and other interventions to treat psychosis. Szasz consistently paid attention to the power of language in the establishment and maintenance of the social order, both in small interpersonal and in wider social, economic, and/or political spheres.\nPositions.\nMental illness is a myth.\nIn Szasz's view, people who are said to have a mental illness only have \"problems in living\". Diagnoses of \"mental illness\" or \"mental disorder\" are passed off as scientific but are judgments (of disdain) to support certain uses of power by authorities. In that line of thinking, schizophrenia becomes not the name of a disease entity but a judgment of extreme psychiatric and social disapprobation. Szasz called schizophrenia \"the sacred symbol of psychiatry\" because those so labeled have long provided and continue to provide justification for psychiatric theories, treatments, abuses, and reforms.\nHe argued that psychiatry is a pseudoscience that parodies medicine by using medical-sounding words and that, supported by the state through various Mental Health Acts, it has become a modern secular state religion. As a vastly elaborate social control system which disguises itself under the claims of being rational, systematic and therefore scientific, it constitutes a fundamental threat to freedom and dignity.\nIn \"The Myth of Mental Illness\" he argued that people can only play \"the mental illness game\" if their partner and those around them play a complementary role \u2013 a situation that would later be described as codependency.\nSeparate psychiatry and the state.\nSzasz believed that if we accept that \"mental illness\" is a euphemism for behaviors that are disapproved of, then the state has no right to force psychiatric \"treatment\" on these individuals. Similarly, the state should not be able to interfere in mental health practices between consenting adults (for example, by legally controlling the supply of psychotropic drugs or psychiatric medication). The medicalization of government produces a \"therapeutic state\", designating someone as, for example, \"insane\" or as a \"drug addict\".\nIn \"Ceremonial Chemistry\" (1974), he argued that the same persecution that targeted witches, Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals now targets \"drug addicts\" and \"insane\" people. Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as an example obesity: instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts, and the social injunction \"not to be overweight\" is to be considered as a moral order, not as scientific advice as it claims to be. As with those thought bad (insane people), and those who took the wrong drugs (drug addicts), medicine created a category for those who had the wrong weight (obesity).\nSzasz argued that psychiatrics were created in the 17th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of social behavior; a new specialization, \"drogophobia\", was created in the 20th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics (from the Greek \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"baros,\" for \"weight\"), was created to deal with those who erred from the medical norms concerning the weight the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970 the American Society of Bariatric Physicians had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.\nThe therapeutic state.\nThe \"therapeutic state\" is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963. The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the \"therapeutic state\", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed (\"cured\") through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured. When faced with demands for measures to curtail smoking in public, binge-drinking, gambling or obesity, ministers say that \"we must guard against charges of nanny statism.\" The \"nanny state\" has turned into the \"therapeutic state\" where nanny has given way to counselor. Nanny just told people what to do; counselors also tell them what to think and what to feel. The \"nanny state\" was punitive, austere, and authoritarian, the therapeutic state is touchy-feely, supportive \u2013 and even more authoritarian.\nAccording to Szasz, \"the therapeutic state swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion.\" Faced with the problem of \"madness\", Western individualism proved to be ill-prepared to defend the rights of the individual: modern man has no more right to be a madman than medieval man had a right to be a heretic because if once people agree that they have identified the one true God, or Good, it brings about that they have to guard members and nonmembers of the group from the temptation to worship false gods or goods. A secularization of God and the medicalization of good resulted in the post-Enlightenment version of this view: once people agree that they have identified the one true reason, it brings about that they have to guard against the temptation to worship unreason \u2013 that is, madness.\nCivil libertarians warn that the marriage of the state with psychiatry could have catastrophic consequences for civilization. In the same vein as the separation of church and state, Szasz believes that a solid wall must exist between psychiatry and the state.\nAbolish involuntary commitment.\nSzasz made efforts to abolish involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for over two decades, and in 1970 took a part in founding the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH). Its founding was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the \"American Journal of Psychiatry\" and \"American Journal of Public Health\". Until it was dissolved in 1980, the association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, \"The Abolitionist\".\nAccording to Williams and Caplan, \"Szasz's philosophical activism was not intended to improve the treatment of people affected by mental illness as much as to block involuntary treatment.\" Citing Szasz's writings, legal reforms were enacted, and all 50 US states narrowed their criteria for involuntary commitment from the prior standard of \"need for treatment\"\u2014causing the number of patients in public psychiatric hospitals to plummet, and the homeless population to balloon. It also exponentially increased the prison population with an estimate of 40\u201380% inmates with mental illness by 2006.\nThree legal decisions were key:\nAbolish insanity defense.\nSzasz advocated for the removal of the insanity defense. Just as legal systems work on the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty, individuals accused of crimes should not be presumed incompetent simply because a doctor or psychiatrist labels them as such. Mental incompetence should be assessed like any other form of incompetence, i.e., by purely legal and judicial means with the right of representation and appeal by the accused.\nSzasz believed that testimony about the mental competence of a defendant should not be admissible in trials. Szasz compared psychiatric testimony in court to religious testimony, suggesting that both lack empirical grounding. Szasz argued that the insanity defense was a legal tactic invented to circumvent the punishments of the church, which at the time included confiscation of the property of those who committed suicide, often leaving widows and orphans destitute. Only an insane person would do such a thing to his widow and children, it was successfully argued. This is legal mercy masquerading as medicine, according to Szasz.\nRight to drugs.\nAccording to Szasz, drug addiction is not a \"disease\" to be cured through legal drugs but a social habit. Szasz also argued in favor of a free market for drugs. He criticized the war on drugs, arguing that using drugs is in fact a victimless crime. Prohibition itself constituted the crime. He argued that the war on drugs leads states to do things that would have never been considered half a century before, such as prohibiting a person from ingesting certain substances or interfering in other countries to impede the production of certain plants, e.g. coca eradication plans, or the campaigns against opium; both are traditional plants opposed by the Western world. Although Szasz was skeptical about the merits of psychotropic medications, he favored the repeal of drug prohibition.\nSzasz also drew analogies between the persecution of the drug-using minority and the persecution of Jewish and homosexual minorities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Nazis spoke of having a \"Jewish problem\". We now speak of having a drug-abuse problem. Actually, \"Jewish problem\" was the name the Germans gave to their persecution of the Jews; \"drug-abuse problem\" is the name we give to the persecution of people who use certain drugs.\u2014\u200a\nSzasz cites former U.S. Representative James M. Hanley's reference to drug users as \"vermin\", using \"the same metaphor for condemning persons who use or sell illegal drugs that the Nazis used to justify murdering Jews by poisoned gas\u2014namely, that the persecuted persons are not human beings, but \"vermin.\"\nRight to die.\nIn an analogy to birth control, Szasz argued that individuals should be able to choose when to die without interference from medicine or the state, just as they are able to choose when to conceive without outside interference. He considered suicide and the right to die to be among the most fundamental rights, but he opposed state-sanctioned euthanasia. In his 2006 book about Virginia Woolf, Szasz stated that Woolf put an end to her life by a conscious and deliberate act, her suicide being an expression of her freedom of choice.\nCitizens Commission on Human Rights.\nIn 1969, Szasz and the Church of Scientology co-founded the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) to oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments. Szasz served on CCHR's Board of Advisors as Founding Commissioner. In the keynote address at the 25th anniversary of CCHR, Szasz stated, \"We should all honor CCHR because it is really the organization that for the first time in human history has organized a politically, socially, internationally significant voice to combat psychiatry. This has never been done in human history before.\" In a 2009 interview aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Szasz explained that he was an atheist and collaborated with Scientology only out of convenience, as an organization with money who were active in this cause.\nReception.\nIn the summer of 2001, Szasz took part in a on human rights in psychiatry held in Berlin between June 30 and July 2, 2001, and was part of the majority verdict which claimed that there was \"serious abuse of human rights in psychiatry\" and that psychiatry was \"guilty of the combination of force and unaccountability\".\nIn 2005, Robert Evan Kendell presented a critique of Szasz's conception of disease and the contention that mental illness is \"mythical\" as presented in \"The Myth of Mental Illness\". Kendell argued that Szasz's conception of disease exclusively in terms of \"lesion\", i.e., morphological abnormality, is arbitrary and unsound, and his argument that \"disease or illness can only affect the body\" was based on Cartesian dualism which is already known to be medically inaccurate.\nIn 2011, Szasz published an essay in recognition of the 50th anniversary of \"The Myth of Mental Illness\", which had been delivered as a plenary address at the 2010 International Congress of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Edinburgh. In the same issue, a response from Edward Shorter echoed Kendell's criticism and dismissed Szasz as largely premised on a conception of mind drawn from the psychiatry of the early-mid 20th century \u2013 namely psychoanalytic psychiatry \u2013 which does not exist in the current disciplines of psychiatry or medicine. Modern psychiatry has \"de facto\" dispensed with the idea of \"mental illness\", i.e., the notion that psychiatric disease is mainly or entirely psychogenic and is not a part of biological psychiatry. To this extent, he said, Szasz's critique does not address contemporary biologically-oriented psychiatry, and is irrelevant.\nAccording to Williams and Caplan (2012), Szasz mostly influenced libertarians and the anti-psychiatry movement, with resultant devastating effects on those with severe mental illness, by promoting his \"non-evidence based, philosophical foundation for the practice of mental health that prioritised the views and preferences of individuals with serious mental disorders above the true interests of a person not in the grip of mental illness\". Considering that mental illness greatly contributes to homelessness and incarceration in the USA, they challenge whether \"people with serious mental disorders who are confined to these settings [are] any better off than their pre-Szaszian predecessors who once filled asylums?\"\nAwards.\nSzasz received significant public recognition for his work, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

M. Montgomery). Written for all ages, it has been considered a classic children's novel since the mid-20th century. Set in the late 19th century, the novel recounts the adventures of an 11-year-old orphan girl Anne Shirley sent by mistake to two middle-aged siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, who had originally intended to adopt a boy to help them on their farm in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island, Canada. The novel recounts how Anne makes her way through life with the Cuthberts, in school, and within the town.\n\"Anne of Green Gables\" has been translated into at least 36 languages and has sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books worldwide to date in any language, and is taught to students around the world. It was the first of many novels; Montgomery wrote numerous sequels. In 2008, an authorized prequel\", Before Green Gables\" by Budge Wilson was published on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the series.\nThe book has been adapted as films, television film, and animated and live-action television series. Musicals and plays have also been created, with productions annually in Canada, Europe, and Japan.\nSource.\nIn writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's \"Metropolitan Magazine\" and put on the wall of her bedroom as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her \"youthful idealism and spirituality.\"\nMontgomery was inspired by the formula stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) that were popular at the time, featuring orphans, and often girls with the name Ann; however, she distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra \"e\". She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish.\nSummary.\nAnne Shirley, a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia (based upon the real community of New London, Prince Edward Island), is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried siblings in their fifties and sixties, after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Marilla and Matthew had originally sought to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at Green Gables, which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea (based on Cavendish, Prince Edward Island). Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.\nAnne is fanciful, imaginative, eager to please, and dramatic. She is also adamant her name should always be spelled with an \"e\" at the end. However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising her red hair, freckles, and pale, thin frame, but liking her nose. She is talkative, especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and consideration, along with kind, quiet Matthew's encouragement, Marilla decides to let her stay.\nAnne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables.\nThe book recounts Anne's struggles and joys in settling into Green Gables (the first real home she's ever known): the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her friendship with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or \"bosom friend\" as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmate Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair. For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes several times. As time passes, however, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but her pride and stubbornness keep her from speaking to him.\nThe book also follows Anne's adventures in Avonlea. Episodes include playtime with her friends Diana, calm, placid Jane Andrews, and beautiful, boy-crazy Ruby Gillis. She has run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters, Gertie and Josie, and frequent domestic \"scrapes\" such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thinks is raspberry cordial but which turns out to be currant wine.\nAt sixteen, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane, and several other students, excluding Diana, much to Anne's dismay. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship awarded to the top student in English. This scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the real Dalhousie College) on the mainland in Nova Scotia.\nNear the end of the book, however, tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables, Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is failing. She plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School in favor of Anne, to work at the White Sands School instead, knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew's death. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next.\nPublication history.\n\"Anne of Green Gables\" was first published by L.C. Page &amp; Co. of Boston on June 13, 1908. The book quickly became a best-seller, selling over 19,000 copies in the first five months. Since then, over 50 million copies have been sold worldwide. A full scan of the first edition, first impression is provided by the L. M. Montgomery Institute.\nMontgomery's original manuscript is preserved by the Confederation Centre of the Arts, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Since 2022, the Centre has hosted a project in which digital images of the entire manuscript can be examined online. A transcript of the manuscript was published by Nimbus Publishing in 2019.\nMontgomery's original typescript and the corrected proofs are lost.\nIn 2019, Canadian publishing company Bradan Press crowdfunded a Scottish-Gaelic translation of \"Anne of Green Gables\", titled Anna Ruadh, through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. The book, released in 2020, is the first Scottish-Gaelic translation of \"Anne of Green Gables\".\nRelated works.\nBased on the popularity of her first book, Montgomery wrote a series of sequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley.\nThe prequel, \"Before Green Gables\" (2008), was written by Budge Wilson with the authorization of the heirs of L. M. Montgomery.\nTourism and merchandising.\nThe Green Gables farmhouse is located in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions on Prince Edward Island have been developed based on the fictional Anne, and provincial license plates once bore her image. Balsam Hollow, the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods and Campbell Pond, the body of water which inspired The Lake of Shining Waters, both described in the book, are located in the vicinity. The Anne of Green Gables Museum is located in Park Corner, PEI, in a home that inspired L. M. Montgomery.\nThe province and tourist facilities have highlighted the local connections to the internationally popular novels. \"Anne of Green Gables\" has been translated into 36 languages. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, \"tourism by \"Anne\" fans is an important part of the Island economy\". \nThe novel has been popular in Japan, where it is known as \"Red-haired Anne\" (), and where it has been included in the national school curriculum since 1952. 'Anne' is revered as \"an icon\" in Japan, especially since 1979 when this story was broadcast as an anime, \"Anne of Green Gables\". Japanese couples travel to Prince Edward Island to have civil wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm. Some Japanese girls arrive as tourists with red-dyed hair styled in pigtails, to look like Anne. \nA replica of the Green Gables house in Cavendish is located in the theme park Canadian World in Ashibetsu, Hokkaido, Japan. The park was a less expensive alternative for Japanese tourists instead of traveling to P.E.I. The park hosted performances featuring actresses playing Anne and Diana. The theme park is open during the summer season with free admission, though there are no longer staff or interpreters.\nAdaptations.\nFilms.\nThe first filmed appearance of Anne Shirley was in the 1919 silent film, \"Anne of Green Gables\", in which the role was played by Mary Miles Minter. The film was directed by William Desmond Taylor. As of 2011, no prints of this silent film adaptation are known to survive. The 1919 film version moved the story from Prince Edward Island to New England, which one American critic\u2014unaware that the novel was set in Canada\u2014praised for \"the genuine New England atmosphere called for by the story\". Montgomery herself was infuriated with the film for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary:\nIt was a pretty little play well photographed, but I think if I hadn't already known it was from my book, that I would never had recognized it. The landscape and folks were 'New England', never P.E Island...A skunk and an American flag were introduced - both equally unknown in PE Island. I could have shrieked with rage over the latter. Such crass, blatant Yankeeism!.\nMontgomery disapproved of Minter's performance, writing she had portrayed \"a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne\", and complained about a scene where Shirley waved about a shotgun as something that her Anne would never do.\nIn the 1934 adaptation of the novel, Anne was portrayed by Dawn O'Day, who legally changed her name to \"Anne Shirley.\" She reprised the role in \"Anne of Windy Poplars\", a 1940 film adaptation. Montgomery liked the 1934 film more than the 1919 film, not least because now the book's dialogue could be portrayed on the silver screen and that two scenes were filmed on location in Prince Edward Island (though the rest of the film was shot in California), but still charged that neither the 1919 nor 1934 versions of \"Anne of Green Gables\" quite got her book right. Writing about the 1934 version of \"Anne of Green Gables\", Montgomery wrote in her diary that it was a \"thousand times\" better than the 1919 version, but still it: \"was so entirely different from \"my\" vision of the scenes and the people that it did not seem like \"my\" book at all\". The British scholar Faye Hammill wrote that 1934 film version stripped Anne of the \"Canadian and feminist\" aspects that the Anne of the books possessed, stating that there was something about Anne that Hollywood cannot get right. Hammill observed that the idea that Anne was entirely cheerful is a product of the film and television versions as the Anne of the books has to deal with loss, rejection, cruel authority figures, and loneliness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group was founded in 1970 in opposition to a hydroelectric power plant in New York.\nAs of 2019, the NRDC had over three million members, with online activities nationwide, and a staff of about 700 lawyers, scientists and other policy experts.\nHistory.\nNRDC was founded in 1970. Its establishment was partially an outgrowth of the \"Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission\", the Storm King case. The case centered on Con Ed's plan to build the world's largest hydroelectric facility at Storm King Mountain in New York's Hudson Valley. The proposed facility would have pumped vast amounts of water from the Hudson River to a reservoir and released it through turbines to generate electricity at peak demand.\nA dozen concerned citizens organized the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference in opposition to the project, citing its environmental impact, and the group, represented by Whitney North Seymour Jr., his law partner Stephen Duggan, and David Sive, sued the Federal Power Commission and successfully achieved a ruling that groups such as Scenic Hudson and other environmentalist groups had the standing to challenge the FPC's administrative rulings. Realizing that continued environmentalist litigation would require a nationally organized, professionalized group of lawyers and scientists, Duggan, Seymour, and Sive obtained funding from the Ford Foundation and joined forces with Gus Speth and three other recent Yale Law School graduates of the class of 1969: Richard Ayres, Edward Strohbehn Jr., and John Bryson.\nJohn H. Adams was the group's first staff member and Duggan its founding chairman; Seymour, Laurance Rockefeller, and others served as members of the board.\nIn September 1979 The Ford Foundation pulled funding for the NRDC alongside the Environmental Defense Fund after Henry Ford II said groups receiving foundation money were \"antibusiness\" and \"biting the hand that feeds them.\" The NRDC had recently challenged the FDA's interim approval for Coca-Cola's first plastic bottle made of acrylonitrile/styrene. The FDA reported that test animals exposed to acrylonitrile had \"significantly lowered body weight and other adverse effects, including lesions in the central nervous system and growths in the ear ducts.\" and suspended its approval. \nPosition on nuclear power.\nIn the 1970s, NRDC sought to block expansion of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. It had advocated for the closure of the plant until it ceased operations in 2021. NRDC has also sought to close the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California. In 2018, the NRDC took no position on legislative proposals in New Jersey to subsidize three of its nuclear reactors. NRDC has argued that nuclear power is not a viable energy source to mitigate climate change, arguing that it poses public health and safety risks through nuclear waste and nuclear proliferation. In 2014, NRDC president Frances Beinecke said that the NRDC could not support nuclear power because it would lose donations.\nPosition on solar power.\nAccording to NRDC, rooftop solar power plays an \"essential role... in our shared mission to confront the climate crisis.\" However, its activism on rooftop solar has sparked controversy. In 2022, NRDC called for reductions in subsidies for rooftop solar power in California, prompting criticism of NRDC by other environmental groups.\nIn 2012, NRDC sued the federal government to stop the 663.5-megawatt Calico solar station in the Mojave Desert in California. NRDC said the solar plant would imperil protected wildlife.\nPosition on hydropower.\nNRDC's position on hydropower is that it is not a renewable energy source. When Indian Point was scheduled for closure, NRDC held no position on a proposal to build a transmission line to Quebec to access excess hydropower while arguing, \"we certainly would not be on board where [hydropower] gobbles up the space we think should be covered by true renewables\".\nPrograms.\nNRDC states the purpose of its work is \"safeguard the earth\u2014its people, its plants and animals, and the natural systems on which all life depends,\" and to \"ensure the rights of all people to the air, the water and the wild, and to prevent special interests from undermining public interests.\" Their stated areas of work include: \"climate change, communities, energy, food, health, oceans, water, the wild\".\nAs a legal advocacy group, the NRDC works to accomplish environmental goals by operating within the legal system to reduce pollution and protect natural resources through litigation, and by working with professionals in science, law, and policy at the national and international level. The NRDC's Center for Campaigns &amp; Organizing (CC&amp;O) also oversees the NRDC Action Fund, a separate 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization which engages in political and electoral activities.\nNRDC published \"onEarth\", a quarterly magazine that dealt with environmental challenges, through 2016. It was founded in 1979 as \"The Amicus Journal\". As \"Amicus\", it won the George Polk Award in 1983 for special interest reporting.\nStaff.\nThe council's first president was John H. Adams, who served until 2006. He was replaced by Frances Beinecke, who served as president from 2006 to 2015. The third president was Rhea Suh, who served from 2015 to 2019.\nIn 2020, Gina McCarthy served as the CEO and president. She previously served as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration and became White House National Climate Advisor in the Biden administration in 2021. In 2021, NRDC selected Manish Bapna, formerly of the World Resources Institute, as their new president and CEO. At their web site NRDC state they have about 700 employees including scientists, lawyers, and policy advocates.\nLegislation.\n\"NRDC v. U.S. EPA\" (1973), with David Schoenbrod caused the United States Environmental Protection Agency to begin reducing tetraethyl lead in gasoline sooner than they were going to.\nNRDC opposed the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands.\nNRDC supported the EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 (H.R. 5057; 113th Congress), a bill that would exempt certain external power supplies from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the United States Department of Energy in February 2014.\nEffect on administrative law.\nNRDC has been involved in the following Supreme Court cases interpreting United States administrative law.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They made the first controlled, sustained flight of an engine-powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the \"Wright Flyer\" on December 17, 1903, four miles (6\u00a0km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. In 1904 the Wright brothers developed the \"Wright Flyer II\", which made longer-duration flights including the first circle, followed in 1905 by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the \"Wright Flyer III\".\nThe brothers' breakthrough invention was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. Their system of aircraft controls made fixed-wing powered flight possible and remains standard on airplanes of all kinds.183 Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines. Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.156228\nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.169 This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists and involved in the bicycle business in various ways. From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, the brothers conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop mechanic Charles Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.\nThe Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to numerous counter-claims. Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that the Wrights were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company well, but did not have the business skills or temperament necessary to dominate the rapidly growing aviation industry at the time.\nChildhood.\nWilbur and Orville Wright were two of seven children born to Milton Wright, a clergyman, and Susan Catherine Koerner. Milton Wright's mother, Catherine Reeder, was descended from the progenitor of the Vanderbilt family\u00a0\u2013 one of America's richest families\u00a0\u2013 and the Huguenot Gano family of New Rochelle, New York. Wilbur was born near Millville, Indiana, in 1867; Orville in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871. The brothers never married. The other Wright siblings were Reuchlin, Lorin, Katharine, and twins Otis and Ida (died in infancy).\nNone of the Wright children had middle names. Instead, their father tried hard to give them distinctive first names. Wilbur was named for Willbur Fisk and Orville for Orville Dewey, both clergymen that Milton Wright admired. They were \"Will\" and \"Orv\" to their friends and in Dayton, and their neighbors knew them simply as \"the bishop's kids\", or \"the bishop's boys\".\nBecause of their father's position as a bishop in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, he traveled often and the Wrights frequently moved \u2013 twelve times before finally returning permanently to Dayton in 1884. In elementary school, Orville was given to mischief and was once expelled. In 1878, when the family lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, their father brought home a toy helicopter for his two younger sons. The device was based on an invention of French aeronautical pioneer Alphonse P\u00e9naud. Made of paper, bamboo and cork with a rubber band to twirl its rotor, it was about long. Wilbur and Orville played with it until it broke, and then built their own. In later years, they pointed to their experience with the toy as the spark of their interest in flying.\nEarly career and research.\nBoth brothers attended high school, but did not receive diplomas. The family's abrupt move in 1884 from Richmond, Indiana, to Dayton, Ohio, where the family had lived during the 1870s, prevented Wilbur from receiving his diploma after finishing four years of high school. The diploma was awarded posthumously to Wilbur on April 16, 1994, which would have been his 127th birthday. In late 1885 or early 1886, while playing an ice-skating game with friends Wilbur was struck in the face with a hockey stick by Oliver Crook Haugh, who later became a serial killer. Wilbur lost his front teeth. He had been vigorous and athletic until then, and although his injuries did not appear especially severe, he became withdrawn. He had planned to attend Yale. Instead, he spent the next few years largely housebound. During this time he cared for his mother, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis, read extensively in his father's library and ably assisted his father during times of controversy within the Brethren Church,164 but also expressed unease over his own lack of ambition.130\nOrville dropped out of high school after his junior year to start a printing business in 1889, having designed and built his own printing press with Wilbur's help. Wilbur joined the print shop, and in March the brothers launched a weekly newspaper, the \"West Side News\". Subsequent issues listed Orville as publisher and Wilbur as editor on the masthead. In April 1890 they converted the paper to a daily, \"The Evening Item\", but it lasted only four months. They then focused on commercial printing. One of their clients was Orville's friend and classmate, Paul Laurence Dunbar, who rose to international acclaim as a ground-breaking African-American poet and writer. For a brief period the Wrights printed the \"Dayton Tattler\", a weekly newspaper that Dunbar edited.\nCapitalizing on the national bicycle craze (spurred by the invention of the safety bicycle and its substantial advantages over the penny-farthing design), in December 1892 the brothers opened a repair and sales shop (the Wright Cycle Exchange, later the Wright Cycle Company) and in 1896 began manufacturing their own brand. They used this endeavor to fund their growing interest in flight. In the early or mid-1890s they saw newspaper or magazine articles and probably photographs of the dramatic glides by Otto Lilienthal in Germany.\n1896 brought three important aeronautical events. In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam-powered fixed-wing model aircraft. In mid-year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider. These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began.\nWilbur said, \"Lilienthal was without question the greatest of the precursors, and the world owes to him a great debt.\" In May\u00a01899 Wilbur wrote a letter to the Smithsonian Institution requesting information and publications about aeronautics. Drawing on the work of Sir George Cayley, Chanute, Lilienthal, Leonardo da Vinci, and Langley, they began their mechanical aeronautical experimentation that year.\nThe Wright brothers always presented a unified image to the public, sharing equally in the credit for their invention. Biographers note that Wilbur took the initiative in 1899 and 1900, writing of \"my\" machine and \"my\" plans before Orville became deeply involved when the first person singular became the plural \"we\" and \"our\". Author James Tobin asserts, \"it is impossible to imagine Orville, bright as he was, supplying the driving force that started their work and kept it going from the back room of a store in Ohio to conferences with capitalists, presidents, and kings. Will did that. He was the leader, from the beginning to the end.\"\nIdeas about control.\nDespite Lilienthal's fate, the brothers favored his strategy: to practice gliding in order to master the art of control before attempting motor-driven flight. The death of British aeronaut Percy Pilcher in another hang gliding crash in October 1899 only reinforced their opinion that a reliable method of pilot control was the key to successful \u2013 and safe \u2013 flight. At the outset of their experiments they regarded control as the unsolved third part of \"the flying problem\". The other two parts\u00a0\u2013 wings and engines\u00a0\u2013 they believed were already sufficiently promising.166\nThe Wright brothers' plan thus differed sharply from more experienced practitioners of the day, notably Ader, Maxim, and Langley, who all built powerful engines, attached them to airframes equipped with untested control devices, and expected to take to the air with no previous flying experience. Although agreeing with Lilienthal's idea of practice, the Wrights saw that his method of balance and control by shifting his body weight was inadequate. They were determined to find something better.\nOn the basis of observation, Wilbur concluded that birds changed the angle of the ends of their wings to make their bodies roll right or left. The brothers decided this would also be a good way for a flying machine to turn \u2013 to \"bank\" or \"lean\" into the turn just like a bird \u2013 and just like a person riding a bicycle, an experience with which they were thoroughly familiar. What is equally important, they hoped this method would enable recovery when the wind tilted the machine to one side (lateral balance). They puzzled over how to achieve the same effect with man-made wings and eventually discovered wing-warping when Wilbur idly twisted a long inner-tube box at the bicycle shop.\nOther aeronautical investigators regarded flight as if it were not so different from surface locomotion, except the surface would be elevated. They thought in terms of a ship's rudder for steering, while the flying machine remained essentially level in the air, as did a train or an automobile or a ship at the surface. The idea of deliberately leaning, or rolling, to one side either seemed undesirable or did not enter their thinking. Some of these other investigators, including Langley and Chanute, sought the elusive ideal of \"inherent stability\", believing the pilot of a flying machine would not be able to react quickly enough to wind disturbances to use mechanical controls effectively. The Wright brothers, in contrast, wanted the pilot to have absolute control.168\u2013169 For that reason, their early designs made no concessions toward built-in stability (such as dihedral wings). They deliberately designed their 1903 first powered flyer with anhedral (drooping) wings, which are inherently unstable, but less susceptible to upset by gusty cross winds.\nFlights.\nToward flight.\nOn July 27, 1899, the brothers put wing warping to the test by building and flying a biplane kite with a wingspan, and a curved wing with a chord. When the wings were warped, or twisted, the trailing edge that was warped down produced more lift than the opposite wing, causing a rolling motion. The warping was controlled by four lines between kite and crossed sticks held by the kite flyer. In return, the kite was under lateral control.\nIn 1900 the brothers went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to begin their manned gliding experiments. In his reply to Wilbur's first letter, Octave Chanute had suggested the mid-Atlantic coast for its regular breezes and soft sandy landing surface. Wilbur also requested and examined U.S. Weather Bureau data, and decided on Kitty Hawk after receiving information from the government meteorologist stationed there.\nKitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters, who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.\nGliders.\nThe Wrights based the design of their kite and full-size gliders on work done in the 1890s by other aviation pioneers. They adopted the basic design of the Chanute-Herring biplane hang glider (\"double-decker\" as the Wrights called it), which flew well in the 1896 experiments near Chicago, and used aeronautical data on lift that Otto Lilienthal had published. The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of the top surface.\nThe brothers did not discover this principle, but took advantage of it. The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley. Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used cambered wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces.\nThe wooden uprights between the wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them from, a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal.73 Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one.\nAccording to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as he did not want to have to explain to their father, Bishop Wright, if Orville got injured.198\n1900.\nThe brothers flew the glider for only a few days in the early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, probably on October 3, Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes. Most of the kite tests were unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast.\nThey tested wing-warping using control ropes from the ground. The glider was also tested unmanned while suspended from a small homemade tower. Wilbur, but not Orville, made about a dozen free glides on only a single day, October 20. For those tests the brothers trekked four miles (6km) south to the Kill Devil Hills, a group of sand dunes up to high (where they made camp in each of the next three years). Although the glider's lift was less than expected, the brothers were encouraged because the craft's front elevator worked well and they had no accidents. However, the small number of free glides meant they were not able to give wing-warping a true test.\nThe pilot lay flat on the lower wing, as planned, to reduce aerodynamic drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through an opening in the wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.\n1901.\nBefore returning to Kitty Hawk in the summer of 1901, Wilbur published two articles, \"The Angle of Incidence\" in \"The Aeronautical Journal\", and \"The Horizontal Position During Gliding Flight\" in \"Illustrierte Aeronautische Mitteilungen\". The brothers brought all of the material they thought was needed to be self-sufficient at Kitty Hawk. Besides living in tents once again, they built a combination workshop and hangar. Measuring long by wide, the ends opened upward for easy glider access.\nHoping to improve lift, they built the 1901 glider with a much larger wing area and made dozens of flights in July and August for distances of . The glider stalled a few times, but the parachute effect of the forward elevator allowed Wilbur to make a safe flat landing, instead of a nose-dive. These incidents wedded the Wrights even more strongly to the \"canard\" design, which they did not give up until 1910. The glider, however, delivered two major disappointments. It produced only about one-third the lift calculated and sometimes pointed opposite the intended direction of a turn \u2013 a problem later known as adverse yaw \u2013 when Wilbur used the wing-warping control. On the trip home a deeply dejected Wilbur remarked to Orville that man would not fly in a thousand years.\nThe poor lift of the gliders led the Wrights to question the accuracy of Lilienthal's data, as well as the \"Smeaton coefficient\" of air pressure, a value which had been in use for over 100 years and was part of the accepted equation for lift.\nThe Wrights used this equation to calculate the amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years a wide variety of values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 0.0033 (similar to the number Langley used), not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift.\nThe brothers decided to find out if Lilienthal's data for lift coefficients were correct. They devised an experimental apparatus which consisted of a freely rotating bicycle wheel mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars of a bicycle. The brothers took turns pedaling the bicycle vigorously, creating air flow over the horizontal wheel. Attached vertically to the wheel were an airfoil and a flat plate mounted 90\u00b0 away. As air passed by the airfoil, the lift it generated, if unopposed, would cause the wheel to rotate.\nThe flat plate was oriented so its drag would push the wheel in the opposite direction of the airfoil. The airfoil and flat plate were made in specific sizes such that, according to Lilienthal's measurements, the lift generated by the airfoil would exactly counterbalance the drag generated by the flat plate and the wheel would not turn. However, when the brothers tested the device, the wheel \"did\" turn. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag \u2013 or all of them \u2013 were in error.\nThey then built a six-foot (1.8\u00a0m) wind tunnel in their shop, and between October and December\u00a01901 conducted systematic tests on dozens of miniature wings. The \"balances\" they devised and mounted inside the tunnel to hold the wings looked crude, made of bicycle spokes and scrap metal, but were \"as critical to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers as were the gliders.\"225 The devices allowed the brothers to balance lift against drag and accurately calculate the performance of each wing. They could also see which wings worked well as they looked through the viewing window in the top of the tunnel. The tests yielded a trove of valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value, and that Lilienthal's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done.226\nBefore the detailed wind tunnel tests, Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation to give a lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900\u20131901 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report was published in the \"Journal\" of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled \"Some Aeronautical Experiments\" in a 300\u00a0copy printing.\n1902.\nLilienthal had made \"whirling arm\" tests on only a few wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a different shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 scale-model wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord \u2013 the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better lift-to-drag ratio than the stubbier wings the brothers had tried so far. With this knowledge, and a more accurate Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider.\nThe wind tunnel tests, made from October to December 1901, were described by biographer Fred Howard as \"the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense\". In their September 1908 \"Century Magazine\" article, the Wrights explained, \"The calculations on which all flying machines had been based were unreliable, and ... every experiment was simply groping in the dark ... We cast it all aside and decided to rely entirely upon our own investigations.\"\nThe 1902 glider wing had a flatter airfoil, with the camber reduced to a ratio of 1-in-24, in contrast to the previous thicker wing. The larger aspect ratio was achieved by increasing the wingspan and shortening the chord. The glider also had a new structural feature: A fixed, rear vertical rudder, which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems. However, the 1902 glider encountered trouble in crosswinds and steep banked turns, when it sometimes spiraled into the ground \u2013 a phenomenon the brothers called \"well digging\". According to Combs, \"They knew that when the earlier 1901 glider banked, it would begin to slide sideways through the air, and if the side motion was left uncorrected, or took place too quickly, the glider would go into an uncontrolled pivoting motion. Now, with vertical fins added to correct this, the glider again went into a pivoting motion, but in the opposite direction, with the nose swinging downward.\"\nOrville apparently visualized that the fixed rudder resisted the effect of corrective wing-warping when attempting to level off from a turn. He wrote in his diary that on the night of October 2, \"I studied out a new vertical rudder\". The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problem. They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilot's warping \"cradle\", so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wing-warping and rudder deflection. The apparatus made the trailing edge of the rudder turn away from whichever end of the wings had more drag (and lift) due to warping. The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wing-warping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance. Furthermore, when the glider banked into a turn, rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft in the direction of the turn, eliminating adverse yaw.\nIn short, the Wrights discovered the true purpose of the movable vertical rudder. Its role was not to change the direction of flight, as a rudder does in sailing, but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn \u2013 the change in direction \u2013 was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.\nWith their new method, the Wrights achieved true control in turns for the first time on October 9, a major milestone. From September 20 until the last weeks of October, they flew over a thousand flights. The longest duration was up to 26 seconds, and the longest distance more than . Having demonstrated lift, control, and stability, the brothers now turned their focus to the problem of power.\nThus did three-axis control evolve: wing-warping for roll (lateral motion), forward elevator for pitch (up and down) and rear rudder for yaw (side to side). On March 23, 1903, the Wrights applied for their famous patent for a \"Flying Machine\", based on their successful 1902 glider. Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of three-axis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to, or even more significant, than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer. Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplane.\nAdding power.\nIn addition to developing the lift equation, the brothers also developed the equation for drag. It is of the same form as the lift equation, except the coefficient of drag replaces the coefficient of lift, computing drag instead of lift. They used this equation to answer the question, \"Is there enough power in the engine to produce a thrust adequate to overcome the drag of the total frame\u00a0...,\" in the words of Combs. The Wrights then \"...\u00a0measured the pull in pounds on various parts of their aircraft, including the pull on each of the wings of the biplane in level position in known wind velocities ... They also devised a formula for power-to-weight ratio and propeller efficiency that would answer whether or not they could supply to the propellers the power necessary to deliver the thrust to maintain flight ... they even computed the thrust of their propellers to within 1\u00a0percent of the thrust actually delivered\u00a0...\"\nIn 1903 the brothers built the powered \"Wright Flyer\", using their preferred material for construction, spruce, a strong and lightweight wood, and Pride of the West muslin for surface coverings. They also designed and carved their own wooden propellers, and had a purpose-built gasoline engine fabricated in their bicycle shop. They thought propeller design would be a simple matter and intended to adapt data from shipbuilding. However, their library research disclosed no established formulae for either marine or air propellers, and they found themselves with no sure starting point. They discussed and argued the question, sometimes heatedly, until they concluded that an aeronautical propeller is essentially a wing rotating in the vertical plane. On that basis, they used data from more wind tunnel tests to design their propellers. The finished blades were just over eight feet long, made of three laminations of glued spruce. The Wrights decided on twin \"pusher\" propellers (counter-rotating to cancel torque), which would act on a greater quantity of air than a single relatively slow propeller and not disturb airflow over the leading edge of the wings.\nWilbur made a March 1903 entry in his notebook indicating the prototype propeller was 66% efficient. Modern wind tunnel tests on reproduction 1903 propellers show they were more than 75% efficient under the conditions of the first flights, \"a remarkable feat\", and actually had a peak efficiency of 82%. The Wrights wrote to several engine manufacturers, but none could meet their need for a sufficiently light-weight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers.245\nTo keep the weight down the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice at the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: The fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.\nThe propeller drive chains, resembling those of bicycles, were supplied by a manufacturer of heavy-duty automobile chains. The \"Flyer\" cost less than a thousand dollars, in contrast to more than $50,000 in government funds given to Samuel Langley for his man-carrying Great Aerodrome. In 1903 $1,000 was . The \"Wright Flyer\" had a wingspan of , weighed , and had a , engine.\nOn June 24, 1903, Wilbur made a second presentation in Chicago to the Western Society of Engineers. He gave details about their 1902 experiments and glider flights, but avoided any mention of their plans for powered flight.\nFirst powered flight.\nIn camp at Kill Devil Hills, the Wrights endured weeks of delays caused by broken propeller shafts during engine tests. After the shafts were replaced (requiring two trips back to Dayton), Wilbur won a coin toss and made a three-second flight attempt on December 14, 1903, stalling after takeoff and causing minor damage to the \"Flyer\". Because December 13, 1903, was a Sunday, the brothers did not make any attempts that day, even though the weather was good, so their first powered test flight happened on the 121st\u00a0anniversary of the first hot air balloon test flight that the Montgolfier brothers had made on December 14, 1782. In a message to their family, Wilbur referred to the trial as having \"only partial success\", stating \"the power is ample, and but for a trifling error due to lack of experience with this machine and this method of starting, the machine would undoubtedly have flown beautifully.\"\nFollowing repairs, the Wrights finally took to the air on December 17, 1903, making two flights each from level ground into a freezing headwind gusting to . The first flight, by Orville at 10:35\u00a0am, of in 12\u00a0seconds, at a speed of only over the ground, was recorded in a . The next two flights covered approximately , by Wilbur and Orville respectively. Their altitude was about above the ground. The following is Orville Wright's account of the final flight of the day:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wilbur started the fourth and last flight at just about 12\u00a0o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, but by the time three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began pitching again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852\u00a0feet; the time of the flight was 59\u00a0seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.\nFive people witnessed the flights: Adam Etheridge, John T. Daniels (who snapped the famous \"first flight\" photo using Orville's pre-positioned camera), and Will Dough, all of the U.S. government coastal lifesaving crew; area businessman W.C. Brinkley; and Johnny Moore, a teenaged boy who lived in the area.\nAfter the men hauled the \"Flyer\" back from its fourth flight, a powerful gust of wind flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the \"Wright Flyer\" never flew again. The brothers shipped the airplane home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to the Science Museum in London (see Smithsonian dispute below), before it was finally installed in 1948 in the Smithsonian Institution, its current residence.\nThe Wrights sent a telegram about the flights to their father, requesting that he \"inform press\". However, the \"Dayton Journal\" refused to publish the story, saying the flights were too short to be important. Meanwhile, against the brothers' wishes, a telegraph operator leaked their message to a Virginia newspaper, which concocted a highly inaccurate news article that was reprinted the next day in several newspapers elsewhere, including Dayton.\nThe Wrights issued their own factual statement to the press in January.274 Nevertheless, the flights did not create public excitement \u2013 if people even knew about them \u2013 and the news soon faded. In Paris, however, Aero Club of France members, already stimulated by Chanute's reports of Wright gliding successes, took the news more seriously and increased their efforts to catch up to the brothers.\nAn analysis in 1985 by Professor Fred E.C. Culick and Henry R. Jex demonstrated that the 1903 \"Wright Flyer\" was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider. In a recreation attempt on the event's 100th\u00a0anniversary on December 17, 2003, Kevin Kochersberger, piloting an exact replica, failed in his effort to match the success that the Wright brothers had achieved with their piloting skill.\nEstablishing legitimacy.\nIn 1904 the Wrights built the Wright Flyer II. They decided to avoid the expense of travel and bringing supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles northeast of Dayton. The Wrights referred to the airfield as Simms Station in their flying school brochure. They received permission to use the field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman.\nThey invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May\u00a023, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers had intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.\nThe Wrights were glad to be free from the distraction of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley, and Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention: It had to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.\nAt Huffman Prairie, lighter winds made takeoffs harder, and they had to use a longer starting rail than the rail used at Kitty Hawk. The first flights in 1904 revealed problems with longitudinal stability, solved by adding ballast and lengthening the supports for the elevator.286 During the spring and summer they suffered many hard landings, often damaging the aircraft and causing minor injuries. On August\u00a013, making an unassisted takeoff, Wilbur finally exceeded their best Kitty Hawk effort with a flight of .\nThey then decided to use a weight-powered catapult to make takeoffs easier and tried it for the first time on September\u00a07.\nOn September 20, 1904, Wilbur flew the first complete circle in history by a manned heavier-than-air powered machine, covering in about a minute and a half. Their two best flights were November\u00a09 by Wilbur and December\u00a01 by Orville, each exceeding five minutes and covering nearly three miles in almost four circles.\nBy the end of the year the brothers had accumulated about 50 minutes in the air in 105\u00a0flights over the rather soggy pasture, which, remarkably, is virtually unchanged today from its original condition and is now part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, adjacent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\nThe Wrights scrapped the battered and much-repaired aircraft, but saved the engine, and in 1905 built a new airplane, the \"Flyer\u00a0III\". However, at first this had the same marginal performance as the first two. Its maiden flight was on June\u00a023 and the first few flights were no longer than 10\u00a0seconds. After Orville suffered a bone-jarring and potentially fatal crash on July\u00a014, they rebuilt the \"Flyer\" with the forward elevator and rear rudder both enlarged and placed several feet farther away from the wings. They also installed a separate control for the rear rudder instead of linking it to the wing-warping \"cradle\" as before.\nEach of the three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw) now had its own independent control. These modifications greatly improved stability and control, enabling a series of six long flights ranging from 17 to 38\u00a0minutes and around the course over Huffman Prairie between September\u00a026 and October\u00a05. Wilbur made the last and longest flight, in 38\u00a0minutes and 3\u00a0seconds, ending with a safe landing when the fuel ran out. The flight was seen by several invited friends, their father Milton, and neighboring farmers.\nReporters showed up the next day (only their second appearance at the field since May the previous year), but the brothers declined to fly. The long flights convinced the Wrights they had achieved their goal of creating a flying machine of \"practical utility\" which they could offer to sell.\nThe only photos of the flights of 1904\u20131905 were taken by the brothers. (A few photos were damaged in the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, but most survived intact.) In 1904 Ohio beekeeping businessman Amos Root, a technology enthusiast, saw a few flights including the first circle. Articles he wrote for his beekeeping magazine were the only published eyewitness reports of the Huffman Prairie flights, except for the unimpressive early hop local newsmen saw. Root offered a report to \"Scientific American\" magazine, but the editor turned it down. As a result, the news was not widely known outside Ohio, and was often met with skepticism. The Paris edition of the \"Herald Tribune\" headlined a 1906 article on the Wrights \"Flyers or liars?\".\nIn years to come, Dayton newspapers would proudly celebrate the hometown Wright brothers as national heroes, but the local reporters somehow missed one of the most important stories in history as it was happening a few miles from their doorstep. J.M. Cox, who published the \"Dayton Daily News\" at that time, expressed the attitude of newspapermen \u2013 and the public \u2013 in those days when he admitted years later: \"Frankly, none of us believed it.\"\nA few newspapers published articles about the long flights, but no reporters or photographers had been there. The lack of splashy eyewitness press coverage was a major reason for disbelief in Washington, DC, and Europe, and in journals like \"Scientific American\", whose editors doubted the \"alleged experiments\" and asked how U.S. newspapers, \"alert as they are, allowed these sensational performances to escape their notice.\"\nIn October\u00a01904, the brothers were visited by the first of many important Europeans they would befriend in coming years, Colonel J.E. Capper, later superintendent of the Royal Balloon Factory. Capper and his wife were visiting the United States to investigate the aeronautical exhibits at the St.\u00a0Louis World Fair, but had been given a letter of introduction to both Chanute and the Wrights by Patrick Alexander. Capper was very favorably impressed by the Wrights, who showed him photographs of their aircraft in flight.\nThe Wright brothers were certainly complicit in the lack of attention they received. Fearful of competitors stealing their ideas, and still without a patent, they flew on only one more day after October 5. From then on, they refused to fly anywhere unless they had a firm contract to sell their aircraft. They wrote to the U.S. government, then to Britain, France and Germany with an offer to sell a flying machine, but were rebuffed because they insisted on a signed contract before giving a demonstration. They were unwilling even to show their photographs of the airborne Flyer.\nThe American military, having recently spent $50,000 on the Langley Aerodrome \u2013 a product of the nation's foremost scientist \u2013 only to see it plunge twice into the Potomac River \"like a handful of mortar\", was particularly unreceptive to the claims of two unknown bicycle makers from Ohio. Thus, doubted or scorned, the Wright brothers continued their work in semi-obscurity, while other aviation pioneers like Santos-Dumont, Henri Farman, L\u00e9on Delagrange, and American Glenn Curtiss entered the limelight.\nEuropean skepticism.\nIn 1906, skeptics in the European aviation community had converted the press to an anti-Wright brothers stance. European newspapers, especially those in France, were openly derisive, calling them \"bluffeurs\" (bluffers). Ernest Archdeacon, founder of the A\u00e9ro-Club de France, was publicly scornful of the brothers' claims despite published reports; specifically, he wrote several articles and, in 1906, stated that \"the French would make the first public demonstration of powered flight.\"\nThe Paris edition of the \"New York Herald\" summed up Europe's opinion of the Wright brothers in an editorial on February 10, 1906: \"The Wrights have flown or they have not flown. They possess a machine or they do not possess one. They are in fact either fliers or liars. It is difficult to fly. It's easy to say, 'We have flown'.\"\nIn 1908, after the Wrights' first flights in France, Archdeacon publicly admitted he had done them an injustice.\nContracts and return to Kitty Hawk.\nThe brothers contacted the United States Department of War, the British War Office and a French syndicate on October\u00a019, 1905. The U.S. Board of Ordnance and Fortification replied on October\u00a024, 1905, specifying they would take no further action \"until a machine is produced which by actual operation is shown to be able to produce horizontal flight and to carry an operator.\" In May\u00a01908, Orville wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A practical flyer having been finally realized, we spent the years 1906 and 1907 in constructing new machines and in business negotiations. It was not till May of this year that experiments were resumed at Kill Devil Hill, North Carolina\u00a0...\"\nThe brothers turned their attention to Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there for the first time in 1907 for face-to-face talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model\u00a0A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights. In France, Wilbur met Frank P. Lahm, a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Aeronautical Division. Writing to his superiors, Lahm smoothed the way for Wilbur to give an in-person presentation to the U.S. Board of Ordnance and Fortification in Washington, D.C., when he returned to the U.S. This time, the Board was favorably impressed, in contrast to its previous indifference.\nWith further input from the Wrights, the U.S. Army Signal Corps issued \"Specification 486\" in December 1907, inviting bids for construction of a flying machine under military contract. The Wrights submitted their bid in January, and were awarded a contract on February 8, 1908. Then on March 23, 1908, the brothers had a contract to form the French company La Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Navigation A\u00e9rienne. This French syndicate included Lazare Weiller, Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe, Hart O. Berg, and Charles Ranlett Flint.\nIn May they went back to Kitty Hawk with their 1905 Flyer to practice for their contracted demonstration flights. Their privacy was lost when several correspondents arrived on the scene. Among them was John C. Burkhart, an aeronautical engineering student at Cornell University and a budding photographer. The brothers' contracts required them to fly with a passenger, so they modified the 1905 Flyer by installing two upright seats with dual control levers. Charlie Furnas, a mechanic from Dayton, became the first fixed-wing aircraft passenger on separate flights with both brothers on May 14, 1908. Later, Wilbur over-controlled the front elevator and crashed into the sand at about . He emerged with bruises and hurt ribs, but the accident ended the practice flights.\nReturn to glider flights.\nIn October 1911, Orville Wright returned to the Outer Banks again, to conduct safety and stabilization tests with a new glider. On October 24, he soared for 9 minutes and 45 seconds, a record that held for almost 10 years, when gliding as a sport began in the 1920s.\nPublic showing.\nThe brothers' contracts with the U.S. Army and a French syndicate depended on successful public flight demonstrations that met certain conditions. The brothers had to divide their efforts. Wilbur sailed for Europe; Orville would fly near Washington, D.C.\nFacing much skepticism in the French aeronautical community and outright scorn by some newspapers that called him a \"bluffeur\", Wilbur began official public demonstrations on August 8, 1908, at the Hunaudi\u00e8res horse racing track near the town of Le Mans, France. His first flight lasted only 1\u00a0minute 45\u00a0seconds, but his effortless banking turns amazed and stunned onlookers, including Louis Bl\u00e9riot and several other pioneering French aviators. In the following days, Wilbur made a series of technically challenging flights, including figure-eights, demonstrating his skills as a pilot and the capability of his flying machine, which far surpassed those of contemporary aircraft and pilots.\nThe French public was thrilled by Wilbur's feats and flocked to the field by the thousands, and the Wright brothers became world famous. Former doubters issued apologies and effusive praise. \"L'A\u00e9rophile\" editor Georges Besan\u00e7on wrote that the flights \"have completely dissipated all doubts. Not one of the former detractors of the Wrights dare question, today, the previous experiments of the men who were truly the first to fly\u00a0...\" Leading French aviation promoter Ernest Archdeacon wrote, \"For a long time, the Wright brothers have been accused in Europe of bluff ... They are today hallowed in France, and I feel an intense pleasure ... to make amends.\"\nOn October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, the wife of the brothers' European business agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur \u2013 one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn, including Griffith Brewer and Charles Rolls. Wilbur also became acquainted with L\u00e9on Boll\u00e9e and his family. Boll\u00e9e was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Boll\u00e9e and his wife would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Carlotta Boll\u00e9e had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in Le Mans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. She was fluent in Greek, French and English and translated the technical discussions between Wright and her husband. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908. He became Elizabeth Boll\u00e9e's godfather.\nOrville followed his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, he made the first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On the same day he took up Frank P. Lahm as a passenger, and then Major George Squier three days later.\nOn September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight at an altitude of about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the \"Flyer\" out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip.\nThe brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, \"Has it got your nerve?\" \"Nerve?\" repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. \"Oh, do you mean will I be \"afraid\" to fly again? The only thing I'm afraid of is that I can't get well soon enough to finish those tests next year.\"\nDeeply shocked and upset by the accident, Wilbur determined to make even more impressive flight demonstrations; in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. On September 28, Wilbur won the Commission of Aviation prize, and then on December 31, the Coupe Michelin. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, and for a time they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters, and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain, and Italy came to see Wilbur fly.\nAll three Wrights relocated to Pau, where Wilbur made many more public flights in nearby Pont Long. Wilbur gave rides to a procession of officers, journalists, and statesmen, including his sister Katharine on March\u00a017, 1909. The brothers established the world's first flying school to meet the French syndicate requirements to train three French pilots (Charles de Lambert, Paul Tissandier, and Paul-Nicolas Lucas-Girardville). In April the Wrights went to Rome where Wilbur assembled another \"Flyer\". At Centocelle, Wilbur made demonstration flights, and trained three Italian military pilots (Mario Calderara, Umbert Savoia, and Guido Castagneris). A Universal cameraman flew as a passenger, and filmed the first motion pictures from an airplane.\nAfter their return to the U.S. on May 13, 1909, the brothers and Katharine were invited to the White House where on June 10, President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration on June 17 and 18. On July\u00a027, 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting on the ground, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army. The flights met the requirements that the aircraft carry two persons while remaining aloft for an hour and achieve an average speed of at least .\nPresident Taft, his cabinet, and members of Congress were part of the viewing crowd of 10,000. Following the successful flights, the Army awarded the Wrights $25,000, plus $2500 for each mile per hour they exceeded 40 miles per hour. Orville and Katharine then traveled to Germany, where Orville made demonstration flights at Tempelhof in September 1909, including a flight with the Crown Prince of Germany as a passenger.\nOn October 4, 1909, Wilbur made a flight seen by about a million people in Manhattan during the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York City. He took off from Governors Island, flew north over the Hudson River to Grant's Tomb and returned to Governors Island. The aircraft was equipped with an unusual accessory for the flight: a canoe attached to the underside framework as a flotation device in case of a ditching. On October 8 in College Park, Maryland, Wilbur began pilot training for Army officers Frank P. Lahm and Frederick E. Humphreys, joined later that month by Benjamin Foulois.\nFamily flights.\nOn May 25, 1910, back at Huffman Prairie, Orville piloted two unique flights. First, he took off on a six-minute flight with Wilbur as his passenger, the only time the Wright brothers ever flew together. They received permission from their father to make the flight. They had always promised Milton they would never fly together to avoid the chance of a double tragedy and to ensure one brother would remain to continue their experiments. Next, Orville took his 82-year-old father on a nearly 7-minute flight, the only powered aerial excursion of Milton Wright's life. The aircraft rose to about while the elderly Wright called to his son, \"Higher, Orville, higher!\".12\nPatent war.\nThe Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves, but it was rejected. In January 1904, they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin, and on May 22, 1906, they were granted U.S. Patent 821393 for \"new and useful Improvements in Flying Machines\".\nThe patent illustrates a non-powered flying machine \u2013 namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of \"controlling\" a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control.\nThe concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a \"coordinated turn\", a technique that prevents hazardous \"adverse yaw\", the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.\nIn March 1904, the Wright Brothers applied for French and German patents. The French patent was granted on July 1, 1904. According to Combs, regarding the U.S. patent, \"... by 1906 the drawings in the Wright patents were available to anyone who wanted badly enough to get them. And they gave proof \u2013 in vivid, technical detail \u2013 of how to get into the air.\"\nLawsuits begin.\nGlenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights.\nSoon after the historic July 4, 1908, one-kilometer flight by Curtiss in the AEA June Bug, the Wrights warned him not to infringe their patent by profiting from flying or selling aircraft that used ailerons.\nOrville wrote Curtiss, \"Claim 14 of our patent no. 821,393, specifically covers the combination which we are informed you are using. If it is your desire to enter the exhibition business, we would be glad to take up the matter of a license to operate under our patent for that purpose.\"\nCurtiss was at the time a member of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), headed by Alexander Graham Bell, where in 1908 he had helped reinvent wingtip ailerons for their Aerodrome No. 2, known as the AEA White Wing\nCurtiss refused to pay license fees to the Wrights and sold an airplane equipped with ailerons to the Aeronautic Society of New York in 1909. The Wrights filed a lawsuit, beginning a years-long legal conflict. They also sued foreign aviators who flew at U.S. exhibitions, including the leading French aviator Louis Paulhan. The Curtiss people derisively suggested that if someone jumped in the air and waved his arms, the Wrights would sue.\nEuropean companies which bought foreign patents the Wrights had received sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged on until the patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent invalid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901, and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made an agreement with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights. The Wright brothers won their initial case against Curtiss in February 1913 when a judge ruled that ailerons were covered under the patent. The Curtiss company appealed the decision.\nFrom 1910 until his death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the leading role in the patent struggle, travelling incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed to such an extent that, when the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and American forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.\nVictory and cooperation.\nIn January 1914, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against the Curtiss company, which continued to avoid penalties through legal tactics. Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision, and much to the frustration of company executives, he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly. In fact, he was planning to sell the company and departed in 1915. In 1917, with World War I underway, the U.S. government pressured the industry to form a cross-licensing organization, the Manufacturers Aircraft Association, to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents, including the original and subsequent Wright patents. The \"patent war\" ended, although side issues lingered in the courts until the 1920s. The Wright Aeronautical Corporation (successor to the Wright-Martin Company), and the Curtiss Aeroplane company, merged in 1929 to form the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, which remains in business today producing high-tech components for the aerospace industry.\nAviation historian C.H. Gibbs-Smith stated a number of times that the Wrights' legal victory would have been \"doubtful\" if an 1868 patent of \"a prior but lost invention\" by M.P.W. Boulton of the U.K. had been known in the period 1903\u20131906. The patent, titled \"A\u00ebrial Locomotion &amp;c,\" described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an aileron control system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot. In fact, this patent was well known to participants in the Wright-Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs-Smith, saying the Boulton patent \"is not anticipatory\".\nPublic reactions.\nThe lawsuits damaged the public image of the Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair, and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.\nIn business.\nThe Wright Company was incorporated on November 22, 1909. The brothers sold their patents to the company for $100,000 and also received one-third of the shares in a million dollar stock issue and a 10 percent royalty on every airplane sold.410 With Wilbur as president and Orville as vice president, the company set up a factory in Dayton and a flying school / test flight field at Huffman Prairie; the headquarters office was in New York City.\nIn mid-1910, the Wrights changed the design of the \"Wright Flyer\", moving the horizontal elevator from the front to the back and adding wheels although keeping the skids as part of the undercarriage unit. It had become apparent by then that a rear elevator would make an airplane easier to control, especially as higher speeds grew more common. The new version was designated the \"Model B\", although the original canard design was never referred to as the \"Model A\" by the Wrights. However, the U.S. Army Signal Corps which bought the airplane did call it \"Wright type A\".\nThere were not many customers for airplanes, so in the spring of 1910 the Wrights hired and trained a team of salaried exhibition pilots to show off their machines and win prize money for the company \u2013 despite Wilbur's disdain for what he called \"the mountebank business\". The team debuted at the Indianapolis Speedway on June 13. Before the year was over, pilots Ralph Johnstone and Arch Hoxsey died in air show crashes, and in November 1911 the brothers disbanded the team on which nine men had served (four other former team members died in crashes afterward).Chapter 31, \"The Mountebank Game\"\nThe Wright Company transported the first known commercial air cargo on November 7, 1910, by flying two bolts of dress silk from Dayton to Columbus, Ohio, for the Morehouse-Martens Department Store, which paid a $5,000 fee. Company pilot Phil Parmelee made the flight \u2013 which was more an exercise in advertising than a simple delivery \u2013 in an hour and six minutes with the cargo strapped in the passenger's seat. The silk was cut into small pieces and sold as souvenirs.\nIn 1910 the Wrights advertised for a person to undertake \"plane sewing\", which was corrected by the Dayton newspaper that published it to \"plain sewing\". Ida Holdgreve, a dress maker, applied for the role and became head seamstress at the Wright Company Factory, sewing the fabric \"for the wings, stabilizers, rudders, fins and I don't know what all\" of the planes produced there. She was trained in how to cut and sew the fabric to stretch it tight over the frame so it wouldn't rip by Duval La Chapelle, who was Wilbur's mechanic in France.\nBetween 1910 and 1916 the Wright Brothers Flying School at Huffman Prairie trained 115 pilots who were instructed by Orville and his assistants. Several trainees became famous, including Henry \"Hap\" Arnold, who rose to Five-Star General, commanded U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II, and became the first head of the U.S. Air Force; Calbraith Perry Rodgers, who made the first coast-to-coast flight in 1911 (with many stops and crashes) in a Wright Model EX named the \"Vin Fiz\" (after the sponsor's grape soft drink); and Eddie Stinson, founder of the Stinson Aircraft Company.\nArmy accidents.\nIn 1912\u20131913 a series of fatal crashes of Wright airplanes bought by the U.S. Army called into question their safety and design. The death toll reached 11 by 1913, half of them in the Wright model\u00a0C. All six model\u00a0C Army airplanes crashed. They had a tendency to nose dive, but Orville insisted that stalls were caused by pilot error.459 He cooperated with the Army to equip the airplanes with a rudimentary flight indicator to help the pilot avoid climbing too steeply. A government investigation said the Wright model\u00a0C was \"dynamically unsuited for flying\", and the American military ended its use of airplanes with \"pusher\" type propellers, including models made by both the Wright and Curtiss companies, in which the engine was located behind the pilot and likely to crush him in a crash. Orville resisted the switch to manufacturing \"tractor-type\" propeller aircraft, worried that a design change could threaten the Wright patent infringement case against Curtiss.457\nSmithsonian feud.\nS.P. Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until his death in 1906, experimented for years with model flying machines and successfully flew unmanned powered fixed-wing model aircraft in 1896 and 1903. Two tests of his manned full-size motor-driven Aerodrome in October and December\u00a01903, however, were complete failures. Nevertheless, the Smithsonian later proudly displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier-than-air craft \"capable\" of manned powered flight, relegating the Wright brothers' invention to secondary status and triggering a decades-long feud with Orville Wright, whose brother had received help from the Smithsonian when beginning his own quest for flight.\nThe Smithsonian based its claim for the Aerodrome on short test flights Glenn Curtiss and his team made with it in 1914. The Smithsonian had allowed Curtiss to make major modifications to the craft before attempting to fly it.\nThe Smithsonian hoped to salvage Langley's aeronautical reputation by proving the Aerodrome could fly; Curtiss wanted to prove the same thing to defeat the Wrights' patent lawsuits against him. The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests.\nOrville repeatedly objected to misrepresentation of the Aerodrome, but the Smithsonian was unyielding. Orville responded by lending the restored 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the London Science Museum in 1928, refusing to donate it to the Smithsonian while the Institution \"perverted\" the history of the flying machine.491 Orville would never see his invention again, as he died before its return to the United States.\nCharles Lindbergh attempted to mediate the dispute, to no avail. In 1942, after years of bad publicity, and encouraged by Wright biographer F.C. Kelly, the Smithsonian finally relented by publishing, for the first time, a list of the Aerodrome modifications and recanting the misleading statements it had published about the 1914 tests. Orville then privately requested the British museum to return the \"Flyer\", but the airplane remained in protective storage for the duration of World War\u00a0II; it finally came home after Orville's death.\nOn November 23, 1948, the executors of Orville's estate signed an agreement for the Smithsonian to purchase the Flyer for one dollar. At the insistence of the executors, the agreement also included strict conditions for display of the airplane.\nThe agreement reads, in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the 1903 Wright Aeroplane, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.\nIf this agreement is not fulfilled, the \"Flyer\" can be reclaimed by the heir of the Wright brothers. Some aviation enthusiasts, particularly those who promote the legacy of Gustave Whitehead, have accused the Smithsonian of refusing to investigate claims of earlier flights. After a ceremony in the Smithsonian museum, the \"Flyer\" went on public display on December 17, 1948, the 45th anniversary of the only day it was flown successfully. The Wright brothers' nephew Milton (Lorin's son), who had seen gliders and the Flyer under construction in the bicycle shop when he was a boy, gave a brief speech and formally transferred the airplane to the Smithsonian, which displayed it with the accompanying label:\nLater years.\nWilbur.\nBoth Wilbur and Orville were lifelong bachelors. Wilbur once quipped that he \"did not have time for both a wife and an airplane\".118 The 1909 short silent film \"Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine\" (which translates to \"Wilbur Wright and his Flying Machine\") is considered to be the first use of motion picture aerial photography as filmed from a heavier-than-air aircraft. Following a brief training flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June\u00a01911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.\nWilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European \u2013 particularly Parisian \u2013 philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington, and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would \"come home white\".\nIt was decided by the family that a new and far grander house would be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, building had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon the design of the house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.\nHe became ill on a business trip to Boston in April 1912. The illness is sometimes attributed to eating bad shellfish at a banquet. After returning to Dayton in early May\u00a01912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age\u00a045, at the Wright family home on May\u00a030. His father wrote about Wilbur in his diary: \"A short life, full of consequences. An unfailing intellect, imperturbable temper, great self-reliance and as great modesty, seeing the right clearly, pursuing it steadfastly, he lived and died.\"449\nOrville.\nOrville succeeded to the presidency of the Wright Company upon Wilbur's death. He won the prestigious Collier Trophy in 1914 for development of his automatic stabilizer on the brothers' Wright Model E. Sharing Wilbur's distaste for business but not his brother's executive skills, Orville sold the company in 1915. The Wright Company then became part of Wright-Martin in 1916.\nAfter 42\u00a0years living at their residence on 7\u00a0Hawthorn Street, Orville, Katharine, and their father, Milton, moved to Hawthorn Hill in spring\u00a01914. Milton died in his sleep on April 3, 1917, at age\u00a088. Up until his death, Milton had been very active, preoccupied with reading, writing articles for religious publications and enjoying his morning walks. He had also marched in a Dayton Woman's Suffrage Parade, along with Orville and Katharine.\nOrville made his last flight as a pilot on May 13, 1918, in a 1911 Model\u00a0B. This event was filmed with the motion picture camera and Orville was accompanied in the air by Wright Company instructor Howard Rinehart flying the first US built DH-4. He retired from business and became an elder statesman of aviation, serving on various official boards and committees, including the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce (ACCA).\nKatharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City, a former Oberlin classmate, in 1926. Orville was furious and inconsolable, feeling he had been betrayed by his sister Katharine. He refused to attend the wedding or even communicate with her. He finally agreed to see her, apparently at Lorin's insistence, just before she died of pneumonia on March 3, 1929.\nOrville Wright served in the NACA for 28\u00a0years. In 1930, he received the first Daniel Guggenheim Medal established in 1928 by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. In 1936, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation which designated the anniversary of Orville's birthday as National Aviation Day, a national observation that celebrates the development of aviation.\nOn April 19, 1944, the second production Lockheed Constellation, piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye, flew from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C., in 6\u00a0hours and 57\u00a0minutes (2,300\u00a0mi, 330.9\u00a0mph). On the return trip, the airliner stopped at Wright Field to give Orville Wright his last airplane flight, more than 40\u00a0years after his historic first flight. He even briefly handled the controls. Wright commented that the wingspan of the Constellation was longer than the distance of his first flight.\nOrville's last major project was supervising the reclamation and preservation of the 1905 \"Wright Flyer III\", which historians describe as the first practical airplane.\nOrville expressed sadness in an interview years later about the death and destruction brought about by the bombers of World War\u00a0II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We dared to hope we had invented something that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong ... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in the invention of the airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses.\nOrville died at age\u00a076 on January 30, 1948, over 35\u00a0years after his brother, following his second heart attack, having lived from the horse-and-buggy age to the dawn of supersonic flight. Both brothers are buried in the family plot at Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio. John T. Daniels, the Coast Guardsman who took their famous first flight photo, died the day after Orville.\nCompeting claims.\nFirst powered flight claims are made for Cl\u00e9ment Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for their variously documented tests in years prior to and including 1903. Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights. Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.\nThe aviation historian C.H. Gibbs-Smith was a supporter of the Wrights' claim to primacy in flight. He wrote that a barn door can be made to \"fly\" for a short distance if enough energy is applied to it; he determined that the very limited flight experiments of Ader, Vuia, and others were \"powered hops\" instead of fully controlled flights.\nState rivalry.\nThe U.S. states of Ohio and North Carolina both take credit for the Wright brothers and their world-changing inventions\u2014Ohio because the brothers developed and designed their plane in Dayton, and North Carolina because Kitty Hawk was the site of the Wrights' first powered flight. With a spirit of friendly rivalry, Ohio adopted the slogan \"Birthplace of Aviation\" (later \"Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers\", honoring not only the Wrights, but also astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, both Ohio natives). The slogan appears on Ohio license plates. North Carolina uses the slogan \"First in Flight\" on its license plates, with a depiction of the Wrights' plane.\nThe site of the first flights in North Carolina is preserved as Wright Brothers National Memorial, while their Ohio facilities are part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. As the positions of both states can be factually defended, and each played a significant role in the history of flight, neither state has an exclusive claim to the Wrights' accomplishment.\nNotwithstanding the competition between those two states, in 1937, the Wrights' last bicycle shop and home were moved from Dayton, Ohio to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan, where they remain.\nCommemorations.\nIn addition to appearing on both the front and back of the official United States pilot certification, the Wright brothers and their airplane have been commemorated on several U. S. postage stamps, including:\nWright Brothers Field.\nNASA named the first Martian airfield for the \"Ingenuity\" helicopter \"Wright Brothers Field\". The miniature helicopter arrived on Mars on February 18, 2021, attached to the \"Perseverance\" rover. A small piece of wing fabric from the 1903 \"Wright Flyer\" was attached to a cable underneath \"Ingenuity's\" solar panel. In 1969, Neil Armstrong carried a similar \"Wright Flyer\" artifact to the Moon in the Lunar Module \"Eagle\" during Apollo 11. \"Ingenuity\" flew five times from Wright Brothers Field between April 19 and May 7, 2021, then departed for other areas, making a total of 72 flights.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was produced in the U.S. by the Uniroyal Chemical Company, Inc., (now integrated into the Chemtura Corporation), which registered daminozide for use on fruits intended for human consumption in 1963. It was primarily used on apples until 1989, when the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed banning it based on concerns about cancer risks to consumers. In addition to apples and ornamental plants, Uniroyal also registered daminozide for use on cherries, peaches, pears, Concord grapes, tomato transplants, and peanut vines. \nWhen used on fruit trees, daminozide affects flower bud initiation, fruit maturity, fruit firmness and coloring, preharvest drop and market quality of fruit at time of harvest and during storage. When consumed by mammals, daminozide is catabolised into succinic acid (a non-toxic general intermediate in primary metabolism) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH, a compound with a history of studies associating it with carcinogenic activity in animal models relevant to humans). Breakdown into these two compounds also occurs when the sprayed chemical residue remains on stored fruit, especially with higher temperatures and over longer time periods. \nIn 1989, the EPA outlawed daminozide on U.S. food crops, but still allowed it for non-food crops like ornamental plants. As of August 2022, daminozide appeared as severely restricted in its exports on the list of pesticides whose shipments were ineligible for export credit insurance under the Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States.\nChemistry.\nWhile described by the FDA as an amino acid derivative, daminozide is more formally and correctly described as a dicarboxylic acid monohydrazide. It is the product of the condensation of succinic acid with 2,2-dimethylhydrazine, and in its pure form is a high-melting temperature water-soluble white crystalline solid.\nModes of action.\nDaminozide is classified as a plant growth regulator, a chemical sprayed on fruit to regulate their growth. When used on fruit trees, it affects flower bud initiation, fruit maturity, fruit firmness and coloring, and preharvest drop, which together make harvest easier and keep fruit from falling off the trees before they ripen; it also improves quality of fruit at time of harvest and during storage.\nCarcinogenicity of daminozide degradation products.\nWhen daminozide residue on fruit is consumed by mammalian species, it is catabolised into two chemical components, succinic acid (a non-toxic general intermediate in primary metabolism), and 1, 1-dimethylhydrazine (\"unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine\", UDMH). Degradation into these products also occurs when the sprayed chemical residue remains on stored fruit, increasing with time and elevated temperature. UDMH has had a history of studies associating it with carcinogenic activity in animal models relevant to humans, beginning in the 1960s.\nU.S. campaign to ban Alar.\nIn 1985, the EPA studied daminozide's effects on mice and hamsters, concluding that it was a \"probable human carcinogen\" with a dietary risk possibly as high as one cancer for every thousand people exposed, and proposed banning its use on food crops. They submitted the proposal to the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), which concluded that the tests were inadequate to determine the carcinogenicity of the tested substances.\nLater, in May 1989, Democrats Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Harry Reid (D-NV) held a press conference in which the pesticide program at the FDA was accused of being \"riddled with pro-industry bias\", charging that 7 of 8 SAP members had worked as \"consultants for the 'chemical industry'\" \u2014 that the worst of them, after serving on the SAP (see below), had \"later broke[n] conflict-of-interest laws\", with career university academic toxicologists Wendell Kilgore and Christopher Wilkinson (29 years, UCal-Davis and 22 years, Cornell) being singled out as \"possible violators of the [FDA] ethics code\", with invitation to the \"EP[A] inspector general [IG] to investigate\". Marshall Elliot, writing for the \"News &amp; Views\" section of the AAAS publication, \"Science\", noted that these Senators' public scolding of SAP members\u2014which was prompted by the FDA's \"waffling on Alar\"\u2014led to the investigation of just these two academics by that agency's IG, and of forwarding of Kilgore's file to the U.S. Justice Department for review. Marshall further noted that the event was being seen, in the months following, more for its forcing clarification of rules regardinghow much the government [can limit its]... more than 100,000 advisors, including scientists... who deal with issues ranging from biomedicine to arms control... [quotes spliced to clarify advisor roles] involvement with industry without isolating itself from the expertise it seeks, than for unearthing formal wrongdoing in the Alar case (wherein, after reversal of an earlier, similar conviction on appeal, no charges were ultimately brought). In particular, the Senators alleged that Kilgore had a financial connection to Uniroyal, with Wilkinson and the other five being accused of having more general financial ties to the chemical industry; notably, the key formal contention was of possible violation of FDA ethics rules regarding limits to the \"kind of consulting jobs that can be accepted \"after\" leaving an advisory panel\" [emphasis in original source].\nThe next year, the EPA retracted its proposed ban on Alar and required farmers to reduce its use by 50%. The American Academy of Pediatrics urged EPA to ban daminozide, and some manufacturers and supermarket chains announced they would not accept Alar-treated apples.\nIn a 1989 NYT opinion by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) trustee John B. Oakes, regarding a two-year NRDC study peer-reviewed by an independent panel, Oakes presented the report's argument that children ingesting daminozide in legally permissible quantities were at \"intolerable risk\" (from it and a wide variety of other potentially harmful chemicals); by their estimate, Oakes said, the \"average pre-schooler's exposure to this carcinogen... result[s] in a cancer risk '240 times greater than the cancer risk considered acceptable by E.P.A. following a full lifetime of exposure.'\" In February, 1989, the CBS television program \"60 Minutes\" broadcast a story about Alar that featured the NRDC report highlighting problems with the chemical.\nLater in 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to ban Alar on the grounds that \"long-term exposure\" posed \"unacceptable risks to public health.\" However, in June 1989\u2014before the EPA's preliminary decision to ban all food uses of Alar went into effect\u2014Uniroyal, Alar's sole manufacturer, agreed to halt voluntarily all domestic sales of Alar for food uses. Hence, the consequences of CBS broadcast were swift and severe; as Percival, Schroeder, Miller, and Leape note in review of legal aspects in their \"Environmental Regulation\" text,\"[t]he denouement... came quickly. Alar was removed from the apple market by its manufacturer, not because of regulatory requirements imposed by the EPA, but because of consumer pressure\"in particular, the \"rapid decline in apple consumption that followed the \"60 Minutes\" report\" As the \"Chicago Tribune\" noted at that time, Alar's export was not prohibited, such that Uniroyal could continue its sales in about 70 countries, which led critics to note that Americans still faced exposure (via imported fruit and juice). However, as of August 2022, daminozide/alar was appearing as a \"severely restricted\" entry on the \"List of Banned and Severely Restricted Pesticides Under the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Program\" of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, making its shipments ineligible for export credit insurance.\nBacklash.\nIn November 1990, Washington apple growers filed a lawsuit in Yakima County Superior Court against CBS, NRDC and Fenton Communications (hired by NRDC to publicize their report on Alar) claiming that unfair business practices (product disparagement in particular) cost them $100 million. The suit was moved from state to federal court at the request of CBS. U.S. District Judge William Fremming Nielsen ruled in 1993 that the apple growers had not proved their case, and it was subsequently dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nElizabeth Whelan and her organization, the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), which had received $25,000 from Alar's manufacturer, stated that Alar and its breakdown product UDMH had not been shown to be carcinogenic. During a 1990 speech at Hillsdale College, Whelan said that groups like the NRDC were ignoring a basic principle of toxicology: the dose makes the poison. \"It is an egregious departure from science and logic when a substance is labeled 'cancer-causing' based on a response in a single animal study using high doses of a test material\", she said.\nCurrent views.\nTaken together, the complexity of the problem of assigning risk to this agent\u2014the debate over assumptions concerning risks from early-in-life exposure, the principal role of a decomposition product rather than the agent itself in determining its long-term toxicity, the generation of that product both abiotically and through metabolism after consumption, as well as challenges in determining appropriate \"subpopulations for study, representative parameters of the potency distribution, and corrections for bioassay length\"\u2014have had as a consequence that disagreement and controversy remain about the safety of daminozide and the appropriateness of responses to it in its history.\nConsumers Union did its own analyses and estimated that the human lifetime cancer risk was 5 cases per million, as compared to the previously reported figure of 50 per million. (The EPA had argued for a level of lifetime cancer risk of 1 per million to be the highest acceptable, in this type of case.) On the other hand, representatives of the California Department of Health Services are on record as of 1991 stating that \"the plausible estimates of risk, derived from conservative, reasonable assumptions, exceed those developed by EPA and NRDC\". As late as 1995, results continued to appear (e.g., from a medium-term carcinogenicity assay approved for use by the ICH)\u2014supporting \"in\"significant levels of \"carcinogenicity of daminozide, alone or in combination with... 1,1-dimethylhydrazine\".\nAs of 2005, daminozide remained classified as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA, and listed as a known carcinogen under California's Prop 65.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The chord length is the distance between the trailing edge and the leading edge. The point on the leading edge used to define the main chord may be the surface point of minimum radius. For a turbine aerofoil, the chord may be defined by the line between points where the front and rear of a 2-dimensional blade section would touch a flat surface when laid convex-side up.\nThe wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer and propeller/rotor blades of an aircraft are all based on aerofoil sections, and the term \"chord\" or \"chord length\" is also used to describe their width. The chord of a wing, stabilizer and propeller is determined by measuring the distance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow. (If a wing has a rectangular planform, rather than tapered or swept, then the chord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.) The term \"chord\" is also applied to the width of wing flaps, ailerons and rudder on an aircraft.\nMany wings are not rectangular, so they have different chords at different positions. Usually, the chord length is greatest where the wing joins the aircraft's fuselage (called the root chord) and decreases along the wing toward the wing's tip (the tip chord). Most jet aircraft use a tapered swept wing design. To provide a characteristic figure that can be compared among various wing shapes, the mean aerodynamic chord (abbreviated MAC) is used, although it is complex to calculate. The mean aerodynamic chord is used for calculating pitching moments.\nA chord may also be defined for compressor and turbine aerofoils in gas turbine engines such as turbojet, turboprop, or turbofan engines for aircraft propulsion.\nStandard mean chord.\nStandard mean chord (SMC) is defined as wing area divided by wing span:\nformula_1\nwhere \"S\" is the wing area and \"b\" is the span of the wing. Thus, the SMC is the chord of a rectangular wing with the same area and span as those of the given wing. This is a purely geometric figure and is rarely used in aerodynamics.\nMean aerodynamic chord.\nMean aerodynamic chord (MAC) is defined as:\nformula_2formula_3\nwhere \"y\" is the coordinate along the wing span and \"c\" is the chord at the coordinate \"y\". Other terms are as for SMC.\nThe MAC is a two-dimensional representation of the whole wing. The pressure distribution over the entire wing can be reduced to a single lift force on and a moment around the aerodynamic center of the MAC. Therefore, not only the length but also the position of MAC is often important. In particular, the position of center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft is usually measured relative to the MAC, as the percentage of the distance from the leading edge of MAC to CG with respect to MAC itself.\nThe ratio of the length (or \"span\") of a rectangular-planform wing to its chord is known as the aspect ratio, an important indicator of the lift-induced drag the wing will create. (For wings with planforms that are not rectangular, the aspect ratio is calculated as the square of the span divided by the wing planform area.) Wings with higher aspect ratios will have less induced drag than wings with lower aspect ratios. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds. This is why gliders have long slender wings.\nTapered wing.\nKnowing the area (Sw), taper ratio (formula_4) and the span (b) of the wing, the chord at any position on the span can be calculated by the formula:\nformula_5\nwhere\nformula_6\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as a counselor to Lyndon B. Johnson from 1966 to 1968 and was Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981. As a scholar, Brzezinski belonged to the realist school of international relations, standing in the geopolitical tradition of Halford Mackinder and Nicholas J. Spykman, while elements of liberal idealism have also been identified in his outlook. Brzezinski was the primary organizer of The Trilateral Commission.\nMajor foreign policy events during his time in office included the normalization of relations with the People's Republic of China (and the severing of ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan); the signing of the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II) with the Soviet Union; the brokering of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel; the overthrow of the US-friendly Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the start of the Iranian Revolution; the United States' encouragement of dissidents in Eastern Europe and championing of human rights in order to undermine the influence of the Soviet Union; supporting the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and, ultimately, Soviet troops during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War; and the signing of the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties relinquishing U.S. control of the Panama Canal after 1999.\nBrzezinski's personal views have been described as \"progressive\", \"international\", political liberal, and strongly anti-communist. He was an advocate for anti-Soviet containment, for human rights organizations, and for \"cultivating a strong West\". He has been praised for his ability to see \"the big picture\". Critics described him as hawkish or a \"foreign policy hardliner\" on some issues, such as Poland\u2013Russia relations.\nBrzezinski served as the Robert E. Osgood Professor of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and a member of various boards and councils. He frequently appeared as an expert on the PBS program \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\", ABC News' \"This Week with Christiane Amanpour\", and MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\", where his daughter, Mika Brzezinski, is co-anchor. He supported the Prague Process. His elder son, Ian, is a foreign policy expert, and his younger son, Mark, was the United States Ambassador to Poland from 2022 to 2025 and the United States Ambassador to Sweden from 2011 to 2015.\nEarly years.\nZbigniew Brzezinski was born in Warsaw, Poland, on March 28, 1928 into a Catholic family originally from Brze\u017cany, Tarnopol Voivodeship (then part of Poland, currently in Ukraine). The town of Brze\u017cany is thought to be the source of the family name. Brzezinski's parents were Leonia (\"n\u00e9e\" Roman) Brzezi\u0144ska and Tadeusz Brzezi\u0144ski, a Polish diplomat who was posted to Germany from 1931 to 1935; Zbigniew Brzezinski thus spent some of his earliest years witnessing the rise of the Nazis. From 1936 to 1938, Tadeusz Brzezi\u0144ski was posted to the Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, and was later praised by Israel for his work helping Jews escape from the Nazis.\nIn 1938, Tadeusz Brzezi\u0144ski was posted to Montreal as a consul general. The Brzezinski family lived near the Polish Consulate-General, on Stanley Street. In 1939, the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was agreed to by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union; subsequently the two powers and Slovakia invaded Poland. The 1945 Yalta Conference among the Allies allotted Poland to the Soviet sphere of influence. The Second World War had a profound effect on Brzezinski, who stated in an interview: \"The extraordinary violence that was perpetrated against Poland did affect my perception of the world, and made me much more sensitive to the fact that a great deal of world politics is a fundamental struggle.\"\nAcademia.\nAfter attending Loyola College in Montreal, Brzezinski entered McGill University in 1945 to obtain both his Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees (received in 1949 and 1950 respectively). His Master's thesis focused on the various nationalities within the Soviet Union. Brzezinski's plan for pursuing further studies in the United Kingdom in preparation for a diplomatic career in Canada fell through, principally because he was ruled ineligible for a scholarship he had won that was only open to British subjects. Brzezinski then attended Harvard University to work on a doctorate with Merle Fainsod, focusing on the Soviet Union and the relationship between the October Revolution, Vladimir Lenin's state, and the actions of Joseph Stalin. He received his Ph.D. in 1953; the same year, he traveled to Munich and met Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, head of the Polish desk of Radio Free Europe. He later collaborated with Carl J. Friedrich to develop the concept of totalitarianism as a way to characterize more accurately and powerfully, and to criticize the Soviets in 1956.\nBrzezinski was on the faculty of Harvard University from 1953 to 1960, and of Columbia University from 1960 to 1972 where he headed the Research Institute on Communist Affairs. He was Senior Research Professor of International Relations at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.\nFor historical background on major events during this period, see:\nAs a Harvard professor, he argued against Dwight Eisenhower's and John Foster Dulles's policy of rollback, saying that antagonism would push Eastern Europe further toward the Soviets. The Polish protests followed by the Polish October and the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 lent some support to Brzezinski's idea that the Eastern Europeans could gradually counter Soviet domination. In 1957, he visited Poland for the first time since he left as a child, and his visit reaffirmed his judgement that splits within the Eastern bloc were profound. He developed ideas that he called \"peaceful engagement\". Brzezinski became a naturalized American citizen in 1958.\nVery soon after Harvard awarded an associate professorship in 1959 to Henry Kissinger instead of to him, Brzezinski moved to New York City to teach at Columbia University. Here he wrote \"Soviet Bloc: Unity and Conflict\", which focused on Eastern Europe since the beginning of the Cold War. He also taught future Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who like Brzezinski's wife Emilie was of Czech descent, and whom he also mentored during her early years in Washington. He also became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and joined the Bilderberg Group.\nDuring the 1960 U.S. presidential elections, Brzezinski was an advisor to the John F. Kennedy campaign, urging a non-antagonistic policy toward Eastern European governments. Seeing the Soviet Union as having entered a period of stagnation, both economic and political, Brzezinski predicted a future breakup of the Soviet Union along lines of nationality (expanding on his master's thesis).\nAs a scholar, he developed his thoughts over the years, fashioning fundamental theories on international relations and geostrategy. During the 1950s he worked on the theory of totalitarianism. His thought in the 1960s focused on wider Western understanding of disunity in the Soviet Bloc, as well as developing the thesis of intensified degeneration of the Soviet Union. During the 1970s he proposed that the Soviet system was incapable of evolving beyond the industrial phase into the \"technetronic\" age.\nBrzezinski continued to argue for and support d\u00e9tente for the next few years, publishing \"Peaceful Engagement in Eastern Europe\" in \"Foreign Affairs\", and he continued to support non-antagonistic policies after the Cuban Missile Crisis on the grounds that such policies might disabuse Eastern European nations of their fear of an aggressive Germany, and pacify Western Europeans fearful of a superpower compromise along the lines of the Yalta Conference. In a 1962 book Brzezinski argued against the possibility of a Sino-Soviet split, saying their alignment was \"not splitting and is not likely to split.\"\nIn 1964, Brzezinski supported Lyndon Johnson's presidential campaign and the Great Society and civil rights policies, while on the other hand he saw Soviet leadership as having been purged of any creativity following the ousting of Khrushchev. Through Jan Nowak-Jezioranski, Brzezinski met with Adam Michnik, future Polish Solidarity activist.\nBrzezinski continued to support engagement with Eastern European governments, while warning against De Gaulle's vision of a \"Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.\" He also supported the Vietnam War. In 1966, Brzezinski was appointed to the Policy Planning Council of the U.S. Department of State (President Johnson's October 7, 1966, \"Bridge Building\" speech was a product of Brzezinski's influence). In 1968, Brzezinski resigned from the council in protest of President Johnson's expansion of the war. Next, he became a foreign policy advisor to Vice President Hubert Humphrey.\nFor historical background on events during this period, see:\nThe Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia further reinforced Brzezinski's criticisms of the right's aggressive stance toward Eastern European governments. His service to the Johnson administration, and his fact-finding trip to Vietnam, made him an enemy of the New Left.\nFor the 1968 U.S. presidential campaign, Brzezinski was chairman of the Humphrey's Foreign Policy Task Force.\nBrzezinski called for a pan-European conference, an idea that would eventually find fruition in 1973 as the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Meanwhile, he became a leading critic of both the Nixon-Kissinger d\u00e9tente condominium, as well as George McGovern's pacifism.\nThe Trilateral Commission.\nIn his 1970 piece \"Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era\", Brzezinski argued that a coordinated policy among developed nations was necessary in order to counter global instability erupting from increasing economic inequality. Out of this thesis, Brzezinski co-founded the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller, serving as director from 1973 to 1976. The Trilateral Commission is a group of prominent political and business leaders and academics primarily from the United States, Western Europe and Japan. Its purpose was to strengthen relations among the three most industrially advanced regions of the capitalist world. In 1974, Brzezinski selected Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter as a member.\nAdvisor to President Carter.\nCarter announced his candidacy for the 1976 presidential campaign to a skeptical media and proclaimed himself an \"eager student\" of Brzezinski. Brzezinski became Carter's principal foreign policy advisor by late 1975. He became an outspoken critic of the Nixon-Kissinger over-reliance on d\u00e9tente, a situation preferred by the Soviet Union, favoring the Helsinki process instead, which focused on human rights, international law and peaceful engagement in Eastern Europe. Brzezinski was considered to be the Democrats' response to Republican Henry Kissinger. Carter engaged his incumbent opponent for the presidency, Gerald Ford, in foreign policy debates by contrasting the Trilateral vision with Ford's d\u00e9tente.\nAfter his victory in 1976, Carter made Brzezinski National Security Advisor. Earlier that year, major labor riots broke out in Poland, laying the foundations for Solidarity. Brzezinski began by emphasizing the \"Basket III\" human rights in the Helsinki Final Act, which inspired Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia shortly thereafter.\nBrzezinski assisted with writing parts of Carter's inaugural address, and this served his purpose of sending a positive message to Soviet dissidents. The Soviet Union and Western European leaders both complained that this kind of rhetoric ran against the \"code of d\u00e9tente\" that Nixon and Kissinger had established. Brzezinski ran up against members of his own Democratic Party who disagreed with this interpretation of d\u00e9tente, including Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. Vance argued for less emphasis on human rights in order to gain Soviet agreement to Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), whereas Brzezinski favored doing both at the same time. Brzezinski then ordered Radio Free Europe transmitters to increase the power and area of their broadcasts, a provocative reversal of Nixon-Kissinger policies. West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt objected to Brzezinski's agenda, even calling for the removal of Radio Free Europe from German soil.\nThe State Department was alarmed by Brzezinski's support for dissidents in East Germany and objected to his suggestion that Carter's first overseas visit be to Poland. He visited Warsaw and met with Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski (against the objection of the U.S. Ambassador to Poland), recognizing the Catholic Church as the legitimate opposition to communist rule in Poland.\nBy 1978, Brzezinski and Vance were more and more at odds over the direction of Carter's foreign policy. Vance sought to continue the style of d\u00e9tente engineered by Nixon-Kissinger, with a focus on arms control. Brzezinski believed that d\u00e9tente emboldened the Soviets in Angola and the Middle East, and so he argued for increased military strength and an emphasis on human rights. Vance, the State Department, and the media criticized Brzezinski publicly as seeking to revive the Cold War. Brzezinski advised Carter in 1978 to engage the People's Republic of China and traveled to Beijing to lay the groundwork for the normalization of relations between the two countries. This also resulted in the severing of ties with the United States' longtime anti-Communist ally the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nBrzezinski's influence over President Carter persuaded the latter to, despite the misgivings of his own Department of State, also pursue a more belligerent policy towards Cuba with regards to its role in Africa, which he perceived to be part of a wider Soviet plot to destabilise and dominate the continent. Carter denounced the Cuban government's support of the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia during the Ogaden War.\nFor historical background on this period of history, see:\n1979 saw two major strategically important events: the overthrow of U.S. ally the Shah of Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Iranian Revolution precipitated the Iran hostage crisis, which would last for the rest of Carter's presidency. Brzezinski anticipated the Soviet invasion, and, with the support of Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China, he created a strategy to undermine the Soviet presence. Using this atmosphere of insecurity, Brzezinski led the United States toward a new arms buildup and the development of the Rapid Deployment Forces\u2014policies that are both more generally associated with Reagan's presidency now.\nIn 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in shifting Carter's viewpoint on the Soviet Union to a more assertive one, a shift that finalized with the Soviet-Afghan War.\nBrzezinski constantly urged either the restoration of the Shah of Iran to power or a military takeover, whatever the short-term costs in terms of values.\nOn November 9, 1979, Brzezinski was awakened at 3\u00a0am by a phone call with a startling message: The Soviets had just launched 250 nuclear weapons at the United States. Minutes later, Brzezinski received another call: The early-warning system actually showed 2,000 missiles heading toward the United States. As Brzezinski prepared to phone President Jimmy Carter to plan a full-scale response, he received a third call: It was a false alarm. An early warning training tape generating indications of a large-scale Soviet nuclear attack had somehow transferred to the actual early warning network, which triggered an all-too-real scramble.\nBrzezinski, acting under a lame duck Carter presidency\u2014but encouraged that Solidarity in Poland had vindicated his style of engagement with Eastern Europe\u2014took a hard-line stance against what seemed like an imminent Soviet invasion of Poland. He even made a midnight phone call to Pope John Paul II (whose visit to Poland in 1979 had foreshadowed the emergence of Solidarity) warning him in advance. The U.S. stance was a significant change from previous reactions to Soviet repression in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.\nBrzezinski developed the Carter Doctrine, which committed the U.S. to use military force in defense of the Persian Gulf. In 1981 President Carter presented Brzezinski with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nNational Security Advisor.\nPresident Carter chose Brzezinski for the position of National Security Adviser (NSA) because he wanted an assertive intellectual at his side to provide him with day-to-day advice and guidance on foreign policy decisions. Brzezinski would preside over a reorganized National Security Council (NSC) structure, fashioned to ensure that the NSA would be only one of many players in the foreign policy process.\nInitially, Carter reduced the NSC staff by one-half, and decreased the number of standing NSC committees from eight to two. All issues referred to the NSC were reviewed by one of the two new committees, either the Policy Review Committee (PRC) or the Special Coordinating Committee (SCC). The PRC focused on specific issues, and its chairmanship rotated. The SCC was always chaired by Brzezinski, a circumstance he had to negotiate with Carter to achieve. Carter believed that by making the NSA chairman of only one of the two committees, he would prevent the NSC from being the overwhelming influence on foreign policy decisions it had been under Kissinger's chairmanship during the Nixon administration.\nThe SCC was charged with considering issues that cut across several departments, including oversight of intelligence activities, arms control evaluation, and crisis management. Much of the SCC's time during the Carter years was spent on SALT issues. The Council held few formal meetings, convening only 10 times, compared with 125 meetings during the eight years of the Nixon and Ford administrations. Instead, Carter used frequent, informal meetings as a decision-making device\u2014typically his Friday breakfasts\u2014usually attended by the Vice President, the secretaries of State and Defense, Brzezinski, and the chief domestic adviser.\nNo agendas were prepared and no formal records were kept of these meetings, sometimes resulting in differing interpretations of the decisions actually agreed upon. Brzezinski was careful, in managing his own weekly luncheons with secretaries Vance and Brown in preparation for NSC discussions, to maintain a complete set of notes. Brzezinski also sent weekly reports to the President on major foreign policy undertakings and problems, with recommendations for courses of action. President Carter enjoyed these reports and frequently annotated them with his own views. Brzezinski and the NSC used these presidential notes (159 of them) as the basis for NSC actions.\nFrom the beginning, Brzezinski made sure that the new NSC institutional relationships would assure him a major voice in the shaping of foreign policy. While he knew that Carter would not want him to be another Kissinger, Brzezinski also felt confident that the President did not want Secretary of State Vance to become another Dulles and would want his own input on key foreign policy decisions. Brzezinski's power gradually expanded into the operational area during the Carter Presidency. He increasingly assumed the role of a presidential emissary. In 1978, for example, Brzezinski traveled to Beijing to lay the groundwork for normalizing U.S.\u2013PRC relations.\nLike Kissinger before him, Brzezinski maintained his own personal relationship with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin. Brzezinski had NSC staffers monitor State Department cable traffic through the Situation Room and call back to the State Department if the President preferred to revise or take issue with outgoing State Department instructions. He also appointed his own press spokesman, and his frequent press briefings and appearances on television interview shows made him a prominent public figure, although perhaps not nearly as much as Kissinger had been under Nixon.\nThe Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 significantly damaged the already tenuous relationship between Vance and Brzezinski. Vance felt that Brzezinski's linkage of SALT to other Soviet activities and the MX, together with the growing domestic criticisms in the United States of the SALT II Accord, convinced Brezhnev to decide on military intervention in Afghanistan. Brzezinski, however, later recounted that he advanced proposals to maintain Afghanistan's independence but was frustrated by the Department of State's opposition. An NSC working group on Afghanistan wrote several reports on the deteriorating situation in 1979, but Carter ignored them until the Soviet intervention destroyed his illusions. Only then did he decide to abandon SALT II ratification and pursue the anti-Soviet policies that Brzezinski proposed.\nThe Iranian revolution was the last straw for the disintegrating relationship between Vance and Brzezinski. As the upheaval developed, the two advanced fundamentally different positions. Brzezinski wanted to control the revolution and increasingly suggested military action to prevent Ayatollah Khomeini from coming to power, while Vance wanted to come to terms with the new Islamic Republic of Iran. As a consequence, Carter failed to develop a coherent approach to the Iranian situation. Vance's resignation following the unsuccessful mission to rescue the American hostages in March 1980, undertaken over his objections, was the final result of the deep disagreement between Brzezinski and Vance.\nMajor policies.\nDuring the 1960s, Brzezinski articulated the strategy of peaceful engagement for undermining the Soviet bloc, and while serving on the State Department Policy Planning Council, persuaded President Lyndon B. Johnson to adopt (in October 1966) peaceful engagement as U.S. strategy, placing d\u00e9tente ahead of German reunification and thus reversing prior U.S. priorities.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, at the height of his political involvement, Brzezinski participated in the formation of the Trilateral Commission in order to more closely cement U.S.\u2013Japanese\u2013European relations. As the three most economically advanced sectors of the world, the people of the three regions could be brought together in cooperation that would give them a more cohesive stance against the communist world.\nWhile serving in the White House, Brzezinski emphasized the centrality of human rights as a means of placing the Soviet Union on the ideological defensive. With Jimmy Carter in Camp David, he assisted in the attainment of the Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty.\nAfghanistan.\nCommunists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978. The new regime\u2014divided between Taraki's extremist Khalq faction and the more moderate Parcham\u2014signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year. Taraki's efforts to improve secular education and redistribute land were accompanied by mass executions (including of many conservative religious leaders) and political oppression unprecedented in Afghan history, igniting a revolt by mujahideen rebels.\nFollowing a general uprising in April 1979, Taraki was deposed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September. Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers; even the Soviets were alarmed by the brutality of the Afghan communists, and suspected Amin of being an agent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), although that was not the case. By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan, execute Amin, and install Parcham leader Babrak Karmal as president.\nPresident Carter was surprised by the invasion, as the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community during 1978 and 1979\u2014reiterated as late as September 29, 1979\u2014was that \"Moscow would not intervene in force even if it appeared likely that the Khalq government was about to collapse.\" Indeed, Carter's diary entries from November 1979 until the Soviet invasion in late December contain only two short references to Afghanistan, and are instead preoccupied with the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran. In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf.\nMoreover, the failure to accurately predict Soviet intentions caused American officials to reappraise the Soviet threat to both Iran and Pakistan, although it is now known that those fears were overblown. For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Brzezinski that \"if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate Baluchistan\u00a0 ... [thus] dismembering Pakistan and Iran\" took on new urgency.\nThese concerns were a major factor in the unrequited efforts of both the Carter and Reagan administrations to improve relations with Iran, and resulted in massive aid to Pakistan's Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Zia's ties with the U.S. had been strained during Carter's presidency due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April 1979, but Carter told Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance as early as January 1979 that it was vital to \"repair our relationships with Pakistan\" in light of the unrest in Iran.\nOne initiative Carter authorized to achieve this goal was a collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI); through the ISI, the CIA began providing some $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance to the mujahideen on July 3, 1979\u2014several months prior to the Soviet invasion. The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\" thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended\". The first shipment of U.S.weapons intended for the mujahideen reached Pakistan on January 10, 1980, shortly following the Soviet invasion.\nIn the aftermath of the invasion, Carter was determined to respond vigorously to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid to Pakistan, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense. The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3\u00a0billion. The Soviets were unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, precipitating the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself.\nHowever, the decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon \"became one of the most violent cities in the world\". Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: of the seven mujahideen groups supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs\u2014and these fundamentalists received most of the funding. Years later, in a 1997 CNN/National Security Archive interview, Brzezinski detailed the strategy taken by the Carter administration against the Soviets in 1979:\nWe immediately launched a twofold process when we heard that the Soviets had entered Afghanistan. The first involved direct reactions and sanctions focused on the Soviet Union, and both the State Department and the National Security Council prepared long lists of sanctions to be adopted, of steps to be taken to increase the international costs to the Soviet Union of their actions. And the second course of action led to my going to Pakistan a month or so after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for the purpose of coordinating with the Pakistanis a joint response, the purpose of which would be to make the Soviets bleed for as much and as long as is possible; and we engaged in that effort in a collaborative sense with the Saudis, the Egyptians, the British, the Chinese, and we started providing weapons to the Mujaheddin, from various sources again\u2014for example, some Soviet arms from the Egyptians and the Chinese. We even got Soviet arms from the Czechoslovak communist government, since it was obviously susceptible to material incentives; and at some point we started buying arms for the Mujaheddin from the Soviet army in Afghanistan, because that army was increasingly corrupt.\n\"Afghan Trap\" theory.\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, a theory that Brzezinski intentionally provoked the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 was widely repeated. Some adherents of this theory thus blamed Brzezinski (and the Carter administration) for events subsequent to the Soviet invasion, including the decades-long Afghanistan conflict (1978\u2013present), the September 11 attacks, and the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. A 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal \"Diplomatic History\" contends that this theory\u2014referred to as the \"Afghan Trap\" theory by the author\u2014is a misrepresentation of the historical record based almost entirely on a \"caricature\" of Brzezinski as an anti-communist fanatic, a disputed statement attributed to Brzezinski by a \"Le Nouvel Observateur\" journalist in 1998 (which was \"repeatedly den[ied]\" by Brzezinski himself), \"and the circumstantial fact that U.S. support antedated the invasion.\" In addition to Tobin, several academic or journalistic sources have questioned the veracity of aspects of the \"Afghan Trap\" theory, as have at least two former high-ranking Carter administration officials.\nWhile it is true that the March 1979 Herat uprising in Afghanistan and a desire to rebuild strained U.S. relations with Pakistani leader Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in light of the Iranian Revolution prompted Carter to sign presidential findings in July 1979 permitting the CIA to spend $695,000 on non-military assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to Afghan mujahideen insurgents (and on a propaganda campaign targeting the Soviet-backed leadership of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan or DRA), internal deliberations show that \"U.S. policies were almost wholly reactive\u00a0... to the Soviets' escalating military presence\" with policymakers rejecting \"a \"substantial\" covert aid program\" (including lethal provisions) \"to avoid provoking Moscow.\" (The Soviet military and political presence in Afghanistan steadily increased throughout 1979, including \"tens of millions of dollars in military aid provided by Moscow to the DRA.\")\nAccording to Tobin, Brzezinski went to considerable lengths to dissuade the Soviets from invading Afghanistan, urging the Carter administration to publicize information regarding the growing Soviet military role in Afghanistan's nascent civil war and to explicitly warn the Soviets of severe sanctions in the event of an invasion; when his warnings were watered-down by the State Department under the leadership of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Brzezinski leaked information to a journalist, resulting in an August 1979 article in \"The New York Times\" headlined \"U.S. Is Indirectly Pressing Russians to Halt Afghanistan Intervention.\" (Ironically, Soviet general Valentin Varennikov complained in 1995 that American officials had never made Afghanistan's strategic significance clear to their Soviet counterparts prior to December 1979, speculating\u2014in line with the \"Afghan Trap\" theory\u2014that this omission may have been deliberate as the U.S. \"had an interest in us getting stuck in Afghanistan, and paying the greatest possible price for that.\") Furthermore, Brzezinski attempted to discretely negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet troops with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin during 1980, privately conceding that the country would likely remain within the Soviet sphere of influence following a diplomatic settlement, as he had little confidence in the mujahideen's ability to inflict a military defeat on the Red Army.\nCarter administration officials Robert Gates and Vice President Walter Mondale criticized the \"Afghan Trap\" theory between 2010 and 2012, the former stating that it had \"no basis in fact\" and the latter calling it \"a huge, unwarranted leap\". Tobin concludes: \"The small-scale covert program that developed \"in response\" to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan \"if\" the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\" Historian Robert Rakove wrote, the notion of a U.S. effort to entrap the Soviet Union in Afghanistan has been \"methodically and effectively refuted by Conor Tobin\". Steve Coll had previously stated in 2004 that \"[c]ontemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail.\u00a0... Given this evidence and the enormous political and security costs that the invasion imposed on the Carter administration, any claim that Brzezinski lured the Soviets into Afghanistan warrants deep skepticism.\" Coll's \"specific debunking of the Brzezinski \"Nouvel Observateur\" interview\" was cited by the National Security Archive in 2019. In 2016, Justin Va\u00efsse referred to \"[t]he thesis according to which a trap was set having been dismissed\" as \"[s]uch a position would not be compatible with the archives\". Elisabeth Leake, writing in 2022, agreed that \"the original provision was certainly inadequate to force a Soviet armed intervention. Instead it adhered to broader US practices of providing limited covert support to anti-communist forces worldwide.\"\nIran.\nIn November 1979, revolutionary students stormed the Embassy of the United States, Tehran and took American diplomats hostage. Brzezinski argued against Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's proposed diplomatic solutions to the Iran hostage crisis, insisting they \"would deliver Iran to the Soviets.\" Vance, struggling with gout, went to Florida on Thursday, April 10, 1980, for a long weekend.\nOn Friday, Brzezinski held a newly scheduled meeting of the National Security Council and authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a military expedition into Tehran to rescue the hostages. Deputy Secretary Warren Christopher, who attended the meeting in Vance's place, did not inform Vance. Furious, Vance handed in his resignation on principle, calling Brzezinski \"evil\".\nPresident Carter aborted the operation after three of the eight helicopters he had sent into the Dasht-e Kavir desert crashed, and a fourth then collided with a transport plane, causing a fire that killed eight servicemen. The hostages were ultimately released on the day of the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan, after 444 days in captivity.\nAlong with Kissinger and David Rockefeller, Brzezinski played a role in convincing Carter to admit the exiled Shah into the U.S.\nBrzezinski has compared complaints by US officials about Iran's alleged nuclear ambitions to similar statements made before the Iraq war began: \"I think the administration, the President and the Vice President particularly, are trying to hype the atmosphere, and that is reminiscent of what preceded the war in Iraq.\"\nChina.\nShortly after taking office in 1977, President Carter again reaffirmed the United States' position of upholding the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9. In May 1978, Brzezinski overcame concerns from the State Department and traveled to Beijing, where he began talks that seven months later led to full diplomatic relations. The United States and People's Republic of China announced on December 15, 1978, that the two governments would establish diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979. This required that the United States sever relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. Consolidating U.S. gains in befriending Communist China was a major priority stressed by Brzezinski during his time as National Security Advisor.\nBrzezinski \"denied reports that he encouraged China to support the genocidal dictator Pol Pot in Cambodia, because Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge were the enemies of communist Vietnam.\" However, following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia which toppled the Khmer Rouge, Brzezinski prevailed in having the administration refuse to recognize the new Cambodian government due to its support by the Soviet Union.\nThe most important strategic aspect of the new U.S.\u2013Chinese relationship was in its effect on the Cold War. China was no longer considered part of a larger Sino-Soviet bloc but instead a third pole of power due to the Sino-Soviet Split, helping the United States against the Soviet Union.\nIn the Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations dated January 1, 1979, the United States transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The United States reiterated the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9's acknowledgment of the PRC position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China; Beijing acknowledged that the United States would continue to carry on commercial, cultural, and other unofficial contacts with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act made the necessary changes in U.S. law to permit unofficial relations with Taiwan to continue.\nIn addition the severing relations with the Republic of China, the Carter administration also agreed to unilaterally pull out of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, withdraw U.S. military personnel from Taiwan, and gradually reduce arms sales to the Republic of China. There was widespread opposition in Congress, notably from Republicans, due to the Republic of China's status as an anti-Communist ally in the Cold War. In \"Goldwater v. Carter\", Barry Goldwater made a failed attempt to stop Carter from terminating the mutual defense treaty.\nArab-Israeli conflict.\nOn October 10, 2007, Brzezinski along with other influential signatories sent a letter to President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice titled \"Failure Risks Devastating Consequences.\" The letter was partly an advice and a warning of the failure of an upcoming U.S.-sponsored Middle East conference scheduled for November 2007 between representatives of Israelis and Palestinians. The letter also suggested to engage in \"a genuine dialogue with Hamas\" rather than to isolate it further.\nEnding Soviet d\u00e9tente.\nPresidential Directive 18 on U.S. National Security, signed early in Carter's term, signaled a fundamental reassessment of the value of d\u00e9tente, and set the United States on a course to quietly end Kissinger's strategy.\nZbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Jimmy Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy. Brzezinski was a liberal Democrat and a committed anti-communist, favoring social justice while seeing world events in substantially Cold War terms. Additionally, according to \"Foreign Policy\", \"Brzezinski\u2019s outlook was anti-Soviet, but he also insisted, like George Kennan before him, on the necessity of cultivating a strong West.\"\nBrzezinski stated that human rights could be used to put the Soviet Union ideologically on the defensive:\nI felt strongly that in the U.S.-Soviet competition the appeal of America as a free society could become an important asset, and I saw in human rights an opportunity to put the Soviet Union ideologically on the defensive...by actively pursuing this' commitment we could mobilize far greater global support and focus global attention on the glaring internal weaknesses of the Soviet system.\nBrzezinski's policy on Iran was thoroughly connected to the Soviet Union, because it was observed that each coup and revolution in 1979 had advanced Soviet power towards the Persian Gulf. Brzezinski advised President Carter that the United States's \"greatest vulnerability\" lay on an arc \"stretching from Chittagong through Islamabad to Aden.\" This played a role in the Carter Doctrine.\nNuclear strategy.\nPresidential Directive 59, \"Nuclear Employment Policy\", dramatically changed U.S. targeting of nuclear weapons aimed at the Soviet Union. Implemented with the aid of Defense Secretary Harold Brown, this directive officially set the United States on a countervailing strategy.\nArms control.\nZbigniew Brzezinski utilized the United States' need to stability and progress in political relations with the Soviet Union to spur on the call for a new strategic arms treaty. On April 5, 1979, Brzezinski made a speech at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations where he stated that competition between the two powers and the nuclear arms race would not simply end because of the accord. According to him, the projected strategic arms treaty that would intend to impose limits on power such as missiles and bombers through the year 1989, would be what contributes to the progress and confidence in Soviet-American relations.\nHe aimed to frame his arms control policy in a way that portrayed it as favorable to create, ensure, and maintain Soviet-American relations. Leading up to the presidential election in 1980, the Carter administration set sight on confronting Ronald Reagan on arms control agreements with Moscow. On this issue, Brzezinski believed that to continue moving safely ahead with talks to control atomic arms with Moscow, despite Soviet troops holding position in Afghanistan, the United States needed to remain firm in containing Soviet expansionism.\nOverall, Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2019s arms control views leaned skeptical and mistrusting of Soviet motives in general and emphasized the central importance of the East-West competition. On the other hand, other officials such as the Secretary of State Cyrus Vance worked to pave a way for a wider US-Soviet relationship. Arms control in Brzezinski\u2019s terms would take any opportunity to halt or reduce the momentum of the Soviet buildup.\nAfter power.\nBrzezinski left office concerned about the internal division within the Democratic party, arguing that the dovish McGovernite wing would send the Democrats into permanent minority. Ronald Reagan invited him to stay on as his National Security Adviser, but Brzezinski declined, feeling that the new president needed a fresh perspective on which to build his foreign policy. He had mixed relations with the Reagan administration. On the one hand, he supported it as an alternative to the Democrats' pacifism. On the other hand, he also criticized it as seeing foreign policy in overly black-and-white terms.\nBy the 1980s, Brzezinski argued that the general crisis of the Soviet Union foreshadowed communism's end.\nHe remained involved in Polish affairs, critical of the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981, and more so of the Western European acquiescence to its imposition in the name of stability. Brzezinski briefed U.S. vice president George H. W. Bush before his 1987 trip to Poland that aided in the revival of the Solidarity movement.\nIn 1985, under the Reagan administration, Brzezinski served as a member of the President's Chemical Warfare Commission. From 1987 to 1988, he worked on the U.S. National Security Council\u2013Defense Department Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy. From 1987 to 1989 he also served on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.\nIn 1988, Brzezinski was co-chairman of the Bush National Security Advisory Task Force, endorsing Bush for president, and breaking with the Democratic party. Brzezinski published \"The Grand Failure\" the same year, predicting the failure of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, and the collapse of the Soviet Union in a few more decades. He said there were five possibilities for the Soviet Union: successful pluralization, protracted crisis, renewed stagnation, coup (by the KGB or Soviet military), or the explicit collapse of the Communist regime. He called collapse \"at this stage a much more remote possibility\" than protracted crisis.\nHe also predicted that the chance of some form of communism existing in the Soviet Union in 2017 was a little more than 50% and that when the end did come it would be \"most likely turbulent\". Conflicts such as Nagorno-Karabakh crisis and Soviet attempts to reinstate its authority in Lithuania and other republics were much less violent than Brzezinski and other observers anticipated. In the event, the Soviet system collapsed totally after the abortive August coup of 1991 launched against Gorbachev failed.\nIn 1989, the Communists failed to mobilize support in Poland, and Solidarity swept the general elections. Later the same year, Brzezinski toured Russia and visited a memorial to the Katyn Massacre. This served as an opportunity for him to ask the Soviet government to acknowledge the truth about the event, for which he received a standing ovation in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Ten days later, the Berlin Wall fell, and Soviet-supported governments in Eastern Europe began to totter. Strobe Talbott, one of Brzezinski's long-time critics, conducted an interview with him for \"TIME\" magazine entitled \"Vindication of a Hardliner\".\nIn 1990, Brzezinski warned against post\u2013Cold War euphoria. He publicly opposed the Gulf War, arguing that the United States would squander the international goodwill it had accumulated by defeating the Soviet Union, and that it could trigger wide resentment throughout the Arab world. He expanded upon these views in his 1992 work \"Out of Control\".\nBrzezinski was prominently critical of the Clinton administration's hesitation to intervene against the Serb forces in the Bosnian war. He also began to speak out against Russia's First Chechen War, forming the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya. Wary of a move toward the reinvigoration of Russian power, Brzezinski negatively viewed the succession of former KGB agent Vladimir Putin after Boris Yeltsin. In this vein, he became one of the foremost advocates of NATO expansion. He wrote in 1998 that \"Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.\" In 1997 he advocated for a \"loosely confederated Russia \u2014 composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic\" as a \"decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization\". He later came out in support of the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia during the Kosovo war.\nLater years.\nAfter his role as National Security Adviser came to a close, Brzezinski returned to teaching, but remained an influential voice in international relations. Polish politician Radek Sikorski wrote that to Poles, Brzezinski was considered \"our statesman\" and his was one of the most revered voices in Poland: \"During the decades when Poland was stuck against her will behind the Iron Curtain, he and the Polish pope were the two most important voices for a free Poland abroad. After liberation, he acted as an adviser and champion of the new democracies on their way to rejoining Western institutions.\"\nThough he rose to national prominence as a member of the Carter administration, Brzezinski avoided partisan politics and sometimes later voted Republican. In the 1988 election, he endorsed George H. W. Bush for president over Democrat Michael Dukakis.\nBrzezinski argued against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was outspoken in the then-unpopular opinion that the invasion would be a mistake. As recalled by David Ignatius, \"Brzezinski paid a cost in the insular, self-reinforcing world of Washington foreign policy opinion, until it became clear to nearly everyone that he (joined in this Iraq War opposition by Scowcroft) had been right.\" He later called President George W. Bush's foreign policy \"catastrophic.\"\nBrzezinski was a leading critic of the George W. Bush administration's conduct of the war on terror. In 2004, Brzezinski wrote \"The Choice\", which expanded upon his earlier work,\"The Grand Chessboard\" (1997), and sharply criticized George W. Bush's foreign policy. In 2007, in a column in \"The Washington Post\", Brzezinski excoriated the Bush administration, arguing that their post-9/11 actions had damaged the reputation of the United States \"infinitely greater than any wild dreams entertained by the fanatical perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks\" and destroyed any chance of uniting the world to defeat extremism and terrorism. He later stated that he had \"visceral contempt\" for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who supported Bush's actions in Iraq. In 2006, he defended John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt after their arguments about the Israel lobby attracted intense criticism.\nIn August 2007, Brzezinski endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. He stated that Obama \"recognizes that the challenge is a new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of America's role in the world\" and that \"What makes Obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and people.\" In September 2007 during a speech on the Iraq war, Obama introduced Brzezinski as \"one of our most outstanding thinkers,\" but some pro-Israel commentators questioned his criticism of the Israel lobby in the United States.\nIn a September 2009 interview with \"The Daily Beast\", Brzezinski replied to a question about how aggressive President Obama should be in insisting Israel not conduct an air strike on Iran, saying: \"We are not exactly impotent little babies. They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq. Are we just going to sit there and watch?\" This was interpreted by some supporters of Israel as supporting the downing of Israeli jets by the United States in order to prevent an attack on Iran.\nOn October 1, 2009, Brzezinski delivered the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. In 2011, Brzezinski supported the NATO intervention against the forces of Muammar Gaddafi in the Libyan Civil War, calling non-intervention \"morally dubious\" and \"politically questionable\".\nIn early 2012, Brzezinski expressed disappointment and said he was confused by some of Obama's actions, such as the decision to send 2,500 U.S. troops to Australia, but supported him for re-election.\nOn March 3, 2014, between the February 22 ousting of Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych and the March 16, Crimean referendum, Brzezinski authored an op-ed piece for \"The Washington Post\" entitled \"What is to be done? Putin's aggression in Ukraine needs a response.\" He led with a link on Russian aggression; he compared Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"thuggish tactics in seizing Crimea\" and \"thinly camouflaged invasion\" to Adolf Hitler's occupation of the Sudetenland in 1938, and characterized Putin as a cartoon Benito Mussolini, but stopped well short of advocating that the U.S. go to war. Rather, he suggested that NATO should be put on high alert and recommended \"to avert miscalculations\". He explicitly stated that reassurances be given to \"Russia that it is not seeking to draw Ukraine into NATO.\"\nAccording to Ignatius and Sikorski, Brzezinski was \"deeply troubled\" by the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States and worried over the future. Two days after the election, on November 10, 2016, Brzezinski warned of \"coming turmoil in the nation and the world\" in a brief speech after he was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service from the Department of Defense. On May 4, 2017, he sent out his final Tweet, saying, \"Sophisticated US leadership is the \"sine qua non\" of a stable world order. However, we lack the former while the latter is getting worse.\"\nPiotr Pietrzak argued that \"Brzezinski never trusted Putin and saw him as the post-Soviet man, a product of Soviet imperialist indoctrination, who felt deeply humiliated by how the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact collapsed, but he predicted the escalation of the situation in the East long before Putin took power and much earlier than most of us, possibly because his geopolitical insights were strongly influenced by the work of Alfred Thayer Mahan, Halford J. Mackinder, Nickolas J. Spykman, and Friedrich Ratzel.\".\nPietrzak also suggested that \"Although Zbigniew Brzezinski is dead, his work is very much alive; the Biden administration follows Brzezinski\u2019s geostrategic blueprint, which supports Ukraine militarily, logistically, diplomatically, and politically. Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2019s son Mark Brzezinski serves as the United States Ambassador to Poland and helps his superiors implement his father\u2019s geostrategic vision on the ground thanks to which the Ukrainian army is still standing and is capable of not only repelling the Russian offensive but actually launching a successful counter-offensive. The question is what constitutes the Brzezinski Doctrine today? Would Brzezinski see Ukraine as a potential NATO member or a frozen buffer zone between the transatlantic community and an increasingly assertive, hawkish, and unpredictable Russian giant?\".\nPersonal life.\nBrzezinski was married to Czech-American sculptor Emilie Benes (grand-niece of the second Czechoslovak president, Edvard Bene\u0161), with whom he had three children. His elder son, Ian Brzezinski (b. 1963), is a Senior Fellow in the International Security Program and is on the Atlantic Council's Strategic Advisors Group. Ian also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO (2001\u20132005) and was a principal at Booz Allen Hamilton. His younger son, Mark Brzezinski (b. 1965), is a lawyer who served on President Clinton's National Security Council as an expert on Russia and Southeastern Europe, and has served as the U.S. ambassador to Sweden (2011\u20132015) and Poland (from 2022). His daughter, Mika Brzezinski (b. 1967), is a television news presenter and co-host of MSNBC's weekday morning program, \"Morning Joe\", where she provides regular commentary and reads the news headlines for the program. \nHe was deeply Catholic. \nPublic life.\nBrzezinski was a member of the Atlantic Council and the National Endowment for Democracy. At the time of his death, he was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Honorary Council of the European Academy of Diplomacy.\nHe was also referred to by the nickname \"Zbig\".\nFilm appearances.\nBrzezinski appeared as himself in several documentary films and TV series, such as: the 1997 film \"Eternal Memory: Voices from the Great Terror\", directed by David Pultz; Episodes 17 (\"Good Guys, Bad Guys\"), 19 (\"Freeze\") and 20 (\"Soldiers of God\") of the 1998 CNN series \"Cold War\" produced by Jeremy Isaacs; the 2009 documentary \"\"; and the 2014 Polish biographical film \"Strateg\" (\"The Strategist\") directed by Katarzyna Kolenda-Zaleska and produced by TVN. The 2014 Polish film \"Jack Strong\" features Krzysztof Pieczy\u0144ski as Brzezinski.\nDeath.\nBrzezinski died at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, on May 26, 2017, at the age of 89. His funeral was held June\u00a09 at the Cathedral of St. Matthew in Washington, D.C. Former President Carter and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were among those who gave eulogies, while attendees included international diplomats and emissaries; journalists Carl Bernstein, Chuck Todd and David Ignatius; 100-year-old Gen. Edward Rowny; former National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice; and former National Security Advisor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.\n\"If I could choose my seatmate, it would be Dr. Brzezinski,\" Carter said of his international flights on Air Force One. Former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, aged 94, was unable to attend, but a note he sent during the eulogy said: \"The world is an emptier place without Zbig pushing the limits of his insights.\"\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 3,708 at the 2020 United States census. It was established in the early 18th century as Chickahawk.\nHistory.\nThe name Kitty Hawk is derived from the native Algonquin Native American language word Chickahawk, meaning \"a place to hunt geese\".\nKitty Hawk became world-famous after the Wright brothers made the first controlled powered airplane flights at Kill Devil Hills, south of the town, on December 17, 1903. After the four flights in their \"Wright Flyer\", the brothers walked back to Kitty Hawk. Here, they sent a telegram from the Weather Bureau office to their father informing him of their success. Kitty Hawk is usually credited as the site of the powered flights because it was the nearest named settlement at the time of the flight; the modern town of Kill Devil Hills did not exist until 50 years after the flights. The Wrights chose the area because its frequent winds and soft sandy surfaces were suitable for their glider experiments, which they conducted over three years before they made the powered flights.\nThe Old Currituck Sound Bridge was completed in 1930, which connected the mainland to the Outer Banks across Albemarle Sound, prompting the paving of a road between the two existing bridges (the other in Manteo) and connecting the Outer Banks to the outside world by road for the first time.\nThe aircraft carrier USS \"Kitty Hawk\" (CV-63), the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber AV-19 with an aircraft number of 93\u20131086, P-40D Kittyhawk fighter aircraft, the aircraft transport ship USS \"Kitty Hawk\" (AKV-1), and the Apollo 14 command module have been named for the town, which incorporated in 1981.\nThe Kitty Hawk Life-Saving Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nGeography.\nKitty Hawk is located at at an elevation of above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a complete area of , of which is land and (0.579%) is water.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Live oak/Sea Oats Uniola paniculata (\"90\") with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (\"20\").\nKitty Hawk is served by US 158 and Highway 12, which parallel each other in the city. US 158 can be used to go west, while the barrier islands extend north and south.\nClimate.\nAccording to the Trewartha climate classification system, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (\"Cfak\"). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0\u00a0\u00b0F (&gt; 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature \u2265 50.0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u2265 10.0\u00a0\u00b0C), at least one month with an average mean temperature \u2265 71.6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u2265 22.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Kitty Hawk, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values \u2265 100\u00a0\u00b0F (\u2265 38\u00a0\u00b0C). Kitty Hawk is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 10\u00a0\u00b0F (&lt; -12\u00a0\u00b0C). The plant hardiness zone in Kitty Hawk is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . The average seasonal (Dec\u2013Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5\u00a0cm), and the average annual peak in nor'easter activity is in February.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,991 people, 1,265 households, and 866 families residing in the town.

{"id": "58422", "revid": "50301655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58422", "title": "Aviation", "text": "Activities surrounding aircraft industry\nAviation includes the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry. \"Aircraft\" include fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air aircraft such as hot air balloons and airships.\nAviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon, an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy. Cl\u00e9ment Ader built the \"Ader \u00c9ole\" in France and made an uncontrolled, powered hop in 1890. This was the first powered aircraft, although it did not achieve controlled flight. Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896. A major leap followed with the construction of the \"Wright Flyer\", the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s. \nSince that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet engine which enabled aviation to become a major form of transport throughout the world. In 2024, there were 9.5 billion passengers worldwide according to the ICAO. As of 2018, estimates suggest that 11% of the world's population traveled by air, with up to 4% taking international flights. \nEtymology.\nThe word \"aviation\" was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863. He originally derived the term from the verb \"avier\" (an unsuccessful neologism for \"to fly\"), itself derived from the Latin word \"avis\" (\"bird\") and the suffix \"-ation\".\nHistory.\nEarly beginnings.\nThere are early legends of human flight such as the stories of Icarus in Greek myth, Jamshid and Shah Kay K\u0101vus in Persian myth, and the flying automaton of Archytas of Tarentum (428\u2013347 BC). Later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the winged flights of Abbas ibn Firnas (810\u2013887, recorded in the 17th century), Eilmer of Malmesbury (11th century, recorded in the 12th century) and the hot-air Passarola of Bartholomeu Louren\u00e7o de Gusm\u00e3o (1685\u20131724).\nLighter than air.\nThe modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, of a hot air balloon designed by the Montgolfier brothers. The usefulness of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. The first steerable dirigible, balloon was flown by Jean-Pierre Blanchard in 1784. It was human-powered and, Blanchard completed a successful crossing of the English Channel in one in 1785.\nRigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best-known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company.\nThe most successful Zeppelin was the \"Graf Zeppelin\". It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The \"Golden Age\" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937. That year the \"Hindenburg\" caught fire, killing 36 people. The cause of the \"Hindenburg\" accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer found that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship. Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further \"Hindenburg\" type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time. There had been previous airship accidents that were more fatal, for instance, a British R38 on none }}, but the \"Hindenburg\" was the first to be captured on newsreel.\nHeavier than air.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1799, Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion and control.\nOtto Lilienthal was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful flights with gliders, therefore making the idea of \"heavier than air\" a reality. Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding, favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical.\nLilienthal's work led him to develop the concept of the modern wing. His flight attempts in Berlin in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight and the Lilienthal \"Normalsegelapparat\" is considered to be the first airplane in series production, making the \"Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal\" in Berlin the first air plane production company in the world.\nLilienthal is often referred to as either the \"father of aviation\" or \"father of flight\".\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw dirigible developments, such as Henri Giffard's included machine-powered propulsion Giffard dirigible in 1852, David Schwarz' rigid frame dirigible in 1896 and (Alberto Santos-Dumont's improvements to speed and maneuverability in 1901.\nThere are many competing claims for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight. The first recorded powered flight was carried out by Cl\u00e9ment Ader on October 9, 1890, in his bat-winged, fully self-propelled fixed-wing aircraft, the Ader \u00c9ole. It was reportedly the first manned, powered, heavier-than-air flight of a significant distance of , but insignificant altitude from level ground. Seven years later, on October 14, 1897, Ader's Avion III was tested without success in front of two officials from the French War ministry. The report on the trials was not publicized until 1910, as they had been a military secret. In November 1906, Ader said that he made a successful flight on October 14, 1897 and achieved an uninterrupted flight of around . Although widely believed at the time, these claims were later discredited.\nThe Wright brothers made the first successful powered, controlled and sustained airplane flight on December 17, 1903, a feat made possible by their invention of three-axis control and in-house development of an engine with a sufficient power-to-weight ratio. A decade later, at the start of World War I, heavier-than-air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting and attacks against ground positions.\nAircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. The Wright brothers took aloft the first passenger, Charles Furnas, one of their mechanics, on May 14, 1908.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s great progress was made in the field of aviation, including the first transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in 1919, Charles Lindbergh's solo transatlantic flight in 1927 and Charles Kingsford Smith's transpacific flight the following year. One of the most successful designs of this period was the Douglas DC-3, which became the first airliner to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. During World War II one of the first jet engines was developed by Hans von Ohain and accomplished the world's first jet-powered flight in 1939. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first jet aircraft and the first liquid-fueled rockets.\nAfter World War II, especially in North America, there was a boom in general aviation, both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as Cessna, Piper, and Beechcraft expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.\nBy the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the de Havilland Comet, though the first widely used passenger jet was the Boeing 707, because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time, turboprop propulsion started to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.\nSince the 1960s composite material airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and Concorde provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades. However, the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of solid-state electronics, the Global Positioning System, satellite communications, and increasingly small and powerful computers and LED displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of airliners and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through synthetic vision, even at night or in low visibility.\nOn June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded aircraft to make a spaceflight, opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, the need to decarbonize the aviation industry to face the climate crisis has increased research into aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as ethanol, electricity, hydrogen, and solar energy, with flying prototypes becoming more common.\nOperations of aircraft.\nCivil aviation.\nCivil aviation includes all non-military flying, both general aviation and scheduled air transport.\nAir transport.\nThere are seven major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft:\nBoeing, Airbus, Ilyushin and Tupolev concentrate on wide-body and narrow-body jet airliners, while Bombardier, Embraer and Sukhoi concentrate on regional airliners. Large networks of specialized parts suppliers from around the world support these manufacturers, who sometimes provide only the initial design and final assembly in their own plants. The Chinese ACAC consortium has also recently entered the civil transport market with its Comac ARJ21 regional jet.\nUntil the 1970s, most major airlines were flag carriers, sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition. Since then, open skies agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, as well as crises such as the September 11 attacks and the SARS pandemic have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time, low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, Southwest and WestJet have flourished.\nGeneral aviation.\n\"General aviation\" includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both private and commercial. General aviation may include business flights, air charter, private aviation, flight training, ballooning, paragliding, parachuting, gliding, hang gliding, aerial photography, foot-launched powered hang gliders, air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, traffic reporting, police air patrols and forest fire fighting.\nEach country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.\nMany small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.\nThe most important recent developments for small aircraft, which form the bulk of the GA fleet, have been the introduction of advanced avionics (including GPS) that were formerly found only in large airliners, and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster. Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation, they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft.\nMilitary aviation.\nSimple balloons were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years, military aircraft have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their government's arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost, performance and the speed of production.\nAir safety.\nAviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and categorization of flight failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel.\nAviation MRO.\nA maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization (MRO) is a firm that ensures airworthiness or air transport. According to a 2024 article, \"maintenance (M) involves inspecting, cleaning, oiling, and changing aircraft parts after a certain number of flight hours. Repair (R) is restoring the original function of parts and components. Overhaul (O) refers to extensive maintenance, the complete refurbishment of the aircraft, and upgrades in avionics, which can take several weeks to complete.\" Airlines are legally obligated to certify airworthiness, meaning that a civil aviation authority must approve an aircraft suitable for safe flight operations. MRO firms are responsible for this process, thoroughly checking and documenting all components' repairs while tracking mechanical, propulsion, and electronic parts. Aviation regulators oversee maintenance practices in the country of aircraft registration, manufacture, or current location. All aircraft maintenance activities must adhere to international regulations that mandate standards.\nAviation accidents and incidents.\nAn \"aviation accident\" is defined by the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which a person is fatally or seriously injured, the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible. An accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a \"hull loss accident\".\nThe first fatal aviation accident occurred in a Wright Model A aircraft at Fort Myer (now part of Joint Base Myer\u2013Henderson Hall) in Virginia, on September 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, Orville Wright, and death of the passenger, Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge. The worst aviation accident in history was the Tenerife airport disaster on March 27, 1977, when 583 people died when two Boeing 747 jumbo jets, operated by Pan Am and KLM collided on a runway in Los Rodeos airport, now known as Tenerife North.\nAn \"aviation incident\" is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.\nAir traffic control.\nAir traffic control (ATC) involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation\u00a0\u2013 that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas they may use radar to see aircraft positions.\nBecoming an air traffic controller in the United States typically requires an associate or bachelor's degree from the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative. The FAA also requires extensive training, along with medical examinations and background checks. Some controllers are required to work weekend, night, and holiday shifts.\nThere are generally four different types of ATC:\nATC is especially important for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules (IFR) when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However, in very high-traffic areas, especially near major airports, aircraft flying under visual flight rules (VFR) are also required to follow instructions from ATC.\nIn addition to separation from other aircraft, ATC may provide weather advisories, terrain separation, navigation assistance, and other services to pilots, depending on their workload.\nATC does not control all flights. The majority of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights in the United States and Canada are not required to contact ATC unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport, and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, air traffic control services are not available, even for IFR flights at lower altitudes.\nEnvironmental impact.\nLike all activities involving combustion, operating powered aircraft, from airliners to hot air balloons, releases soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance: \nAnother environmental impact of aviation is noise pollution, mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing. Sonic booms were a problem with supersonic aircraft such as the Concorde.\nInnovation and development.\nAir transportation is a mode of travel and commerce, involving the movement of people, goods, and animals through the atmosphere using aircraft such as airplanes and helicopters. It is a major mode for the overall transportation system, because of its speed and the ability to cover long distances quickly, connecting remote regions and major economic hubs. It plays a significant role in global trade and passenger mobility, influencing economic development and international relations. However, its share of CO2 emissions is significant, accounting for 2% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, having grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road or shipping. Even under the High Ambition scenario, where total emissions are reduced significantly, aviation emissions will still be a major concern.\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) has highlighted the need for ambitious policies in order to achieve significant reductions in aviation emissions, projecting that CO2 emissions from aviation could be lowered by up to 50% by 2050 with the right measures in place. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also emphasizes the potential of accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and implementing efficiency technologies for both commercial and cargo aircraft to achieve significant emission reductions. These commitments reflect a concerted effort by global organizations to address the climate impact of the aviation sector.\nTwo significant megatrends are observed in terms of air transport innovation, sustainability and digitalization. A report published by WIPO in 2025 showed a steady increase of patents publication in air transportation, the majority of which being related to communication and security, followed by sustainable propulsion.\nSustainable Propulsion technologies are being developed to reduce emissions and improve environmental sustainability. Efficient aircraft turbines are used to improve fuel efficiency, reduce emissions and lower noise levels. Aviation biofuels aim for a reduction in CO2 emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Battery-based electric and/or hybrid aircraft are being developed for short-haul and regional flights. Hydrogen-powered aircraft are intended for long-haul flights and heavy-duty applications.\nAutomation and Circularity technologies are promoting efficient material use, smart production and robotics, and enhanced recycling practices.\nCommunication and Security technologies are revolutionizing air transportation by improving operational efficiency, safety and customer experience. They include navigation technologies such as advanced air traffic management (ATM) systems, device-to-device technology, cloud computing, low-latency internet, and cybersecurity. Analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company has stated that the rise in digital technologies has made aviation systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures.\nAdvanced Human\u2013 Machine Interfaces, such as extended reality technologies, speech recognition technology, facial recognition technology, touch displays and data gloves, and head-up displays, are making interactions more intuitive, secure, and responsive, thereby improving operational efficiency and user experience.\nThe air transportation sector is undergoing a surge in patenting activity, with annual Air transport-related patent families increasing from under 1,100 in 2000 to over 12,800 in 2023 \u2013 a growth of 11%. China, the South Korea, and Japan stand out for their high patent volumes and significant growth rates, although they exhibit a relatively low Relative Specialization Index, reflecting a broad approach to innovation at the country-level across various sectors. In contrast, France, the United States and Canada demonstrate a high degree of specialization in Air transportation technologies reflecting a concentrated focus on advancing specific innovations in aviation.\nLeading aviation companies such as RTX, General Electric, Safran, Boeing, Rolls-Royce Holdings, and Honeywell International dominate the patent filings. The Aero Engine Corporation of China leads in recent growth with a compound annual growth rate of 81.1%. Generally, Chinese patent owners exhibit strong recent growth in air transport patent, in contrast to the other top patentees. Mitsubishi Electric in Japan is as the only non-Chinese entity among the fastest-growing patent owners, highlighting its strategic emphasis on Air transportation research and innovation. The diverse landscape underscores the dynamic interplay of high-volume patenting and strategic specialization across different regions, driven by both established aviation multinationals and emerging players.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally an army engineer, he later became Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, and built it into the foremost scientific institution in the country before the American Civil War.\nEarly life and education.\nBache was born in Philadelphia, the son of Richard Bache, Jr., and Sophia Burrell Dallas Bache. He came from a family prominent in American politics. He was the nephew of Vice-President George M. Dallas and naval hero Alexander J. Dallas, the grandson of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Dallas, and the great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin.\nCareer.\nUnited States Army.\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1825, as first in his class, he was an assistant professor of engineering there for some time. As a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, he was engaged in the construction of Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island. Bache resigned from the Army on June 1, 1829.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\nBache was a professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania from 1828 to 1841 and again from 1842 to 1843. He spent 1836\u20131838 in Europe on behalf of the trustees of what became Girard College; he was named president of the college after his return. Abroad, he examined European education systems, and on his return he published a valuable report. From 1839 to 1842, he served as the first president of Central High School of Philadelphia, one of the oldest public high schools in the United States.\nU.S. Coast Survey.\nIn 1843, on the death of Professor Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, Bache was appointed superintendent of the United States Coast Survey. Whereas Hassler had faced continual doubts from Congress, Bache succeeded in convincing legislators of the value of geodesy in addition to geomagnetic and meteorological research. With many contacts, friends, and family among the nation's political and military leaders, Bache won liberal appropriations to build up his agency and greatly expand its work. By the mid 1850s it had become the federal government's leading scientific bureau. In 1849, it began study of the Pacific Coast, which the US had newly acquired via the US-Mexico War and Oregon Treaty. Assisted by Isaac Stevens, his number two in Washington, DC, Bache reorganized the Coast Survey so that it could complete initial mapping of the entire US coast.\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, Smithsonian, and \"Lazzaroni\".\nBy the 1840s, a clique of leading US scientists began to coalesce around Bache with the goal of professionalizing their fields. They formalized with establishment of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists in 1843 (renamed the American Association for the Advancement of Science five years later) and the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. Informally, Bache and his circle called themselves the Scientific Lazzaroni. Together, the groups created and enforced standards of intellectual merit with the goal of elevating the nation and its reputation. This meant discrediting charlatans but, at times, also denying research funding or academic appointments to others. Perhaps most important, the groups advised and even mentored politicians and army engineers. Bache would lead the AAAS until 1851 and serve on the Smithsonian's board of regents throughout his term as Coast Survey superintendent.\nCivil War and later life.\nAs the sectional crisis worsened through the late 1850s, Coast Survey budgets became ensnared by polarization and conflicts in Congress. Then, the start of war in 1861 brought a stop to work along the South's Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Bache withdrew Survey ships from the region so they would not fall into secessionists' hands. At the same time, some staff resigned to join the Confederacy. A number of trusted friends and Democratic allies, including senators Jefferson Davis and Stephen Mallory, would lead the rebellion \u2014 acts that Bache took as both political and personal treachery.\nYet the Civil War enhanced the Coast Survey's stature in Washington, D.C. By this time, the agency had amassed charts of southern harbors, rivers, and coastal terrain. The research gave a critical advantage to the Union navy and army. Meanwhile, Bache continued to lead scientists to greater influence in government, helping to establish the U.S. Sanitary Commission and National Academy of Sciences.\nOfficial duties and private worries contributed to Bache's declining health. By 1864 he had suffered a stroke, which left him handicapped and unable to work without his wife's assistance. At the time of his death, he had served as head of the Coast Survey for 24 years.\nAwards and honors.\nAfter the Civil War, Bache was elected a 3rd Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) in consideration of his contributions to the war effort.\nPersonal life.\nHe married Nancy Clark Fowler on September 30, 1838, in Newport, Rhode Island. She was born in Newport and died on January 13, 1870, in Philadelphia. She assisted in the publication of much of his work. They adopted one son, Henry Wood Bache (1839\u20131878).\nDeath.\nHe died at Newport, Rhode Island on February 17, 1867, from cerebral softening. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., under a monument designed by architect Henry Hobson Richardson.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}

He played the violin in the 1846 Birmingham festival, and in 1849 went to London as a private composition student for three years under William Sterndale Bennett\nIn October 1850 Bache became organist of All Saints, Gordon Square. While continuing his studies with Sterndale Bennett, Bache composed concertos, overtures, two operettas, a string quartet and a piano trio along with many piano pieces. He made his debut as a concert performer at Keighley, Yorkshire on 21 January 1851. When he played the Allegro of an unpublished piano concerto of his own in June 1852, Henry Chorley remarked, \"We have met with no Englishman for whom we have so long been waiting than Mr. Bache.\" In November 1851 Bache went to live with Mellon, who was then living in London, and in 1852 was given a contract by Addison, Hollier and Lucas to write light piano pieces; he turned out these works in considerable numbers. Of one of these he wrote, \"I must say that I would \"sooner\" have written my \"Galop di Bravura\" than a Sonata which is only printed to lie on the shelf like a dead weight on account deficiency of anything like idea.\"\nIn 1853, on Sterndale Bennett's recommendation, Bache continued his musical education at Leipzig. He studied there with Moritz Hauptmann, acquiring the then-conventional prejudices against the music of Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. (This would be in sharp contrast to his brother Walter, who would become a staunch champion of Liszt and Wagner's music.) After visiting Dresden, he returned to London by way of Paris in February 1855. He attended the 1855 Birmingham Festival and reviewed it for some of the local newspapers. Afterwards, he suffered a severe attack of the tuberculosis that had plagued him for several years.\nOn medical advice, Bache went to Algiers early in 1856. There he gave a concert on 28 March. He travelled by way of Paris to Leipzig, arriving there in June, then through Dresden and Vienna to Rome by December of that year. His health again deteriorated, so he returned home in June 1857. He spent the following winter in Torquay, where he succeeded in giving a concert in February 1858. After his return to Birmingham, his illness continued to progress. He died less than three weeks after a farewell concert of his music on 5 August, at the age of 24.\nAccording to an evaluation in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Considering the early age at which he died, his compositions are fairly numerous, and the best, a trio for piano and strings, was long held in high esteem. Two operettas, a piano concerto and a number of published pianoforte pieces and songs do little more than show how great was his promise.\nHis younger brother, Walter Bache (1842\u20131888), was a successful pianist and conductor.\nA memoir of the two brothers, by their sister Constance Bache, appeared in 1901 under the title \"Brother Musicians\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They formerly constituted the Sultanate of Bacan.\nBacan (), formerly also known as Bachian or Batchian, is the group's largest island. Bacan Island in 2020 included about 82,387 people, of whom 7,073 lived in the capital Labuha; it is subdivided into seven districts. The second and third-largest islands are Kasiruta and Mandioli. Kasiruta and Mandioli each have over 11,000 inhabitants, and each is subdivided into two districts. A fourth island, Batang Lomang, forms a twelfth district within the group.

The ruling elite converted to Islam in about the late 15th century. The sultan at first resided on Kasiruta Island and had political and commercial influence in northern Ceram and the Papuan Islands. In 1513, the first Portuguese trading fleet to reach the Moluccas set up a trading post on Bacan which at the time was tied to the Sultan of Ternate by dynastic marriages. The fleet's commander, Captain Antonio de Miranda Azevedo, left seven men on Bacan to buy cloves for the following year's expedition. Their arrogant behaviour and reported bad treatment of Bacan women led to their murder. As Ternate did not have enough stock, the ship for which the men had stayed to prepare was used by the Sultan of Ternate to fill Ferdinand Magellan's last ship, which was the first ship to circumnavigate the world. A slave and two birds of paradise were given to the ship by Bacan. Bacan became a place of refuge for rebellious Ternatans. The Portuguese sent a punitive expedition against Bacan but it failed, and instead the Portuguese Governor Galv\u00e3o challenged Bacan's sultan to a duel to determine who was to be subservient to whom. The challenge was accepted but the duel never took place.\nIn 1557, Father Antonio Vaz converted Bacan's sultan and court members to Catholicism. The king was married to a daughter of Sultan Hairun of Ternate. Fleets from Ternate invaded the islands in 1570 and later and the king apostatized in 1575, though he was nevertheless poisoned in 1578. A community of Christians remained and were later joined by coreligionists from Tobelo and Ambon. A small Roman Catholic hospital was built by an elderly Dutch nun. Today, Protestants significantly outnumber Catholics. During the mid-19th century Moluccan travels of British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, Christians in the Moluccas were called \" (lit. \"Nazarene People\"), a term regularly applied to locals of European ancestry in the Malay Archipelago, thought to have been descended from the Portuguese. They had dressed in white and black and Wallace reports they dance \"quadrilles, waltzes, polkas, and mazurkas with great vigour and much skill\".\nFollowing the 1575 Ternatan invasion, Bacan become subservient to Ternate for periods, which was sealed through marriages. A sister and a daughter of Sultan Saidi Berkat of Ternate married Bacan rulers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. A Spanish fort was built in 1606. By this time the seat of the sultan had been moved from Kasiruta to Bacan Island. Once the Dutch East India Company established hegemony in 1609, the Netherlands' power on Bacan was based in Fort Barnaveld.\nIn 1705, the sergeant in charge of the fort and the sultan captured the English explorer William Dampier, seized his ship, looted its cargo, and threatened all aboard with execution. It is thought that this was in response to Dampier violating the trade monopoly. When the sergeant's Dutch superiors heard of the incident, Dampier was released, his ship restored and the English provided with sumptuous hospitality in Ternate. The chief town at the time, also known as Bachian, was Amasing or Amasingkota on the island's isthmus.\nTernate and Bacan were the only places in the northern Moluccas that had a Dutch curriculum school and a Protestant minister in the late 19th century. The majority of Bacan's Roman Catholics became Protestants during the Dutch colonial period. These Sirani wore semi-European dress and celebrated Sundays with dancing and music. The Sultanate of Bacan was treated as a Dutch protectorate; it was replaced by a council of chiefs under a Dutch \"\" in 1889. A sultan with much reduced powers was eventually appointed in 1900. What independence remained was lost with the Japanese occupation during and Indonesian independence after World War II. The most significant modern town is Labuha on the west coast. Bacan has more recently been in the news due to violence between Christian and Muslim inhabitants of the island.\nGeography.\nBacan is of irregular form, consisting of two distinct mountainous parts, united by a low isthmus, which a slight subsidence would submerge. The total land area is around 1,900\u00a0km2. The prevailing rocks are sandstone, coralline limestone, and pebbly conglomerate, although hot springs attest to volcanic activity as well. The ancient and non-volcanic rocks are especially prevalent on the south side of the island. The sulphur spring at Taubenkit has a temperature of and a still more remarkable example is found at Sayowang on the east coast. \"Amasing Hill\" on the northern half consists of three small andesitic volcanoes: Cakasuanggi, Dua Saudara, and Mount Sibela. The highest elevation on the southern half is Gunong Sabella or Labua (), which the locals traditionally considered the seat of evil spirits. Coal and other minerals have been discovered.\nDuring the 19th and early 20th century, large portions of the island were richly wooded, with indigenous sago, coconuts and cloves abundantly produced. The Dutch purposefully exterminated the native nutmeg trees: a large grove still remained as late as the 1870s but it had disappeared by the onset of World War I. It is the easternmost point naturally inhabited by primates, in the form of a black macaque which also occurs on Sulawesi. The world's largest bee, the giant mason bee, occurs here and on nearby Halmahera.\nDemographics.\nBy the mid-19th century, the interior of Bacan island was considered uninhabited and the coastal dwellers all non-indigenous. They consisted of the Christian descendants of Portuguese sailors (\"\"), of Malays and Papuans, of Galelas from northern Halmahera, and of Moris (To Mori) from Sulawesi's Bay of Tolo. Prior to World War I, the population of the island was around 13\u2009000, including some Chinese and Arabs. In the late 1990s, 193 of Bacan's 7,700 Christians were Protestants. The whole group had a population of 84,075 at the 2010 Census, but by mid 2023 had grown to 117,986.\nSeveral non-Austronesian (Papuan) languages are spoken on Bacan, the main one of which is Galela but also Tobelo and Ternate. Near the capital Labuha, Bacan Malay was once spoken by the Bacan people, but by 2012 only a handful of speakers remained.\nEconomy.\nColonial interest in Bacan was primarily driven by the spice trade, which was flourishing in Ternate, Tidore, and Halmahera. The island of Bacan was not particularly sought after for its own resources, but rather, to assist control of the more valuable islands nearby. The Dutch East India Company paid a stipend to the Bacan sultan as compensation for the destruction of Bacan's clove trees that was higher than the salary of the Dutch Governor on Ternate and about 1/9 of that paid to the Sultan of Ternate.\nIt is thought that gold was washed on Bacan since at least 1774; in the mid-nineteenth century, 20 skilled Chinese gold workers were brought from west Borneo but a gold rush did not eventuate. During the era of steam power, an attempt was made to establish coal mining on the island using Japanese convicts imprisoned by the Dutch. However, following the delivery of several tons the grade of coal was deemed poor and the mining was discontinued.\nFrom 1882, an Amsterdam merchant cleared plantations for vanilla, coffee, tobacco and potatoes, however, his land was unsuitable and the crops succumbed to floods, drought, rot, insects and rodents. Despite over ten years of large investments of capital, creditors forced him out of business in 1900 although they also did not succeed with the plantations. The indigenous economy included the gathering of pearl and mother-of-pearl, and the harvesting the resin from dammar.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58439", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58439", "title": "Transformational grammar", "text": "Earliest model of generative grammar\nIn linguistics, transformational grammar (TG) or transformational-generative grammar (TGG) was the earliest model of grammar proposed within the research tradition of generative grammar. Like current generative theories, it treated grammar as a system of formal rules that generate all and only grammatical sentences of a given language. What was distinctive about transformational grammar was that it posited transformation rules that mapped a sentence's deep structure to its pronounced form. For example, in many variants of transformational grammar, the English active voice sentence \"Emma saw Daisy\" and its passive counterpart \"Daisy was seen by Emma\" share a common deep structure generated by phrase structure rules, differing only in that the latter's structure is modified by a passivization transformation rule.\nBasic mechanisms.\nTransformational grammar was a species of generative grammar and shared many of its goals and postulations, including the notion of linguistics as a cognitive science, the need for formal explicitness, and the competence-performance distinction. Transformational grammar included two kinds of rules: phrase-structure rules and transformational rules.\nDeep structure and surface structure.\nIn transformational grammar, each sentence in a language has two levels of representation: a deep structure and a surface structure. The deep structure represents a sentence's core semantic relations and is mapped onto the surface structure, which follows the sentence's phonological system very closely, via \"transformations\".\nDeep structures are generated by phrase structure grammars using rewrite rules.\nTransformations.\nTransformations are rules that map a deep structure to a surface structure. For example, a typical transformation in TG is subject-auxiliary inversion (SAI). That rule takes as its input a declarative sentence with an auxiliary, such as \"John has eaten all the heirloom tomatoes\", and transforms it into \"Has John eaten all the heirloom tomatoes?\" In the original formulation (Chomsky 1957), those rules held over strings of terminals, constituent symbols or both.\nX NP AUX Y formula_1 X AUX NP Y\nIn the 1970s, by the time of the Extended Standard Theory, following Joseph Emonds's work on structure preservation, transformations came to be viewed as holding over trees. By the end of government and binding theory, in the late 1980s, transformations were no longer structure-changing operations at all; instead, they added information to already existing trees by copying constituents.\nThe earliest conceptions of transformations were that they were construction-specific devices. For example, there was a transformation that turned active sentences into passive ones. A different transformation raised embedded subjects into main clause subject position in sentences such as \"John seems to have gone\", and a third reordered arguments in the dative alternation. With the shift from rules to principles and constraints in the 1970s, those construction-specific transformations morphed into general rules (all the examples just mentioned are instances of NP movement), which eventually changed into the single general rule move alpha or Move.\nTransformations actually come in two types: the post-deep structure kind mentioned above, which are string- or structure-changing, and generalized transformations (GTs). GTs were originally proposed in the earliest forms of generative grammar (such as in Chomsky 1957). They take small structures, either atomic or generated by other rules, and combine them. For example, the generalized transformation of embedding would take the kernel \"Dave said X\" and the kernel \"Dan likes smoking\" and combine them into \"Dave said Dan likes smoking.\" GTs are thus structure-building rather than structure-changing. In the Extended Standard Theory and government and binding theory, GTs were abandoned in favor of recursive phrase structure rules, but they are still present in tree-adjoining grammar as the Substitution and Adjunction operations, and have recently reemerged in mainstream generative grammar in Minimalism, as the operations Merge and Move.\nIn generative phonology, another form of transformation is the phonological rule, which describes a mapping between an underlying representation (the phoneme) and the surface form that is articulated during natural speech.\nMathematical representation.\nAn important feature of all transformational grammars is that they are more powerful than context-free grammars. Chomsky formalized this idea in the Chomsky hierarchy. He argued that it is impossible to describe the structure of natural languages with context-free grammars. His general position on the context-dependency of natural language has held up, though his specific examples of the inadequacy of CFGs in terms of their weak generative capacity were disproved.\nCore concepts.\nInnate linguistic knowledge.\nUsing a term such as \"transformation\" may give the impression that theories of transformational generative grammar are intended as a model of the processes by which the human mind constructs and understands sentences, but Chomsky clearly stated that a generative grammar models only the knowledge that underlies the human ability to speak and understand, arguing that because most of that knowledge is innate, a baby can have a large body of knowledge about the structure of language in general and so need to \"learn\" only the idiosyncratic features of the language(s) to which it is exposed.\nChomsky is not the first person to suggest that all languages have certain fundamental things in common. He quoted philosophers who posited the same basic idea several centuries ago. But Chomsky helped make the innateness theory respectable after a period dominated by more behaviorist attitudes towards language. He made concrete and technically sophisticated proposals about the structure of language as well as important proposals about how grammatical theories' success should be evaluated.\nGrammaticality.\nChomsky argued that \"grammatical\" and \"ungrammatical\" can be meaningfully and usefully defined. In contrast, an extreme behaviorist linguist would argue that language can be studied only through recordings or transcriptions of actual speech and that the role of the linguist is to look for patterns in such observed speech, not to hypothesize about why such patterns might occur or to label particular utterances grammatical or ungrammatical. Few linguists in the 1950s actually took such an extreme position, but Chomsky was on the opposite extreme, defining grammaticality in an unusually mentalistic way for the time. He argued that the intuition of a native speaker is enough to define the grammaticality of a sentence; that is, if a particular string of English words elicits a double-take or a feeling of wrongness in a native English speaker, with various extraneous factors affecting intuitions controlled for, it can be said that the string of words is ungrammatical. That, according to Chomsky, is entirely distinct from the question of whether a sentence is meaningful or can be understood. It is possible for a sentence to be both grammatical and meaningless, as in Chomsky's famous example, \"colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". But such sentences manifest a linguistic problem that is distinct from that posed by meaningful but ungrammatical (non)-sentences such as \"man the bit sandwich the\", the meaning of which is fairly clear, but which no native speaker would accept as well-formed.\nTheory evaluation.\nIn the 1960s, Chomsky introduced two central ideas relevant to the construction and evaluation of grammatical theories.\nCompetence versus performance.\nOne was the distinction between \"competence\" and \"performance\". Chomsky noted that when people speak in the real world, they often make linguistic errors, such as starting a sentence and then abandoning it midway through. He argued that such errors in linguistic \"performance\" are irrelevant to the study of linguistic \"competence\", the knowledge that allows people to construct and understand grammatical sentences. Consequently, the linguist can study an idealised version of language, which greatly simplifies linguistic analysis.\nDescriptive versus explanatory adequacy.\nThe other idea related directly to evaluation of theories of grammar. Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve \"descriptive adequacy\" and those that go further and achieve \"explanatory adequacy\". A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives insight into the mind's underlying linguistic structures. In other words, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. For Chomsky, such mental representations are largely innate and so if a grammatical theory has explanatory adequacy, it must be able to explain different languages' grammatical nuances as relatively minor variations in the universal pattern of human language.\nChomsky argued that even though linguists were still a long way from constructing descriptively adequate grammars, progress in descriptive adequacy would come only if linguists held explanatory adequacy as their goal: real insight into individual languages' structure can be gained only by comparative study of a wide range of languages, on the assumption that they are all cut from the same cloth.\nHistorical context.\nChomsky developed transformational grammar in the late 1950s, drawing on older work including that of the structuralists. Its central ideas are maintained to varying degrees in present-day approaches to syntax such as Minimalism, while others such as Combinatory categorial grammar are distinctly non-transformational.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although the backscratcher was an early human invention, primates have been observed using similar tools. \nComposition and variation.\nBackscratchers are generally long, slender, rod-shaped tools used to scratch one's back, with a knob on one end for holding and a rake-like device, sometimes in the form of a human hand, on the other end to perform the scratching. Many others are shaped like horse hooves or claws, or are telescoping to reach further down the back. Most modern backscratchers are typically made of plastic, bamboo, or metal. Examples throughout history can be found made of wood, whalebone, tortoiseshell, horn, cane, ivory, baleen, and in some cases, narwhal tusks, due to the status afforded by relieving itches with a supposed unicorn horn (an example of conspicuous consumption).\nBackscratchers vary in length between . They are a common household tool.\nThere are also retractable backscratchers.\nHistory.\nBackscratchers are an example of simultaneous invention (or multiple discovery), where separate cultures have invented the same device independent of each other. The Inuit carved backscratchers from whale teeth. In ancient China, Chinese farmers occasionally used backscratchers as a tool to check livestock for fleas and ticks. In recent history backscratchers were employed as a type of rake to keep the huge \"heads\" of powdered hair, worn by the upper-class in the 18th and 19th centuries, in order.\nIn the past, backscratchers were often highly decorated, and hung from the waist as accessories, with the more elaborate examples being silver-mounted, or in rare instances, capped by an ivory carved hand with rings on its fingers. The scratching hand was sometimes replaced by a rake or a bird's talon. Generally, the hand could represent either a left or right hand, but the Chinese variety usually bore a right hand. In the example above, from Bidar, India in the 16th century, an ornate backscratcher has been made using a technique called bidri. Artisans used a zinc-copper alloy and inlaid it with silver. This example depicts a makara (a sea-monster in Hindu myth) on its hilt.\nAlthough not specifically used for only back scratching, young Chiricahua men in training and women going through a puberty ritual traditionally had to use a ceremonial wooden scratcher made from a fruit-bearing tree instead of scratching with their fingernails or hands. Young men who did not use the scratcher for scratching were reported to develop skin that was too soft.\nPrimate use.\nBackscratchers have also been observed in use by primates. In 2010, scientists studying chimpanzee behavior in Uganda discovered members of the Sonso chimpanzee community had learned to use rudimentary backscratchers. \nChimpanzees in the Sonso community were routinely encountering traps made for bush pigs, leaving one third with permanent disabilities. First observed in a chimpanzee named Tinka, who had lost the use of his hands as a result of these snares, the community adapted to their disabilities. Using a woody vine (a liana) pulled tight by one foot, these chimpanzees were seen scratching hard to reach places on their backs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It rises at an unnamed lake in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories and flows more than mostly through the Kivalliq Region, Nunavut, to its mouth at the Arctic Ocean in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut.\nCourse.\nThe river begins at the outflow of an unnamed lake at an elevation of and flows west into Sussex Lake, then north to Muskox Lake, at the border between the Northwest Territories and the Kivalliq Region, Nunavut, where it takes in the left tributary Icy River. It flows over the Muskox Rapids, takes in the left tributary Contwoyto River, and heads east through the Heywood Range. The Back River heads over the Malley Rapids, takes in the left tributary Siorak River and enters the long lake-expansion Lake Beechey in a southeast direction. It heads east, takes in the right tributary Baillie River, left tributary Warren River, right tributary Jervoise River, passes over the Hawk Rapids, takes in the right tributary McKinley River and right tributary Consul River. Between the Baillie and Consul Rivers, the Back River forms the northern border of the Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary. The river turns northeast, takes in the left tributary Bullen River, and reaches Pelly Lake at an elevation of . It flows east through, in immediate succession: Upper Garry Lake, where it takes in the right tributary Morse River; Garry Lake; Lower Garry Lake; Buliard Lake; Upper MacDougall Lake; and Lower MacDougall Lake. The Back River then heads over the Rock Rapids, Sinclair Falls, Escape Rapids, Sandhill Rapids, and Wolf Rapids, and takes in the right tributary Meadowbank River. The river curves around Mount Meadowbank, takes in the right tributary Hermann River and left tributary Montresor River, passes McKay Peak, heads over the Whirlpool Rapids, and reaches Franklin Lake. It continues northeast, takes in the right tributary Mistake River, passes north into Kitikmeot Region, takes in the right tributary Hayes River and reaches its mouth at Cockburn Bay on Chantrey Inlet on the Arctic Ocean.\nWatershed.\nThe river has a watershed of and a mean discharge of per second. The river is long to the Muskox Lake outlet, though the river continues further upstream to its source.\nLike the Coppermine, Hood, Dubawnt or Kazan, which are other large rivers in this part of Canada, it is navigable only by experienced canoeists because of the numerous and challenging 83 rapids.\nThe entire river is above the tree line.\nHistory.\nThe Back River is the historic homeland of the \"Haningayogmiut\" (or \"Hanningajurmiut\") Copper Inuit, also referred to as the \"Ualininmiut\" by their Caribou Inuit northern neighbours, the \"Utkusiksalinmiut\". The \"Kaernermiut\" (also \"Kainermiut\") and the southerly \"Ahiagmiut\" of the Copper Inuit also frequented this area. The Back River and Thelon River were also the northern and northeastern edges of the tribal territories of the enemy Yellowknives and Chipewyan to the south.\nIts first exploration by Europeans was led by George Back in 1834, as part of an expedition initially mounted to seek the 1829 expedition of Captain John Ross. Back learned of the river from local guides, and throughout his memoir of the expedition he referred to the river as the \"Thlew-ee-cho-dezeth\", which he translated as \"Great Fish River\". Later 19th-century explorers habitually referred to the river as \"Back's Great Fish River\", but gradually this was shortened to \"Back River\" over time.\nOn abandoning their ships to the ice, the remaining members of Sir John Franklin's 1845 expedition to map a Northwest Passage set out for the Back River but did not survive. In search of them, James Anderson and James Stewart of the Hudson's Bay Company descended the river in 1855 to Chantrey Bay and Montreal Island.\nAfter a hiatus of slightly over 100 years, it was again descended in 1962 by two groups. A British group of four young men was led by Robert Cundy, who wrote a book about their descent called \"Beacon Six\". They started at Beechey Lake paddling three foldup kayaks, one of which was destroyed on the expedition. An American group of four led by Austin Hoyt started at the source of the river, Sussex Lake, with two cedar canvas canoes. Both groups filmed their trips. The British film, \"Beacon Six\", was televised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\nOver the course of 17 months in 1963\u20131965, anthropologist Jean Briggs did field research with the Utkusiksalinmiut Inuit living at the opening of Back River and Chantrey Inlet, resulting in her work \"Never in Anger\", as well as helping to compile an Utkuhiksalik dictionary.\nNatural history.\nThe area around the river is full of wildlife, with many fish in the river, as well as caribou, muskoxen, and wolves in the area, with occasional sightings of brown bears, wolverines and Arctic hares. Polar bears are also found as the river nears the Arctic Ocean. The Middle Back River Important Bird Area, located on the river in the Pelly Lake to Lower Garry Lake segment, is a significant habitat for Canada geese, the lesser snow goose and other waterfowl.\nLike other areas in Northern Canada, Back River is subject to very cold weather and a persistent Arctic wind that gusts up to gale force.\nModern canoeing.\nThe Back River constitutes a long and difficult voyage, taking over a month of hard work by strong and experienced Arctic (duo) canoeists. The Back is much more challenging than either the Kazan River or the Dubawnt River. Many rapids end in dense \"rock gardens\" rendering portaging often mandatory. Such portages must be conducted on bare rocks and occasionally unstable boulders. The need for portage is generally lower after a set of rapids known as the \"Escape Rapids\", thereafter very many rapids (but not all) can be run, as the river becomes less rocky and risky. Water level permitting, two further areas of runnable rapids are notable: Sandhill rapids generally navigated on the left bank, Wolf rapids on the right.\nBear spray is recommended as a protection against polar bears on stretches of the river near the Arctic Ocean. Cooking fuel must also be brought in, as the river is above the tree line, and all vegetation is low-lying and not suitable for use as fuel.\nThe source of the river can be reached by floatplane from Yellowknife, N.W.T. At the end of the trip, a bush plane can be called in from Baker Lake in Nunavut for a landing in a prearranged spot in the tundra. One must make sure that a rigid canoe can be attached to the exterior of the bush plane. If not, a foldable canoe should be used instead of a rigid one.\nThe river can also be travelled to its end, where a boat tow can be arranged to the Inuit community of Gjoa Haven, which has commercial air service back to Yellowknife. If planning a canoeing trip on the river, due to the weather, it is generally recommended to have navigated Garry Lake by August 8, the mark of the seasonal change to worse weather. It needs to be noted that being windbound can happen at any time. Due to the proximity to the Arctic Circle and the associated cold, any capsizing can easily conclude in hypothermia and death. A spray deck-equipped canoe is strongly recommended both for lakes and rapids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Contango refers to \"negative basis\" where the future price is trading above the expected spot price.\nNote: In industry parlance backwardation may refer to the situation that futures prices are below the \"current\" spot price.\nBackwardation occurs when the difference between the forward price and the spot price is less than the cost of carry (when the forward price is less than the spot plus carry), or when there can be no delivery arbitrage because the asset is not currently available for purchase.\nIn a state of backwardation, futures contract prices include compensation for the risk transferred from the underlying asset holder to the purchaser of the futures contract. This means the expected spot price on expiry is higher than the price of the futures contract. Backwardation seldom arises in money commodities like gold or silver. In the early 1980s, there was a one-day backwardation in silver while some metal was physically moved from COMEX to CBOT warehouses. Gold has historically been positive with exception for momentary backwardations (hours) since gold futures started trading on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1972.\nThe term is sometimes applied to forward prices other than those of futures contracts, when analogous price patterns arise. For example, if it costs more to lease silver for 30 days than for 60 days, it might be said that the silver lease rates are \"in backwardation\". Negative lease rates for silver may indicate bullion banks require a risk premium for selling silver futures into the market.\nOccurrence.\nThis is the case of a convenience yield that is greater than the risk free rate and the carrying costs.\nIt is argued that backwardation is abnormal, and suggests supply insufficiencies in the corresponding (physical) spot market. However, multiple commodities markets are frequently in backwardation, especially when the seasonal aspect is taken into consideration, e.g., perishable and/or soft commodities.\nIn \"Treatise on Money\" (1930, chapter 29), economist John Maynard Keynes argued that in commodity markets, backwardation is not an abnormal market situation, but rather arises naturally as \"normal backwardation\" from the fact that producers of commodities are more prone to hedge their price risk than consumers. The academic dispute on the subject continues to this day.\nExamples.\nNotable examples of backwardation include:\nOrigin of term: London Stock Exchange.\nLike contango, the term originated in mid-19th century England, originating from \"backward\".\nIn that era on the London Stock Exchange, backwardation was a fee paid by a seller wishing to defer delivering stock they had sold. This fee was paid either to the buyer, or to a third party who lent stock to the seller.\nThe purpose was normally speculative, allowing short selling. Settlement days were on a fixed schedule (such as fortnightly) and a short seller did not have to deliver stock until the following settlement day, and on that day could \"carry over\" their position to the next by paying a backwardation fee. This practice was common before 1930, but came to be used less and less, particularly since options were reintroduced in 1958.\nThe fee here did not indicate a near-term shortage of stock the way backwardation means today, it was more like a \"lease rate\", the cost of borrowing a stock or commodity for a period of time.\nNormal backwardation vs. backwardation.\nThe term \"backwardation\", when used without the qualifier \"normal\", can be somewhat ambiguous. Although sometimes used as a synonym for normal backwardation (where a futures contract price is lower than the expected spot price at contract maturity), it may also refer to the situation where a futures contract price is merely lower than the \"current\" spot price.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bacon has been reckoned the founder of the British School of sculpture. He won numerous awards, held the esteem of George\u00a0III, and examples of his works adorn St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London, Christ Church, Oxford, Pembroke College, Oxford, Bath Abbey and Bristol Cathedral.\nBiography.\nJohn Bacon was born in Southwark on 24 November 1740, the son of Thomas Bacon, a clothworker whose family had formerly held a considerable estate in Somersetshire. At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to Mr\u00a0Crispe's porcelain manufactory at Lambeth, where he was at first employed in painting small ornamental pieces of china. He was swiftly promoted to modeller and used the additional income to support his parents, then in straitened circumstances. Observing the models sent by different eminent sculptors to be fired at the adjoining pottery kiln determined the direction of his genius: he began imitating them with such proficiency that a small figure of Peace sent by him to the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts won a prize. Subsequently, its highest awards were given to him nine times between 1763 and 1776. During his apprenticeship, he also improved the method of working statues in stoneware, an art which he afterwards carried to perfection.\nBacon first attempted working in marble around 1763, when he resided in George Yard on Oxford Road near Soho Square. He exhibited a medallion of George\u00a0III and a group of Bacchanalians that year and a bas relief of the Good Samaritan the next. During this period, he was led to improve the method of transferring the form of the model to the marble (\"getting out the points\") by the invention of a more perfect instrument for the purpose. This instrument possessed many advantages: it was more exact, took a correct measurement in every direction, was contained in a small compass, and could be used on either the model or the marble.\nBy 1769, Bacon was working for Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory. The same year he was awarded the first gold medal for sculpture awarded by the Royal Academy for a bas-relief representing the escape of Aeneas and Anchises from Troy. In 1770, he exhibited a figure of Mars, redone in marble the next year for Charles Pelhalm, which gained him the gold medal from the Society of Arts and his election as an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA). In 1771, Eleanor Coade appointed him works supervisor at her manufactory: he directed both model-making and design there until his death. In 1774, he was gifted with a new establishment at 17\u00a0Newman St. by a Mr\u00a0Johnson who was a great admirer of his work. He executed a bust of George III for Christ Church, Oxford, and retained that king's favour throughout his life. Jealous competitors criticised him for ignorance of classic Greek sculpture, a charge he refuted with a bust of Jupiter Tonans. In 1795, he completed a statue of John Howard for St Paul's Cathedral. That statue was the first to be erected on the floor of the cathedral, ending a century-long prohibition on monuments in the body of that church. Bacon was considered the most successful public sculptor in England at the time and the church authorities awarded him the commissions for the next two statues erected in the cathedral, that of Samuel Johnson in 1795 and of the judge Sir William Jones in 1799.\nOn 4 August 1799 Bacon suddenly developed an \"inflammation\" and died a little more than two days later on the 7th. He was buried in Whitefield's Tabernacle in London. His estate was valued at \u00a360,000, which was divided equally among his children. His widow was his second wife; he left a family composed of six sons and three daughters. His sons Thomas Bacon and John Bacon Jr. continued his work, and one of his daughters married a Mr Thornton. His memoirs were edited by Rev. Cecil and published in 1801.\nLegacy.\nBacon has been reckoned the founder of the British School of sculpture, although he himself considered Roubiliac's statue of Eloquence for Waterloo Bridge to be such a fine piece of sculpture that he was sure he could never equal it. He won numerous awards, held the esteem of George\u00a0III, and continued to be praised in the 19th and 20th centuries. His works adorn St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London, Christ Church, Oxford, Pembroke College, Oxford, Bath Abbey and Bristol Cathedral.\nSelected public works.\n1770\u20131779.\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n!

He held the pulpit of the First Church New Haven and was later professor of church history and polity at Yale College.\nBiography.\nLeonard Bacon was born in Detroit, Michigan. He was the son of David Bacon (1771\u20131817), a missionary among the Indians in Michigan and founder of the town of Tallmadge, Ohio. There his sister Delia Bacon, later a major Shakespeare scholar, was born in 1811.\nLeonard Bacon prepared for college at grammar school in Hartford, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale College in 1820, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity, and from the Andover Theological Seminary in 1823. From 1825 until his death he was pastor of the First Church (Congregational) in New Haven, Connecticut, occupying a pulpit which was one of the most conspicuous in New England, and which had been rendered famous by his predecessors, Moses Stuart and Nathaniel W. Taylor. In 1866, however, though never dismissed by a council from his connection with that church, he gave up the active pastorate; still, in 1868 he was president of the American Congregational Union.\nFrom 1826 to 1838, he was an editor of the \"Christian Spectator\" (New Haven). In 1843 he was one of the founders of the \"New Englander\" (later the \"Yale Review\"), and in 1848, with Richard Salter Storrs, Joshua Leavitt, Joseph Parrish Thompson, and Henry C. Bowen, he founded \" The Independent\", a magazine designed primarily to combat slavery extension; he was an editor of the \"Independent\" until 1863. From 1866 until his death he taught at Yale: first, until 1871, as acting professor of didactic theology in the Theological Department; and from 1871 as lecturer on church polity and American church history. He traveled to the Middle East (then \"Greater Syria\") in the middle 1800s to visit holy sites, and gave lectures on his experiences, at least one of which was published in the New York Times.\nAs a part of the 1872 Iwakura Mission Bacon was given guardianship of Yamakawa Sutematsu, a Japanese girl sent to the United States to be educated. She became particularly close with the youngest daughter in the household, Alice Mabel Bacon, and would become the first Japanese woman to receive a college degree.\nBacon was buried at Grove Street Cemetery, as was his sister Delia Bacon. Four of his six sons became Congregational pastors: Edward Woolsey Bacon (in New London, Connecticut), Leonard Woolsey Bacon, George B. Bacon (in Orange, New Jersey), and Thomas Rutherford Bacon (in New Haven, Connecticut).\nConvictions and influence.\nIn his own theological views, Bacon was broad-minded and an advocate of liberal orthodoxy. In all matters concerning the welfare of his community or the nation, moreover, he took a deep and constant interest, and was particularly identified with the temperance and anti-slavery movements, his services to the latter constituting perhaps the most important work of his life. In this, as in most other controversies, he took a moderate course, condemning the apologists and defenders of slavery on the one hand and the Garrisonian extremists on the other. His \"Slavery Discussed in Occasional Essays from 1833 to 1846\" (1846) exercised considerable influence upon Abraham Lincoln, and in this book appears the sentence, which, as rephrased by Lincoln, was widely quoted: \"If that form of government, that system of social order is not wrong \u2014 if those laws of the Southern States, by virtue of which slavery exists there, and is what it is, are not wrong \u2014 nothing is wrong.\"\nHe was early attracted to the study of the ecclesiastical history of New England and was frequently called upon to deliver commemorative addresses, some of which were published in book and pamphlet form. Of these, his \"Thirteen Historical Discourses\" (1839), dealing with the history of New Haven, and his \"Four Commemorative Discourses\" (1866) may be especially mentioned. The most important of his historical works, however, is his \"Genesis of the New England Churches\" (1874). He published \"A Manual for Young Church Members\" (1833); edited, with a biography, the \"Select Practical Writings of Richard Baxter\" (1831); and was the author of a number of hymns, the best-known of which is the one beginning, \"O God, beneath Thy guiding hand Our exiled fathers crossed the sea.\"\nGradually, after taking up his pastorate, he gained greater and greater influence in his denomination, until he came to be regarded as perhaps the most prominent Congregationalist of his time, and was sometimes popularly referred to as \"The Congregational Pope of New England.\" In all the heated theological controversies of the day, particularly the long and bitter one concerning the views put forward by Dr Horace Bushnell, he was conspicuous, using his influence to bring about harmony, and in the councils of the Congregational churches, over two of which, the Brooklyn councils of 1874 and 1876. he presided as moderator, he manifested great ability both as a debater and as a parliamentarian.\nHis congregation published a commemorative volume in his honor, \"Leonard Bacon, Pastor of the First Church in New Haven\" (New Haven, 1882), and his biography is also found in Williston Walker's \"Ten New England Leaders\" (New York, 1901).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58475", "revid": "1301479581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58475", "title": "Bacteriology", "text": "Subdiscipline of microbiology that studies bacteria\nBacteriology is the branch and specialty of biology that studies the morphology, ecology, genetics and biochemistry of bacteria as well as many other aspects related to them. This subdivision of microbiology involves the identification, classification, and characterization of bacterial species. Because of the similarity of thinking and working with microorganisms other than bacteria, such as protozoa, fungi, and non-microorganism viruses, there has been a tendency for the field of bacteriology to extend as microbiology. The terms were formerly often used interchangeably. However, bacteriology can be classified as a distinct science.\nOverview.\nDefinition.\nBacteriology is the study of bacteria. Bacteriology evolved from physicians needing to apply the germ theory to address the concerns relating to disease spreading in hospitals the 19th century. Identification and characterizing of bacteria being associated to diseases led to advances in pathogenic bacteriology. Koch's postulates played a role into identifying the relationships between bacteria and specific diseases. Since then, bacteriology has played a role in successful advances in science such as bacterial vaccines like diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. Bacteriology can be studied and applied in many sub-fields relating to agriculture, marine biology, water pollution, bacterial genetics, veterinary medicine, biotechnology and others.\nBacteriologists.\nA bacteriologist is a microbiologist or other trained professional in bacteriology. Bacteriologists are interested in studying and learning about bacteria, as well as using their skills in clinical settings. This includes investigating properties of bacteria such as morphology, ecology, genetics and biochemistry, phylogenetics, genomics and many other areas related to bacteria like disease diagnostic testing. They can also work as medical scientists, veterinary scientists, or diagnostic technicians in locations like clinics, blood banks, hospitals, laboratories and animal hospitals. Bacteriologists working in public health or biomedical research help develop vaccines for public use.\nCulturing bacteria.\nThe growth of bacteria in laboratory cultures is the mainstay method used by bacteriologists. Both solid and liquid culture media are used. Solid culture medium is usually nutrient agar in a petri dish. The constituents of the nutrient agar vary according to the bacteria under investigation. For growing the bacterium \"Haemophilus influenzae\", for example, which is dependent on hemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide for its growth, blood (usually from a sheep or a horse) is added to the medium. When growing bacteria that are found in the intestines of mammals, such as salmonella, XLD agar which contains, among other ingredients deoxycholic acid is used.\nHistory.\nBacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design. Leeuwenhoek did not recognize bacteria as a distinct category of microorganisms, and referred to all microorganisms, including bacteria, protists, and microscopic animals, as animalcules. He published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London. His observations also included protozoans. The German Ferdinand Cohn began studying bacteria in 1870 and is also said to be a founder of bacteriology, as he was the first to classify bacteria into groups based on their cell shapes. He defined bacteria as \"chlorophyll-free cells of spherical, oblong, or cylindrical form, sometimes twisted or bent, which multiply exclusively by transverse division and occur either isolated or in cell families,\" and placed them in the plant kingdom. He also discovered heat-resistant bacterial endospores\nLouis Pasteur demonstrated in 1859 that microorganisms cause the fermentation process, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation (yeasts and molds, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi). Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease. Between 1880 and 1881 Pasteur produced two successful vaccinations for animals against diseases caused by bacteria. The importance of bacteria was recognized as it led to a study of disease prevention and treatment of diseases by vaccines. Pasteur's research led to Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister researching the importance of sanitized hands in medical work.\nIn the 1840s, Semmelweis' observations and ideas surrounding sanitary techniques were rejected and his book on the topic condemned by the medical community due to its conflict with the prevailing theory and practice of humorism at the time. After Lister's publications, which supported hand washing and sanitation with germ theory, doctors started sanitizing their hands in the 1870s; mandatory handwashing was not incorporated into common health practice until as late as the 1980s.\nThe discovery of the connection of microorganisms to disease came later in the nineteenth century, when Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini isolated the cholera bacterium \"Vibrio cholerae\" in 1854 in Florence during the Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846\u201363 and clearly linked the presence of the bacterium in the intestinal mucosa of dead cholera patients to the disease.\nAlthough Pacini's work was available to the international scientific community via French and English translations, the discovery of the cholera-causing agent is often attributed to the German physician Robert Koch who rediscovered it in 1884. Koch is credited for introducing the science of microorganisms including bacteria to the medical field. Koch, a pioneer in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a disease, and these postulates are still used today. Both Koch and Pasteur played a role in improving antisepsis in medical treatment. In 1870\u20131885 the modern methods of bacteriology technique were introduced by the use of stains, and by the method of separating mixtures of organisms on plates of nutrient media.\nThough it had been known since the nineteenth century that bacteria are a cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available until the 20th century. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained \"Treponema pallidum\"\u2014the spirochaete that causes syphilis\u2014into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich was awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain.\nIn the early 20th century, there was debate about the classification of bacteria. In 1904, cyanobacteria were usually classified as a class of algae, which are eukaryotic. However, Haeckel at this time classed cyanobacteria with bacteria because they lacked nuclei. In 1938, Herbert Faulkner Copeland proposed that prokaryotes be granted their own kingdom. The development of the transmission electron microscope allowed better visualization of cell structure and helped to clarify issues. In 1962, Stanier and van Niel published an influential definition of bacteria, proposing that bacteria be defined as prokaryotic cellular entities; they also specified three differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes: presence or absence of internal membranes, division by fission or mitosis, and presence or absence of a cell wall.\nA major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy came from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains as part of the three-domain system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
